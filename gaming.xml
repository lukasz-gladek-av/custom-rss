            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/6/3958162/valve-steam-box-cake">once imagined</a> that every PC maker could have their own "Steam Machine," a PC game console running the company's Linux-based SteamOS. It took a decade for that dream to evolve into the company's own internally developed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck</a> gaming handheld, but the original dream isn't dead. </p><p>The company's <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499215/valve-steam-deck-interview-late-2022#">long said</a> it plans to let other companies use SteamOS, too — and that means explicitly supporting the rival Asus ROG Ally gaming handheld, Valve designer Lawrence Yang now confirms to <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>A few days ago, some spotted an intriguing line <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/4361258795952118018">in Valve's latest SteamOS release notes</a>: “Added support for extra ROG Ally keys.” We didn't know Valve was supporting any ROG Ally keys at all, let alone extras! </p><p>Maybe Valve was just supporting those keys in the Steam desktop client on a Windows, where it offers a Steam Deck-like Big Picture Mode interface for any PC, and the line mistakenly made it into these patch notes? I asked to be safe.</p><p>But no: this is indeed about Valve eventually supporting the ROG Ally and other rival handhelds! </p><p>"The note about ROG Ally keys is related to third-party device support for SteamOS. The team is continuing to work on adding support for additional handhelds on SteamOS," Yang tells me. </p><p>That doesn't mean Asus will officially bless Valve's installer or sell the Ally with SteamOS, of course. (Asus has told me there are many reasons why it ships with Windows; a big one is that Microsoft has dedicated validation teams that ensure its operating system works across many different hardware configurations and chips.) </p><p>And it's not like Valve is suggesting it'll offer SteamOS for rival handhelds anytime soon, either. Valve is “making steady progress,” Yang tells me, but it “isn’t ready to run out of the box yet.”</p><p>We already knew Valve plans a general release of SteamOS 3 that you can theoretically install on non-handheld PCs as well; Yang says it's similarly making progress there but it's not ready quite yet. </p><p>So that's the update on turning Windows handhelds into Steam Machines; what about Valve's promise to let you turn Steam Decks into dual-booting Windows machines too, letting you swap between the two OS at will? Here's Yang on that:</p><div><blockquote><p>As for Windows, we’re preparing to make the remaining Windows drivers for Steam Deck OLED available (you might have seen that we are prepping firmware for the Bluetooth driver). There’s no update on the timing for dual boot support—it’s still a priority, but we haven’t been able to get to it just yet. </p></blockquote></div><p>Valve isn't the only one adapting its compelling combination of Linux and controller-friendly Steam UI to Windows handhelds. Universal Blue touted that its Bazzite operating system had <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/bazzite-linux-36-out-now-bringing-full-asus-rog-ally-x-support/">already achieved support for the Asus ROG Ally X</a> before it even came out. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

One player controls the Space Marine Lieutenant Titus of the Ultramarines Chapter, and the other commands an army of Tyranids in asymmetric matches that last around 30 minutes. The box includes a grid-based playmat, rulebook, dice, ruler, one Lieutenant Titus miniature, and 22 Tyranids. Each miniature comes unassembled and unpainted just like in standard Warhammer 40,000 tabletop sets, giving new players a taste of what it's like to build and customize their own army. The minis are also compatible with the standard Warhammer 40K tabletop game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349720-spacemarinehero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4349720" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349720-spacemarinehero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4349720"></a><figcaption>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine: The Board Game</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349720-spacemarinehero.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349721-sm1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349722-sm2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349723-sm3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349724-sm2b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4349721,1300-4349722,1300-4349723,1300-4349724" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4349721-sm1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4349722-sm2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4349723-sm3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4349724-sm2b.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349721-sm1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349722-sm2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349723-sm3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349724-sm2b.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While this deal is an excellent chance to grab Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine and dip into the world of Warhammer tabletop, several other board games are also eligible for the 20% Target Circle discount, including <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fstar-wars-villainous-board-game%2F-%2FA-85017096&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwarhammer-space-marine-board-game-is-only-32-ahead-of-space-marine-2s-launch%2F1100-6525773%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Star Wars Villainous</a>, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fravensburger-disney-villainous-introduction-to-evil-board-game-disney-100-edition%2F-%2FA-87884715&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwarhammer-space-marine-board-game-is-only-32-ahead-of-space-marine-2s-launch%2F1100-6525773%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Disney Villainous</a>, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Favalon-hill-betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill-3rd-edition-game%2F-%2FA-85008832&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwarhammer-space-marine-board-game-is-only-32-ahead-of-space-marine-2s-launch%2F1100-6525773%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Betrayal At House On The Hill</a>, and more.

                <p>When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> came out over a decade ago, exploring underground was already spooky, but it was pretty monotonous; lava and the rare diamond block were the most exciting things to see. Nowadays, though, heading underground is a much more exciting experience. Caves are far more varied and interesting, and there are even deep-buried Ancient Cities to loot--if you can avoid the Warden.</p><p dir="ltr">There are dozens of biome types and subtypes aboveground, but below ground you'll find fewer biomes and more danger.</p><p><strong>Note: This guide focuses on the Bedrock version of Minecraft, available on Windows 10, Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and mobile.</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr">Dripstone Caves</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4349781-minecraft-1-18-dripstone-caves.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4349781" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4349781-minecraft-1-18-dripstone-caves.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4349781"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4349781-minecraft-1-18-dripstone-caves.jpg"></figure><p>Dripstone caves are, as the name suggests, full of dripstone stalactites hanging from the ceiling and stalagmites crawling up from the floor. Dripstone is useful for a variety of applications, like a self-replicating lava farm, and can be used as spikes to damage players and mobs. Copper spawns in comparatively large amounts in dripstone caves.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Lush Caves</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4349780-minecraft-1-18-lush-caves.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4349780" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4349780-minecraft-1-18-lush-caves.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4349780"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4349780-minecraft-1-18-lush-caves.jpg"></figure><p>Lush caves are a stunning addition to Minecraft's subterranean world. For a long time, Minecraft caves all kind of looked the same--stone for ages, with little patches of desirable blocks like iron ore and diamonds scattered about. Lush caves, however, are packed with plant life. They're covered by moss blocks, moss carpet, azalea bushes, grass, and flowers on the ground. From above, you can find glowberries--both a fruit <em>and</em> a source of light--along with vines and spore blossoms. Shallow ponds generate with dripleaf plants and, sometimes, axlotls.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Deep Dark</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4349782-minecraft-1-19-ancient-city-full.png" data-ref-id="1300-4349782" data-ratio="0.52552083333333" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4349782-minecraft-1-19-ancient-city-full.png" data-ref-id="1300-4349782"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4349782-minecraft-1-19-ancient-city-full.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Deep Dark caves are where things get scary. These dark caves generate mostly in the layers where stone turns to deepslate. You'll find sculk sensors and shriekers, which can summon wardens. The Deep Dark is also where Ancient Cities spawn, and are a source of enchanted golden apples and a rare music disc, among other treasures. No mobs aside from wardens spawn here, but wardens can kill you nearly instantly even when you're fully armored in Netherite, so take care when exploring this biome.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead Game Studios</a> has acknowledged <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-review">Helldivers 2</a>'s recent Escalation of Freedom update "didn't hit [its] target" following significant criticism from the community, and it's detailed the steps its taking to address core areas of complaint over the next 60 days.
</p>
<p>
Helldivers 2's latest round of community unrest followed the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-biggest-update-yet-announced-with-higher-difficulty-new-bugs-and-more">last week's major Escalation of Freedom update</a>, which featured headline additions including new mission objectives and enemies. However, it's some under-the-hood balance tinkering that's proven particularly controversial, with nerfs to the popular FLAM-40 flamethrower - which has significantly reduced its effectiveness against Chargers - drawing considerable ire.
</p>
<p>
Various senior team members have already acknowledged player feedback - Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani drew parallels with a similarly unpopular balance update released in April (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arrowhead-ceo-says-we-need-to-do-better-after-incendiary-response-to-flamethrower-nerfs-in-helldivers-2-me-just-talking-about-it-isn-t-enough-actions-matter/">PC Gamer</a>), confirming the studio was already discussing "what we can do to avoid this situation again" - but now the developer is ready to offer a more formalised plan of attack.

<p>
In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1erc9w5/the_message_to_the_community_from_our_game/">post shared on Reddit</a>, Helldivers 2 game director Mikael Eriksson wrote, "We've spent the last week listening to feedback, reflecting about the path ahead for Helldivers 2 and how we want to continue developing the game. In short, we didn’t hit our target with the latest update." Eriksson added the studio sees two sorts of issues it wants to address: "some things we just didn't get right" and "other more fundamental inconsistencies in our approach to game balance and game direction."
</p>
<p>
"All of that is on us and we are going to own that," he continued. "As many of you have pointed out, and we agree, what matters most now is action. Not talk."
</p>
<p>
To that end, Eriksson shared the studio's plan for the next 60 days, which will begin with an examination of its approach to balance. "Our intention is that balance should be fun," he explained, "not 'balanced' for the sake of balance." Arrowhead will also update the flamethrower's "fire damage mechanic" to tweak how it works as a close-range support weapon, but Eriksson stressed, "A quick straight revert won't work, as it would break other things".
</p>
<p>
Then, moving onto other complaints stemming from last week's Escalation of Freedom update, Arrowhead will rework gameplay to prevent excessive rag dolling, rethink its approach to primary weapons and "create a plan for making combat more engaging", reprioritise bug fixes so those impacting gameplay are addressed first, improve game performance, and rework Chargers.
</p>
<p>
The studio is also looking to establish an opt-in beta test environment as a "high priority" to improve its testing processes, and it'll be posting regular player surveys to gather more insight and feedback. Additionally, it wants to improve communication with players - providing more context for changes in its patch notes, and sharing more blog posts and streams to expand on those topics. "We also want to thank you for your patience," Eriksson added. "We're grateful that so many of you provided constructive feedback and suggestions on the latest update.
</p>
<p>
Arrowhead's decision to rethink its approach to balancing follows comments made by Helldivers 2 creative director Johan Pilestedt back in May. "I think we've gone too far in some areas," he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-balancing-has-sometimes-gone-too-far-ceo-admits">told players</a>. "It feels like every time someone finds something fun, the fun is removed." Hopefully, the studio's new commitment to balancing will help it avoid falling into a similarly unpopular trap a third time around.

That’s why, at the time, I was like, ‘Fuck, if I could do anything, I would love to do <em>Alien </em>and scare the audience again with that creature and those environments.’ I was playing, and realizing how terrifying <em>Alien </em>could be if you take it back to that tone.”</p><h2 id="h53631"><a id=""></a>Save Stations from <em>Alien: Isolation</em> appear regularly in <em>Romulus</em></h2><p>However, <em>Isolation </em>didn’t just inspire Alvarez to make a new, scary <em>Alien </em>movie. The survival horror game is also directly referenced in the film in a neat detail involving <em>Isolation’s </em>save stations, which appear as emergency phones dotted around the game. Players have to stop what they are doing, walk up to one, and activate it to save their game. As such, these are important devices that tend to appear in areas where you might get attacked or killed. And Alvarez did something similar in the movie. </p><p> “The movie is set up in a way [that] every time something bad is about to happen, you will see [an emergency] phone,” the <em>Romulus </em>director and co-writer explained. </p><p>“In the game, every time you knew there’s a phone you’d go, ‘Fuck, I’m about to go into some bad set-piece.’ It’s the same thing here. You’ll see they’re planted strategically throughout the film. When you see the phone, it’s like: Brace for impact.” </p><p><em>Alien: Romulus</em> arrives in theaters on August 16. I’ll be watching out for emergency phones and preparing to scream. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/maschinen-mensch-reveals-multiplayer-platformer-mother-machine/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Maschinen-Mensch, an indie developer studio behind Curious Expedition and Curious Expedition 2, has unveiled its latest project. The game is titled<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1555980/Mother_Machine/"> Mother Machine</a> and is shaping up to be a chaotic, multiplayer action-platformer roguelike with RPG elements sprinkled in.</p>
<p>The game features vibrant backgrounds and creatures, with chaotic goblins that you get to play as and a wild, defective robot mother of the gremlins, and it all comes together in procedurally generated co-op action.</p>
<p>Mother Machine has been built in <a href="https://wccftech.com/halloween-getting-unreal-engine-5-game-john-carpenter-involved/">Unreal Engine 5</a>&nbsp;and aims to push the limits of procedurally generated content in gaming. This game is a one-to-four-player co-op action-platformer that features many RPG elements in the cave networks of a derelict space colony.</p>
<p>The players can play the game by taking control of the "chaos gremlins," who are continuously sent to their deaths only to be revived repeatedly by their malfunctioning robot mother. The aim is to scour for resources and new technology and find the answers to the darkest mysteries of the planet they reside on.</p>
<p>To add extra depth to the game play of the gremlins, players can mutate their gremlin, giving them access to a wide range of abilities to help them survive longer in the cave system. These mutations can also help change the game's difficulty, allowing players to choose their play style.</p>
<p>The game will feature easy drop-in features so that players can join others at any given time, regardless of what they are doing in-game. Joining the game adds to the chaos and competition between players.</p>
<p>Mother Machine is designed to be highly replayable, with players able to experience heartfelt moments with satisfying progression.</p>
<p>In response to the announcement, Maschinen-Mensch CEO Riad Djmelli said, "At Maschinen-Mensch, crafting games with innovative procedural gameplay is in our DNA. Following the success of Curious Expedition 1 and 2, our team has grown to over 20 very talented individuals. Now, we're excited to bring our approach to the action-RPG genre with our new IP, Mother Machine. We can't wait to share this new adventure with our community."</p>
<p><iframe title="Mother Machine Announcement Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gPUI2ihP6pE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Maschinen-Mensch is highly successful, selling over 500,000 copies of Curious Expedition across all platforms. Johannes Kristmann and Riad Djmelli founded this studio in 2014, and their shared studio space is in Berlin.</p>
<p>At the moment, Mother Machine doesn't have a release date, but as the Steam store page states, it will tentatively release in Q1 2025.</p>

<!-- cache hit 50:single/related:dedbb8ec06ec1628450068f39a0aa82c --><!-- empty -->
<p>After a 14-year journey of various states of availability and usefulness amid the shifting policies of Apple's App Store approval process, MS-DOS game emulator iDOS is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/idos-3/id1580768213">back</a> on the iPhone and iPad. It's hopefully here to stay this time.</p>
<p>iDOS allows you to run applications made for MS-DOS via DOSBox, with a nice retro-styled interface. Its main use case is definitely playing DOS games, but it has seen a rocky road to get to this point. Initially released over a decade ago, it existed quietly for its niche audience, though it saw some changes that made it more or less useful in the developer's quest to avoid removal from the App Store after it violated Apple's rules. That culminated in it being removed altogether in 2021 after some tweets and articles brought attention to it.</p>
<p>But earlier this year, Apple made <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/apple-now-allows-retro-game-emulators-on-its-app-store-but-with-big-caveats/">big changes</a> to its App Store rules, officially allowing "retro game emulators" for the first time. That cleared the way for a wave of working console game emulators like Delta and RetroArch, which mostly work as you might expect them to on any other platform now. But when iDOS developer Chaoji Li and other purveyors of classic PC emulator software attempted to do the same for old PC games for MS-DOS and other non-console computing platforms, they <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/apple-rejects-pc-emulators-on-the-ios-app-store/">were stymied</a>. Apple told them that it didn't consider their apps to be retro game console emulators and that they violated rules intended to prevent people from circumventing the App Store by running applications from other sources.
</p><p>PC emulator UTM released a version of its software that worked around Apple's rules, but it was a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/apples-restrictions-hold-back-the-first-pc-emulator-on-the-ios-app-store/">subpar experience</a>. But on August 2, Apple amended its App Store rules to explicitly allow emulators of classic PC games. That opened the door for iDOS, which has made its triumphant return and works quite well.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Developer Chaoji Li's <a href="https://litchie.com/2024/08/idos3-approved">announcement</a> of iDOS 3's availability didn't have a tone of triumph to it, though—more like exhaustion, given the app's struggles over the years:</p>
<blockquote><p>It has been a long wait for common sense to prevail within Apple. As much as I want to celebrate, I still can't help being a little bit cautious about the future. Are we good from now on?</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/idos-3/id1580768213">Get iDOS3 on AppStore</a></p>
<p>I hope iDOS can now enjoy its turn to stay and grow.</p>
<p>P.S. Even though words feel inadequate at times, I would like to say thank you to the supporters of iDOS. In many ways, you keep iDOS alive.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given that Apple's policy changes were driven by regulatory concerns, it seems likely it'll stick this time, but after everything that's happened, you can't blame Li for putting a question mark on this.</p>
<p>In any case, if you're among the dozens (or maybe several hundred) of people looking to play <em>Commander Keen</em>,&nbsp;<em>Might and Magic: The World of Xeen</em>, <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em>, or <em>Jill of the Jungle</em> on your iPhone, today is your day.</p>

<p>One of the most electrifying fixtures at IEM Cologne has just wrapped up, with FaZe Clan pulling out one of the most dizzying reverse sweeps against Team Liquid that we’ve seen in years. It looked awry for FaZe Clan on Mirage, with Team Liquid securing a massive 11 – 1 lead, but as the match pushed on, FaZe Clan exploded.</p>



<p>Just like that, the team was able to pull off a full reverse sweep, with Team Liquid managing to secure just one more round before the game entered Overtime at 12 – 12. FaZe Clan refused to relent, netting a further four rounds to win the map and push Team Liquid out of IEM Cologne.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-stunning-performance">Stunning Performance</h2>



<p>FaZe Clan went on one hell of a run to secure qualification into the playoffs. From the upper bracket, FaZe Clan beat Team Liquid once but was sent packing into the lower run by Vitality, who would later qualify for the playoffs. </p>



<p>In the lower bracket, FaZe Clan forcefully ejected Team Falcons – currently the number-one organisation at the Esports World Cup – before dispatching Team Liquid once again.</p>



<p>The numbers ended up <a href="https://www.hltv.org/stats/matches/mapstatsid/181396/liquid-vs-faze" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">looking sharp for FaZe Clan</a>, but most particularly for ropz, who picked up the accolades for the best overall rating, the most kills, and the most damage. </p>



<p>It was tough watching FaZe Clan get rinsed so many times in quick succession, but the team remained resilient and pulled off a beautiful reverse sweep worthy of a tournament champion.</p>



<p>Now, FaZe Clan enters the playoffs along with MOUZ, G2, NAVI, Vitality, and SAW. There’s still the matter of the $1 million prize pool on the line, and the winner of this event will net $400,000 of that <strong>plus </strong>qualification to IEM Katowice 2025 <strong>and </strong>the BLAST Premier World Final.</p>



<p>FaZe has been running a little cold lately, having secured IEM Chengdu in April but nothing else going back to November 2023. Could this be another IEM win for the squad?</p>

It’s a message that sees Arrowhead acknowledging player frustrations, as it promises to focus on “action. Not talk,” when it comes to Helldivers 2’s future.</p><p>“We’ve spent the last week listening to feedback, reflecting about the path ahead for Helldivers 2 and how we want to continue developing the game,” game director Mikael Eriksson said. “In short, we didn’t hit our target with the latest update. Some things we just didn’t get right - and other more fundamental inconsistencies in our approach to game balance and game direction. All of that is on us and we are going to own that.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/23/helldivers-2-escalation-of-freedom-1721742365253.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Arrowhead publishes 60-day plan to get Helldivers 2 back in shape.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Anger from Helldivers 2 fans stems from a number of gameplay tweaks and additions that have arrived since launch in February. Namely, many are <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fire-damage-nerfs-push-helldivers-2-community-to-open-rebellion-again"><u>upset with recent weapon nerfs</u></a>, arguing that Arrowhead’s balance tweaks hamper fun in favor of a more even experience overall. It’s a conversation that has seen the community divided, as there is a fair share of others who prefer the feeling of barely extracting from a mission alive.</p><p>Regardless, Arrowhead feels the need to step in. Within the next 60 days, Eriksson promises to re-examine how the team approaches balance in Helldivers 2. That means alterations to how fire damage works and rag-dolling that isn’t as intrusive to the experience. Arrowhead also wants to prioritize bugs that directly impact gameplay while improving frame rate across Helldivers 2. Another change promised in the first 60 days will see those relentless Chargers reworked, though no details on how they will be changed were revealed.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Our intention is that balance should be fun, not ‘balanced’ for the sake of balance.</p></div><p>“Our intention is that balance should be fun, not ‘balanced’ for the sake of balance,” the outline says.</p><p>Arrowhead’s grand outline comes with a few long-term bullet points aimed to ensure Helldivers 2 sticks around for a long time to come. This includes the high-priority goal of erecting an opt-in beta test environment as well as regularly posting player surveys in order to streamline communication from fans to the developers. With this will come even more blog posts and more detailed patch notes.</p><p>“We also want to thank you for your patience," Eriksson continued. "We're grateful that so many of you provided constructive feedback and suggestions on the latest update.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Helldivers 2 launched to unforeseen success earlier this year and even managed to become <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-playstations-fastest-selling-game-of-all-time-with-over-12-million-sold-in-12-weeks"><u>PlayStation’s fastest-selling game ever</u></a> with 12 million copies sold in 12 weeks on PC and PlayStation 5. With its victories have come a laundry list of changes, with one major shift seeing <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-boss-of-helldivers-2-dev-arrowhead-is-now-its-chief-creative-officer-i-care-more-about-weapon-balance-than-qbrs"><u>John Pilestedt switch from CEO to CCO</u></a> in order to focus more on the studio’s games and community. Its new CEO, Shams Jorjani, would later <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-setting-studio-up-to-make-more-and-better-stuff-in-sustainable-way-new-ceo-says">comment on the success of Helldivers 2</a>, acknowledging that the team “knew it would be impossible to keep up with demand and the insatiable hunger for more fun shit to do in/with HD2.”</p><p>Helldivers 2 is working through a low period after a strong first few months. We called it “amazing” in our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-review"><u>9/10 review</u></a>, saying, “Helldivers 2's combat feels fantastic, its missions stay fresh and interesting, and its smart progression system doesn’t nickel and dime you.”</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-am-in-awe-of-the-borderlands-movie%E2%80%99s-origin-story-a-burden-you-must-now-also-bear.952386/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/borderlands-movie-eli-roth-randy-pitchford-gearbox<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After many years in various circles of development hell, the <em>Borderlands </em>movie is finally out. It’s not doing well. On <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/borderlands" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, it’s currently tangled in the tendrils of a nine-percent score, and its global box office take over the weekend was <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/borderlands-grosses-16-million-globally-leaving-it-roughly-60-million-shy-of-breaking-even-and-that-s-before-the-theatres-take-their-cut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a mere $16 million</a> – tens of millions less than its budget. I have no desire to see this apparent whimper of a thing in theaters, nor should you. However, I will absolutely <em>devour </em>details about how it got made.</p><p>Nothing about the movie makes sense, after all. How did it attract such a star-studded cast? Why are all the main characters played by actors substantially older than they’re supposed to be? Why <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-movie-r-rated-pg-13-eli-roth-interview-1851618411" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cut the cartoony gore</a> the <em>Borderlands </em>series is known for, especially with the R-rated <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> running circles around the rest of this year’s summer movie slate? <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/cate-blanchett-borderlands-covid-madness.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is Cate Blanchett OK</a>?&nbsp;</p><p>Answering precisely none of those questions – though definitely providing an illuminating point A to explain how we reached the movie’s point Z – is director Eli Roth’s explanation of how he pitched <em>Borderlands </em>to studio execs, which I discovered while going down a rabbit hole last night and which I am now obligated to share with you, to ease the weight of my own burden. It involves literal dogshit. From <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-movies/borderlands-director-reveals-the-first-question-he-asked-the-games-studio-and-how-his-dog-got-him-the-job/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an interview</a> Roth did with SFX Magazine:</p><blockquote><p>Whenever I take [my dog] for a walk and she has to go to the bathroom, she won’t let me look at her. I have to look away because she gets really shy. But one day I filmed her. She had that shy look on her face and I was like, 'That’s Claptrap.'</p><p>My first question [to Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford] was, 'You can’t kill Claptrap, but you can shoot him hundreds of times?' He goes, 'Correct. Because there’s a scene where Claptrap gets shot up after being a decoy.' I said, ‘So, what happens to the bullets?’ Randy goes, 'I don’t know.’ I go, ‘Could he shit out the bullets, like we’re in a Mel Brooks movie?’ He goes, ‘Yes, he could.’ And I felt we needed to see that.</p><p>… And that was my pitch to Lionsgate. They were laughing so hard.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>This tale fits a little too well with <em>Borderlands</em>’ sometimes-puerile sense of humor, so perhaps it’s just marketing spin. But given where things ended up, I’m choosing to believe it.</p><p>Speaking of where things ended up, Pitchford is – as <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/randy-pitchford-tweets-maximum-copium-after-borderlands-bombs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Gamer recently put it</a> – posting through it. Among other things, he recently compared the plainly-bad video game movie <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1822369245822374131" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to The Beatles</a>, which is certainly a choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/owlcat-games-enters-publishing-space-with-two-rpgs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Owlcat Games, known for making games like Pathfinder: Kingmaker and <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-crpg-pathfinder-owlcat-games/">Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</a>, has entered the publishing space with two new RPGs. This company will now help independent developers across the globe create their own RPG projects. By helping these independent developers out, they will give them access to funding, expert advice, and any other services they may need in the game creation department.</p>
<p>Owlcat Games reviewed 50 different games and picked two to start with. The two development teams they'll be working with are Emotion Spark Studio, based in Serbia, and Another Angle Games, based in Poland.</p>
<p>Emotion Spark Studio is currently working on an RPG titled <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2126190/Rue_Valley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rue Valley</a>. The story revolves around a man who is trapped in a time loop during a psychotherapy session. By uncovering more of his story, he has to delve into his mental challenges and figure out how he got into this situation.</p>
<p>Another Angle Games is working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1173980/Shadow_of_the_Road/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shadow of the Road</a>, an isometric RPG set in an alternate history timeline of Feudal Japan. This game combines history, samurai, allegiance, and honor with tactical turn-based combat systems. In addition, it takes place in a world filled with magical Yokai and Steampunk technology.</p>
<p>While both games are still in early development, attendees of Gamescom will get more information on these two RPGs.</p>
<p>With Owlcat Games joining the publishing industry, they gained full control of the publishing label META Games, which assisted in publishing Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous and helped bring the game to PC and consoles in 2021. META Games is a very different publisher style from the one that Owlcat Games aims to be, as they focus primarily on gameplay-first titles with co-op multiplayer features.</p>
<p>META Games has published some games, including Biped, Spirit of the Island, Train Valley 1, and Train Valley 2. Its upcoming games include Biped 2 and Nested Lands. Similar to the above RPGs, META Games will be at Gamescom, where it will showcase some of its upcoming titles, including Biped 2 and Nested Lands.</p>
<p>Owlcat Games started as a very small company and has since grown exponentially, with over 450 employees worldwide. Their head office is in Cyprus, but that doesn't stop them from having employees from many different countries. With the news of Owlcat Games stepping into publishing, they are continuing to expand and hire for new roles, something that is seemingly uncommon in today's climate in the gaming industry.</p>

About 30 minutes into playing in the tournament, Osmanova alerted officials that she was feeling sick, complaining of nausea and dizziness. Doctors were called and they deduced that she had likely been poisoned. Officials checked security footage and discovered Abakarova allegedly poisoning Osmanova’s chess board. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://t.me/bazabazon/30070&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://t.me/bazabazon/30070" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In footage released online</a></span>, you can see Abakarova enter an area filled with chess boards and empty chairs. Before the tournament had started, the chess pro walked over to where Osmanova was scheduled to play and then smeared liquid mercury—allegedly from a broken thermometer—onto the table and board. Reportedly, before the incident, she had asked officials if there were security cameras in the area and had been told no.<br></p><p>After police were notified by the tournament’s officials and reviewed the footage, they arrested Abakarova.   </p><p>“I still feel bad. In the first minutes, I felt a lack of air and a taste of iron in my mouth. I had to spend about five hours on this board. I don’t know what would have happened to me if I hadn’t seen it earlier,” Osmanova told<em> Russia Today.</em></p><p>Two other people reportedly suffered similar symptoms from the mercury. </p><p><em>Chess.com</em> reports that Abakarova has confessed that she wanted to “knock her opponent out of the tournament.” The week before the poisoning, Osmanova had won a different chess event, beating Abakarova. Osmanova allegedly didn’t want to harm her rival, but just wanted to scare her, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://rtvi.com/news/na-sorevnovaniyah-v-dagestane-shahmatistka-popytalas-otravit-soperniczu-chto-izvestno/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://rtvi.com/news/na-sorevnovaniyah-v-dagestane-shahmatistka-popytalas-otravit-soperniczu-chto-izvestno/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to a police report</a></span>.</p><p>Abakarova is currently being held by police, and faces up to three years of jail time. The Russian Chess Federation has temporarily banned the pro from future chess events as it investigates the situation. It’s reported she could receive a lifetime ban. </p><p>“Like many others, I am perplexed by what happened, and the motives of such an experienced competitor as Amina Abakarova are incomprehensible,” said Dagestan’s Minster of Sports. </p><p>Osmanova recovered after being poisoned and continued to play in the tournament, eventually finishing in second place.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There are several fantastic gaming events throughout the year designed to build hype around upcoming titles, like the ever-popular Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 or Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. This year, at Gamescom, we’re set to see a huge selection of popular games, with a few of them already confirmed for the show floor. Here are 10 games we’ll see at Gamescom!</p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>This year’s entry in the long-running first-person shooter franchise promises to be one of the most exciting and welcoming to everyone, as it’s one of the first major launches in the series on Xbox Game Pass. <strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 </strong>returns with improved movement, a cinematic single-player campaign, round-based Zombies, prestige levels, weapon customization, and so much more!</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The upcoming installment in the grind-heavy Monster Hunt series, <strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong>, takes players to an all-new location with unique monsters, weapons, and abilities to help breathe fresh life into the franchise. We’ve previously glimpsed an overhauled weather system and boss encounters, but Gamescom should give us a taste of more gameplay!</p>



<h2 id="h-star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In what may be the biggest blockbuster game of the summer, Star Wars Outlaws is Ubisoft’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-star-wars-outlaws-multiplayer-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first open-world, single-player</a> Star Wars title to date. It boasts multiple planets to explore, space flight, cover-based combat mechanics, stealth, and choice-based story progression. We’ve already explored quite a bit of the game, but Gamescom is the last real shot the team has at winning over fans before its launch at the end of August!</p>



<h2 id="h-warhammer-40-000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Saber Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>The upcoming third-person horde shooter, <strong>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</strong>, from developer Saber Interactive is shaping up to be one of the most exciting titles of the year. Stepping into the ultra-armored boots of an Ultramarine, players once more take on the role of Captain Titus, but this time around, it’s not Orks but Tyranids invading. Using a variety of weapons, up to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-multiplayer-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three players in co-op</a> can push back the unsightly enemy en masse.</p>



<h2 id="h-little-nightmares-3">Little Nightmares 3</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Following the immense success of Little Nightmares and Little Nightmares 2, Supermassive Games is back once more with <strong>Little Nightmares 3</strong>. In this entry, players follow Low &amp; Alone, two companions in search of a way out of Nowhere. With two protagonists, players will embark on this unique and frightful adventure in full co-op or with an AI companion. We’ll see more of Little Nightmares 3 at Gamescom this month!</p>



<h2 id="h-s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-heart-of-chornobyl">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-stalker-2-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent delay and 35-minute Deep Dive</a>, in which we enjoyed significantly more gameplay and game design elements than ever before, we’re all eagerly awaiting the launch of <strong>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</strong>. Thankfully, it’s only a few months away, but we’re still hopeful for more. With Gamescom around the corner, developer GSC Game World intends to give us what we want!</p>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Once more, following in the footsteps of young Henry, <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</strong> drops us into 15th-century Medieval Europe in an epic adventure full of sword fights, horseback chases, and an impressive five hours worth of cinematics to help the story along. At Gamescom, we hope to see additional gameplay from Henry’s perspective as he explores Medieval Europe, along with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a release date</a>!</p>



<h2 id="h-dune-awakening">Dune Awakening</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>From developer Funcom, known for Conan Exiles, <strong>Dune Awakening</strong> follows a similar gameplay style but set in the iconic universe of Frank Hebert’s Dune. It’s touted as an open-world survival MMO with a massive, persistent sandbox world to explore, fight across, and build within. We’re hoping to see gameplay from the project at Gamescom!</p>



<h2 id="h-civilization-vii">Civilization VII</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The long-running turn-based strategy franchise returns with immense excitement on all fronts. <strong>Civilization VII</strong> is coming to Gamescom, and we’re hoping for gameplay, first and foremost, but also more on the title’s mechanics, countries, and multiplayer components. It’ll be there for all to see, so <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-the-civilization-7-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we just have to wait patiently</a>!</p>



<h2 id="h-indiana-jones-at-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones at the Great Circle</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>From MachineGames and Bethesda Softworks, long-time fans of the Indiana Jones franchise can fulfill their dreams of playing as Indy in the upcoming <strong>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</strong>. It’s a story-driven single-player adventure spanning multiple continents as Indy and companions fight against sinister forces. At Gamescom, we’re hoping for gameplay, but a cinematic is certainly welcome, too!</p>



<h2 id="h-honorable-mentions-at-gamescom">Honorable Mentions at Gamescom</h2>



<p>Of course, it’s Gamescom! The showcase is positively massive, with way more than just ten upcoming titles to show off. Alongside the games we don’t yet know about, there’s also a handful previously confirmed titles we’ll explore in greater detail, such as:</p>



<ul>

<li><strong>Dragon Ball: Sparkling! ZERO</strong></li>



<li><strong>Sonic X Shadow Generations</strong></li>



<li><strong>Crimson Desert</strong></li>



<li><strong>Visions of Mana</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Stay tuned! Gamescom is about to take off, and the hype train is running right alongside it!</p>

            <p>
Cast your mind back to the murky distant past of 24 hours ago and you might remember publisher Boss Team Games teasing two projects based on John Carpenter's Halloween. Well, it turns out one of those is a 16-bit-style platformer from Shantae developer WayForward, and the studio's creating an Ash vs Evil Dead platformer too.
</p>
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/retro-realms-halloween-ash-vs-evil-dead-games-announced-release-date-price">IGN</a>, Boss Team (which previously published Saber Interactive's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/last-years-multiplayer-evil-dead-game-wont-get-new-content-switch-version-canned">now-defunct</a> Evil Dead: The Game) is releasing both titles as part of its new RetroRealms series. The publisher describes its first two instalments as "gore-filled" and "fast-paced 90's arcade style" platfomers, and you can get a taste of their retro-inspired action in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_S-Dt-0_lbY">trailer</a> below.
</p>
<p>
RetroRealms: Halloween and RetroRealms: Ash vs Evil Dead are both set to launch for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch on 18th November, and they'll cost $24.99 USD (around £20) each. A $49.99 physical Double Feature bundle is also on the way, with Boss Team noting players owning both games will unlock new features, including the ability for protagonists Michael Myers and Ash Williams to cross over to each others' worlds.

<p>
Today's news (which, if nothing else, has reminded me I still haven't watched all of Ash vs Evil Dead) follows Boss Team Games' recent announcement it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/john-carpenters-halloween-is-getting-two-game-adaptations-from-evil-dead-publisher">two Halloween projects in the works</a>, both enabling players to "relive moments from the film and play as classic characters". One of these is evidentally WayForward's platformer, but the other remains mysterious. It does, however, seem likely this second project will be the one John Carpenter is said to be "intimately involved" with, unless Carpenter had some particularly revolutionary ideas about running left and right and occassionally hitting a jump button.
</p>
<p>
There's no word of a release date for Halloween game number two, but hopefully the oft-reliable WayForward will deliver the goods when RetroRealms: Halloween and RetroRealms: Ash vs Evil Dead show up on 18th October.

This update is special since it marks the sci-fi social deduction game crossing over with the beloved <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>D&amp;D</em></a> actual play series <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-beacon-membership-service-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Critical Role</a>. The aptly named Among Us x Critical Role crossover introduces new cosmetic items and new imposter kill animation.</p>
<h2>The Among Us x Critical Role Crossover Announcement</h2>
<p>The Among Us x Critical Role crossover was announced through a <a href="https://www.innersloth.com/announcing-among-us-x-critical-role/">dev log post</a> on Innersloth's website. As the name implies, the update introduces brand-new cosmetic items based on the adventuring parties of Vox Machina, Mighty Nein, and Bells Hells.</p>

Log into the game and pick up Gilmore's Curious Cosmicube for 110 Stars (MSRP $9.99). From there, you slowly unlock those cosmetics as you play.</p>
<p>The cosmetics found within that Cosmicube are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Artagan's Cloak Skin</li>
<li>Artagan's Hair Hat</li>
<li>Artagan's Incredible Brows Visor</li>
<li>Chetney's Eyebrows Visor</li>

<li>Scanlan's Hand Hat</li>
<li>Sprinkle is "Fine" Hat</li>
<li>Teatime with Caduceus Nameplate</li>
<li>The Nine Eyes of Lucien Nameplate</li>
<li>Vax's Armor Skin</li>
<li>Vax's Hair Hat</li>
</ul><p>If your character has all three of Chetney's cosmetics equipped, and you are playing as the Impostor, you will unlock a brand new kill animation.</p>
<p>Like all purchased Cosmicubes, you can unlock the <em>Among Us x Critical Role</em> cosmetics at your leisure after you buy them. However, this Cosmicube will only be available for a limited time. You have until November 12 at 2 AM ET to pick it up if interested.</p>

You doing okay, buddy? I know it's been a few years since you launched a game, but did you remember...how? to announce? a game?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In case you haven't heard, Steam platform owner Valve, the developer of the Half Life, Team Fortress, and Portal series, as well as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>DOTA 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Artifact</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, is finally releasing a new game: a hero shooter called </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Or...is it? The game was first dug up through Steam datamining and not officially announced. Though it looked near completion, there was every chance Valve could pull the plug and not launch it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then, at some point, Valve invited players to a closed beta for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, using a key system that allowed players to invite their friends. The invites proliferated so far that according to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/">SteamDB</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the game's hit a peak of 18,000 concurrent players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Such invites for unreleased games normally come with varying NDAs, but as The Verge's Sean Hollister </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/12/24219016/valve-deadlock-hands-on-secret-new-game">discovered</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Valve's only attempt to discourage sharing anything about the game was a menu screen saying "don't share info" when you opened the client, with a prompt for the user to say "ok."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hollister navigated around this screen by pressing the "escape" key. After he wrote about this experience, Valve banned his account from matchmaking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hollister's banning tripped a red flag for me. Not just because retaliating against journalists pushes against a free press (I don't want to make too big a deal of this, it's just getting banned from a game's matchmaking), but because this series of events indicates Valve's market power might be getting out of hand.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Is it a monopoly? I don't know, but because Valve owns and operates Steam, the platform it distributes </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on, it's been able to market its game in a way no another developer or publisher can.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let's dig into why.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What other publisher can roll out a game in this manner?">What other publisher can roll out a game in this manner?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let's step through the stages of Valve's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> rollout.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Valve owns Steam, the platform it distributes its own games on. It funds the development of new games with revenue from Steam and its existing titles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When Valve releases any game, it competes against other games on the Steam marketplace. Valve's market power is checked by how many games it can deliver, the quality of them, and its competitors' ability/decision to launch on other platforms.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Valve, like other developers, decided to do a closed beta for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Unlike most other developers, it has not announced the game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>yet</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. This closed beta is run with an invite-based system that is very open, where players can invite others. Valve has deliberately given up control over precisely who joins the playtest because for whatever reason, this fit into its strategy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Valve could also have legally controlled who is allowed to discuss </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and under what conditions by requiring the signing of an NDA or some equivalent triggered in-game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It did not, because for reasons I do not know, this fit into its strategy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Already we are in a position most (if not all?) developers and publishers cannot afford to operate in: tightly controlling information about a game (purportedly) key to its financial success. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Valve has an outsized amount of financial stability to endure any loss of revenue that could come from an early leak of </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The closest example of another publisher trying this strategy I can think of this is when Respawn Entertainment and Electronic Arts revved up the launch for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Apex Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and invited a bunch of press and influencers to LA to play the game before it launched. During this test, they still required press to sign NDAs (or at least agree to embargoes, I never learned the specific terms).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now we enter even more uncharted territory. Valve has placed a game on Steam that it has not announced, and invited people to play it. Not only to invite them to play it, but to invite their friends to play it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is where Valve doesn't just have market capacity that other companies don't have, but it explicitly </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>benefits</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from its position. The company is not making money off of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but a beta like this could entice people to one day spend money on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Valve is benefitting from this strategy, as many other companies do, so I'm only noting it here as the beginning of its unusual position.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here is the nail in the coffin for me on why Valve's moves flex its market power: when Valve gets people to share invites for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it has the potential to effectively create new users for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>all of Steam</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some people playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> may invite their friends who have not played on Steam before. That's not a farfetched concept. If people have only played </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, or have mostly been on console, or have pirated software and not used Steam, whatever, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Valve's efforts here have the potential to create new Steam accounts.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Every new Steam account benefits Valve in some way financially. If a player accepts an invite to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, makes an account, then buys a game from its competitor on Steam, Valve gets a cut. If that player never spends a penny, but hops into other free-to-play games on Steam, they enter an ecosystem that leads to other players spending money in the game, which Valve gets a cut from. In the big picture, Valve relies on other companies to market Steam for it, because they're the ones who say "hey, if you want to buy our game, join Steam." Here, they get to use their own product to do that marketing at a discount compared to their competitors.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And now we hit the "NDAs," a point where I think Valve has badly abused its position. Valve did not require anyone invited to play </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to sign a legally actionable NDA or have them agree to an EULA. It posted a sign that did not even explicitly require the user to click "I agree," something EULAs go to great lengths to spell out to ensure their legality (and even then, some judges and regulators are scrutinizing that).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Imagine this warning, or any document, is a guard at the door. If the guard is named "NDA," or "EULA," when a person asks to pass the threshold, the guard says "you may pass the threshold if you agree to X, and Y, and if you violate that agreement, Z will happen."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The person who wants to cross the door agrees or disagrees, and the guard lets them in.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here, Valve has dropped a guard at the door who when players ask to cross, it says "don't tell anyone you crossed this door." If players ask "or what?" it does not answer. What will the guard do? Will it bar you from entry? Will it punch you into next Tuesday? Will it open a trap door and you fall in and there's crocodiles but the crocodiles are friendly and you have a nice time with the crocodiles—okay this is getting out of hand, I think you get the point.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then a person can walk past without saying "ok" to the guard.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That is the purpose of those documents: to create conditions so both parties understand the outcomes and can agree on somewhat equal footing to enter a contract together.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Valve's menu is not an NDA, and it is not an EULA. When Hollister wrote about the game, he did so with no explicit knowledge of what Valve's response would be. When journalists agree to embargoes or sign NDAs, we do so with the knowledge of what will happen when we violate that agreement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Valve took action and banned him from matchmaking. That is a slap on the wrist—but Hollister had no way of knowing if that would be the only consequence.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Valve could have banned him from all online play on Steam. Valve could have turned off his access to various elements of Steam. Valve could have gone so far as to disable or suspend his entire account. It has the power to flip that switch, and it chose here to take what it felt like was an appropriate response.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But unlike </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>every other game company in the marketplace</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it did so </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>without entering an agreement in the first place</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Actions like this invite scrutiny of Valve's marketplace power">Actions like this invite scrutiny of Valve's marketplace power</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To date, I have not been personally convinced by the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/wolfire-games-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve-has-been-dismissed">lawsuits</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> accusing Valve of operating a monopoly through Steam. That's not to say I think they're 100 percent wrong, I just think as long as I can go buy a game on Xbox or PlayStation, I have a marketplace of choices. That I can play other games on PC without ever opening Steam is another factor.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In other words, I want to leave it to the courts and the regulators to figure out. I'm just a writer, not a legal expert.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Valve's behavior with the rollout of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has shifted my thinking. Some of the lawsuits against Valve has revealed details about how it "encourages" developers to maintain </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/valve-sued-for-allegedly-overcharging-14-million-uk-steam-players">price parity</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> across platforms, but again I'm not an expert on whether that is considered price fixing. But as someone professionally obligated to follow the game industry, I know when I've seen something I've never seen before, and I have never seen a company enforce an order to not share information without some form of binding agreement in place.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is a first. And it is a first because Valve has the market power to do this. That power manifests in its control over accounts on Steam, its ability to resist harm from the leak of information, and its ability to benefit its entire ecosystem by letting players invite other players into </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I still don't know if Steam is a monopoly! Again, I am a writer and not an expert, and would prefer the courts and FTC step in before putting such an argument to print.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I've been thinking a lot about market power and monopolies in the wake of the recent court decision about</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/technology/google-antitrust-ruling.html"> Google's search engine dominance</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ftc-says-microsoft-has-turned-xbox-game-pass-into-a-degraded-product-">FTC's objection</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to Game Pass price changes following Microsoft's purchase of Activision Blizzard, especially with regards to the concept of a "degraded product." Valve hasn't done anything to make Steam worse (in fact, it regularly makes it better for developers and players), but the rollout of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> suggests the existence of some supreme form of Steam that other developers don't have access to.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Is that fair? Is it legal? I don't know. If nothing else, I think Gabe Newell should roll one of his $30 million yachts up to the office and go "hey guys, what's going on over here?" before someone in the government does so for him.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer has reached out to Valve for comment on this story and will update it when a response is given.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The Dracthyr shown in the WoWCast image, however, is definitely not an Evoker. Rather than using the caster weapons Evokers typically wield, this Dracthyr is wielding two giant axes. That has led players to believe the image actually shows a Dracthyr Warrior, seemingly confirming that the race will have its Evoker-only class restrictions lifted for The War Within's launch or sometime shortly after. Blizzard had previously hinted the Dracthyr would eventually be able to play as different classes, but that the feature would not be included for The War Within's release.</p><p dir="ltr">Funnily enough, this isn't the first Warband image Blizzard has shown depicting a non-Evoker Dracthyr. During BlizzCon 2023, Blizzard shared a Warbands interface mockup that featured a Dracthyr wearing leather armor instead of the mail armor worn by Evokers. Blizzard at the time called the inclusion of the leather-wearing Dracthyr an oversight.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4349699-dracthyrwarrior.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4349699" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1456" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4349699-dracthyrwarrior.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4349699"></a><figcaption>Yep, that's definitely a Dracthyr Warrior.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4349699-dracthyrwarrior.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As the feature hasn't been officially announced, it's unknown what classes will be available to Dracthyr. Whereas class and race restrictions were once the norm, Blizzard has in the past few years made it so most races are now able to be most classes, though there are still a few exceptions.</p><p dir="ltr">The War Within will officially add one new playable race, the Earthen, but many fans believe another, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-dataminers-think-theyve-discovered-a-new-playable-race/1100-6522773/" data-ref-id="1100-6522773">still-unannounced playable race will also be added</a> over the course of the expansion.
