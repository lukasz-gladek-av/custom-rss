            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-eshop-online-closing-china-2026<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that it will shut down the eShop and all Switch network services in China in 2026. No reason has been given for the shutdown.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.nintendoswitch.com.cn/topics/57ea6913-1a17-4afa-b325-a1a1a8596e15" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a notice</a> posted on the official Chinese Nintendo website (thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-eshop-closing-2026-in-china" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>), the eShop will cease selling games and software on March 31st, 2026, after which point you won't be able to buy any games from the eShop, nor will you be able to download demos, trials, or free games.</p>

<p>Following that, on May 15th of the same year, you won't be able to download games from the eShop, and you won't be able to redeem codes either. That means you won't be able to buy any DLC, and it also seems to mean you won't be able to download games you already own.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/super-mario-odyssey-eshop-closure-china.jpg?itok=clxwOBnG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/super-mario-odyssey-eshop-closure-china.jpg?itok=0WvP487i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Nintendo Switch eShop, as well as all of the console's network services, will be coming to an end in 2026 in China.</figcaption></figure><p>On the same day, all Switch-related network services will also be shut down, so you'll no longer be able to play Switch games online with your friends at that point.</p>

<p>You can see a full list of all of the games that will be affected by the network shutdown <a href="https://www.nintendoswitch.com.cn/support/software_affected.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>. It's in Chinese, and we're using machine translation for it, but it seems relatively accurate to me (although I have little to no knowledge of Chinese as a language).</p>

<p>In order to compensate Chinese Switch gamers for this decision, Nintendo will give away up to four Nintendo games for users via their WeChat account. You'll need to have activated your Switch console, and you'll need to have stuck to the Terms of Use as well.</p>

<p>The list has a couple of...unusual entries using machine translation, but games like&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Yoshi's Crafted World&nbsp;</em>can be redeemed, as well as&nbsp;<em>Kirby Star Allies</em>,&nbsp;<em>New Pokemon Snap</em>, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-eshop-closure-china-new-pokemon-snap.jpg?itok=o1tMZUrf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-eshop-closure-china-new-pokemon-snap.jpg?itok=I6sOdYmB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you're a Switch user in China, you could be entitled to a free copy of&nbsp;<em>New Pokemon Snap</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The giveaway starts on November 27th and runs until March 31st, 2026, and you'll need to use WeChat's game redemption applet in order to take advantage of it.</p>

<p>Do note that you'll have to download whatever games you decide to grab before May 15th, or else your free games will be gone for good. It's also worth noting that as far as we know, this doesn't affect the eShop anywhere else in the world.</p>

<p>News of the eShop's closure in China comes amid fevered speculation about the Switch 2, which Nintendo is due to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation" rel="nofollow">reveal sometime before April</a>. It's not clear what this might mean for the Switch 2 in China.</p>

That’s not to say you should be tempted to fork over real money just yet! There are plenty of cards to fill out your custom build and in-progress dream decks alike.</p><p>In addition to useful Item and Supporter cards, we’ll also be including Pokémon with unique abilities and decent attacks that call for Colorless Energy. That last part is especially important, since Colorless Energy requirements can be fulfilled by any Energy you attach to it. These cards have you covered for any type of deck you’re making!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="61eda78304533bd1ec3b6db7e9126d54" data-recommend-id="image://61eda78304533bd1ec3b6db7e9126d54" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Persian card shows a large muscular cat lounging." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Persian card shows a large muscular cat lounging." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="61eda78304533bd1ec3b6db7e9126d54" data-recommend-id="image://61eda78304533bd1ec3b6db7e9126d54" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Persian card shows a large muscular cat lounging." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Starting this list is Persian, which might initially sound like a tough sell. Not only does its Shadow Claw attack require two Colorless energy and only deal 40 damage, but it’s a stage-one Pokémon and will require you to evolve a Meowth just to bring it out. What makes it worth it, however, is the Shadow Claw’s ability. You’ll flip a coin with every attack, with heads forcing your opponent to discard a random card from their hand. This effect can greatly disrupt any player’s plans when you remember every deck is only 20 cards. </p><p>Additionally, Meowth isn’t a bad card itself. Its Payday attack might deal a measly 10 damage, but its effect lets you draw a card with each attack. Both this ability and the one from its evolution can be pretty handy.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a10e884acca1e2a89db5a230f3cb4f24" data-recommend-id="image://a10e884acca1e2a89db5a230f3cb4f24" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The yellow Heliolisk card shows the lightning-type lizard in action." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The yellow Heliolisk card shows the lightning-type lizard in action." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a10e884acca1e2a89db5a230f3cb4f24" data-recommend-id="image://a10e884acca1e2a89db5a230f3cb4f24" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The yellow Heliolisk card shows the lightning-type lizard in action." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Next is the only Pokémon on the list that isn’t a Colorless one. Heliolisk is a stage-one lightning-type Pokémon that evolves from Helioptile. Its Quick Attack, which uses two Colorless energy, makes this an attractive inclusion for a deck. It’s a pretty unique attribute. So many evolved Pokémon require at least some energy that matches their type. The attack also does a base 50 damage, with a coin flip potentially adding an extra 40 if you land a heads.</p><p>Heliolisk’s biggest problem is its pre-evolution Helioptile. It’s only a basic Pokémon and its Tail Whap attack requires one Lightning energy. If your deck doesn’t have enough Lightning types to necessitate that energy, Helioptile will essentially be worthless for you before it can evolve it.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a3f896205d3be65c6fc14d85521a1b4f" data-recommend-id="image://a3f896205d3be65c6fc14d85521a1b4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Kangaskhan card shows the Pokémon carrying their young and getting ready." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Kangaskhan card shows the Pokémon carrying their young and getting ready." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a3f896205d3be65c6fc14d85521a1b4f" data-recommend-id="image://a3f896205d3be65c6fc14d85521a1b4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Kangaskhan card shows the Pokémon carrying their young and getting ready." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Sometimes your deck needs a tanky Pokémon that can stall while you build up your main strategy. Kangaskhan is one of the best at this approach as a basic Pokémon with 100 HP. Just as impressive is its Dizzy Punch attack. For just one Colorless energy, you can flip two coins and inflict 30 damage for each one that lands heads.</p><p><br>Luck can be a tricky thing with this card, however. Getting two tails and dealing no damage at all isn’t a great situation. However, the chances of dealing 30 or 60 damage are worth taking in my opinion. This is especially true when you consider the high HP and low energy cost. If you haven’t received this card yet, which is likely given its low offering rate, you might want to try crafting it through the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/get-the-pokemon-tcg-pocket-card-you-want-with-the-pack-1851702255&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/get-the-pokemon-tcg-pocket-card-you-want-with-the-pack-1851702255">Pack Point Exchange</a></span> system.  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d2646d852c050ef56f650b13a295d821" data-recommend-id="image://d2646d852c050ef56f650b13a295d821" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Poké Ball opens slightly on the identically titled card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Poké Ball opens slightly on the identically titled card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d2646d852c050ef56f650b13a295d821" data-recommend-id="image://d2646d852c050ef56f650b13a295d821" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Poké Ball opens slightly on the identically titled card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There are quite a few Item cards that feel necessary for specific kinds of decks or situations, but some will work just about anywhere. A fantastic example of this is Poké Ball, which adds one random Basic Pokémon from your deck to your hand.</p><p>This card doesn’t have any downsides. The only bad use for it is if it’s played late enough into a game when you no longer have anything to properly target.

Pidgeot has the Drive Off ability, which allows you to switch out the opponent’s Active Pokémon once per your turn. The opponent will be able to choose which of their benched Pokémon will take the new active spot. It’s basically like using a Sabrina card for each turn.</p><p>Drive Off is a separate ability that doesn’t rely on its attack. Speaking of, a 70-damage dealing Wing Attack isn’t too bad for two Colorless energy either. You can comfortably use Drive Off whether Pidgeot is in the Active spot or on the Bench. Still, how useful this is depends on personal preference. You’ll need to include both of its pre-evolutions just for the chance to benefit from the ability. No matter how beneficial and disruptive the ability is, that’s a lot to accommodate for.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c0426164f663a227bf4bb654d0b7c9ac" data-recommend-id="image://c0426164f663a227bf4bb654d0b7c9ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The duck-like Pokémon Farfetch’d carries a leek in its mouth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The duck-like Pokémon Farfetch’d carries a leek in its mouth." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c0426164f663a227bf4bb654d0b7c9ac" data-recommend-id="image://c0426164f663a227bf4bb654d0b7c9ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The duck-like Pokémon Farfetch’d carries a leek in its mouth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>We could not have a list like this without including one of the most helpful cards. Farfetch’d is a simple, basic Pokémon that can hit hard thanks to its 40-damage Leek Slap. What separates this attack from everything else added so far is that it only requires one Colorless energy.</p><p>That isn’t to say the card is completely OP. Farfetch’d is less likely to survive a turn once some ex or stage-two Pokémon are out on the field. They’re typically more effective during the initial few turns.

It can feel more effective when weaker Pokémon are attacking each other, instead of stronger ones that can easily deal closer to 100 damage. An easy way to get help with that is to include more than one copy in your deck. Again, healing isn’t that common of an effect during this first expansion.

The obvious choice is to switch out a tough Pokémon in hopes of one that’s easier to knock out. In the early turns, where there sometimes isn’t much on the field, you can also use it to take out a basic Pokémon that you know your opponent will want to evolve. Even when your opponent has a full bench of options, causing a switch like this is bound to be a hindrance to their game plan.</p><hr><p>Adding these cards to an incomplete deck is sure to round it out and give it some better legs to stand on.

<p>Marvel Rivals’ ambition is matched by its star-studded roster, list of iconic maps, and excitable community eager to play. However, one big question circling Marvel Rivals is if the shooter is free to play, or if you need to pay a fixed price to get your heroic groove on.</p>



<p>Fans of the MCU—and Marvel in general—can rest easy as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-release-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals release date</a> is nearly upon us. An ensemble shooter with a list of playable characters so almighty it’s enough to make your eyes water—I’m not crying, you are. Marvel Rivals takes the hero shooter literally by supplying a roster chock-full of some of the most notable superheroes and villains in media.</p>



<p>Several successful alpha and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-beta-surprises-players-with-thor-and-another-character/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beta tests</a> have set the scene, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-roadmap-reveals-new-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap</a> ahead is promising, and it’s nearly time to say “Action!” and let the chaos unfold. No doubt you want to play Marvel Rivals, so let’s see if greatness requires a gratuity.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-is-marvel-rivals">How Much is Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>There is a God, and I’m not talking about Thor. Credit to NetEase Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Marvel Rivals is a free-to-play</strong>, third-person shooter, meaning, <strong>you don’t have to pay a penny to play NetEase Games’ shooter</strong>—a free download and a stable internet connection are the only requirements.</p>



<p>The live-service model continues to be a trendsetter for many shooters and fellow online multiplayer platforms. It’s no surprise to see Marvel Rivals adopt the F2P formula with contemporaries such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-tests-avoid-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concord</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Suicide Squad</a> showing how a <em>paid</em>, live-service title can fail.</p>



<p>So, if you want to enjoy all Marvel Rivals has to offer without spending a single penny, you go right ahead. Of course, Rivals has an abundance of microtransactions and Season Passes filled with content for players who want to more out of the shooter, but it’s entirely optional.</p>



<p>Thankfully, every current character is available at launch, and according to the <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/news/20240821/40185_1174687.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official site</a>, “<strong>All heroes will be unlocked and free-to-play at launch and beyond</strong>, ensuring every player can fully immerse themselves in the experience of becoming their favorite Super Hero without any barriers!”</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-marvel-rivals-for-free">How to Play Marvel Rivals for Free</h2>



<p>Once Marvel Rivals releases, it’s likely all you have to do is go to your platform’s storefront, search for the game, and <strong>press to download it</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s sure to be as simple as this. Like Fortnite, Warzone, Overwatch 2, or any other free-to-play title, Marvel Rivals is a quick and easy download. Here are the steps you probably need to follow to download the Marvel shooter:</p>



<ol>
<li>Load up your PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, or PC.</li>



<li>Go to the PlayStation Store, Microsoft Store, or Steam.</li>



<li>Search for <strong>Marvel Rivals</strong>.</li>



<li>Once it’s live, press the download option.</li>



<li>Make sure you have room for the file size.</li>



<li>When it’s installed, press on Marvel Rivals to play for free!</li>
</ol>

<p>According to a new report, Sony and Kadokawa have been discussing a partnership for years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since Sony sent a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kadokawa-confirms-acquisition-talk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">letter of intent</a> to Kadokawa, the entire gaming community has been wondering whether this acquisition will go through, and now new information has come to light. According to a <span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-11-26/sony-s-pursuit-of-kadokawa-anime-looks-like-a-great-takeover-idea" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg report</a></span>, Sony and Kadokawa have been “testing the waters for a potential combination for years.” However, the issue seems to be the “degree of commitment.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the report states, Kadokawa wants Sony to acquire them completely or not purchase anything at all. On the other hand, Sony only wants ownership of assets related to anime and video games, which will help build their IP portfolio. The Kadokawa group has several game developers under its banner, including heavy hitters like FromSoftware, Spike Chunsoft, Gotcha Gotcha Games, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Sony is developing a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-developing-playstation-handheld-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation Handheld</a> that will rival the likes of Switch and Xbox. Also, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-sales-better-ps4-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 Pro sold better than the PlayStation 4 Pro</a> in the same period.

But where does Echoes of Wisdom fit in? After <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/character/zelda/en/history/index.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a recent update</a> from Nintendo itself, fans finally know.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a>, which flips the franchise's famous formula on its head by having Zelda as the playable character, is part of the ‘Hero is defeated’ timeline, a fork generated by the seminal Ocarina of Time if Ganon defeats Link. From there, Echoes of Wisdom takes place after the 2015 3DS game Tri Force Heroes, but before the very first Zelda game, released in 1986 for the NES.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ominously, Nintendo notes the “Decline of Hyrule Kingdom” that followed the events of Echoes of Wisdom, but came before the first Zelda. Here’s Nintendo’s official blurb on the game’s entry:</p><blockquote>The hero Link sets out to rescue Princess Zelda, who was captured by Ganon. Following a fierce battle, Link defeats Ganon, only to be swallowed up by an eerie rift. It was as if he'd been stolen away... All across Hyrule, more mysterious rifts are forming and taking the people of Hyrule away. Nobody is safe — not even the king himself and his advisers, who have also gone missing. Princess Zelda must set out on an adventure to save her father — the king of Hyrule — the people, and Link.</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/26/screenshot-2024-11-26-123857-1732626477149.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Echoes of Wisdom's place on the Zelda timeline is now official. Image credit: Nintendo.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This particular timeline fork ends with 1987’s side-scrolling The Adventure of Link, the direct sequel to the first Zelda game. The ‘Hero is Triumphant’ fork includes two timelines of its own: Link’s child and adult eras. The child era continues with the likes of Ocarina of Time follow-up Majora’s Mask, whereas the adult era includes Game Cube masterpiece Wind Waker. Still with us?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, that’s where we’re at for now. But does any of this matter? One person who doesn’t care about the Zelda chronology is producer Eiji Aonuma, who last year told IGN that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zelda-producer-eiji-aonuma-doesnt-really-care-about-the-series-chronology">overthinking the Zelda chronology could limit the development team's creativity and vision</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course there will be new Zelda games released, no doubt for Nintendo’s Switch successor, and we’ll have this timeline debate all over again. The question is, what’s the next Zelda game?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-moves-on-to-brand-new-the-legend-of-zelda-game-rules-out-tears-of-the-kingdom-dlc">Nintendo said it had no plans to release DLC for Tears of the Kingdom</a>, and confirmed it had moved on to a brand new game in the series. In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/news/202309/06314767.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Famitsu</u></a>, Aonuma left the door open to a return to the Hyrule of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, potentially setting up a third game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the first place, the reason I decided to make this a sequel to the previous work was because I thought there was value in experiencing a new game in that Hyrule place,” Aonuma said. “If that's the case, if a new reason arises, we might return to the same world again. Whether it's a sequel or a new work, I think it's going to be a completely new game, so I hope you're looking forward to it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/echoes-of-wisdom-now-has-a-place-on-the-official-zelda-timeline.1045530/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/echoes-of-wisdom-zelda-timeline<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has finally allocated a place for&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>on its sprawling and baffling&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>timeline, although one rather wonders if that constitutes wasted effort on the Japanese gaming giant's part.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-finally-places-echoes-of-wisdom-on-its-official-zelda-timeline" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>,&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>is now located just before the original 1986&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda</em>&nbsp;and just after&nbsp;<em>Tri-Force Heroes&nbsp;</em>on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/character/zelda/en/history/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official timeline</a>, which means that it takes place in the branch in which Link was defeated in&nbsp;<em>Ocarina of Time</em>.</p>

<p>In case you need reminding, the&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>timeline is unified until&nbsp;<em>Ocarina of Time</em>, at which point two divergent branches are created: one in which Link is defeated by Ganondorf and one in which he emerges victorious.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-timeline-beds.jpg?itok=zARfnUfm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-timeline-beds.jpg?itok=FfIUiNcH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>now has a place on the official&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>timeline.</figcaption></figure><p>The branch in which Link is triumphant has its own two branches, too: one set in Link's "child era" and one in his "adult era". The former gives rise to&nbsp;<em>Majora's Mask&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Twilight Princess</em>, while the latter leads to&nbsp;<em>The Wind Waker&nbsp;</em>and its DS sequels.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly where&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-wild" rel="nofollow">Breath of the Wild</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-kingdom" rel="nofollow">Tears of the Kingdom</a>&nbsp;</em>fit into the timeline...well, they don't. They're part of their own branch, one that's not connected to any previous&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>games.</p>

<p>I've never quite understood the appeal of creating an overarching&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>timeline. The series doesn't feel like it fits neatly into a chronology, and imposing a rigid timeline on things arguably makes it harder for fans to create fun theories, like the one that posits all&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>games are retellings of the same story.</p>

<p>Still, if you were wondering exactly where&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>fits into the broader <i>Zelda</i>...storyline, then now you know.</p>




<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>is the latest entry in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>series. It combines the top-down perspective of classic&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>games with the experimental systems-based style of&nbsp;<em>Breath of the Wild</em>.</p>

<p>Unlike previous&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>games, you'll play as Princess Zelda in this one, and you'll use Echoes to conjure everything from objects to monsters in order to help you solve freeform puzzles.</p>

<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>is available right now <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">exclusively on Nintendo Switch</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-codmas-event/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>CODMAS returns in 2024 with Black Ops 6 and Warzone, bringing all kinds of holiday gifts and surprises for players. Driving the holiday spirit, Treyarch have detailed what to expect in the CODMAS event, from the return of the Nuketown Holiday map to limited-time modes.</p>



<p>Here’s everything you need to know about the Warzone and Black Ops 6 CODMAS event, including its release date and expected content.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-codmas-event-in-black-ops-6-amp-warzone">When is CODMAS event in Black Ops 6 &amp; Warzone?</h2>



<p>The devs have not confirmed an official date for the Black Ops 6 CODMAS event yet, but if we look at last year’s release date for the event, we <strong>expect it to arrive mid-December</strong>, perhaps Tuesday the 17th. </p>



<p>The event is definitely arriving, as the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Weapons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6 Season 1 blog</a> confirmed its return alongside Nuketown Holiday, the Christmas-themed variant of the iconic map that’s set to arrive in the days leading up to CODMAS.</p>



<p>The previous year’s CODMAS event landed on December 19 and ended on January 3, so if that’s anything to go off, this year’s event will also last around 2 weeks as well. Keep in mind that this is just speculation, so take it with a pinch of salt. Treyarch will likely announce the event soon, so when they do, we’ll be sure to refresh this piece with the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-expected-content-for-codmas-in-bo6-amp-warzone">Expected content for CODMAS in BO6 &amp; Warzone</h2>

<ul>
<li>Event rewards</li>



<li>Limited-time modes</li>



<li>Themed maps</li>



<li>Store bundles</li>



<li>Warzone mode</li>
</ul>



<p>Similarly to last year’s CODMAS event, BO6 players can expect to see an in-game event panel with a variety of rewards for players to earn. These prizes will likely be cosmetic rewards like Charms, Calling Cards, Emblems, Weapon Blueprints, and maybe even an Operator skin. We also expect to see Holiday-themed Store bundles.</p>



<p>On top of tasty rewards, CODMAS will also bring themed maps and limited-time modes like last year’s Santa’s Slayground It’s unclear whether the mode will be completely new or just another iteration of last year’s. </p>



<p>Further, Warzone will likely also receive its own Christmas-themed mode, but players will hope that doesn’t mean the return of Krampus, who completely ruined the festivities a few years back by being an unstoppable killing force in lobbies.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/casey-hudson-humanoid-origin-closed-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ex-bioware-dev-casey-hudsons-studio-humanoid-origin-closes-down.1045515/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/casey-hudson-humanoid-origin-closed-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Humanoid Origin, the studio started by ex-BioWare staffer Casey Hudson, has closed down, citing "an unexpected shortfall of funding" that left the studio "unable to sustain operations".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/humanoid-origin_earlier-today-we-informed-our-staff-that-activity-7266889657370447874-9uwE/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LinkedIn post</a>, Humanoid Origin says that the closure happened despite its "efforts to shield the studio from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th" rel="nofollow">broader challenges in the industry</a>", and that the company is "heartbroken" it won't be able to complete its debut project.</p>

<p>The project in question was set to take place in a "new science-fiction universe", and while Hudson and Humanoid Origin never revealed what kind of game it would be, the studio's <a href="https://humanoidorigin.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>&nbsp;describes it as a "multi-platform AAA title focused on character-driven narrative". Sounds very familiar indeed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/casey-hudson-humanoid-origin-closure-mass-effect.jpg?itok=4I2uaIGN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/casey-hudson-humanoid-origin-closure-mass-effect.jpg?itok=sGPLRKBe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Casey Hudson is perhaps best known for his work as a director on the&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>series.</figcaption></figure><p>Humanoid Origin says that it's "committed to supporting [its team] in their transition to new employment", and that during the team's time together, it "achieved incredible progress", fostering "a culture of fun and creativity".</p>

<p>The studio is right when it points to the current time as one of tumult and difficulty for the gaming industry (or certain sections of it, at the very least).</p>

<p>Major studios like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Sony</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Take-Two</a> have laid off hundreds of staff members in recent times, and some studios, like&nbsp;<em>Saints Row&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-developer-volition" rel="nofollow">Volition</a> and&nbsp;<em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>outfit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">Piranha Bytes</a>, have been outright shut down.</p>

<p>Many game projects are being canceled as well; in recent months, we've seen the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-spinoff-project-t-canceled" rel="nofollow"><em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>spinoff Project T</a>, online action RPG&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blue-protocol-canceled-west-japan-service-ending" rel="nofollow"><em>Blue Protocol</em></a>, and an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-to-lay-off-5-of-its-workforce-amid-refocus-on-owned-ip-and-sports-games" rel="nofollow">unannounced&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>FPS</a> canceled (at least in the West, in <em>Blue Protocol</em>'s case), among others.</p>

We'll just have to wait and see, I suppose.</p>

Explore the natural landscapes of Colorado and Texas, alone or in a group, and hunt numerous animal species with the help of your faithful hunting dog.</p><p>With almost 10 years’ expertise in hunting games, developer NACON Studio Ghent intends to offer fans of the genre an authentic hunting experience with this third opus. Thanks to feedback from the community, which numbered over one million players on the two previous titles, NACON Studio Ghent has retained the foundations that have made the series such a success, while introducing a number of new features and gameplay improvements. Among these, <em>Hunting Simulator 3</em> introduces an all-new dynamic system, “SimFauna,” which faithfully reproduces animal behavior, allowing players’ actions to have a real impact on animals and the environment.</p><p>In addition to improved hunting dog behavior and sound design, and the addition of vehicles, the game features realistic, natural open-world environments thanks to Unreal Engine 5. Players can hunt over 40 species of animal, using hunting equipment from renowned brands such as Beretta, Winchester, Browning, and many others.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>'s next season is named Dual Destiny, and will kick off next week on Tuesday 3rd December. 
</p>
<p>
Its logo features obvious black and white-themed branding, which should perhaps not be a surprise considering Pokémon Black and White region Unova is next on the docket to be featured in the game's Go Tour event series. Dual Destiny finishes on 4th March, around the time we'd expected Go Tour Unova to be held.
</p>
<p>
So, why "Dual Destiny"? In a press briefing, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/niantic">Niantic</a> said the name was designed to reflect "opposites coming together to strengthen one another and celebrate two sides of a whole", which is nice.
</p>
<p>
In terms of content, much of what is to come will be announced over the coming days, but perhaps the headline for now is the early introduction of teacup Pokémon Sinistea. This fits the Dual Destiny branding as it has two different types - Antique and Phony - depending on whether it comes with a stamp of authenticity. (Maybe it should have been called Authencitea?)
</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with Sinistea - a Ghost-type Pokémon that debuted in Pokémon Sword and Shield - it looks like a small chipped teacup. Its Pokédex entry describes it thus: "The soul of someone who died alone possessed some leftover tea." It evolves into Polteageist: "The tea that composes Polteageist's body has a distinct and enjoyable flavor. Drinking too much, however, can be fatal."</p>
<p>
From the start of the season, Red and Blue-striped Basculin will now be Shiny-possible and available in 7km eggs. Oddly, though, the form you obtain will relate to where the gift is <em>hatched</em>, not from where it was sent. (Here in the UK, you'll obtain Blue Basculin while on the West side of the Prime Meridian line, and Red Basculin on the East.)
</p>
<p>
Gigantamax Lapras will also make its debut in Max Battles, while Go Battle League will feature avatar items based on Unova Elite Four member Grimsley. Dragalge, Bibarel, Glliscor, Starmie and others will receive additional moves.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rift-of-the-necrodancer-pc-release-date-revealed-alongside-delay.1045482/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rift-of-necrodancer-pc-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Klei and developers Brace Yourself and Tic Toc have announced the&nbsp;<em>Rift of the NecroDancer&nbsp;</em>release date, although it's probably a little later than you might have expected or hoped for.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2073250/view/4489618994289967161" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on Steam</a>,&nbsp;<em>Rift of the NecroDancer&nbsp;</em>will launch on PC on February 5th, but Brace Yourself says it's "decoupling" the Steam launch from the game's console release, which will now happen "at a later date" that's yet to be determined.</p>

<p>According to Brace Yourself, the delay is down to the team not wanting to cut any of&nbsp;<em>Rift of the NecroDancer</em>'s features to make a 2024 release, and the console delay is so that the team has "a little more time" to polish the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rift-of-the-necrodancer-release-date-gameplay.jpg?itok=9jLY_Dyq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rift-of-the-necrodancer-release-date-gameplay.jpg?itok=QCN9ve0E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Rift of the NecroDancer&nbsp;</em>will now be launching in 2025.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as announcing the new release date (and, by extension, the delay), Brace Yourself also reveals what it's been working on in the last year or so, with many of the features mentioned seemingly contributing to the game's delay.</p>

<p>These features include an extra "Impossible" difficulty level, as well as more Rhythm Rift beat maps, additional readability for monsters that land off the beat, and tools to implement custom music.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to enjoy a Remix Mode that "throws a fresh chart your way every playthrough", as well as better tutorials and practice mode gameplay, more animation clarity, and a revamp of the story mode. In short,&nbsp;<em>Rift of the NecroDancer</em>'s devs are using the extra time wisely, it seems.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Rift of the NecroDancer</em>, it's a&nbsp;rhythm spinoff of Brace Yourself's roguelike&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/crypt-of-necrodancer" rel="nofollow"><em>Crypt of the NecroDancer</em></a>. Though the game will feature many of the same characters as&nbsp;<em>Crypt</em>, it has its own gameplay style that's more indebted to games like Harmonix's&nbsp;<em>Frequency&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Amplitude</em>.</p>

<p>The game is set to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2073250/Rift_of_the_NecroDancer/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> on February 5th, with a console release to follow sometime after.</p>

            <p>Video games in general have a surplus of weapons. It's gotten to the point that if I had any freelance budget, I'd commission somebody to count them up. Just give me an approximate running total for the industry at large, so that whenever next a shiny-eyed producer regales me with the prospect of enchanted lazurite rapiers at a preview event, I can quietly ask how many enchanted lazurite rapiers we're talking about, then open my laptop and generate a scrolling image akin to those <a href="https://mr21.github.io/space-object-comparison/#earth,moon">comparison pages for stars and planets</a> - a cosmic mountain of points and pommels, with the new game's armoury forming a pixel-wide foothill in the bottom left corner. "Are there not enough enchanted lazurite rapiers," I will kindly enquire, as the producer sobs brokenly into my shoulder.</p><!--more-->
<p>In the absence of an artform-wide disarmament project, with shame-faced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> adventurers handing over their runic heirlooms to local constables, games could at least teach their players to think more about each individual weapon: its design and history, how it fits into some on-going story. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bladesong">Bladesong</a> seems helpful on that front. It's a blacksmithing game where you make swords to play out the tale of a mighty fortress, "one of mankind's last remaining bastions after the gods have banished themselves".</p>

<p>It doesn't <em>look</em> a lot like blacksmithing, mind you. It's a spotlit model-editing garage that burgeons with icons, fields and sliders for things like "distal taper" and "flamboyance". There is minimal hammering, as far as I can see. No actual in-game singing either, despite the title. I feel like there genuinely are blacksmiths who sing to their creations, to regulate the rhythm of their strokes. I guess you can always sing at the screen if it helps with your APM.</p><p> If you dislike crafting screens in video games, this is your worst nightmare. But I'm already enjoying both the nerdy extravagance of options, and the accompanying requirement to meet specific buyer requests that factor into the aforesaid narrative. Somebody needs a lightweight training sword - perhaps they're a juvenile Chosen One embarking on that very first tutorial rat hunt. Somebody else wants a blade that's hefty and not too long, so that they can slash with it in tight spaces - perhaps this particular individual is a city guard who patrols a lot of narrow alleyways. Somebody else just wants a shitload of pretentious glowing sigils. He's likely a witcher.</p>
<p>It'd be nice if we had the option of deliberately failing commissions and saddling people we dislike with minimally hardened or heat-treated swords. A few days later, there's a story in the papers about some git noble splintering his bejewelled katana against a peasant's scythe while trying to collect taxes. </p>
<p>Sadly, the Steam page doesn't give much sense of the story and how much control you have over it. The morsels I sponge from the trailer suggest that there's a lot of text, but it's tersely phrased. Makes sense - there's no room for roundabout adjectives when you're commissioning weapons. It would be like making a rapier out of lazurite. Lazurite, incidentally, is a tectosilicate mineral often used in painting. I don't speak from any experience, but you probably shouldn't try to make a sword out of the stuff.</p>
<p>Bladesong will have a public playtest from 4th-13th December. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305640/Bladesong/">You can sign up on the Steam page</a>. In the shorter term, I welcome any recommendations for other games in which you largely just make weapons for people. I know there are a few.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Improvements to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> patch for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> are still not ready, despite Remedy today releasing a new update for the game across all platforms.</p>
<p>As with a handful of games, playing Alan Wake 2 on Sony's more powerful console results in performance issues, which players are waiting to be patched.</p>
<p>"The PlayStation 5 update (1.200.005) does not contain anything PlayStation 5 Pro specific, but we wanted to acknowledge that we are seeing your feedback," wrote Remedy in a post on X. "We are still researching a few things on the Pro when it comes to improved performance. We'll keep you posted. As PS5 Pro support was a work of many months, it will take the team longer than a few weeks for changes and improvements. Thank you for understanding!"</p>

<p>Still, the <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-2-update-notes/">new patch</a> does include a number of improvements and fixes. For instance, Alan's hair now gets messier and when using the Classic Outfit it gets "properly soaked". He also now wears his wedding ring - bit awkward that.</p><p>Other changes include collectibles from DLC The Lake House appearing in Saga's Mind Place; the Night Springs theme is available in the Writer's Room after finishing any Night Springs chapter in the main campaign; gyro controls have been improved; and the "Thrower" enemies are less frustrating thanks to less frequent movement and teleportation.</p>

<p>Ahead of the PS5 Pro's release, Remedy released a detailed blog post explaining all the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-ps5-pro-enhanced-label-will-see-30fps-quality-mode-with-added-ray-tracing">improvements the Enhanced label would bring</a>. That included a 30fps and 4K Quality Mode with added ray tracing, and a 4K Performance Mode at 60fps.</p>

			<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> with several bugs and issues, which GSC Game World, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-has-already-sold-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrating</a> the million units sold milestone, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-team-outlines-next-fixes-crashes-bugs-weapon-price-adjustments-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> to resolve.</p>
<p>One of the main features that need care is the so-called A-Life AI and spawn system. While we wait to see if the developer will be able to fix it with an official patch, modder ConnerRia <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/210" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a mod called The Roadside Panic that aims to greatly improve the lively feeling of the Zone - although it might just kill your game's frame rate in the process. Here's the official overview from the mod's description:</p>
<p><em>This mod restores the chaotic dynamism of the old STALKER games. It also murders your frame rate, so you can enjoy the authentic 30fps 2007 Shadow Of Chernobyl gameplay experience.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Unleashes the full potential of online A-Life</em></li>
<li><em>Heavily mitigates cases of enemies appearing out of thin air right behind you, like in that Reddit clip of the military base everyone keeps talking about</em></li>
<li><em>Significant extension of the A-Life range. NPC and NPC interactions can be seen and heard from afar.</em></li>
<li><em>Different factions will fight for territory at POIs.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>How Did You Fix "A-Life"?</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Duct-tape. The AI director in STALKER 2 is actually very complex internally, however its function is gimped because of severe bugs compounding each other. I troubleshooted the present bugs to the extent of my ability and duct-taped a solution to coax the A-Life system into working around its own field of anomalies, so to speak. However, a couple of other issues with the A-Life system are breaking it and causing not only janky behavior but also flat-out non-existent A-Life simulation.</em></p>
<p><em>This mod should prevent or at least mitigate abrupt spawns and it will also deliver immersive A-Life interactions such as NPC-NPC firefights, of course.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>What's The Catch?</em></strong><br>
<em><strong>Performance.</strong> This mod will slaughter your frames in an already unoptimized game. A top-of-the-line CPU is recommended.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Persisting Spawn Issues.</strong> As said before, the director is broken, and all a-life cfg tweaks are doing is finding brute-force methods to circumvent said issues to get more spawns and world events.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Roadside Panic - Stalker 2 A-Life Demonstration" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e472boNXfIs?start=4&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With this mod, you can pick between three download options. The first, Roadside Panic, works at a radius of 800 meters but keeps the squad density of STALKER 2 as-is. The second, called Roadside Panic Lite, works in a 250-meter radius to mitigate bugs. If you're feeling really brave, though, the option for you is Roadside Panic, which works in an 800-meter radius but also cranks up the spawns a lot.</p>
<p>If you opt to try Roadside Panic, let us know in the comments about your experience.</p>

			<p>The development of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vice-city-nextgen-edition-footage-system-requirements/">Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nextgen Edition</a> mod is almost complete, and the unofficial remaster should be released before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Together with launching a new story-focused trailer, which doesn't feature interior lighting that will be added to the final version of the mod, Revolution Team confirmed that development is 95% complete and is now at the final testing stage. The developer discovered some unforeseen bugs that require fixing, so the mod's release may slip to January 2025, as they want to release the most functional version of the mod possible. Still, they are doing everything they can to get the Nextgen Edition of one of the best entries in the series out before the end of the year.</p>
<p><iframe title="GTA Vice City Nextgen Edition | Story Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZJ9NHFuafDU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nextgen Edition mod has been in the works for some time, so it's definitely good to hear that development is almost over, as it is setting out to be one of the best ways to experience the classic open-world game developed by Rockstar Games complete with visuals and gameplay enhancements.</p>
<p>Those who cannot play Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nextgen Edition are still able to experience a remastered version of the game with the GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition remasters. The compilation was updated <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-trilogy-definitive-edition-patch-classic-lighting-mode/">earlier this month</a> with some enhancements only available for the mobile version of the compilation up until this month that address some of the issues of the PC and console release. You can learn more about it and the issues that plagued it at launch in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition/">review.</a></p>

		<p><em>On Monday, F1 and General Motors announced that they had agreed that GM would join the F1 grid as a brand new team, a surprising turn of events given that a nearly identical pitch involving GM and the Andretti Global racing organization was rejected back in January of this year. It’s the kind of opaque political maneuvering that makes F1 so irresistible to me, and as I was researching the topic <u>for </u></em><a href="https://www.patreon.com/shiftf1?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer"><em><u>Shift</u></em></a><em><u>+F1</u> </em>prior to recording<em>, I ended up writing out why I think things turned out this way… and why I think F1 might end up regretting making General Motors so central to this expansion.</em></p><p>After stonewalling Andretti Global's attempts to enter Formula 1 racing for over two years, the sport is now <a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/statement-on-general-motors-application-to-join-fia-formula-one-world.69uoRF1uwHwXkr4efkpnhc?ref=remapradio.com"><u>welcoming General Motors</u></a> into the sport as the 11th team on the grid for 2026. In light of the fact that this is substantively be the same Andretti bid that F1’s leadership rejected before, it’s worth wondering whether the value of the GM and Cadillac badges was the decisive factor for F1 leadership, or if it was removing the liability of the Andretti connection.</p><p>The argument from F1’s chieftains has always been that, if the sport was going to grant a highly-coveted new spot on its grid to a new team, the team needed to come in as a serious contender and bring real value to the sport. They wanted a high-quality “works” team, one that has the technical and manufacturing wherewithal to produce an entire Formula 1 machine from end-to-end, especially the complicated and ruinously expensive power units. The fact that Andretti’s bid was bolstered by a promise to partner with GM wasn’t sufficient for the opposition that had gathered to Andretti’s efforts. The Andretti F1 car would be sourcing its engine from another supplier (at least at the outset), like most of the current F1 grid, and there was wariness about how seriously GM was in its intentions to take an active role in its partnership with Andretti.</p><figure></figure><p>Behind that reasoning was a blatant distaste toward Andretti Autosport, and particularly toward the Andrettis themselves. Mario Andretti might be a living legend who won races with just about every kind of machinery he ever touched, but he is not quite as beloved figure in F1 as he in the United States… and his son Michael’s reputation in the sport <a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/motorsports/a25684703/michael-andretti-f1-1993/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>was marred by his grim stint at McLaren</u></a> prior to being replaced by Mika Hakkinen. Yet it was the way he came across as owner and executive at his motorsports company that truly turned the sport against him.</p><p>Something about the way Michael Andretti <a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/why-f1-and-teams-are-still-not-impressed-by-andrettis-new-team-plans/10418580/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>lobbied to secure support for his team’s bid</u></a> was off-putting to the leadership of the F1 grid. In many ways, the response to Andretti was anachronistic, like the Andrettis were <em>nouveau riche </em>Americans of the 19th century, hunting for a place in European society.&nbsp;</p><p>Except it might not be quite as easy to reduce it to a simple matter of bluff, assertive Americans repelling the reserved Europeans they set out to charm. Zak Brown has led McLaren for a decade, Otmar Szafnauer was a well-regarded team principle (though I have always suspected his stock was likewise diminished by his very midwestern lack of pretension, which seems like it was not what board room “alpha” wannabes like Lawrence Stroll and Laurent Rossi wanted from a direct report). Rather than coming across as respectful or considerate, Andretti's attempts to persuade other team owners to welcome his efforts to join the F1 grid, he seems to have struck his peers as presumptuous and manipulative.</p><p>More important than Andretti’s initial unctuousness was the way the organization was also desperately bargain-hunting. Andretti was willing to pay <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/200m-andretti-plans-f1-entry/10303590/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>an anti-dilution fee</u></a> of $200M to the other teams on the F1 grid to make up for the fact a ten way revenue split would become an eleven way split, but the fee was seen as too small in light of the current value of a spot on the F1 grid (the fact that owner Liberty Media’s takes half the sport’s revenue off the top and teams would end up losing money if the sport’s health and popularity draws more entrants is another topic for another day).&nbsp;</p><p>Andretti may also have erred critically by soliciting, or maybe just having the misfortune receive, <a href="https://www.skysports.com/f1/news/12433/12979350/andretti-fia-president-mohammed-ben-sulayem-confident-formula-1-will-approve-new-team?ref=remapradio.com"><u>the blessing of the FIA and its increasingly unpopular chairman</u></a> Mohamed Ben Sulayem. After a misfiring charm offensive, it would not be surprising if F1’s leadership was thoroughly alienated by Andretti’s efforts with the FIA and then with the press to paint the other F1 teams as acting out of <a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/andretti-says-greed-is-behind-f1-negativity-of-entry-plans/10419099/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>pure greed and bad faith</u></a>, a charge which attracted warnings of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-republican-jim-jordan-f1-investigation-andretti-us-rcna151103?ref=remapradio.com"><u>an anti-trust investigation</u></a> from Congress.</p>

<p>The bulk of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6’s marketing features The Replacer. The bearded character appears in various BLOPS 6 trailers and spoofs, but his origins are confusing to many—so let’s tell you everything you need to know about The Replacer.</p>



<p>Treyarch brought back the iconic character for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>—marking the first time The Replacer has been seen since Black Ops 4. The character has been used in various pre-release trailers, depicted as a replacement for real people in everyday life.</p>



<p>The Replacer’s face has become synonymous with CoD, and I’m here to dive into who he is, the actor behind the role, and more.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-is-the-replacer-character-in-black-ops-6">Who is The Replacer Character in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Irreplaceable. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Replacer is a fictional character created specifically for the Call of Duty universe and was first seen in Black Ops 2.</strong></p>



<p>With CoD’s reputation continuing to grow and its popularity soaring at an unfathomable rate, The Replacer debuted in a marketing trailer to hype up new BLOPS 2 content. In the video, The Replacer steps into the shoes of normal people going about their day to “replace” them, allowing the person to enjoy Black Ops 2 instead.</p>



<p>The hot reception for The Replacer resulted in the persona returning for Black Ops 3, and Black Ops 4, and they have returned for 2024’s Black Ops 6. Again, following the same ideology; players desperate to play Black Ops 6 can call upon his services to step in and fulfill their day-to-day duties.</p>

            <p>
PlayStation is celebrating its upcoming 30th Anniversary by letting you sit on its logo while riding the Victoria Line.
</p>
<p>
The marketing stunt is the first time in over 25 years that Transport for London has allowed a brand to advertise on its Tube seats. It's also probably the first time in over 25 years that TFL has actually put in new Tube seats.
</p>
<p>
Sony's design includes the classic Circle, Square, Cross and Triangle buttons emblazoned across the Tube's usual moquette seat cushions. (Today I learned that the correct name for this type of fabric is indeed "moquette". Impress your friends.)
</p>
<p>
Here's how it all looks:

<p>
Somewhat oddly, PlayStation has also suggested people should kiss while sat on these seats. I will continue staring at the ground trying to ignore everyone else as normal, but thank you anyway Sony.

Keen to spot the PlayStation Tube branding for yourself? You might find it more difficult than it first appears. Reading further, it seems like just one carriage on the Victoria Line has been given the PlayStation spruce-up. With 36 trains operating per hour, that might take a while to find.
</p><p>
This isn't the first time PlayStation has teamed up with TFL. Back in 2020, Sony took over the Tube signs outside Oxford Circus by replacing those with the Circle, Square, Cross and Triangle designs to promote the launch of PS5. Finding these signs was easier than finding an actual PS5 at the time.

And before that, PlayStation memorably stuck its favourite buttons up on London's Oxo Tower back in 2013, to celebrate the launch of PS4.

PlayStation celebrates its 30th anniversary next week, on Tuesday 3rd December, when it will have been three decades since the launch of the original PS1 in Japan. Eurogamer will be marking the occaison here too - stay in your PlayStation-branded seats for much more.
</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-prepping-playstation-5-portable-plans-to-battle-nintendos-handheld-dominance">Sony is quietly prepping plans to re-enter the handheld gaming market with a portable PS5</a> that's set to rival <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Callisto Protocol PS5 Pro patch greatly enhanced image quality and performance while also introducing an 8K resolution mode that delivers a visual experience without compromise, according to a new analysis of the patch.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vez2JZxDYSg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weekly podcast</a>, Digital Foundry provided their own analysis of the PS5 Pro patch released for Striking Distance's game, highlighting how the patch improves Performance Mode considerably by adding the ray tracing features only available in Quality Mode on the base model while maintaining a solid 60 FPS framerate. This is seemingly achieved by lowering the resolution, as on the mid-generation console, the pixel count hits 1440p and 1296p in areas where it is higher on the base model's Performance mode, although the image is definitely sharper on the new system. In addition, the game also achieves better performance on the new PlayStation 5 model by using TAAU instead of AMD FSR 2 or PSSR, as the artifacts that indicate that either are being used are nowhere to be seen. As such, it is not clear if Striking Distance simply used the additional GPU power of the system to brute force these improvements in some ways or had access to the PS5 Po exclusive features that can only be used with more recent SDK versions.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry also examined the 8K mode introduced in The Callisto Protocol with the PS5 Pro patch. This mode is not as impressive as the No Man's Sky 8K mode, as it features a slightly sharper image than the 4K resolution mode and not much else. As such, Digital Foundry theorizes that this mode employs a dynamic resolution range that hits up to 6K and then upscales the image to 8K.</p>
