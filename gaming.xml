                <p>During the early stages of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dune-awakening/" data-ref-id="5000-570883">Dune: Awakening</a>, you'll be tasked with acquiring a few basic resources that will serve as the foundation of your character's gear and base items. Some of these resources include Granite, Plant Fiber, and Salvaged Metal. You'll also be asked to add some Fuel Cells to your inventory, as those are what you use to power anything electronic in Dune: Awakening.</p><p>When it comes to Granite and Plant Fiber, you'll have no issues whatsoever finding either of those resources, as they're as abundant as the sand on Arrakis. However, Salvaged Metal and Fuel Cells take a little more searching to find. Below, you can see exactly how to get Salvaged Metal and Fuel Cells for all of your early game needs in Dune: Awakening.</p><h2>Where to find Salvaged Metal in Dune: Awakening</h2><p>Out of the two resources, Salvaged Metal is the easier one to find. One of your first missions in Dune: Awakening requires you to find 250 of the resource, though, which isn't so easy.</p><p>Salvaged Metal can be looted as a single item all around the starting area of Dune: Awakening. It looks like a small metal box that's usually lying on the sand near rocky formations. Of course, while you can pick up a few of these pieces, that's not going to get you nearly close to the amount you need.</p><p>The best way to acquire Salvaged Metal in large quantities is by raiding scavenger camps in the starting region of the game. All around you are small camps, either inside moisture-sealed caves or underneath some rocky cover, that can be looted for solid amounts of Salvaged Metal. Of course, these camps aren't unoccupied, so you'll have to kill scavengers to get your hands on the resource.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507822-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-14.01.40.69.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507822" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507822-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-14.01.40.69.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507822"></a><figcaption>Scavenger camps are the best way to acquire Salvaged Metal in the early game</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507822-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-14.01.40.69.png"></figure><p>When you're looting a camp, you can find the singular pieces of Salvaged Metal on the ground, but you can also cut open larger pieces of it using your Cutteray. This is the same item you use to cut open Granite Stone boulders, Copper Ore, etc. Scan large pieces of metal with a yellow icon above them, cut where the blue mark is, and you'll loot roughly 40-60 pieces of Salvaged Metal.</p><p>You can also find these large metal pieces out in the world next to singular pieces, but they're far more common to find at camps. Salvaged Metal can be looted in chests at camps as well, but those chests usually have rarer items inside them. You might even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-best-ways-to-get-blood-and-water/1100-6532157/" data-ref-id="1100-6532157">find some water</a> in these chests, which is as valuable an item as you can have in Dune: Awakening.</p><p>To find a scavenger camp, just open your map and zoom in. Hover over all of the icons to see which ones are camps. You can discover every camp for yourself by eventually crafting a Survey Probe in Dune: Awakening, but that only comes after you make Copper Ingots at a Fabricator inside your base once you complete your first trial mission.</p><h2>Where to find Fuel Cells in Dune: Awakening</h2><p>Unfortunately, Fuel Cells are often located in the same areas as Salvaged Metal, but they're found in far fewer numbers. Fuel Cells look like small, rectangular cartridges on the ground, and you can often find them lying right next to Salvaged Metal pieces.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507821-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-15.02.34.15.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507821" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507821-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-15.02.34.15.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507821"></a><figcaption>A Fuel Cell lying on the floor of a scavenger camp</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507821-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-15.02.34.15.png"></figure><p>Instead of looking on the ground for Fuel Cells, though, you want to find scavenger camps with chests in them. Chests have a high chance of containing Fuel Cells and other rarer items, so looting them is one of the most consistent ways to acquire the resource.</p><p>To make your Fuel Cell farming process even better, chests at camps, as well as all world resources, are on a respawn timer in Dune: Awakening. After one in-game day, every item, enemy, resource, and chest in the world and at camps will respawn, allowing you to loot everything over again. If you find a route with plenty of scavenger camps on it, you can make a few runs within a couple of hours and stock up on every resource you might need.</p><p>Scavenger camps and world looting aren't the only ways to acquire Fuel Cells, though. You can also head up to trader camps, like the one at the Griffin Research Tradepost, and purchase Fuel Cells for money. While this isn't the most efficient way to acquire the resource, spending 50 Solari per Fuel Cell isn't a bad fee if you need them in a pinch.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507820-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-20.39.33.36.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507820" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507820-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-20.39.33.36.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507820"></a><figcaption>Fuel Cells on sale for 50 Solari in Dune: Awakening</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507820-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-20.39.33.36.png"></figure><p>As you progress in Dune: Awakening, you'll find more trader camps and more ways of acquiring both Fuel Cells and Salvaged Metal. However, for the early game, stick to scavenger camps, traders, and simple world looting.</p><p>If you're playing Dune: Awakening on PC, you're probably experiencing some performance issues, so make sure to check out our guide on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-pc-settings-for-dune-awakening-to-remove-stutters-and-improve-fps/1100-6532153/" data-ref-id="1100-6532153">best PC settings to improve FPS and reduce stutters</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Numbers skin was part of the "Frank Woods Operator Pack," which was a preorder bonus given out to those who preordered the digital or Vault edition of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. The Numbers skin featured Woods surrounded by glowing red numbers, but it appears a bug from the recent update caused his entire body to have an intense glow.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer says this is just a temporary removal. Players who try to use the Numbers skin during this time will spawn in as the default Woods skin instead. This is an ongoing investigation, so there's currently no date given for when the skin will return. The Season 4 update had a rough launch, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-season-4-update-broke-multiplayer-lobbies-in-this-one-way-activision-investigating/1100-6531959/">buggy multiplayer lobbies</a> and Warzone server issues.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, Call of Duty features a crossover event with the Ballerina movie, which is part of the John Wick universe.

            <p>The annual cascade of Summer Game Fest broadcasts formally begins tonight with the Opening Showcase at 10pm UK time (11pm CEST/5pm EDT/2pm PDT). We'll report all of the major announcements from it here, as they happen, while also chatting with you. So grab a tea or a coffee, or something harder if you like, and join us for the show.</p>
<p>Tonight's Opening Showcase is expected to be a long one with a projected runtime of around two hours. It'll be hosted by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>, as ever, although he'll be joined this year by friend-of-Eurogamer Lucy James, which is nice. You'll know her from GameSpot.</p>
<p>Keighley has kept a tight lid on announcements for tonight, although a couple of <a href="https://x.com/summergamefest/status/1930630371760361955">promo reels for the show</a> have included footage from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, new James Bond game 007: First Light, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, and a bunch of other games I don't immediately recognise. There's also been an uptick in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-just-got-a-sneaky-teaser-by-capcom-fans-believe">Resident Evil 9 speculation</a> ahead of the show, suggesting a possible unveiling tonight. Wouldn't that be nice?</p>

<p>This week's gaming festivities were kicked off on Wednesday by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-everything-announced">a PlayStation State of Play broadcast</a>, which unveiled 007: First Light to the world, resurrected Capcom's lost-in-development Pragmata, debuted Silent Hill F, revealed a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lumines">Lumines</a> game, and more.</p>
<p>Tonight's Opening Showcase will be followed directly by Day of the Devs, and then by a packed weekend of broadcasts including an Xbox Showcase on Sunday at 6pm UK time. I'll return to live-report that show. We've compiled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams#section-7">a full Summer Games Fest 2025 schedule</a> elsewhere on the site.</p>
<p>Join us shortly before 10pm UK time for the show. In the meantime, speculate away - what would you like to see?</p><div data-live="true">

Good afternoon! Here we go, then. This is the big one. There should at least be an announcement or two in here to get excited about. Ian Higton just made a good point while asking what the rooster or chicken was about in the headline image, to which I said "I don't know" because I didn't put it there - the Summer Games Fest Twitter/X account did. Could it be a nod to Fable 4?

		<p>Merry Switchmas, one and all. The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> came out yesterday, so there’s been a burst of activity here, as those of us who have the latest Nintendo console in hand have got to playing a whole bunch of Mario Kart World, and checking out all the other games, new and old, that are on the system.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has been the most-played game of mine on Switch 2, I’ve been bouncing back and forth between what feels like countless other games. I’m having to write down and keep track what I’m playing for the purposes of comparisons back to last gen.</p>
<p><strong>Dom’s</strong> been doing the same. alongside Mario Kart World, he’s quickly spun out reviews of the excellent anti-grav racer Fast Fusion, ran through Welcome Tour, and gave a middling review of “the game of waiting for the delivery person on Thursday.”</p>

<p><strong>Jason</strong> has not been playing Switch 2, “because nobody bought me one, very rude”, and since he doesn’t feel like sharing beyond that, we’ll move right along to Gamoc, who finished Split Fiction with his sister last night, “which is still mechanically brilliant, though it’s story doesn’t do as well.” There’s also been Baldur’s Gate 3, Warhammer 40K Rogue Trader, and the newly launched Atomfall DLC for a review sometime soon.</p>

<p><strong>Aran’s</strong> been working on Tainted Grail The Fall of Avalon for a review coming next week, while <strong>Ade’s</strong> had The Alters on the go for review as well.</p>
<p>Digging back through Resident Evil, <strong>Jim</strong> played through the Shadows of Rose DLC for Resident Evil Village, “which offers a bizarre detour from the main game that supposedly sets up the next arc in the series.” He found it quite unsettling at times with the creepy mannequins. He also played some of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/nioh-3-preview-team-ninjas-answer-to-elden-ring/">Nioh 3 demo</a>, which is a big evolution over past games, taking a bit of inspiration from Elden Ring.</p>
<p>As is tradition, <strong>Steve</strong> has been playing many, many demos and will have a recommendation post up ready for the start of Next Fest. He also hopes to be joining the Switch 2-athon later today, but what else has he played? “I also enjoyed rattling through Spray Paint Simulator on Game Pass before making the perhaps unwise decision to start Metaphor: ReFantazio as if I have time for another huge JRPG at the moment..</p>

<p>Another Switch acolyte is <strong>Nic</strong>, but for him Mario Kart has been joined by Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster, and there’s Magic: The Gathering, of course.</p>
<p>There’s no Switch 2 for <strong>Miguel</strong>, but he’s played a few games that are on it, namely Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/05/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-review/">Fantasy Life i</a>, joining those with Zenless Zone Zero and Elden Ring Nightrein.</p>

<p>And finally,&nbsp;<strong>Tuffcub</strong> has made a start on our Death Stranding 2 review. That’s all he can say for now…</p>
<p>But what have you been playing this week?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/genshin-impact-version-5-7-brings-skirk-and-more-later-this-month.1209342/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-57-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.7, with the latest update for the gacha action RPG arriving later this month and bringing new characters, plus new story and more, with it.</p>

<p>Just like with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-56" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-5-5-release-date" rel="nofollow">updates</a>, you can expect this one to introduce new story for you to experience, including a continuation of the Archon Quest, which will introduce a "new unrest" brewing between the Traveler twins.</p>

<p>Perhaps more exciting, however, is the debut of Skirk, Childe's "enigmatic master" and a unique 5-star fighter. She wields "Abyssal power camouflaged as Cryo", according to HoYoverse, and she can switch between two combat styles for a choice of burst damage or more sustained output.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.7-release-date-skirk.jpg?itok=Exiy-O2t 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.7-release-date-skirk.jpg?itok=LVBHveh7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Skirk finally joins the fray in&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.7.</figcaption></figure><p>Rather than Elemental Energy, Skirk will use a unique resource called Serpent's Subtlety, which only she can generate. Both of her combat modes will use that resource for their abilities. She can also buff Hydro and Cryo users, buffing herself in the process.</p>

<p>Skirk isn't the only character joining the roster for&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.7, however. Also entering the fray in this update is Dahlia, a 4-star Hydro-wielding support fighter who can shield his allies and boost their stats.</p>

<p>Skirk and Dahlia will feature in the first half of the update's Event Wishes, alongside a rerun of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/genshin-impact-shenhe-build-guide" rel="nofollow">Shenhe</a>. The second half, meanwhile, will play host to reruns of Mavuika and Emilie, so look out for them if you didn't add them to your team the first time around.</p>




<p>If you're a returning customer to&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>updates, then you probably know what's next. That's right: it's time for some juicy codes. Here are this update cycle's goodies! Remember to put these in without the colons at the end of the codes.</p>

<ul><li>MasterSkirk0618: 100 Primogems, 10 Mystic Enhancement Ore</li>
	<li>YourSpaceTime: 100 Primogems, 5 Hero's Wit</li>
	<li>VoidStar0618: 100 Primogems, 50,000 Mora</li>
</ul><p><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>is available to play right now for free on <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation, Xbox Series X|S, and mobile devices</a>. Version 5.7 lands on June 18th.</p>

            <p>You might have seen a new name around the homepage this past week: Mark Warren. It might also be that you recognise the name if you're a reader of RPS sibling site VG247, where Mark has already been plying his trade for several years. Well, we've adopted Mark here at RPS, as one might adopt a puppy if the puppy really liked mods, RPGs and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>. Come say hello in the comments.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Mark joined VG247 back in 2023, and since then he's written news, features and reviews that would have all sat comfortably on our own pages. He's <a href="https://www.vg247.com/the-sims-4-25-anniversary-house-build-existential-dread">had a breakdown about his lack of interior design skills in The Sims</a>, braved <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-tv-show-fallout-community-feature">talking to the Fallout community</a>, interviewed developers behind one of <a href="https://www.vg247.com/summer-eternal-studio-ex-disco-elysium-expectations-interview">the half-dozen Disco Elysium spiritual successors</a>, and <a href="https://www.vg247.com/mlb-the-show-24-extra-seinfeld-series-we-never-knew-we-needed">built a baseball team made entirely of George Costanzas</a>. He's also, yeah, written a lot about Helldivers 2, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-battle-for-super-earth-makes-chinese-news-following-the-successful-and-slightly-review-bomby-defense-of-equality-on-sea">three</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-follows-up-the-battle-for-super-earth-automaton-fighting-because-bots-waiting-in-big-invasion-queue">posts</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-next-gear-drop-includes-judge-dredd-style-armour-just-in-case-you-want-to-be-the-law">for us</a> this week alone, so you know he's not afraid to follow through on his passions.
</p>
<p>It's been an odd year for RPS, with more departures than arrivals. We continue to work to hire a new reviews editor, too. In the meantime, I'm glad that Mark is bringing his expertise to the site. Please give him a warm welcome below.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-overture-launch-trailer-seemingly-leaks-online-will-be-shadow-dropped-this-weekend/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With the main <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-has-record-setting-60-partners-for-this-years-showcase/">Summer Game Fest</a> showcase event only hours away at the time of this writing, it's no surprise that some of the announcements are beginning to leak out early, like the launch trailer for the Lies Of P DLC expansion, Overture, appearing online, spoiling the surprise that it is going to be shadow-dropped this weekend.</p>
<p>There's some debate as to when the trailer will be shown, whether it's at tonight's Summer Game Fest showcase, or during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-set-for-june-8-the-outer-worlds-2-gets-direct-presentation-immediately-after/">Xbox showcase</a> on Sunday, but based on the images and videos that have leaked on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-lies-of-p-dlc-will-be-shadowdropped-this-week.1209165/">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Elite_Gaming_X/status/1930966673193943544">X</a>, it's clear that it will be shadow-dropped, whenever the reveal does show up.</p>
<p>Even with this news leaking online, it's not the biggest surprise that Lies of P: Overture would be out this weekend. As recently as last week, it was rumored to arrive for the launch of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-rumored-for-nintendo-switch-2-launch/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and well before that, we knew it would <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-overture-announced-releasing-this-summer/">arrive sometime this summer</a>.</p>
<p>Now it's just a matter of waiting to see where the trailer shows up. The leaked trailer only highlights Xbox platforms at the end, and begins with the Xbox logo, which makes it seem like it'll appear on Sunday. It wouldn't be the first time that the DLC has <a href="https://wccftech.com/idxbox-fanfest-reveals-revenge-of-the-savage-planet-date-lies-of-p-overture-trailer-and-more/">appeared at an Xbox show</a>.</p>
<p>If it does show up during Xbox's showcase, then it is also potentially the second announcement from Xbox's show to have leaked earlier, with rumors circulating that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-revealed-xbox/">Persona 4 Remake</a> will be officially announced on Sunday as well.</p>

            <p>Does <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s bird-bodied Guardian have a human face hidden somewhere on his feathery body? It's a question people have been thinking about, and by "people" I mean a small subset of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> obsessives who like to watch the game being picked apart 3D model by 3D model.</p>
<p>Thanks to a prolific Souls modder/dataminer, I can provide you with an answer. In their latest video, Zullie The Witch - who's previously <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sunday-papers-727">solved various Souls mysteries</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/people-are-modding-armored-cores-into-elden-ring-and-now-i-want-a-souls-game-where-you-play-a-giant">modded an Armored Core</a> into Elden Ring - has unmasked <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Nightreign</a>'s crop of nightfarers like they're Scooby-Doo villians. Most of their faces look how you'd expect, but there are a couple of noteworthy cases that I think it's worth you knowing about.</p>

<p>First of all, it's worth noting that due to the switch from custom characters to eight established archetypes, Nightreign's playable characters don't use facedata - by my understanding, this the character creator values that spit out a specfic face - in the same way Elden Ring did, though Zullie does note: "there is technically facedata in Nightreign, but it seems to be just a copy of the existing data from Elden Ring."</p>
<p>With that established, I'm gonna jump to the bit of the video that discusses the Guardian, the game's halberd-wielding Pinionfolk captain. Some folks had been wondering if his birdy visage might have mean FromSoft having to hide a human face somewhere on his model, presumably so he'd conform with the rest of the playable models. Thankfully for all of our dreams, Zullie has checked under the backs of their knees for stray mouths, and says they've not found a weird human face hiding anywhere on the Guardian.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the only nightfarer they couldn't find any kind of proper face for (of the human or birdy variety) was Wylder. Removing the armour from each of his skins has just revealed a featureless "silhoutte", which Zullie notes leaves his appearance a bit of mystery, though folks have inferred that he likely looks similar to the Dutchess. Cue some commenters joking that of course the character they've dubbed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1l4dhbq/john_nightreign/">John Nightreign</a>, similarly to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> players making a meme out of the name <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1b3pmx5/who_is_john_helldiver/">John Helldiver</a> referring to some legendary everyman figure, is faceless.</p>
<p>One asserted that this confirms that "Wylder is the true John from all Fromsoft games", which is certainly a theory.</p>
<p>If you've not given Nightreign a go yet, make sure to check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Nic's review of it</a> and the stuff FromSoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-now-confirmed-to-be-getting-those-duo-expeditions-plus-enhanced-fights-against-its-current-nightlord-crop">recently confirmed</a> is coming to it down the road.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That discount will also be available on PS5 and PC, developer Game Science saying it wanted to give players a heads up in case they were planning on buying the game before then. </p><p>But the real question remains why <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> took so long to arrive on Xbox in the first-place. Many assumed the only explanation was an exclusivity deal with a Sony, whose Hero Initiative focuses on scouting high-quality games in the Chinese market and helping bring them to a global audience. However, <em>Black Myth </em>was never announced as one of those. Microsoft helped fuel those rumors with an opaque comment released back in summer 2024 ahead of the game’s launch</p><p> “We’re excited for the launch of <em>Black Myth Wukong</em> on Xbox Series X|S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms,” a Microsoft spokesperson told<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/hotly-anticipated-black-myth-wukong-is-delayed-on-xbox-for-optimizations-and-now-microsoft-has-responded&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/hotly-anticipated-black-myth-wukong-is-delayed-on-xbox-for-optimizations-and-now-microsoft-has-responded" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Windows Central</em></a></span><em> </em>at the time. “We can’t comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders, but we remain focused on making Xbox the best platform for gamers, and great games are at the center of that.” </p><p>While Game Science has always claimed it was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-xbox-series-x-s-release-delay-1851731006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-xbox-series-x-s-release-delay-1851731006">optimization issues on Xbox Series S</a></span> that was holding the port up, <em>Forbes</em>’ Paul Tassi <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1829211594108350790?t=xQkqpU3DJI9iMMrrNljuRA&amp;s=19&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1829211594108350790?t=xQkqpU3DJI9iMMrrNljuRA&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a></span> that an exclusivity agreement of some kind was in place. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-due-to-sony-exclusivity-deal-not-tech-issues-according-to-source&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-due-to-sony-exclusivity-deal-not-tech-issues-according-to-source" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em> contradicted Game Science’s position</a></span> and reported that “no tech issue” that would delay<em> Black Myth </em>on Xbox had been reported to Microsoft. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/live/YOf7LJRiDww?t=1432s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/YOf7LJRiDww?t=1432s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Giant Bomb</em>’s</a></span> Jeff Grubb, however, claimed there was no marketing agreement in place between the two companies. The whole saga left everyone confused and let console warriors on both sides claim vindication. </p><p>So why is <em>Black Myth</em> now just happening to drop on Xbox Series X/S exactly 365 days after it came to PS5 if there wasn’t an exclusivity deal in place? “Bringing <em>Black Myth:</em>&nbsp;<em>Wukong</em> to Xbox Series X|S—and ensuring the experience met our internal quality standards—was no easy feat,” the Chinese studio wrote in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=194&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=194" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a newly published FAQ</a></span>. “Fortunately, we were able to complete this challenging task smoothly within the first year of the game’s official release.”</p><p>Others, meanwhile, have suggested August 20 just happens to be a special date for the studio. “Game Science has been using August and the 20th for announcements since 2020,” gaming consultant Daniel Camilo <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.comboinfinito.com.br/principal/black-myth-wukong-no-xbox-exclusividade/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.comboinfinito.com.br/principal/black-myth-wukong-no-xbox-exclusividade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Infinite Combo</em></a></span>.

The original c-stick doubles as the Switch 2's new C-button, which will open GameChat, and the internals have been re-arranged for a more responsive d-pad, according to a parts breakdown on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1l3u79o/took_them_nearly_24_years_but_they_finally_fixed/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo GameCube Classics – Official Reveal Trailer | Nintendo Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p>The most surprising new addition is the gyroscope, which wasn't mentioned by Nintendo in the lead-up to the Switch 2's release. Surprised fans instead discovered the added functionality themselves upon unboxing the new controller--such as Japanese Splatoon content creator <a href="https://x.com/sashibu2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sashibu</a>, who posted to X about the new option to play Splatoon with a GameCube controller.</p><p>Gyroscopic controls were first introduced to mainstream gaming with the Wii MotionPlus in 2009, and have remained in use by Nintendo in each of their consoles since. A <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Nintendo_Switch_games_that_support_gyro_controls" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">decent number</a> of Switch titles make use of gyroscopic controls for aiming (the Wii and Wii U both made us of a sensor bar), while some also use them in more novel ways.</p><p>When the GameCube controller for the Switch 2 was first announced, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-controller-has-one-major-limitation/1100-6530712/" data-ref-id="1100-6530712">Nintendo warned</a> that it was only compatible with GameCube titles in the Nintendo Switch Online Classics library. The company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-gamecube-controller-works-outside-of-switch-online-but-could-run-into-issues/1100-6531045/" data-ref-id="1100-6531045">later clarified</a> that it could be used with any game on the Switch 2, but that issues may arise due to lacking features or buttons found on other controllers. The addition of gyro controls and the C-Button seems to contradict the idea that the controller is designed exclusively for GameCube titles (none of which support gyro input) but consider yourself warned.</p><p>The GameCube controller is available to order only for Nintendo Switch Online members, with a limit of one per person. The controller can also be bought in person at select Nintendo stores.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> has acquired a 15.75 percent stake in Arrowhead Games - the development studio behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> - for $80m.</p>
<p>Tencent has previously founded or acquired shares in a variety of video game companies, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-launches-new-business-for-assassins-creed-and-other-big-ips-with-116bn-tencent-investment">including a new gaming venture with Ubisoft Games</a>, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-acquires-riot-games-for-around-usd400-million">total ownership of Riot Games</a>, a major <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/den-of-wolves-is-an-intriguing-sci-fi-heist-fps-from-payday-veterans-gtfo-studio">ownership position for 10 Chamber</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-launches-new-publishing-division-level-infinite-dedicated-to-delivering-high-quality-games-to-a-global-audience">its own publishing arm Level Infinite</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.di.se/digital/spelsuccen-gor-729-mkr-i-vinst-tencent-koper-in-sig/">Speaking to DI</a>, founder John Pilestedt stated that bringing Tencent in as partial owners "opens up opportunities for China as a market. Gaining access to the Chinese player base is the holy grail in the gaming industry."</p>

<p>The remaining 84.25 percent of shares are owned by Arrowhead founders Johan Pilestedt, Emil Englund, Malin Hedstrom, Peter Lindgren, and Anton Stenmark.</p>
<p>A recent financial report reviewed by DI stated Arrowhead had a turnover of 959m SEK, which is around £73,736,551 / $99,877,484.85 / €87,516,806.33, and an operating profit of 729m SEK which is £56,052,445.50 / $75,911,192.99 / €66,526,965.99. That's a lot of cash!</p>
<p>Not too much of a surprise, considering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">Helldivers 2 was PlayStation's fastest selling game ever.</a> The game had recently found itself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update-sees-super-earth-itself-invaded">the stage for an invasion of Super Earth itself</a> which revitalised the game's player base to its highest point since that period of intense launch hype.</p>
<p>All the while Arrowhead bosses remain supportive of the pursuit of new and interesting ideas rather than trend chasing, with Pilestadt stating at GDC that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-boss-says-industry-doomed-to-unnecessarily-brutal-layoffs-while-chasing-after-the-battle-royales">the industry is doomed to "unnecessary layoffs" by "chasing after the battle royales</a>".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This year feels different, though. Apple is reportedly planning a redesign that will touch all its operating systems, and a new naming scheme to tie them all more closely together. Is that enough for a company under this much pressure? Regulators are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/679946/apple-rejected-court-attempt-to-stop-app-store-web-links">changing the way Apple’s business works</a>; developers continue to be frustrated with Apple’s rules and machinations; competitors are <a href="http://[How Apple botched the rollout of AI-powered Siri | The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/the-vergecast/629652/siri-delay-bad-apple-tesla-trump-vergecast)">leaving Apple’s AI efforts behind</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-2">Borderlands 2</a> is currently free to keep on Steam until June 8, but its recent reviews are mostly negative due to an ongoing review bombing from players concerned about its terms of service.</p>
<p>This follows an earlier upset among Borderlands likers because of Gearbox exec and unstoppable poster of words Randy Pitchford, who recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hey-randy-im-not-sure-if-saying-that-a-real-fan-will-figure-out-how-to-pay-80-for-borderlands-4-is-a-good-look">said a rather inconsiderate thing</a> about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>’s pricing and then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/randy-pitchford-shows-hes-capable-of-not-being-an-idiot-about-borderlands-4-prices-raising-questions-about-previous-insistence-on-being-an-idiot">said some slightly less inconsiderate things</a> about Borderlands 4’s pricing.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If you go to claim the game for zero pounds and zero pence ahead of the offer expiring on Sunday, you’ll notice that while the total number of reviews it’s racked up since release in 2012 have left it sitting at “very positive”. That’s in spite of the past month or so, which has seen it accrue this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/49520/Borderlands_2/#app_reviews_hash">barrage of negative verdicts</a> that’s gotten more intense since this announcement of it going free.</p>
<p>It’s attracted 1980 thumbs downs just over the course of June 5 and June 6 as of writing, in comparison to just 280 positive reviews in the same timespan. The vast majority of these recent negative reviews cite an update to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com//eula/49520_eula_0">Take-Two's terms of service</a> on February 28 this year as their reason for unhappiness, with many accusing the publisher and 2K of pushing “spyware”.</p>
<p>This looks to be the continuation of a review bombing movement that the game’s review graph suggests really kicked into motion in May, stemming from concerns over a recent 2K change to Borderlands 2’s Ts and Cs. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/borderlands-is-the-latest-battleground-for-steam-review-bombing-but-the-justification-is-extremely-flimsy/">PC Gamer</a> reports that a YouTube video released by Borderlands content creator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@0fficalHellfire">Hellfire</a> may have been where things started.</p>
<p>Those doing the review bombing, which has also hit other games in the series like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/397540/Borderlands_3/">Borderlands 3</a>, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/vcxzvxzcvxczadsadsqw/recommended/49520/">are citing</a> the types of data the revamped EULA collects about players, as well as a clause in its “Code of Conduct” section they believe unfairly targets mods and cheats.</p>
<p>That clause reads as follows: “You will not use exploits or illegal or unauthorised means to interfere with or adversely impact any other user’s ability to use the services as intended; to gain unfair gameplay advantage; or to gain access to virtual items or other content to which you do not have valid entitlement. This includes the use of cheats or so-called ‘mod menus’, unauthorised mods, hacks, glitches, or any other technical exploits, and phishing, scamming, or social engineering.”</p>
<p>So, something that could maybe affect modders generally - not that prominent Borderlands modders <a href="https://x.com/EpicNNG/status/1930688158204616891">seem concerned</a> - but sounds to me more like fairly typical EULA stuff designed specifically to discourage the use of mods or cheats online, where they could affect the experience had by other players. You know, like the checks fellow Take-Two-owned GTA Online developers Rockstar have tried to institute to stop your session being ambushed by invincible gods who fly around magically giving everyone vast sums of free money.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-survival-mmo-funcom-advanced-access-1851783808<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Realizing your big-budget, high-risk online game is coming out at the same time as the most anticipated new console in half a decade can’t be a great feeling. But I bet discovering that nearly one hundred thousand people played it at the same time anyway, almost a week before it’s officially released, made all the dread worthwhile. <em>Dune Awakening</em>, Funcom’s MMO-cum-survival game, is proving astonishingly popular, despite some hefty competition.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197527" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Part 2 Is Short, Shocking, And Strangely Satisfying" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="169" data-playlist="197527,195301,196790" data-current="197527"><div><p>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Part 2 Is Short, Shocking, And Strangely Satisfying</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197527/197527_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197527/197527_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197527/197527_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23057.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Making an MMO in 2025 seems brave in and of itself. Funcom has had a mixed history with the format, from the story-focused <em>Anarchy Online</em> and <em>Secret World Legends</em> to the more widely successful <em>Conan Exiles</em>, but it’s been a long seven years since the company created a new game. <em>Dune Awakening</em>, born admidst the popularity of Denis Villeneuve’s movies, picks up what <em>Conan</em> put down (then pushed around in a big circle for years), expanding on the mix of crafting and survival simulation set in a massively multiplayer world.</p><p>The game is officially out on June 10, but the scourge of “Advanced Access” means that those who buy a more expensive version of the unreviewed game can start playing before anyone has the chance to tell them if it’s worth their money. And how. Last night saw over 93,000 people playing simultaneously, and that number has already picked back up to 55k at the time of writing, as the Western world wakes up once again. </p><p>Funcom has been a little bit canny here. Usually, Advanced Access on PC is a benefit you only get if you fork out the cash for some kind of “special edition” that sees the cost of a game soar above its vanilla $60 launch price, likely hitting $90 to $100. However, in the case of <em>Dune Awakening</em>, prices started lower. People playing today likely bought the Deluxe Edition that’s “only” $70, still a significant bump over the $50 the game will cost you on Tuesday, but certainly more enticing to larger crowds, and does include the season pass. Then there’s an Ultimate Edition, at $90, to make sure the big spenders still have somewhere to throw away their cash: on top of playing the game earlier, you’ll also get four in-game dress-up assets and a digital artbook and soundtrack. </p><p>That more sensible pricing structure is likely a big part of why the game is performing so extraordinarily well ahead of full launch, and hopefully will get noticed by those who believe that increasing prices is the only way to make more money. Bang a drum with me: Larger. Numbers. Of. People. Can. Afford. Lower. Prices.</p><p>It’ll be very interesting to see if the game sustains this kind of player population, and whether it can smash even these splendid numbers on official release. Games like <em>Dune Awakening</em> are make-or-break on launch (or at least have a monstrous hill to climb should it go badly), and given that the 100k who showed up last night all went in pretty blind (they may have played a beta, but still), not knowing if they would find a game that’s up to standard, it remains to be seen what the consensus will be. It’s currently sitting on 84 percent positive reviews, from almost 4,000 people, so not too shabby. </p><p>This is all the more impressive considering it was done against the backdrop of the Switch 2 arriving in everyone’s homes. Sure, the Venn circles might not have the <em>biggest</em> overlap between PC multiplayer survival players and Nintendo fanciers, but given the Switch 2 now has mouse controls...It really demonstrates that gaming is a far broader church than people usually credit, with plenty of room for vast amounts of variety to be simultaneously successful.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Black Myth: Wukong, one of 2024's best-selling games worldwide, is finally headed to Xbox after a year of exclusivity on PlayStation. The game is coming to Xbox Series X|S on August 20, with preorders opening on June 18.</p><p>The game originally released on PS5 and PC on August 20, 2024, meaning it's coming to Xbox Series X|S precisely one year later. This is fueling the theory that Sony did, in fact, have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-isnt-on-xbox-yet-due-to-sony-exclusivity-deal-report/1100-6526196/" data-ref-id="1100-6526196">one-year exclusivity deal with developer Game Science.</a></p><p>Some had claimed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-developer-says-xbox-port-delay-is-due-to-the-series-s/1100-6528607/" data-ref-id="1100-6528607">technical issues with the Xbox Series S</a> prompted a delay for the Xbox version, but Microsoft maintained this was not true (despite the fact that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-in-development-for-xbox-but-theres-a-series-s-snag/1100-6511819/" data-ref-id="1100-6511819">some titles have in the past run into issues</a> with the lower-spec version of the newest Xbox).</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=194" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post on the game's website</a>, Game Science said it took time to bring Black Myth to Xbox because it was "no easy feat" to ensure the experience met the developer's internal expectations. "Fortunately, we were able to complete this challenging task smoothly within the first year of the game's official release," the developer said.</p><p>What's more, Game Science has announced the first-ever discount on Black Myth, stating the game will be 20% off beginning June 18 on all platforms. That means Xbox players can preorder the game at a 20% discount, bringing the price down from $60 to about $48.</p><p>Black Myth sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-is-now-one-of-the-fastest-selling-games-ever/1100-6526082/" data-ref-id="1100-6526082">10 million copies in its first three days</a> and has gone on to shift <a href="https://s3.hatchbuck.com/WebTemplates/5009e2fc130048b2970ee352f5cf59c3.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 25 million units.</a> At launch, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-is-now-one-of-the-fastest-selling-games-ever/1100-6526082/" data-ref-id="1100-6526082">overwhelming majority of PC sales on Steam came from China</a>, where its developer is based.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/nioh-3-preview-team-ninjas-answer-to-elden-ring/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nioh-3-preview-%E2%80%93-team-ninja%E2%80%99s-answer-to-elden-ring.1209213/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/nioh-3-preview-team-ninjas-answer-to-elden-ring/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>For almost a decade Japanese developer <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/team-ninja">Team Ninja</a> has been hot on the heels of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a>, the studio behind <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a>, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>, and indeed the wider “Soulslike” genre. Many have tried to replicate and remix that formula to varying levels of success, Team Ninja being the most dogged and consistent in that pursuit.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nioh 3 - Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KXGm-JaxY54?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>2017’s <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/nioh">Nioh</a> ticked all the boxes, including brutal skill-based combat, a dark oppressive world, and a satisfying risk/reward progression, while adding its own kinetic combat touches. After all, these are the guys who developed the 3D <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ninja-gaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a> series. Since then, the studio has put its name to a successive string of Souslike games including <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/nioh-2">Nioh 2</a>, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/stranger-of-paradise-final-fantasy-origin">Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin</a>, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/wo-long-fallen-dynasty">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a>, and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/rise-of-the-ronin">Rise of the Ronin</a>, each wrapping that familiar action RPG core with new and interesting design ideas.</p>


<p>Announced during Sony’s recent State of Play broadcast, Nioh 3 doesn’t require you to have played the two previous games in the series, even if that might help. It may share the same setting and core gameplay design, but this isn’t a continuous story. As a lone warrior destined to become Shogun, you enter a world gripped by a bloody conflict as Japanese warlords vye for power amidst a demonic Yokai invasion.</p>
<p>The Nioh series has always excelled in blending elements of mythology and folklore with real-world history, giving the games a distinct identity that is equal parts grim and enchanting. Once idyllic landscapes are now wreathed in a pulsating aura of corruption as a menagerie of spirits, beasts, and other monstrosities predate upon the remaining pockets of humanity who have yet to succumb to war.</p>


<p>Nioh fans will immediately feel at home, though there are some new gameplay quirks that take some getting used to. Players will notice that the main character is more agile and dynamic in their movements – something carried forward from Wo Long and the more recent Rise of the Ronin. They can double jump and dodge in mid-air, adding a greater sense of verticality to Nioh’s combat and exploration.</p>
<p>Another major new gameplay feature allows the player to seamlessly switch between Samurai and Ninja playstyles, both with their own unique abilities, movesets, and equipment loadouts. Where the Samurai is more defence-focused with hard-hitting charged attacks the Ninja is capable of running rings around sluggish opponents, delivering a flurry of attacks before using their Mist evade to fall back. Naturally, players are likely to gravitate towards one of playstyle, though Team Ninja makes an argument for using both to suit different combat scenarios.</p>
<p>Nioh 3’s evolution doesn’t stop there. With FromSoftware having broken the bonds of its traditional “open linear” level design with Elden Ring’s open world, Nioh was bound to follow suit. Again, we got a taste of this in Rise of the Ronin, and at first it can be a little disorientating. Nioh 3’s opening stage serves as a tight-knit tutorial, allowing newcomers and veterans to cut their teeth on a few skirmishes before squaring up to a tough first boss – a member of Takeda Shingen’s Crimson Cavalry.</p>

<p>However, it isn’t long before players are unleashed upon a vast new landscape that stretches in just about every direction. Although there’s a gleaming icon on the HUD compass, players are invited to forge their own path, discovering hidden treasures, completing side quests, and stumbling upon horrific enemies they have no chance of defeating. The Shrines dotted throughout act as resting points where you can replenish items, trade goods, and funnel resources into boosting various stats and skills, enabling a multitude of build possibilities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/04/nioh-3-revealed-for-ps5-with-a-demo-available-today/">Playing the Nioh 3 alpha demo</a> it’s clear to see how ambitious the scope of this game is, building on countless gameplay innovations and experiments Team Ninja has developed across its stable of recent action RPGs. It’s not just bigger, it’s deeper and more layered, instantly becoming one of our most anticipated PlayStation 5 games of 2026.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tencent-reportedly-bought-a-15-stake-in-helldivers-2-dev-arrowhead-last-year.1209210/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arrowhead-tencent-stake-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which claims that Chinese gaming and tech giant Tencent purchased a 15% stake in&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>developer Arrowhead Game Studios last year.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-has-acquired-15-75-of-arrowhead-game-studios/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Insider Gaming</a> (which in turn cites Swedish publications <a href="https://www.di.se/digital/spelsuccen-gor-729-mkr-i-vinst-tencent-koper-in-sig/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dagens Industri</a> and <a href="https://www.di.se/digital/spelsuccen-gor-729-mkr-i-vinst-tencent-koper-in-sig/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Breakit</a>), Tencent paid roughly $83 million for the stake, which represents a fraction of Arrowhead's reported valuation of about $532 million.</p>

<p>Insider Gaming also says that Arrowhead chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt welcomed the deal, claiming that it will open up the Chinese market for Arrowhead. Pilestedt also apparently said that the Chinese player base is the "holy grail" in the gaming industry (a quote for which Insider uses machine translation).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-arrowhead-tencent.jpg?itok=_hrMT8gp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-arrowhead-tencent.jpg?itok=39bIK_xt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>developer Arrowhead can reportedly now count Tencent among its shareholders.</figcaption></figure><p>Arrowhead is far from the only Western game company in which Tencent has a stake. The company is one of Ubisoft's major shareholders, having recently had a major role in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft--report-new-gaming-entity-core-ip" rel="nofollow">creation of a new entity</a> that will handle much of Ubisoft's most popular IP.</p>

<p>Tencent also counts&nbsp;<em>Dying Light&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-techland-majority-stakeholder" rel="nofollow">Techland</a>,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-and-sony-buy-over-30-shares-in-from-software" rel="nofollow">FromSoftware</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>giant Epic Games among its investments, with the latter having landed Tencent in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-government-investigating-epic-games-riot-games-due-to-tencent" rel="nofollow">hot water with the US government</a> in the past.</p>

<p>That's not to mention Tencent's many collaborations with other studios in the gaming industry, like its&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-outlanders-mobile-rpg" rel="nofollow"><em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>mobile RPG</a> or its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-revealed" rel="nofollow">mobile version of&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-revealed" rel="nofollow">Final Fantasy XIV</a>&nbsp;</em>(which has yet to come to the West). Suffice it to say Tencent is a pretty big deal, even for the Western gaming industry.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with Arrowhead, meanwhile, its most recent (and by far its biggest) game is PS5 and PC exclusive&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-financials-helldivers-2-sales" rel="nofollow">passed twelve million sales last year</a>&nbsp;and which has a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/helldivers-2-board-game-fully-funded-in-12-minutes-on-gamefound" rel="nofollow">board game adaptation</a> on the way as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arrowhead-tencent-helldivers-2-mech.jpg?itok=igpWSSDF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arrowhead-tencent-helldivers-2-mech.jpg?itok=YUxI8iJ6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is a big deal for Arrowhead.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s monumental success, creative director Johan Pilestedt is already thinking about what to do next; in January, he <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical" rel="nofollow">announced he would take a "sabbatical"</a> before returning to work on the studio's next project.</p>

<p>It's unlikely that Tencent's investment in Arrowhead will result in any major creative changes for the company, but we'll have to wait and see what happens next. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Developer CD Projekt will no doubt be delighted to see its latest game doing so well on Switch 2, after it previously skipped Nintendo's last-gen console. With the power to run Cyberpunk's Night City now available, Switch 2 owners look to have jumped at the chance to catch up with the open-world RPG. Earlier this week, IGN chatted with CD Projekt to find out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-cd-projekt-red-got-cyberpunk-2077-running-on-switch-2">how the developer managed to get Cyberpunk 2077 working on Switch 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Third is Nintendo's own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a>. This is the $10 collection of mini-games and tech demos that many fans believe should have been offered for free (and after an hour with the game myself last night, I am inclined to agree). Part instruction manual, part interactive museum exhibit, Welcome Tour is at least fairly cheap. (Just remember <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-which-everyone-thinks-should-be-free-requires-95-of-accessories-and-a-4k-tv-for-100-completion">you'll need a camera and a separate controller/grip with GL/GR buttons to play everything included in it</a>.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fourth best-selling game on the Switch 2 eShop right now is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a>, a game which you may not have heard of. This fast-paced sci-fi racer is an interesting addition to the console's launch line-up, as developer Shin'en Multimdia previously released the similar Fast RMX as a launch title for the original Switch, back in March 2017. Why is this series popular with Nintendo fans? Well, because it is essentially F-Zero. And without a new F-Zero from Nintendo anytime soon (if ever again), hardcore Nintendo fans love it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fast Fusion Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The fifth biggest game on the Switch 2 eShop is not actually a game, but an upgrade — yes, it's the $10 upgrade to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>. It's interesting to see this chart so highly, as Nintendo Switch Online subscribers do get this add-on included as part of their membership. But perhaps fans have decided they want it to keep? Or maybe they haven't realised. Regardless, the fact this upgrade is so popular clearly shows Nintendo was right to assume people would pay up for some improved visuals (something you get free in upgrades to other titles, such as Pokémon Scarlet and Violet), plus access to a new mobile app.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sixth on the Switch 2 eShop right now is Deltarune, which just launched its latest chapters this week. Seventh is the $10 upgrade pack for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> (as an older game, perhaps fewer people are still playing it compared to Tears of the Kingdom). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In eighth place is relaxing role-player Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, while ninth place goes to Square Enix's Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster. This is followed by Yakuza 0 and Street Fighter 6 Years 1-2 Fighters Edition. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After these, the full Switch 2 Editions of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild sandwich Hitman World of Assassination. And lastly in the chart is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, whose Switch 2 version features a number of graphical upgrades. A $10 upgrade for this Harry Potter prequel RPG is also available if you owned the game on the original Switch.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Finally, here is the Switch 2 eShop launch day chart as a handy list:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Mario Kart World</li><li>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</li><li>Fast Fusion</li><li>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Upgrade Pack</li><li>Deltarune</li><li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Upgrade Pack</li><li>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</li><li>Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster</li><li>Yakuza 0</li><li>Street Fighter 6 Years 1-2 Fighters Edition</li><li>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Switch 2 Edition</li><li>Hitman: World of Assassination</li><li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Switch 2 Edition</li><li>Hogwarts Legacy</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

    <p><span>The paths and fates of the Traveler twins cross once more.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 5.7 update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [124 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “A Space and Time for You,” will launch on June 18, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [197 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-970467"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>One of the major highlights of the update will be the introduction of the new playable character, Skirk, a powerful and enigmatic figure with deep ties to the Abyss who fights in two distinct combat styles. As one powerful companion joins the fray, a new unrest brews between the Traveler twins, with looming darkness drawing ever closer in the new Archon Quest. A new power is rising, and so too does the story of the Travelers march toward a pivotal new phase.</p><p>Version 5.7 will mark the long-awaited debut of Skirk as a playable character. She is known as Childe’s enigmatic master, and once trained under Surtalogi “The Foul,” one of Khaenri’ah’s Five Sinners. Wielding Abyssal power camouflaged as Cryo, this 5-star character shifts between two combat styles: One that relies on enhanced Normal Attacks for sustained damage, or another that uses her Elemental Burst to deal powerful AoE Cryo damage. Both modes draw on Serpent’s Subtlety, a unique resource generated from Skirk’s Skills and Talents, instead of Elemental Energy. Skirk also brings valuable synergy to teams with only Hydro and Cryo characters (with at least one of each in the party), granting an extra level to their Elemental Skills and a significant DMG buff to herself.</p><p>Also joining the roster is Dahlia, a new 4-star Hydro support character and the Deacon of the Church of Favonius. Dahlia offers versatile support in the form of a renewable shield created by his Elemental Burst, which can be reactivated by Normal Attacks or Freeze reactions. He can also boost teammates’ ATK SPD with his Talent, and use his Elemental Skill to bounce allies high into the air or deal Hydro DMG to enemies. For the Event Wishes of Version 5.7, the first half will feature Skirk, Dahlia, and Shenhe’s rerun, followed by reruns of the Pyro Archon Mavuika and Emilie in the second half.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_970468"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>Following the “Bedtime Story” quest, the Archon <a title="Platforms > Quest [142 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a> continues to unravel the tale of the Traveler and their sibling. In this new chapter, the Abyss Order begins to mobilize in Natlan as part of their sibling’s grand plan. Natlan’s defenders, including Mavuika and her allies, remain on high alert, while Dainsleif joins Traveler on the front lines in a form that players have never seen before. As the journey leads them deeper into the domain of the Abyss Order, the Traveler may begin to uncover some long-buried truths about their sibling’s schemes.</p><p>In Version 5.7, the Sumeru <a title="Games > Aka [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/aka">Aka</a>demiya will launch a new simulated <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,313 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure game</a> that combines tactical team-building with a touch of luck. Travelers can select Companion Pieces to form their lineup, power their pieces up, and choose between rainforest or desert routes with unique challenges, narratives, and unexpected encounters. To prepare for the journey, Travelers may also take part in research stages, guiding Paimon to harvest fruit to gain extra buffs. Completing the event gives rewards such as Primogems, as well as the opportunity to invite Sethos to their party.</p><p>A new permanent combat mode, “Stygian Onslaught,” will also be available. With 3 bosses that rotate every update and 6 escalating levels of difficulty, players can complete the trials to claim Artifacts and even a new item called “Dust of Enlightenment,” which allows for the re-rolling of the minor affixes’ enhancements on a Level 20 Artifact.</p><p>Meanwhile, “Travelers’ Tales: Gilded Chapter” will bring lighthearted stories from all over Teyvat. Thoma returns to Mondstadt, Neuvillette visits Merusea Village, and Dori tries to strike a deal with Sayu in Inazuma. These stories are sure to offer moments of reprieve between adventures.</p><p>In addition, more optimizations will be implemented in Version 5.7.
