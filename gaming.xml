		<p>It’s the middle of the sporting summer in the UK, with Wimbledon, the British Grand Prix, cricket and the warm up matches for the Lions tour all going on. Obviously anything in the UK is subject to British weather, and it definitely seems to be returning to type for the weekend.</p>

<p>Microsoft axed the studio behind the new project this week</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Perfect Dark" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b82c61e49a066/perfect-dark.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Although the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/perfect_dark">Perfect Dark</a> series has been under Microsoft's control for more than two decades now, the news this week about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/microsoft-announces-another-wave-of-layoffs-over-9000-jobs-affected">the latest entry by The Initiative being axed</a> has led to a lot of reactions within the Nintendo community.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Joanna's voice actor Alix Wilton Regan (who was cast in the now-cancelled project) is rallying fans of the video game agent and calling on them to "speak up" on social media and elsewhere online if they want to see this series "survive". <em>Yes, it's that grim!</em></p><div><figure data-videoid="JEHFv10kUS0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38eeb6mljouv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEHFv10kUS0" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"A lot of people have been reaching out and floating this idea on my timeline, my phone and in my DMs, so I’m just gonna say it... #PerfectDark #PerfectPickUp speak up if you wanna see Perfect Dark survive"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although the chances of the latest project getting revived in some way or form appear to be very slim at this stage, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/07/perfect-dark-actor-calls-on-fans-to-speak-up-and-help-the-game-survive">as our colleagues at Pure Xbox note</a>, there have been some surprising outcomes and scenarios before, such as when Microsoft folded Tango Gameworks (<a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/hi-fi_rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>) and Krafton stepped in to revive the studio.</p>
<p>Of course, Regan's aim here is to simply get Perfect Dark fans to show their love for Joanna in hopes <em>something</em> might change or happen, or elevate the chances of someone stepping in to save the day – including the studio behind the cancelled project (<em>and dare we say Joanna's future</em>).</p>
<p>If you were about during the N64 generation, Agent Dark's 64-bit outing was one of the best experiences available on the platform. And although her latest project has been cancelled, you can still at least experience her classic first-person shooter on the Switch and Switch 2 via the Switch Online + Expansion Pack "Mature" app.</p>
<p>Perfect Dark isn't the only IP Microsoft has been accused of sitting on since acquiring the legendary British developer from Nintendo in the early 2000s. Although it did bring back <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a> during the Xbox 360 generation, the famous bird and bear have been stashed away for a long time now – with many fans and former developers losing hope of a comeback.</p>
<p>Apart from Joanna's latest mission, Microsoft also cancelled Rare's next project <strong><a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/everwild">Everwild</a></strong> this week, a title that was originally announced more than five years ago.</p>

                                        <p>Ever since Persona transformed the RPG into a wonderfully voyeuristic Japanese tourism simulator, I’ve had an appetite for games that let me experience living on the other side of the planet. Whether it’s roaming the streets of Osaka in Yakuza or trudging across the dung-filled fields of Kingdom Come: Deliverance’s medieval Bohemia, there’s something satisfying about picking up a controller and being given a window into someone else’s life.</p><p>Yet since Persona offers a disappointingly linear Tokyo to traverse, I’ve been left pining to get lost in a truly sprawling virtual metropolis. Thankfully, it turns out my oddly specific prayers have been answered. Welcome to the slick and exciting new anime open-world RPG from Hotta Studio, NTE.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M7b_00KDgk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6M7b_00KDgk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h4>Hot-ta Go</h4><p>Developed by the creators of the 2021 hit, Tower of Fantasy, NTE is a fully open-world anime brawler made using Unreal Engine 5. Putting players into the near-future city of Hethereau, anime-styled characters are free to roam the futuristic metropolis as they see fit. Feeling like a blend of Shanghai, Seoul, and Tokyo, Hethereau is fully explorable in its gargantuan glory – and it finally satisfies that free-form slice of life itch.</p><p>It helps that the city of Hetherau looks absolutely stunning. As crisp character models are brought to life with expressive animations, Lumen lighting tech brings street lamps and puzzles shimmering to life with impressive reflections. In a nice touch, exploring this cityscape feels pleasingly kinetic. From sprinting across packed plazas to sipping coffee at a quiet cafe or fighting anomalies in back alleys, there’s an impressively vast map begging to be explored. As you hop into a car and crash into incoming traffic, chat to overly excitable citizens and then head into a portal to slice up some dudes, it’s hard not to feel like you’re playing a Shonen Jump twist on GTA.</p><p>Real-time weather helps to keep your time in Hethereau feeling fresh - no matter the forecast. Whenever you boot up NTE, you never know what kind of day awaits, with your daily adventures shifting from sun-soaked ambles across packed city streets to racing across town with snowflake-laden windscreen wipers. It’s all surprisingly well realised and immersive stuff, with snow even affecting NPC behaviour. Pedestrians leave snow prints as they go about their days, and heavy snowfall even brings traffic edging to an authentic standstill.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4526647-drivinginthesnow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4526647" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4526647-drivinginthesnow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4526647"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4526647-drivinginthesnow.jpg"></figure><h4>Anomaly of a Fall</h4><p>Still, it’s not all a breezy good time here - there is an existential threat facing humanity, after all. With people around the world suddenly mutated by thick goo falling from the sky, a hyper vortex has corrupted and maddened once ordinary citizens, and it’s up to the authorities to try and contain this horrific anomaly before it spreads. As a member of the Anomaly Control's Containment Unit, it’s up to you to help keep citizens safe.</p><p>Much like in the games that inspired it, there’s a murky distinction between regular city life and the action-packed showdowns with anomalies. In NTE, the vast city of Hethereau shimmers with a surrealist quality, seamlessly blending day-to-day city life with reality-bending sci-fi. Divided into two main sections, the city’s Frontworld is a meticulously ordered, seamless open-world cyberpunk metropolis where players can explore and progress the story, while the Backworld – you guessed it – is littered with local urban distortions caused by those pesky supernatural anomalies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4526648-newallies.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4526648" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4526648-newallies.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4526648"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4526648-newallies.jpg"></figure><p>The sun-soaked streets of the Frontworld offer a nice contrast to the murky, horror-tinged encounters that define the anomalies. One such section saw me roaming an eerily abandoned school. With its glistening corridors devoid of life, and a pulsating crimson oozing out of the windows, these spooky sections are nice and atmospheric – a welcome change from simply being dumped straight into combat.</p><p>Speaking of combat, NTE offers unique mechanics depending on your character, such as character-specific Critical Dodge Counterattacks and Parry Attacks, which add fresh layers of strategy and style to enemy encounters.</p><h4>Grand Theft Anime</h4><p>In a Michael-Scott pleasing touch, urban exploration comes with a parkour twist, allowing players to navigate the sprawling urban metropolis by sprinting, jumping, and climbing their way across the packed city streets. If that all sounds far too exhausting, you can instead opt to simply hop on the subway, chatting to the locals for new leads on anomaly locations, or to engage in some enjoyably silly side quests. If parkour doesn’t float your proverbial boat, you can always take to the sky, hopping on a zipline to speed across the neon skyline and uncover the city's hidden corners.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4526650-wantedsystem.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4526650" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4526650-wantedsystem.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4526650"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4526650-wantedsystem.jpg"></figure><p>Of course, it wouldn’t be GTA-like without, well, some grand theft auto. Just like in Rockstar’s flagship franchise, vehicles in Hethereau can be commandeered under Anomaly Control's Containment Unit (more on them later) authority via Requisition gameplay, allowing you to peacefully take over any car if it will help you keep the city safe. If, however, you step out of line and attack fellow citizens, you’ll trigger a Wanted level, with the Security Office putting out a warrant for your arrest and chasing you down. Continuing to break the law will increase your wanted level with escalating consequences based on the severity of your offence. The more you attempt to escape or the more wanton destruction you cause, the higher the said wanted level. GTA VI, eat your heart out.</p><p>And if that wasn’t enough law-flaunting for you, you can also team up with friends to try out street racing challenges, competing with crews from various districts in high-octane multiplayer races. If you fancy testing your driving skills, Hetherau’s streets are littered with fast and furious drivers, all itching to put the pedal to the metal and helping you try out all manner of torque-testing new rides. Just be careful in bad weather: the snow might be immersive and realistic – with snowflakes organically blowing in the wind and the snow getting deeper in real time – but rain or snow means slippery roads and a greater chance of you dramatically spinning off track.</p><p>In NTE, you’re an anomaly hunter, with the game’s core missions revolving around hunting down said anomalies. Story beats are punctuated with gorgeously rendered cutscenes, leaning fully into their anime inspirations, as devious plot twists and turns are delivered with pleasing cinematic flourish.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4526651-openworld.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4526651" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4526651-openworld.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4526651"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4526651-openworld.jpg"></figure><h4>Beta Than Paradise</h4><p>Whether you’re cruising down the streets in your sweet new ride or clambering up the side of buildings, NTE is a surprisingly varied and feature-packed game. I was pleasantly surprised by the open world’s scope, with developer Hotta Studio promising that players will be able to choose how they mould their own destiny - yet it was too early to tell how these choices will ultimately pan out.</p><p>If the year-long wait for GTA VI has got you down, and modern gatcha games aren’t doing it for you, you can always take a trip to Hethereau when NTE comes out on PC, mobile, and PlayStation 5.

<p>Looking back on this week first, Nintendo released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_smash_football">Super Mario Strikers</a> for the GameCube NSO app on Switch 2. It's a solid title, and you can see exactly where it lands in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-online-gamecube-game-on-switch-2-ranked">GameCube ranking for Switch 2</a> so far.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, it emerged that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendos-ability-to-ban-switch-2-consoles-has-landed-it-in-hot-water">Nintendo is facing a legal challenge from Brazil</a> thanks to its ability to ban Switch 2 consoles, while both major Zelda titles on Switch 2 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-and-breath-of-the-wild-updates-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">received a cheeky little update</a>. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is also facing a bit of controversy recently, with folks <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/of-course-mario-kart-world-is-being-review-bombed">review-bombing the game</a> after Nintendo's latest update.</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I’m off to see some friends this weekend and I know they haven’t played any Switch 2 yet.</p>
<p>So I’m packing up my dock and camera and I’m off to introduce everybody to the joys of Mario Kart World when you can see the faces of the racers in front of you. We’ll see whether they’re still my friends once Monday rolls around…</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I actually started playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a> recently, and although it's not my usual cup of tea, I'm actually having a blast with it.</p>
<p>I'm also playing through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_6">Resident Evil 6</a> again on the Switch 2, taking full advantage of that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/22-games-with-secret-performance-bumps-you-should-revisit-on-switch-2">bump up to 60fps</a>. And yes, I still love it.</p>

<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a>. Again. And probably will be until I get my hands on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong</a>. I'll be taking the Switch 2 with me on holiday next week, so it'll be the first time travelling with the console, and what better way to travel than to spend time levelling crafting jobs, eh?</p>
<p>Otherwise, some Mario Kart World with friends is in order. Have a good one!</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>It is incredible how Next Level games kicked-off Super Mario Strikers so flawlessly from the opening whistle. Input and online latency aside, this will be quite good fun to spend some of the weekend’s gaming plans. Also: Sass. Every character is full of sass and attitude which was quite amusing to see back then – glad Nintendo allowed it.</p>
<p>I’ve made my way onto <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a> chapter 10 during the week and things are quickly heating up with a setup for the inevitable Kiryu-Majima showdown. I’m unsure how long I have left to see the end credits on this excellent re-edition, but I’m sure it will be a really fun time.</p>
<p>And then there is the second Namco Model 22 Arcade Archives outing! Ace Combat 22 brings a ton of memories. While the game is a bit bare-bones (and most assuredly a coin muncher), the fact I used to play this at local sit-down arcade cabinet several months before even dreaming of owning Air Combat (which is quite a different experience despite sharing the core visuals) on the PS1 makes it quite special. Maybe I will actually complete Top Gun mode before I run out of coins.</p>
<p>I haven’t been able to start <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/robocop_rogue_city">RoboCop: Rogue City</a> last weekend but I’m sure to correct that before Monday arrives. Dead or alive, someone is most definitely coming with me.</p>

<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>Lots on the menu this weekend. Can you believe we've had Switch 2 now for a whole month?</p>
<p>As ever, the question is whether I'll actually get to any of the games I plan on playing. I've got an appetite for a little more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a>, digging into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">No Man's Sky</a>, and polishing off a dozen other things. I want to spend more time with the GameCube app, too.</p>
<p>But will I just end up noodling around in Mario Kart World picking up Peach coins and P Switches? Yes, that's almost certainly what I'll end up doing. Same time next week, shall we?</p>
<h2>Alex Olney, Video Producer</h2>
<p>I recently got my hands on an <em>adorable</em> Xbox Series S, after years of wanting one but having no good reason to do so. This weekend I'm keen to put it through its paces, playing the likes of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/doom_the_dark_ages">DOOM The Dark Ages</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/baldurs_gate_3">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/indiana_jones_and_the_great_circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a> – whatever's modern and on GamePass really. What do you mean 'obviously this is preparation for a video'?</p>
<p>I'd ask you not to read too much into my personal affairs, thank you very much.</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<div><p>This weekend I'm on holiday in SPAIIIIN, which means being outside in 35°C heat. It's great. It's so great.</p><p>

Luckily for you readers, that means a lot of my time is spent inside in air-conditioned hotels and cafés, playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy</a>. I'm about 30 days in, and let me tell you, it's a SLOW burn, but a good one. And it's genuinely quite funny to play the game as a <strong>Danganronpa</strong>/<strong>Zero Escape</strong> fan and see all the ways in which Hundred Line is exactly a mashup of those two, complete with a genuinely delightful amount of jokes about how it is exactly that. I mean, there's a character that keeps going on about how she hopes it's a killing game with students and an evil teddy bear mascot. Which it kind of is!</p><p>

It's great, though, despite the mildly tedious Danganronpa "improve your stats and figure out what gifts to give people" side quests. Only 70 more days to go (until I get to NG+, anyway)!</p></div>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-idoneth-deepkin-new-release-preview-surfs-up</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-idoneth-deepkin-new-release-preview-surfs-up.1236387/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The sun's out, the surf is right, and it's time to get murdered by magical floating merfolk! That's right, we've got your first look at the sprues and basic rules for the newest Idoneth Deepkin releases up for preorder this weekend! Games Workshop sent these along for us to check out, so dive in (okay sorry no more water puns, I promise not to sink that deep again).</p>

<p>Unfortunately we don't have pre-release access to the new Battletome which is also up for pre-release this weekend, so you can use this article really as a chance to check out the sprues for each of these models (along with the pretty built and painted GW-provided photos).</p>

<h2>Ikon of the Sea</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-ikon-of-the-sea.jpg?itok=qWN9DMwY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-ikon-of-the-sea.jpg?itok=Ne1nF9bY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>First up is the Idoneth Deepkin Ikon of the Sea (which can also be built as the Ikon of the Storm), and I have to say I'm really loving the look of this unit. There's a lot of dynamic motion on display here, and it just hammers home that there really isn't anything else in Warhammer that looks like the Deepkin.</p>

<p>The decision to surround these warriors with waves and ocean-bound creatures really sets them in a league of their own, and shows the true creativity Games Workshop can bring to tabletops with they set out with a bold concept. From the rules we've seen so far, the Ikon of the Sea cares about charging, allowing it and another friendly unit within its combat range to add an extra die when charging (up to three). Its glaive also gets a +1 when charging, so this wave movement is captured well.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at the sprue for this model, assembly is painless, with everything slotting together quite nicely.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-ikon-of-the-deep.jpeg?itok=Q16XiZDa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-ikon-of-the-deep.jpeg?itok=eTF5YpM_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Mathaela, Oracle of the Abyss</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-mathaela.jpg?itok=LF4Q_csU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-mathaela.jpg?itok=8vTV6iLT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Next up is Mathaela, Oracle of the Abyss. For this model, I find the eel-like creatures surround it a bit strange, but I suppose that's the point - this is a mysterious figure surrounded by mysterious denizens of the very deepest depths of the Abyss.</p>

<p>Mathaela has the ability to add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of friendly companion weapons that are nearby, and she's a wizard. The preview article for this model up on GW's website also explains that it "../can also use the Lore of the Abyss to summon the Incarnate of the Deep – a manifestation of the realmsea’s extraordinary power who visit violence upon the foes of the Idoneth."</p>

<p>More on that in a moment, but let's check out the sprue for this model - again, another very straightforward build, which I love to see!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-mathaela-oracle-of-the-abyss-sprue-photo.jpeg?itok=wfIYDYRZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-mathaela-oracle-of-the-abyss-sprue-photo.jpeg?itok=7_y-vX6C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Idoneth Deepkin: Manifestations</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-manifestations.jpg?itok=gj4fjerN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-manifestations.jpg?itok=W3UcUtq6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Finally this week (it's a short one!), we have the Idoneth Deepkin: Manifestation. This manifestation, when summoned, can hit for damage and summon two watery tendrils which can attack on their own.</p>

<p>These tendrils can also strike out against enemies, and can even use a special ability to ensnare a foe engaged in combat with it. Ensnared models aren't able to use commands, so its a great way to lock down your opponent's commanders.</p>

<p>Checking out the sprue for this, I was very happy to see that it all came on one sprue, and didn't involve too many little bits and bobs - I feel like in the old days this would have been an absolute monster to put together.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-manifestations-sprue-photo.jpeg?itok=fykr8KhH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-manifestations-sprue-photo.jpeg?itok=nDTxT0YC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Other than these three products we received for preview this week, there's also the&nbsp;<em>Battletome: Idoneth Deepkin</em>&nbsp;to get the rules for these and updated rules for these new units and the entire army, and the very cool-looking&nbsp;Isharann Soulscryer, which was previously only available as part of the spearhead. Speaking of spearheads, there's a new one coming out for Idoneth as well, the&nbsp;Spearhead: Akhelian Tide Guard.</p>

<p>I don't run this army myself, but I am always in awe of a well-painted one on the table. What do you think? Do you run Idoneth and, if so, will you be picking up these additions? Were you hoping for more support? Let me know in the comments below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the Anime Expo in Los Angeles, California, CD PROJEKT RED and studio TRIGGER <a href="https://x.com/edgerunners/status/1941255538047951061" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2 is officially in development. This is a major turnaround from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-edgerunners-isnt-getting-a-season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement released in October 2022</a>. Edgerunners 2 will be a standalone anime series of 10 episodes set in the world of Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<p>Hugo Award-winning writer Bartosz Sztybor, showrunner, story writer, and producer on Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>David’s story might be over, but there’s plenty more to discover in Night City. And to again have the legendary animation studio TRIGGER along for the ride makes us at CD PROJEKT RED so excited to introduce a raw, real chronicle of redemption and revenge, something unlike what we’ve done before.</em></p>



<p>Sztybor will be joined by lead character designer Kanno Ichigo (Promare, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners) and Masahiko Otsuka (Gurren Lagann, Promare), who will be responsible for the screenplay adaptation. Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2 will air on Netflix at an unspecified date.</p>



<p>As you might recall, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners launched in September 2022 to rave reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, it enjoys an enviable 100% fresh rating. More importantly, it was the first real spark to <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-continues-its-edgerunners-fueled-comeback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reignite interest</a> in CD PROJEKT RED's Cyberpunk 2077. The studio wisely timed Patch 1.6 to launch alongside the Netflix anime series, which added the Wardrobe feature, cross-progression between different platforms, three new side missions (Gigs), five new melee weapons, and six new firearms, in addition to some light Edgerunners-related content and tons of fixes. Cyberpunk 2077 player numbers spiked, and the sentiment around the game started turning around.</p>



<p>It is presently unclear whether CD PROJEKT RED will go to the trouble of making more Cyberpunk 2077 content to go with this series. It seems unlikely, though, as they are now deep into the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-is-officially-in-full-scale-production-game-director-is-confident-in-a-remarkable-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">production of The Witcher 4</a>.</p>

<figure><a title="Romero Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/62cb7c5b0b801/romero-games.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://x.com/romerogamesltd">@romerogamesltd</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>It's been another tough week for the video game industry and the fallout from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/romero-games-hit-with-layoffs-following-microsoft-xbox-cuts">Microsoft's layoffs led to funding cuts</a> at John and Brenda Romero's studio, Romero Games.</p>
<p>Now, following some claims the independant studio had completely shut its doors, Irish publication The Journal has got apparently got an official confirmation about this in a statement from Brenda Romero (<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/07/romero-games-shuttered-and-over-100-staff-axed-after-xbox-pulls-funding">thanks, Push Square</a>).</p>
<p>It's mentioned how the decision was made at a "high level" within Microsoft and well above the studio's own "visibility and control".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This absolutely isn’t a reflection of our team’s work, performance or the quality of the project itself. We hit every milestone on time, every time...We’re heartbroken that it’s come to this.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Romero Games reportedly employed 42 studio members "directly", with its broader network for its latest project at "more than 100" people.</p>
<p>An "anonymous" staff member of the Galway-based studio told the source it's been a "big shock" as the team had only had meetings with its publisher the "day before this happened". There was also apparently no warning, and it's further claimed there are "no remaining funds to continue operations".</p>
<p>John Romero is one of the co-creators of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/doom">DOOM</a>, and the studio he co-founded with his wife went on to release multiple titles including the strategy RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/empire_of_sin">Empire of Sin</a> for the Switch in 2020. The same developer also released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/doom-plus-doom-ii-switch-update-3-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">SIGIL and SIGIL 2</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/doom_plus_doom_ii">DOOM + DOOM II</a>.</p>

<p>While it might not be the launch title <em>everyone</em> was hoping for, it's still packed with plenty of things to do. This includes a new Knockout Tour mode, a whole world to free roam, and plenty of classic options like Grand Prix, local and online multiplayer, Time Trials, and Battle Mode.</p>
<p>So, how much time have you spent in Mario Kart World so far? What mode have you played the most and what would you rate the game now that you've had an entire month with it (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/of-course-mario-kart-world-is-being-review-bombed">and after that recent patch</a>)? Let us know by voting in our poll:</p>

Many subscribers can get their entire grocery orders delivered. But even if your Walmart doesn't have a full supermarket, it's still nice to be able to get free delivery on random products you'd normally have to drive to the store to buy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>For all the changes that <a href="https://duneawakening.com/">Funcom</a> has made to the world of Dune for the purposes of telling their own story in <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-1-million-copies-sold-creative-director-announces-major-changes-deep-desert-pve-pvp/">Dune: Awakening</a>, the large-scale multiplayer survival game is very faithful to plenty of key aspects of Dune lore.</p>



<p>The Fremen might have been eradicated in Funcom's version of Dune, but their technologies and impact are everywhere, as is the everlasting and iconic weapon, the Crysknife. </p>



<p>You can actually make your own Crysknife in Dune: Awakening, and this guide will show you how to do it. Unfortunately, this is one of the areas where Funcom made some significant changes to the lore that make the weapon more of a collectors item than anything else.</p>



<h2 id="h-dune-awakening-how-to-craft-a-crysknife-guide">Dune: Awakening - How To Craft A Crysknife Guide</h2>



<h3 id="h-ingredients-and-requirements">Ingredients and Requirements</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Before getting into the ingredients required for crafting your own Crysknife in Dune: Awakening, you'll need to have completed the Fourth Trial of Aql. Even if you have the ingredients, the option to craft an Unfixed Crysknife (which is the only kind you can craft) will not appear. Once you've completed the trial, the option to craft a crysknife will appear in your crafting menu.</p>



<p>The basics of crafting a Crysknife are easy, since you only need two items. One is Plant Fiber, the basic grass you pick up practically anywhere on Arrakis in order to craft healing items, and a bevy of other useful pieces of kit. The other, you might've been able to guess if you're a fan of the Dune universe, is the tooth of a sandworm. </p>



<p>That is a little more difficult to acquire, but not too much more difficult. All you need to do is get swallowed up by Shai-Hulud himself. When you respawn after giving yourself up to the worm and dying, you'll find the tooth of a worm in your inventory. It's possible that you'll need to do this twice, since there is also a cutscene that you'll see if you've never died to a sandworm before. </p>



<figure></figure>



<div><p>Critically, though, before you head out to into the desert to jump on some drumsand, make sure you've stored everything in a chest or storage unit in your base. Make sure you have absolutely no equipment on you whatsoever, not in your backpack, not on your person, nothing. You'll respawn, but the equipment you had on you when Shai-Hulud grabbed you for a snack won't. That will stay in his belly and will be lost forever. </p><p>This does not apply to quest items, though, so you don't need to run around emptying your inventory of items you can't be rid of without completing quests if you're hankering to make yourself a Crysknife as soon as possible. Everything else besides quest items that you can't take out of your inventory or off your person, is viable to be lost if you leave it with you when you go out worm-tooth gathering.</p></div>



<p>Once you have 1 Plant Fiber and 1 Worm Tooth, you'll be able to craft a Crysknife.</p>



<h3 id="h-sadly-the-crysknife-is-not-a-viable-weapon">Sadly, the Crysknife is not a Viable Weapon</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>On the one hand, the Crysknife is one of the most powerful weapons in the game, living up to the reputation it is given in the original Dune books. It deals 191.6 points of damage, which is sure to spill the water of anyone willing to stand in your way while you wield the ancient weapon.</p>



<div><p>The problem is that it's incredibly fragile, which is where Funcom's changes come in. It will break after that first swing. It has absolutely no durability and cannot be repaired. This is even the case for any potential Crysknives you may obtain after certain story beats, which is all I'll say without going into spoiler territory. Dune-heads will know that Crysknives are praised for their durability in the books, but that's not the case here. </p><p>It's an incredibly powerful weapon, living up to the legend, but, in Funcom's version of Dune, due to the eradication of the Fremen, it seems that no one knows how to make one that can withstand more than one strike. Or perhaps making it incredibly brittle is just Funcom's way of ensuring you're not walking around with a weapon that does 191.6 damage fairly early in the game. Or, it's a bit of both.</p></div>



<div><p>So yes, you can craft a Crysknife, and just like in the lore, it's not permitted to leave your side, meaning that it'll become a fixed item in your backpack until it's destroyed. Yes, it will still look cool, and yes, it's nice that Funcom has them in the game at all. </p><p>Unfortunately, it's not really something you use unless you want to deliver a powerful one-shot blow to an enemy, whether at a particularly significant moment in Dune: Awakening's story, or if you have some personal vendetta against an enemy that's made you particularly annoyed. You could try it in PvP scenarios, though, due to how hairy those can get, you're better off not leaving yourself unarmed after one strike.</p></div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/games-media-actually-had-a-good-week-for-once.1236231/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The impossible finally happened: We went a full week without a beloved video game publication being gutted or shut down. Instead, The Old Site <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-sale-keleops-go" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ended up in the hands of seemingly benign new owners</a>, and a new home for games writing, <a href="https://www.endlessmode.com/video-games/hi/endless-mode-its-the-new-thing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Endless Mode</a>, sprang forth from Paste’s media mini-empire. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we allow ourselves to experience a small amount of hope for the future.</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by Ethan Gach of Kotaku dot com and Garrett Martin of Endless Mode, two beneficiaries of the only good week for games media in the past century. We talk to both about the state of games journalism and their cautious optimism for the future now that MBA-brained business idiots seem to have moved on from blindly buying up websites for ponzi schemes.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we discuss decidedly less good news: Microsoft just <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laid off 9,000 more workers</a>, many of them in games, resulting in cancellations of multiple promising projects as well as <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-veterans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">general industry brain drain</a>. Finally, prompted by a mailbag question, we talk about the many cool world records we’ve broken, only some of which involve eating a waffle to discover a clue.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can overtake the Joe Rogan Experience on the podcast charts and confuse all the business idiots into believing they got out of the website business at the wrong time, throwing the entire ecosystem into chaos.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Ethan, you’ve been at Kotaku for pretty much its entire up-and-down cycle. Obviously Kotaku has, over that time period and due to a number of factors – none of which necessarily stem from the quality of writing being published – lost readers. What do you think contributed to that, and why was it entirely Jim Spanfeller?</p><p><strong>Ethan: </strong>I can neither confirm nor deny any Mr Spanfeller’s involvement in the success or decline of Kotaku. One of the things that I think is nice about doing subscriptions or having a physical product is, it’s very clear what you’re making and who you’re giving it to and what you can get from them – as opposed to this sort of amorphous internet machine where all of the ad tech is inscrutable to most people and is controlled by very few companies, and you’re increasingly at the whims of forces beyond your control. That’s very different from having a news stand and a direct relationship with people.</p><p>I think so much back to when I first joined Kotaku and what the expectations were – and not realizing at the time that it was kind of the peak of digital media, or maybe right after the peak. It was taken for granted that what people want to do when they’re sitting at work on their computer is visit websites and what people want to do on their phones is visit websites – and that websites are sort of the main distraction. Versus now: People joke about the pivot to video being so dumb and terrible, but that is the content format most people live in. So I think a large part of the decline is just people moving away from a certain medium of getting their information.&nbsp;</p><p>And what you have then is a flight of investors being like “OK, the numbers kept going up here, so we can make money by selling this to the next person. And once the numbers stop going up, we now have to make money off a sustainable business.” And there are far fewer people who want to do that. Kotaku was sold to what is essentially a mom ‘n’ pop media company; Paste is owned by a guy. There are individuals or small groups who might like the idea of running a media business in the same way as I might want to open a restaurant because I like food or I like seeing people. It might be hard to make money that way, but that’s how I want to make the money, because that’s how I want to spend my time.</p><p>I think media is shifting back to needing to rely on people who want to do media to do media and try to make money at it, versus the [mentality] of “We’re flipping houses right now; we’re gonna sell Vice to Disney for billions of dollars.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>The business-brained MBA dummies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ethan: </strong>Right, the dumb money. When that comes into any industry, things start to go off the rails because when any bubble bursts, immediately after the bubble things are worthless. Nobody wants them, or the right people who would want them can’t afford them. There’s an incongruency. The service people need or want is interesting writing. Do the majority of people in the world want to read about a game? 1) They probably don’t play games, and 2) they probably don’t want to read about them. But do millions of people want to read about games? Yes. Do hundreds of thousands of people want to pay to read good stuff about games? Probably. And so I think it’s a matter of finding a sustainable way to do that.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game"><h3>Sid Meier’s Colonization Is The American Video Game</h3></a><p>No game has told the American story better, whether intentionally or not</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/chatgpt-crunchyroll-ai-subtitles-necronomicon"><h3>Crunchyroll Says Anime’s ChatGPT Subtitling Came From Third-Party Vendor, Goes Against Its Policies</h3></a><p>Cyangames’ VR video game anime Necronomicon and the Cosmic Horror Show subtitles had “ChatGPT” smack-dap in its German subtitling

<p>Who needs an OLED TV when you have a widescreen CRT TV?</p>
<p>Okay, genuinely, CRT scanlines are gorgeous and we have a huge soft spot for these chunky units. Sitting on the floor, looking up at the screen as we ran around in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">Ocarina of Time</a>; pure bliss.</p>
<p>The Switch 2, with its 120fps capabilities and VRR in handheld, is a much more powerful console than the N64 (duh!). So why on earth would we want to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> on a 27 inch CRT TV?</p>
<p>Well, our lovely video producer Zion is here to show you just what playing a Switch 2 on a CRT TV is like, and honestly? It's magical. From newer titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> to retro indie throwbacks like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/celeste">Celeste</a>, Zion's running down the wonderful nostalgia of playing games on an old TV.</p>
<p>Is it the <em>best</em> way to play the Switch 2? No way. Is it fascinating? Heck yes. It takes a fair bit of set-up and it'll vary depending on what kind of TV you have, but if you're interested, check out Zion's video up top and let us know in the comments whether you want to try this out</p>

<p>But new catches, new games, and a new studio are in the net</p>

<figure><a title="Dredge" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4c2c5ca2c7e18/dredge.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team17</em></figcaption></figure><p>Lovecraftian fishing game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dredge">Dredge</a> was a hit back in 2023, blending unsettling horror and sea creatures with atmospheric storytelling and some good ol' reeling in. Now, after some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/08/reminder-dredges-new-expansion-update-the-iron-rig-is-out-now">paid DLC</a> and free updates, the New Zealand-based developer is ready to move on from the seas and create something brand new — and "No, it's not Dredge 2".</p>
<p>Sharing the news on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/blacksaltgames.com/post/3lt3r7344a22o">Bluesky</a>, the team's next title will be an open-world RPG in a new world and setting. It'll still be dark, of course, but it's something <em>very</em> different from the studio's first shipment.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wmxnlj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>But that's not the only new announcement; Black Salt has expanded and opened up a second development studio, called Disc 2 Games. "Think bright, colourful and 90's retro!" says the announcement post. Oh, <em>we're thinking, all right.</em></p>

<p>“We’ve taken DREDGE as far as we can technically – especially while continuing to support players on previous-gen consoles,” producer and CEO of Disc 2 Nadia Thorne shared in <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-US/Black-Salt-Games-Announces-New-Studio-and-Next-Projects">a press release</a>. The studio is eager to "turn our attention to something new” and move on.</p>
<p>Programmer and writer at Black Salt Games Joel Mason echoes Thorne's sentiments, saying "It's reaffirming to know that players enjoy the types of worlds that we want to create - and gives us the confidence to try to do it again."</p>
<p>In terms of Disc 2, the studio has apparently been working on their debut game "for a bit over a year now" says technical director Kris Nicholson. And, despite the proposed colourful facade of the upcoming game, creative director Johannes Otte is setting our expectations appropriately; "beneath this polished surface lies a gritty world, waiting for players to immerse themselves in and join our characters in rebelling against.”</p>
<p>This is fantastic news to read in an industry that feels like it's collapsing in on itself sometimes, and we can't wait to see more from both studios.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Metal Gear and Death Stranding creator Hideo Kojima recently echoed Tom Cruise when talking about his future plans, declaring: "I want to keep creating things until I die."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since starting out in the industry at Konami in 1986, Kojima has created a variety of games, including Snatcher, the innovative sunlight-based GBA title Boktai, and the infamous P.T. demo. In a recent interview centering around Kojima’s latest game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/06/26/154443.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game*Spark</a> asked Kojima about his motivations and thoughts on why he continues to make games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m the same as Tom Cruise (laughs)," he said. "My life has been dedicated to creating things. That is my joy. I want to create for as long as my body and my brain keep working. I will think about (stopping) if it begins to inconvenience the people around me, but I want to keep creating things until I die.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/04/gettyimages-2222468111-1751642076261.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Hideo Kojima says he shares one thing in common with Tom Cruise.

On the red carpet, Cruise told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/tom-cruise-making-movies-into-100s-mission-impossible-1236220928/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a> that he will never stop making movies, even quipping that intends to keep making them into his 100s.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Talking of movies, in Kojima’s comment to Game*Spark, he didn't specify creating games, just <em>creating</em>. This suggests that Kojima is open to making something that is not a game in the future. In a recent video interview with French media outlet <a href="https://youtu.be/TfqoXqWsOt0?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brut</a>, Kojima revealed that, depending on how Kojima Productions is doing after it has completed Microsoft game OD and Sony game Physint, he would like to make a movie.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With their long cutscenes and cinematic presentation, some have argued that many of Kojima’s games are already movie-like (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-of-kojimas-games-are-actually-cutscenes-we-did-the-maths">we’ve even worked out exactly how much of each Kojima game is cutscenes</a>). However, in the interview with Game*Spark, Kojima addresses this, explaining that even though his games are influenced by movies, he is always focused on making a game first and foremost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I grew up watching movies, so they influence the lighting, character modeling, direction and so on (when I make a game), but I am conscious of the fact that I am not making a movie, and my fundamental approach is to consider what can only be done in a game, including an odd sense of playfulness," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima’s playfulness is evident in some of the unexpected cameos and bizarre Easter eggs you can find in his games, especially if you mess about. Check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/Secrets_and_Easter_Eggs">list of the Death Stranding 2 Easter Eggs, cheats and secrets</a> we’ve found so far, or find out about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-why-is-sam-singing-and-dancing-in-the-hotspring-hideo-kojimas-nostalgic-japanese-comedy-legends-easter-egg-explained">the strange things you can make Sam do in the hotsprings</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Kojima is associated with a movie: an adaptation of Death Stranding itself, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-star-norman-reedus-says-he-would-of-course-play-himself-in-the-upcoming-movie-if-it-was-an-option">which Norman Reedus has said he'd love to star in</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for Kojima Productions.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/tariffs-rising-costs-us-consumers-spending-less-video-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tariffs-and-rising-costs-will-have-us-consumers-spending-less-on-video-games-says-analyst.1236171/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/us-consumers-will-cut-back-on-buying">The Game Business</a> as part of the publication's Summer Game Fest event details a presentation from Circana analyst and executive director, Mat Piscatella, who shows how US consumers are pulling back from spending on entertainment areas, video games included, due to the rising cost of essentials like food and shelter, and the potential impact of tariffs on the price of games and other goods.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Tariffs and Affordability: The US Consumer In Limbo" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F7-9rr_Cuhk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As a Circana analyst, and with the wide range of industries that Circana collects data from, Piscatella has the ability to see the details in consumer spending in the US, and shows clearly how US consumers are concerned over the impact that tariffs will have on the prices of everything, from essential goods like food to the cost of clothes, and, key to Piscatella's specialization, video games. </p>



<p>Whether people are opposed or in support of tariffs, a clear majority (69%) think that tariffs will result in high costs, The Game Business and Piscatella report. To make up for those rising costs, per Circana's data, 30% of consumers will spend less on video games and entertainment subscriptions, with more of their spending money going towards the essentials, as Circana has also tracked that the average cost of food has gone up 2.3% compared to 2024, the cost of utilities has gone up 15.7%, car insurance has gone up 5.4%, and shelter has gone up 4%.</p>



<p>Since the Trump administration first announced its tariffs in April, the response we've seen from players in the US has been a concern for rising prices. Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/">paused pre-orders of the Nintendo Switch 2</a> in the US while it accessed the potential impact of tariffs. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-reveals-the-esa-expects-trumps-tariffs-to-have-a-detrimental-impact-on-the-video-game-industry/">ESA expressed its belief that tariffs will have a "<em>detrimental impact on the video game industry</em>,</a>" and even in The Game Business' report this week, expressed that it has been trying to relay to the Trump administration the significance of the video game industry in the US, and how tariffs could negatively impact what is a $59 billion industry in the US alone.</p>



<p>When pre-orders for the Switch 2 were finally announced, the price of the console stayed the same, but the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-us-hardware-pricing-stays-the-same-accessories-bump/">cost of accessories went up</a>. There's also still the chance that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-president/">cost of the console will increase due to tariffs</a>.</p>



<p>Of course, it's not just the cost of Nintendo products that has a <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-is-considering-a-ps5-price-increase-in-the-us-in-response-to-tariffs/">chance of increasing</a>. With costs going up on essentials, and tariffs looming as a greater threat to raise costs further, the downturn that the industry has been in might not end anytime soon.</p>



<p>When Grand Theft Auto VI arrives, it'll be a much-needed shot in the arm for the video game industry, but it remains to be seen how long the impact of that shot will last.</p>

            <p>In bygone ages, Christian clerics would spend decades hunched over scrolls of vellum and parchment, ornamenting the text with scenes of questing knights, creeping chimeras, spiralling verdure, and perhaps the occasional bare bottom, as a treat. They would sacrifice their wits and tendons to the cultivation of microcosms, planted in the eyes of capital Os, or growing around the bars of capital Es.</p>
<p>Now, you can crap on their efforts by slapping together rad illuminated pages in seconds in a video game editor.

<p>"Fulfil orders from prestigious patrons by making your own designs on pages of medieval books," explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3119540/Scriptorium_Master_of_Manuscripts/">the Steam page</a>. "Create, get paid, and unlock new orders, design elements, and grow your workshop. And with time and practice, your works and fame may reach the Queen herself!"</p>
<p>There are over 1000 scene elements to choose from, all apparently based on real-life medieval manuscript art, and client requests will range from the "quaint" to the "bizarre". You can also take on commissions from let's players, via mechanisms yet to be explained, and "export your in-game designs and create medieval memes to share with your friends".</p>
<p>Memes, eh. Hildegard of Bingen is spinning in her grave.</p>
<p>The playtest includes a stretch of the game's story mode, where you can complete 17 commissions for six clients. There's also a sandbox mode, which includes all the assets from the story. This being a playtest, expect "bugs, rough edges, and weirdness". You might want to try Inkulinati out, too - Rachel (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-you-enjoyed-pentiment-inkulinatis-cheeky-ink-based-strategy-is-a-great-history-lesson">expressed enthusiasm</a> for its monk-on-monk action and "uppity bishop cats".

<p>No one could USB-C this...</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Switch 1 and Switch 2 USB-C" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/75ab9eb41aa1c/switch-1-and-switch-2-usb-c.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>With the launch of the Switch 2, accessory manufacturers have been rushing to bring their products to the market in a bid to offer alternatives to Nintendo's own set, including docks. The latter has been causing headaches for many, and it seems Nintendo has put in place restrictions on the console's USB-C ports.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/695915/switch-2-usb-c-third-party-docks-dont-work-authentication-encryption">The Verge's Sean Hollister</a> has been looking into the Switch 2's USB-C port and was told this was the case after speaking to two accessory manufacturers. What should happen is that, when the console is popped into a dock via the USB-C adapter, it kicks off a series of commands that allow the power supply/dock to output video. That's an <em>extremely</em> oversimplified explanation. That's not happening when you connect the Switch 2 to most third-party docks, however.</p>
<p>According to The Verge's sources, the Switch 2 uses a new kind of dedicated encryption chip and scheme and, upon testing, Hollister saw (as he puts it) "the new Nintendo Switch not behaving like a good USB citizen should".</p>
<p>As a result, companies like Jsaux have told The Verge that it's halted plans to make a Switch 2 dock because they simply can't get around the problem right now. Hollister has found some docks that work so far — the <strong>SIWIQU for Nintendo Switch 2 Dock Station</strong>, AverMedia's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EwdSkzN7Iw&amp;ab_channel=AVerMediaContentCreators">own dock</a>, and Viture's virtual glasses hub.</p>
<p>Others on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1lmbroo/siwiqu_antank_s3_max_dock_works_perfectly/">NintendoSwitch2 subreddit</a> say the same thing about the SIWIQU, but there's understandable caution when very few <em>actually</em> work, and when early Switch 1 docks also caused problems.</p>

<p>Manufacturers expect Nintendo will try to "maintain device and system security" via updates, and the Switch 2 does have extra fans — including a fan in the dock itself — as the console runs a little hotter than the Switch 1. It may well be that there's something in Nintendo's upscaling tech that's causing issues with other docks. Or, it could just be that Nintendo is trying to prevent any potential issues that may be caused by unofficial docks.</p>
<p>It's a more powerful dock all around, and it does much more than the Switch 1's ever did. So it looks like this will be an ongoing battle, though we're sure that we'll see plenty of third-party options pop up in the future.</p>
<p><em>Let us know what you think of Nintendo's potential restrictions in the comments</em>.</p>

			<p>Capcom has announced a new Resident Evil mobile game called Resident Evil Survival Unit. Developers Joycity and Aniplex are leading development on it while working in collaboration with Capcom.</p>



<p>Survival Unit is currently being described as a real-time strategy game, though full details on it are still to come at a <a href="https://www.residentevil-survivalunit.com/en">livestream presentation</a> that'll take place next week on <strong>July 10, 2025, at 3pm PT / 6pm ET / 11pm BST</strong>. We at least know that it'll arrive on iOS and Android devices, and that it'll be available in North America, Europe, Japan, South Korea, and Asia.</p>

<p>While a new real-time strategy mobile game might not be the most exciting thing to Resident Evil fans who are just counting the days until <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-started-as-an-open-world-game-before-capcom-realized-it-wasnt-what-fans-wanted-to-see-or-play/">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, what is significant about Resident Evil Survival Unit is that the co-creator of the Kingdom Hearts games, Shinji Hashimoto, is behind the game. He even announced the project during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9WogwxRWbI">Anime Expo Lite livestream</a>, where he expressed that its a project he's been working on bringing to light for some time.</p>



<p>"<em>The title offers a fresh take on the 'Resident Evil' universe,</em>" Hashimoto said, "<em>introducing a strategy game system designed specifically for mobile users. While distinct from Capcom's traditional 'Resident Evil' series, it delivers a unique experience that stays true to the essence of the franchise.</em>"</p>
