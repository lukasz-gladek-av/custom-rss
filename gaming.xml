            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>THQ Nordic and developer Grimlore Games have announced that their action RPG&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest II&nbsp;</em>has hit a big sales milestone just three days out from its release.</p>

<p>Speaking on <a href="https://x.com/TitanQuestGame/status/1952717544046915624" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media</a>, the two studios confirmed that&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest II</em>, which was released in Early Access on PC via Steam on August 1st, managed to hit 300,000 sales just under 72 hours after its launch.</p>

<p>The game has already managed to reach number 17 on Steam's top sellers list at time of writing, beating out longtime stalwarts like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sims-4" rel="nofollow"><em>The Sims 4</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/rimworld" rel="nofollow"><em>RimWorld</em></a>, and Valve's own&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/team-fortress-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Team Fortress 2</em></a>&nbsp;(two of which are, admittedly, free-to-play, but microtransactions are a big business, after all).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/titan-quest-ii-sales-300k-72-hours-combat.jpg?itok=B4QWuFGx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/titan-quest-ii-sales-300k-72-hours-combat.jpg?itok=b0dMkBX_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Titan Quest II&nbsp;</em>has hit 300,000 sales in just 72 hours.</figcaption></figure><p>On Steam's weekly top sellers list, meanwhile,&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest II&nbsp;</em>is sitting at number six, putting it ahead of hits like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/peak-2m-sales" rel="nofollow">indie smash&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/peak-2m-sales" rel="nofollow">Peak</a>&nbsp;</em>and NetEase's free-to-play comic book hero shooter extravaganza&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/marvel-rivals" rel="nofollow"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a>.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest II&nbsp;</em>is, it's the sequel to the 2006 action RPG&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest</em>, which was developed by the Massachusetts-based studio Iron Lore.</p>

<p>Sadly, following the release of the original&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest</em>, Iron Lore folded, but former members of the studio would go on to found Crate Entertainment, whose name you might recognize from action RPG (and unofficial&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest&nbsp;</em>spiritual successor)&nbsp;<em>Grim Dawn</em>.</p>

<p>The new game, meanwhile, is being helmed by German outfit Grimlore Games, the studio responsible for fantasy RTS&nbsp;<em>SpellForce 3&nbsp;</em>(but not for 2023's spinoff&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/spellforce-conquest-of-eo" rel="nofollow"><em>SpellForce: Conquest of Eo</em></a>, if you're still following me).</p>




<p><em>Titan Quest II&nbsp;</em>pits you against Nemesis, the Goddess of Retribution, who is "corrupting the Threads of Fate and condemning all who oppose her to Eternal Punishment". You'll be battling creatures from Greek mythology in&nbsp;<em>Diablo</em>-style action RPG combat to put a stop to her schemes.</p>

<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest II&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1154030/Titan_Quest_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, where it'll set you back $23.99 (at time of writing; it's available at a 20% discount right now).</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-wont-feature-at-upcoming-indie-world-showcase-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksong-won%E2%80%99t-feature-at-upcoming-indie-world-showcase-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1263285/</guid>

<p>A new claim suggests that Hollow Knight: Silksong will not be featured during the Indie World Showcase this week, on August 7, 2025. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Nintendo recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-indie-world-showcase-for-august-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> an Indie World Showcase for this week, and what surprised players was that the announcement came less than a week after their Nintendo Direct <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-july-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Partner Showcase</a>. Many players got their hopes high, thinking they might get to see more of Hollow Knight: Silksong at this event, but new reports say otherwise. </p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-is-not-on-the-cards-for-indie-world-showcase">Hollow Knight: Silksong is ‚ÄòNot on the Cards‚Äô for Indie World Showcase</h2>



<p>The claim about Hollow Knight: Silksong comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tuvr5j3HvXQ&amp;t=203s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SwitchForce</a> (via <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/08/06/nintendo-indie-world-leaker-says-hollow-knight-silksong-wont-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MyNintendoNews</a>), the person responsible for leaking a Nintendo showcase for this week. In his new YouTube video, SwitchForce states that, as far as he is aware, Hollow Knight: Silksong is ‚Äúnot on the cards‚Äù for the upcoming event, and he doesn‚Äôt expect it to get the ‚ÄúIndie World treatment‚Äù as it‚Äôs grown far bigger than that. </p>



<p>SwitchForce notes that players will be able to see Hollow Knight: Silksong at Gamescom, as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-playable-demo-confirmed-by-xbox-for-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo</a> will also be available there. He added that ‚Äúa lot of the marketing has now shifted towards Xbox‚Äù for the upcoming title, and they will be ‚Äúhousing that demo for their upcoming portables at Gamescom. </p>

<p>The last update we received for Hollow Knight: Silksong was in June, when the game‚Äôs website <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-website-receives-big-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">underwent a major refresh</a>. Additionally, a leaker has claimed that the game is expected to release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-before-end-of-summer-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">before the end of Summer 2025</a>.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">There's no question that continuing the success of the PlayStation 5 is one of Sony's top priorities, especially given that its latest console is getting closer to five years old. The Japanese tech giant has yet to formally announce the PlayStation 6, but over the past few months there have been some developments that have allowed us some rare insight into what shape the eventual console might take.</p><p dir="ltr">In this post, we're rounding up everything we know about Sony's PlayStation 6, a potential new Sony handheld, and what the future of console gaming might look like. Keep checking back for more as we update this post as new information comes to light the closer we get to an eventual release date in the next few years.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="PS6_Release_Date__Potential_Price">PS6 Release Date, Potential Price</h4><p dir="ltr">Since no formal announcement has been made for the PlayStation 6, there's no release window to speak of. Taking the company's previous console generation cadence into consideration, one could assume that a PS6 could release in 2027. That would be seven years after the PS5, which itself launched seven years after the PS3. But the gaming industry has changed dramatically since then, which is evident in how long support for the PS4 has stuck around this far into a new generation of hardware. Former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida recently shared that "2028 feels right" when asked about the PS6, but notably hasn't been at Sony since the end of 2024.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite this, Sony Interactive Entertainment‚Äòs new president and CEO <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/playstation-6-sony-says-future-platforms-top-of-mind-exploring-new-and-enhanced-ways-to-play/" rel="nofollow ">Hideaki Nishino stated in a business segment meeting</a> in 2024 that "the future of the (PlayStation) platform is top of mind. We are committed to exploring a new and enhanced way for players to engage with our content and services.‚Äù</p><p dir="ltr">Pricing would be similarly difficult to estimate, especially without any indication of the hardware specification that Sony is targeting. Most recently, Sony released the PS5 Pro, which retailed for $700 and offers the most powerful console-gaming experience on the market. That was a $200 premium over the price of the PS5 at launch. Whether the PS6 matches the pricing of the best PS5 on the market or falls between the two has yet to be seen, and will likely be affected by the continuing trade war and inflation.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="PS6_Potential_Specs">PS6 Potential Specs</h4><p dir="ltr">Sony has committed to hardware in the face of the growing popularity of cloud-based services, saying that the majority of players still want a console that plays games locally.</p><p dir="ltr">"Cloud gaming is increasingly providing an additional option for players to access content, but our belief is that the majority of players continue to want to play and experience gaming through local execution without dependency on network conditions," Nishino said. "PS5 and PS5 Pro have validated this thesis, I believe."</p><p dir="ltr">There are no current concrete specifications for the PS6, but we do at least know that AMD will be providing hardware for the next-generation console. This shouldn't be that surprising, given that AMD has powered both the PS4 and PS5, and could bode well for backwards compatibility.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="PS6__The_Role_of_AI">PS6: The Role of AI</h4><p dir="ltr">Sony's partnership with AMD extends beyond hardware alone. Sony announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324317/amd-playstation-ai-work-better-graphics-project-amethyst" rel="nofollow ">Project Amethyst</a> in partnership with AMD when lead architect Mark Cerny revealed the news during the PS5 Pro breakdown, suggesting that the two companies are planning to work closely together on the future of graphical enhancements and the hardware that empowers it.</p><p dir="ltr">This has already borne fruit, with Cerny saying that the latest version on the PS5 Pro-exclusive upscaler, PSSR, will be using AMD's recently released RDNA 4 suite of AI-powered upscaling options, which debuted with the RX 9070 series of graphics cards. Cerny says that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pros-pssr-will-get-an-upgrade-in-2026/1100-6530019/">latest version of PSSR </a>will be a drop-in replacement for the current implementation in 2026 and, more importantly, it will help inform the future of this technology for newer hardware.</p><p dir="ltr">While AMD is expected to release new graphics cards in 2026 that support a newer version of RDNA, Cerny cautioned that Sony isn't exactly beholden to the same timelines. "AMD is moving extremely quickly," <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/playstation/sonys-mark-cerny-explains-why-your-ps5-pro-is-getting-an-upgrade-in-2026" rel="nofollow ">Cerny said</a>. "What I'm trying to do is prepare for the next generation of consoles, so my timeframe is multi-year here."</p><p dir="ltr">What this all means is that hardware is no longer the only determining factor in the power of a future console. PSSR is only supported on the PS5 Pro currently, given its requirement for hardware to drive its AI-powered upscaling, and suggests the same will be true for the PS6. AMD is expected to power the next Xbox too, and the ways in which both Microsoft and Sony work with AMD might determine how well any platform-specific branches of these upscaling features work. Those alone could be big differentiators during the next console generation.</p><p dir="ltr">With that said, AMD Computing &amp; Graphics SVP and GM Jack Huynh did state in a <a href="https://x.com/JackMHuynh/status/1940049247920943136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1940049247920943136%7Ctwgr%5Ef7c487b8895af695c0410a305a57a77e4f7492d6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playstationlifestyle.net%2F2025%2F07%2F01%2Fps6-push-boundaries-graphically-amd-playstation%2F" rel="nofollow ">tweet</a> about Project Amethyst that AMD and Sony are "developing high-quality neural networks that push the boundaries of real-time game graphics," suggesting that the PS6 will hopefully be a meaningful leap forward in terms of visual rendering that some have suggested was lacking with the PS5.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="A_PlayStation_Handheld_With_The_PS6_">A PlayStation Handheld With The PS6?</h4><p dir="ltr">According to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-reportedly-developing-a-ps5-portable-system/1100-6528023/">Bloomberg report in 2024</a>, Sony is potentially in the planning phases of a new gaming handheld--the company's first since the PS Vita. The handheld is reportedly being designed to play PS5 games natively, but might still be years away from announcement if Sony decides to pursue its development.</p><p dir="ltr">Sony did launch the PS Portal in 2023, which initially acted solely as a means to play your PS5 games remotely over a local network. It has since received an update to add the ability to stream games from the cloud to expand its capabilities away from your console.</p><p dir="ltr">The PS Portal was reportedly initially conceived as a new handheld platform entirely before plans changed closer to its release. Given its popularity, and that of other handheld consoles such as the Nintendo Switch 2, Steam Deck, and Asus ROG Ally, Sony might be thinking the time is right for another attempt at the handheld market. Microsoft is planning the same too, albeit with a partnership with Asus for the time being.</p>

<p>The original Fallout was created as a sequel to EA‚Äôs 1988 title, Wasteland, Interplay‚Äôs former co-founder has revealed. However, they did all they could to avoid being sued by EA. </p>



<p>The original Fallout title came almost a decade after (1997) the first Wasteland game (1988), and both games had the same developers, Interplay. However, Wasteland was published by EA, and Fallout was developed and published by Interplay. Now, Interplay‚Äôs co-founder has revealed that many people are unaware that Fallout was a sequel to Wasteland. </p>



<h2 id="h-interplay-did-everything-to-avoid-being-sued-by-ea">Interplay Did Everything to Avoid Being Sued by EA</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fallout/fallout-was-a-sequel-to-wasteland-says-interplay-co-founder-and-we-did-everything-we-could-not-to-be-sued-by-electronic-arts-after-the-devs-had-to-pivot-out-of-the-follow-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, Brian Fargo, the co-founder of Interplay, revealed new details about Fallout and Wasteland during an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjeRn2eA3y4&amp;t=2766s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mr.MattyPlays</a>. Fargo explicitly stated that a lot of people don‚Äôt know that Fallout ‚Äúwas a sequel to Wasteland.‚Äù Fargo explained that players are unaware of the story behind it, but ‚Äúthat‚Äôs why it went from tunnels and trolls and then we needed a system ‚Äì mercenaries, spies, and private eyes ‚Äì and then that‚Äôs how we got the skill-based system with Wasteland, and then that went to Fallout.‚Äù</p>

<p>The former co-founder explains that while developing Fallout, even though it took heavy inspiration from Wasteland, Interplay did everything they could ‚Äúnot to be sued by Electronic Arts‚Äù. Fallout even had ‚Äúyour life ends in the Wasteland‚Äù, Fargo stated. However, he loves that the game has an origin story that he is very proud of, and he learned a lot from his time on the original Wasteland. </p>



<p>Fargo eventually did make sequels for the Wasteland series as the studio head at inExile Entertainment, with Wasteland 2 releasing in 2014 and Wasteland 3 releasing in 2020. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded embraces unity and squad goals. With multiplayer available, implementing crossplay is a must, but it isn‚Äôt always easy. This handy guide has answers to all key crossplay and cross-progression questions.</p>



<p>The Coalition could have simply brought back Gears 1‚Äôs campaign, and that‚Äôs it. But no, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> has the campaign, co-op, and authentic multiplayer. It‚Äôs the complete package for one of the most beloved shooters of our time.</p>



<p>The second you mention multiplayer, the word ‚Äòcrossplay‚Äô usually follows. Many games utilize crossplay, so let‚Äôs see if Gears of War: Reloaded is the same.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-crossplay-in-gears-of-war-reloaded">Is There Crossplay in Gears of War: Reloaded?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>My brother. Credit to The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Gears of War: Reloaded boasts complete crossplay functionality at launch, meaning you can hop into online campaign sessions and multiplayer matches with players from other formats.</strong></p>



<p>It really is the total package, isn‚Äôt it? The Coalition has confirmed through the official <a href="https://www.gearsofwar.com/games/gears-reloaded/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reloaded</a> website that the game has: ‚ÄúCrossplay across platforms, allowing you and your friends to squad-up wherever you play.‚Äù</p>



<p>There‚Äôs nothing wrong with you flying solo. However, if you desperately need allies to help you complete the impossible Insane difficulty, crossplay allows you to team up and take down Locusts without restrictions.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-gears-of-war-reloaded-have-cross-progression">Does Gears of War: Reloaded Have Cross-Progression?</h2>



<p><strong>Cross-progression is available for Gears of War: Reloaded, which allows you to transfer your save data across compatible platforms.</strong></p>



<p>We‚Äôre two for two so far in this guide! We defer to Reloaded‚Äôs official site once more on this one: ‚ÄúJump from one platform to another and your campaign saves as well as multiplayer progression will come with you.‚Äù</p>



<p>This is two-fold:</p>



<ul>
<li>You can save your campaign progress on one format and resume where you left off elsewhere.</li>



<li>Your online multiplayer data you‚Äôve accrued is also transferable across Reloaded‚Äôs applicable platforms.</li>
</ul>



<p>You‚Äôre not hindered by one platform. Let me explain more about that below for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-platforms-is-gears-of-war-reloaded-crossplay-compatible-with">Which Platforms is Gears of War: Reloaded Crossplay Compatible With?</h2>



<p><strong>Gears of War: Reloaded‚Äôs crossplay and cross-progression functions apply to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</strong></p>



<p>You can buy and own Reloaded on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. In short, any save data on one console can be loaded on another or a PC. I know many of you own multiple platforms in this day and age, so it‚Äôs nice to see The Coalition fully embrace this.</p>



<p>Sorry to Nintendo Switch 2 owners, it doesn‚Äôt look like there‚Äôs any love for you guys right now.</p>



<hr>



<p>Gears of War: Reloaded has everything and more. Is it an easy day-one purchase for you? What‚Äôs the first thing you‚Äôll do when you get it? Let me know through the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

<p>Starting February 25, 2026, all in-game purchases for the PS4 edition will be removed from the PlayStation Store, and all update support for Genshin Impact will end on April 8, 2026. This will result in players no longer being able to log in to the game on PS4. MiHoYo says it will start reminding players of this change later this year. As for the mobile versions of Genshin Impact, <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/40408846" rel="nofollow ">MiHoYo says</a> those devices will need to meet these updated requirements:</p><h3>Genshin Impact: Updated Minimum and Recommended Android Requirements</h3><ul><li>ARMv8-A 64-bit architecture</li><li>Non-PowerVR GPU</li><li>SoC: Snapdragon 660 (Adreno 610) or Helio G88 (Snapdragon 855 or Dimensity 1000 or Kirin 980 and above recommended)</li><li>RAM: 4GB (6GB or more recommended)</li><li>Operating System: Android 10.0 and above (Android 12.0 and above recommended)</li></ul><h3>Genshin Impact: Updated Minimum and Recommended iOS Requirements</h3><ul><li>Supported iOS devices: iPhone 8 Plus or iPhone X, iPad mini (5th generation) or iPad Air (3rd generation) or iPad (8th generation) and later models (iPhone 12 series or iPad (9th generation) and later models recommended)</li><li>iPhone devices with Apple A11 or later, or iPad devices with Apple A12 or above</li><li>RAM: 3GB (4GB or more recommended)</li><li>Operating System: iOS 13.0 and above</li></ul><p>While Genshin Impact could be losing a chunk of its audience with the discontinuation of the PS4 edition, it is worth noting that the number of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/over-4-years-later-ps5-has-more-monthly-users-than-ps4/1100-6532430/">monthly active users on PS5 recently surpassed those on PS4</a>, according to Sony. Both consoles had a combined playerbase of 124 million users--as of March 31--and spending on peripherals, services, and content has also increased on PlayStation consoles.</p><p>Genshin Impact is also playable on PC and Xbox Series X|S, and MiHoYo has several other live-service games under its umbrella like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/honkai-star-rail/">Honkai: Star Rail</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/zenless-zone-zero/">Zenless Zone Zero</a>.</p>

            <p>The Humble bundle building team has detailed its August Choice collection of games, which includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5-royal">Persona 5 Royal</a>, Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden and My Time at Sandrock, to name three.</p>
<p>The Humble Choice subscription offering provides a monthly set of PC games which members claim to own forever. This month, members can get their hands on the following titles as part of their Humble subscription:</p>
<ul>
<li>Persona 5 Royal</li>
<li>Banishers: Ghost of New Eden</li>
<li>My Time at Sandrock</li>
<li>Let's School!</li>
<li>Lil Gator Game</li>

<p>In addition, members can also get a month of IGN Plus. This includes unlimited use of IGN's in-game maps and guides, and disables ads across the site.

<p>As ever, Choice membership fees include a five percent donation to charity. This month's charity is DonorsChoose. Here's a little bit about it all:</p>
<p>"DonorsChoose is the leading way to give to public schools. Since 2000, 6.5 million people and partners have contributed $1.8bn to support more than three million teacher requests for classroom resources and experiences.</p>
<p>"As the most trusted crowdfunding platform for teachers, donors, and district administrators alike, DonorsChoose vets each request, ships the funded resources directly to the classroom, and provides thank yous and reporting to donors and school leaders."</p>
<p>You can find more information via <a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/">donorschoose.org</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>So, what of the games themselves? Personally, i quite like the sound of Wildmender, pictured above, which is described as a "desert gardening survival game".</p>
<p>Then there's My Time At Sandrock , which fully released in 2023, after a successful Kickstarter in 2020 followed by an early access period in 2022. It's a follow-up to My Time at Portia, and treads a similar path to its gentle farming and life simulation predecessor, though this time set in sandier frontier-esque surroundings.</p>
<p>Banishers: Ghost of New Eden, meanwhile, is a supernatural action-RPG from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> studio Don't Nod. We awarded it four out of five stars on its release. "Don't Nod drops the melodrama for a poignantly performed story about grief and injustice, where the difficult choices tug at your heart and principles," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-review">Eurogamer's Banishers: Ghost of New Eden review</a>.</p>
<p>You can check out this month's <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/membership">full Choice bundle collection via Humble here</a>.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/starfield-highly-requested-feature/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starfield-could-be-getting-a-higly-requested-feature-in-the-future.1263225/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Starfield could be getting a highly requested feature in <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-beta-update-bethesda-reiterates-exciting-things/">future patches</a>, judging from some recent findings.</p>



<p>As reported on the game's subreddit, plenty of evidence has been found in the code of the latest two updates which suggests that an <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-mod-interplanetary-engines-adds-in-system-travel-without-using-the-console/">interplanetary travel mechanic</a> that would allow players to travel between two different planets in the same system, which is a feature many have been asking for since the game's release, could be in the works. Sadly, seamless space to planet surface landing doesn't seem to be in the works, at least going by the game's current code, so we shouldn't expect the game by Bethesda to suddenly turn into Elite Dangerous or No Man's Sky anytime soon, if ever.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Although there's the chance that this feature will never make it into the game for any reason, the fact that a new big feature is seemingly in the works aligns with other rumors that have been circulating on Starfield these past few weeks. Reportedly, new quality-of-life improvements are coming to the game, alongside a second expansion, when the game will debut on PlayStation 5 during <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-2026-poor-sales/">Spring 2026</a>. The PlayStation 5 release was originally planned for <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-announced-playstation-5/">this year</a>, but a decision to delay this new version of the game to 2026 was made folliwing the low sales of the first expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">Shattered Space</a>.</p>



<p>Although&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">I did enjoy Starfield</a>&nbsp;when it launched in 2023, my opinion of the game soured rather quickly as I returned to it before the launch of the Shattered Space expansion, which did little to alleviate the base game's most critical issues. Hopefully, the rumored new quality of life improvements and the new expansion will breathe new life into a game that has yet to achieve the full potential its solid foundation offers.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending-next-year.1263222/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced that&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>PS4 support will be ending next year, and that various functions relating to the game's PS4 version will be winding down over the next few months as well.</p>

<p>As revealed in an <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/40408849" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">article</a> on the HoYoverse website, support for&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>on PS4 will end on April 10th next year, at which point you'll no longer be able to log into the game on Sony's last-gen machine.</p>

<p>Additionally, from September 10th this year, if you've never downloaded&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>on PS4 before, you'll no longer be able to do so. If, however, you have downloaded the game on your PS4 prior to that date, you'll still be able to download it again if you wish (until April, anyway).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending-characters.jpg?itok=d6YKi40B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending-characters.jpg?itok=x-84fIr6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Genshin Impact</em>'s PS4 support is ending next year.</figcaption></figure><p>Following the PS4 version's delisting in September, in-game purchases will be removed from this version of&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>on February 25th next year, but if you've bought anything and have yet to claim it, you can do so until April.</p>

<p>Naturally, this delisting won't affect the PS5 version of&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>, nor will it have any impact (ahem) on other platforms like PC or mobile, so you'll still be able to play it everywhere else it's currently available.</p>

<p>As for why the game is being removed from PS4, HoYoverse says it's "due to limitations related to hardware performance and platform application size".</p>

<p>On what is almost certainly a related note, the studio also <a href="https://x.com/GenshinImpact/status/1952942713046774172" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revealed earlier today</a> that device specs for other versions of&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>will be raised following the next version update (which doesn't have a release date yet). It's likely the PS4 wouldn't be able to handle what HoYoverse has planned for the game in future.</p>




<p>This news follows the release of&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-58-july" rel="nofollow">Version 5.8 last month</a>, which is likely to be the last 5.x update before Version 6.0, as well as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-us-age-verification-to-kick-in-later-this-month" rel="nofollow">introduction of age verification</a> for players in the US earlier this year.</p>

<p>For the time being,&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>is still available on PS4, and you can also download and play it for free across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and mobile devices. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>This game puts players in the role of Remi, a United Nations peacekeeper who is accompanied by a drone as he goes AWOL into his homeland, Hadea, to find his missing parents. What he discovers is that supernatural creatures called Hollow Walkers have infested the country. Although the drone can help Remi defend himself, he'll primarily use melee weapons, including swords, polearms, and axes.</p><p>GameSpot had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hell-is-us-intriguingly-bold-design-decisions-refuse-to-give-you-a-hint/1100-6531798/" data-ref-id="1100-6531798">a hands-on experience with Hell is Us</a> in May, which demonstrated the developers' unwillingness to hold the player's hand.

Well, it looks about as elegant as you could reasonably expect.</p>
<p>The vehicle is aided by the Honda Riding Assist system, which means it's able to operate and move independently. You can check this out in the video below, but don't expect blistering speeds out of this one. The bike is equipped with stabilisers, presumably to simply keep it upright, but it's moving at an almost laughably slow speed.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-mwkAYKvypQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-mwkAYKvypQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-mwkAYKvypQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-mwkAYKvypQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f0a5xprozl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mwkAYKvypQ" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Granted, we were never expecting the Koraidon bike to achieve record-breaking speeds, but we definitely had something a <em>little</em> more impressive in mind.</p>
<p>Still, the actual design is pretty cool, but we can't imagine Honda actually making proper production models of the bike anytime soon. It seems this is definitely a one-off to promote <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pok√©mon Scarlet and Violet</a> for the Switch.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Horror game Vile: Exhumed, which sees you delving into a 90s computer to uncover a man's obsession with an adult film actress, has launched as a free download after being "wrongly banned" from Steam over sexual content, according to developer Cara Cadaver of Final Girl Games.</p>
<p>Initially released via <a href="https://final-girl-games.itch.io/vile">Itch.io</a> (where that version remains live), the game was set to to debut on Steam on July 22, but had its page on Valve's platform pulled down. Cadaver and publisher DreadXP say "sexual content with depictions of real people" was the reasoning given for this by Valve, despit the game featuring "no uncensored nudity, no depictions of sex acts, and no pornography".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So, Cadaver's now elected to release the game as a free download under a Creative Commons lisence, via <a href="https://dreadxp.com/vile-is-banned/">vileisbanned.com</a>. "This felt like the best option to make the game available to as many people as possible," the developer wrote. "Trying to release on a different storefront would only open us up to the same problem we ran into with Steam."</p>
<p>There's still the option to pay Cadaver and DreadXP for the game if you wish, with the two parties set to donate 50% of the profits to Canadian charity the <a href="https://www.reddoorshelter.ca/">Red Door Family Shelter</a>, which provides "emergency shelter and support for women and children affected by domestic abuse, families experiencing a housing crisis, and refugee claimants with nowhere else to turn."</p>

<p>"The game covers topics of assault, abuse, and entitlement, and uses a combination of FMV and practical effects to create images as horrifying as the themes. This was never a secret," the developer wrote. "This censorship of my work is a direct attack on creative expression and artistic freedom, and it will not stop with false accusations of sexual content. They will come for anything that speaks more loudly than they do."</p>
<p>We've asked Valve for comment. The context here is that both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-point-to-mastercard-restrictions-as-the-payment-firm-deny-influencing-adult-game-removals">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itch-post-new-list-of-banned-nsfw-content-that-would-rule-out-certain-kojima-games-plus-goty-2024-mouthwashing">Itch.io</a> have recently changed their policies to give payment processors control over what constitutes adult content, as a knock-on effect of Australian anti-porn activists <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">Collective Shout</a> putting pressure on those processors to do something about adult games which the group view as "sexually violent" or which they feel otherwise sexualise or objectify women.</p>
<p>The question is who gets to decide what's dodgy smut and what's a serious work digging into issues like misogyny and parasocial obsession. Both kinds of game might end up depicting or alluding to similar things, after all, and it's impossible to have important conversations about such problems if you're not even allowed to bring them up. If it <em>was</em> pulled as part of the storefront's recent changes to how it handles NSFW content, Vile: Exhumed would be an example of the sort of game folks feared might be put at risk by giving banks and credit card firms extra power over what gets the thumbs up. </p>
<p>It's possible Vile: Exhumed might not have been pulled as a direct result of these recent changes, mind. Our game of the year 2024 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mouthwashing">Mouthwashing</a> was assumed to have been nixed from Itch.io as a part of that platform's mass de-adulting, but was subsequently revealed to have been delisted due to an older change. Either way, if you want to give Cadaver's work a go, you're now free to do so.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-being-wrongly-banned-from-steam-over-sexual-content-rules-horror-game-vile-exhumed-launches-for-free]]></content:encoded>

              <p>HoYoverse, the studio behind the mega-hit&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>, has announced that the game will no longer be supported on the PS4. Not only will the game no longer receive updates on the older console by next spring, but it‚Äôs due to be removed from the PlayStation store next month, and will lose all its in-game purchases by February 2026. By the end of this process, you won‚Äôt be able to play the game on PS4 at all.</p> <p>‚ÄúDue to limitations related to hardware performance and platform application size,‚Äù <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/40408849">a statement from HoYoverse begins</a>, ‚Äúwe will be discontinuing our support and updates for&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em> on PS4 in future versions.‚Äù This process will begin on September 9, 2025, when the open-world RPG will be removed from the PlayStation Store. That means, if you haven‚Äôt added the game to your PS4 before that date, it‚Äôll disappear from search results and no longer be listed as available to download.</p> <p>Following this, after February 25, 2026, all of <em>Genshin Impact</em>‚Äòs in-game purchases will be removed as well, both from the PS Store and from the game itself. That means if you‚Äôve bought anything from the store but have yet to claim it in-game, you‚Äôll need to do that before February or risk losing it entirely.</p>

 <p>Finally, on April 8, 2026, the game will lose all PS4 support and will no longer allow players to log in, and that‚Äôs that. Of course, people can use their accounts to continue playing the game on other systems, including the Xbox Series, PS5 and PC. Or even mobile.</p> <p>And it‚Äôs this last part that makes the decision somewhat confusing. No one can argue that HoYoverse isn‚Äôt given plenty of warning to PS4 players‚Äìit‚Äôs eight months until the game will become inaccessible‚Äìbut the reasons given seem a little strange when the game runs fine on mobile devices. The PlayStation 4 released in 2013, so is clearly pretty old tech, but it does seem odd that the stated issues regarding hardware and install size wouldn‚Äôt also affect cellphones. The game‚Äôs listed requirements for Android are 8GB of storage and 3GB of memory, working on anything from an Arm v8a 64-bit chip or higher‚Äìan architecture that‚Äôs been around since 2011. It‚Äôs a bit more needy on iOS, wanting anything from 2017‚Äôs iPhone 8 onward. Meanwhile, the PS4 launched with 8GB of RAM and 500GB storage, which would therefore seem plenty. Of course, it could be far more complicated than this, and we‚Äôve reached out to HoYoverse to ask for more information about what‚Äôs caused the issues.</p> <p>Either way, this still sucks for PS4 owners, and speaks to the impermanence of modern games.</p>

<p>Sniping looks incredible in Battlefield 6, but there has been a consistent complaint: Sniper Glint. A Battlefield 6 dev has addressed this via social media and promises big changes coming to the game mechanic.</p>



<p>Nearly everything about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-phantom-edition-contents-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> has looked impressive. Battlefield Labs has been an eye-opening experience, with hundreds and thousands of matches taking place. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-peaks-players-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BF6 beta</a> opens up the player pool significantly, and we can see for ourselves what it looks and feels like.</p>



<p>But gameplay leaks and official footage have already shown how extreme Sniper Glint is.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-sniper-glint-will-be-toned-down">Battlefield 6 Sniper Glint Will be ‚ÄúToned Down‚Äù</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I‚Äôm blind. Image via Battlefield Studios </figcaption></figure>



<p>Being a sniper is all about stealth and secrecy. Ensuring your position isn‚Äôt compromised so the enemy can be neutralized without a fuss. A social media post from <a href="https://x.com/TheBFWire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Wire</a> shows how exposed snipers are when aiming down their scopes.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs so distinct that the page even asked: ‚ÄúDo you think that Battlefield 6 should have Sniper Glint?‚Äù</p>







<p>Well, it caught the attention of Florian Le Bihan AKA DRUNKKZ3‚Äîa former player turned Principal Game Designer for DICE. They replied: ‚ÄúYes. It‚Äôll get toned down in scale a bit but it‚Äôs here to stay.‚Äù</p>



<p>Sniper Glint isn‚Äôt going anywhere. This is a good thing, as no Sniper Glint would be unfair. With no killcams and expansive maps, while snipers could do what the role asks of them very well, it could be too OP.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Yes üôÇ It‚Äôll get toned down in scale a bit but it‚Äôs here to stay</span></p></article></div>



<p>We don‚Äôt know the scale of the Sniper Glint nerfs. It‚Äôs likely DICE will tweak the glint until the developer and player base are happy with the changes. How problematic do you think Sniper Glint is in its current state? How much is too much? Let us know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Kinetic Games has laid out some of its future plans for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a>, including a new map coming to the ghost hunting jump-fest.</p>
<p>The upcoming map is known as Nell's Diner, and has been inspired by those classic American diners that often pop up in films when impossibly slim actors eat a plate of bacon loaded waffles with a side of pie, a coffee and a milkshake (why no, I haven't had breakfast yet, why do you ask?). </p>
<p>According to the developer, in terms of size Nell's Diner will be a tad larger than 6 Tanglewood Drive. The team said it recognised that Phasmophobia's smaller maps tend to be more popular, as they allow for "quicker but intense investigations full of memorable moments", and Nell's Diner will accommodate that.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>The diner itself is a work in progress right now, and doesn't have a release date, but the current plan is for it to have 13 unique rooms. Of those 13, 11 will be possible ghost rooms, and one is a freezer which will make it harder to use that trusty thermometer to seek out a ghost in there. As is standard, Nell's Diner will also include places to hide during a ghost hunt, which I often forget to seek out whenever the time actually comes to it, and so I do tend to die quite a lot when I play Phasmophobia.</p>
<p>Kinetic Games also shared some concept art for Nell's Diner, which you can see in the header image and below. The developer explained that the diner can be found on its own on a "winding desert highway", and immediately serves up "Phasmophobia's trademark sense of dread and curiosity".</p>
<p>There will also be some environmental story telling with this map when it goes live. "As seen by both the scene outside, as well as the recently abandoned Diner itself - where food still sits warm and tables are cluttered with plates and cutlery - something awful has taken place," the developer teased.</p>
<p>"What exactly has happened is of course up to you as a community to piece together. We're excited to hear your theories!"</p>
<p>Kinetic Games is keeping further details for now under wraps, but has said it will share more closer to the release of Nell's Diner. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>Ahead of all that, though, fellow ghost hunters can look forward to the reworked Grafton Farmhouse, which will be launching on 12th August, across platforms. The Phasmophobia team has promised this will offer a "completely different experience" to its sister farmhouse (and recently reworked) Bleasdale.</p>
<p>"Now home to the aftermath of something truly harrowing, Grafton Farmhouse has seen better days," the developer teased. "Players conducting investigations will encounter a layout that, while feeling wholly familiar, offers a ton of new experiences as well as a brand new attic space, new interactions and much more."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Battlefield 6's unique destruction mechanics are not possible on a generic engine like Unreal Engine 5, but this is only one reason why the series will hardly leave the Frostbite Engine behind.</p>



<p>Speaking with Spanish publication <a href="https://www.3djuegos.com/juegos/battlefield-2025/noticias/que-hacemos-no-posible-motor-generico-padres-battlefield-6-dicen-no-a-hacer-maletas-seguir-moda-industria">3DJuegos</a>, Senior Producer David Sirland commented on the possibility of the series ever switching to <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/unreal-engine-5/">Unreal Engine</a>, saying that the destruction mechanics seen in Battlefield 6 are not possible on a generic engine, as the Frostbite Engine is tailor-made for the new entry in the series and its features as much as the studio is tailoring the game itself for the engine. Achieving similar results on a generic game engine, pushing it to the limit, is achievable, Sirland added, but the developers are specialists with the engine, and he thinks this shows in the game. The Frostbite Engine being tailor-made for Battlefield 6 and the game itself being tailored for the engine isn't the only reason why the franchise is unlikely to leave its current engine behind, as the development studios are used to Frostbite and have engineers knowledgeable about the engine, which allows them to work in harmony, according to Producer Alexia Christofi, something that would likely require a lot of time to achieve with an engine switch.</p>



<p>Soon enough, players worldwide will be able to get a first, proper taste of Battlefield 6 ahead of its launch this October. The open beta, which is now available for <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-preload-now-available-matchmaking-skill/">pre-load</a>, will allow players to test out the game this weekend from August 9 to August 10 and from August 14 to August 17. The open beta includes, for the first weekend, the Iberian Offense, Liberation Peak, and Siege of Cairo maps, and a selection of play modes, including Conquest, Breakthrough, Domination, and King of the Hill.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on October 10. You can tide yourself over while waiting for the open beta to go live by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-hands-on-impressions/">first impressions</a> on the game.</p>

<figure><a title="RTA Japan - DK" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c519742fe14b6/rta-japan-dk.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Japan's largest speedrunning event, <a href="https://rtain.jp/">RTA</a>, is set to kick off later this week on 9th August, and will see some of the speediest gamers in the biz ploughing through the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cuphead">Cuphead</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">Nier: Automata</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/elder_scrolls_v_skyrim">Skyrim</a>, all in aid of Doctors Without Borders. We learnt a few months ago that Nintendo games would not be included in the lineup, and now the RTA group has explained why (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/japans-biggest-charity-speedrunning-event-wont-have-nintendo-games-because-nintendo-couldnt-help-but-nintendo">Eurogamer</a>).</p>
<p>In a new post shared on the <a href="https://rtain.jp/rtaij/nintendo/">RTA website</a> (and translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-owned-titles-excluded-from-japans-biggest-speedrunning-event-after-organizers-were-told-they-had-to-apply-for-permission-for-each-game/">Automaton</a>), the event organisers explain that they were contacted by Nintendo back in June, informing them that "as a legal entity, they would have to ask for permission in advance" if they wanted to feature any Nintendo game in the event. What's more, the Big N apparently stated that all previous instances of Nintendo games being streamed from the event are now considered "unauthorised use".</p>
<p>RTA has long featured Nintendo games in its lineup ‚Äî <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> is a staple, natch ‚Äî but the Big N's interest this year seems to stem from the event's relatively recent (2020) transition into an official legal entity. The event remains non-profit, with all proceeds going to charity.</p>
<p>To be clear, this isn't necessarily the end of Nintendo's RTA appearances completely ‚Äî the organisers state that they are working with Nintendo to get game permission for future events ‚Äî but the proximity to the Summer 2025 event meant that the team couldn't possibly get all permissions through and approved in time.</p>
<p>It's disappointing to hear that RTA speedrunners won't get to take a pop at Mario &amp; co. this year, though it's hardly surprising. Let's not forget that Nintendo has historically been <em>very</em> cagey about which events can and cannot feature its titles. It <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/12/nintendo-releases-full-statement-after-cancellation-of-smash-world-tour">cancelled the Smash World Tour</a> back in 2022, and we regularly hear reports of streamers and other events that have been similarly hit by the ninjas.</p>
<p>Let's hope the permission-giving goes smoothly for RTA next year.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/genshin-impact-drops-playstation-4-support/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/genshin-impact-drops-playstation-4-support-due-to-hardware-limitations-and-platform-application-size-increased-pc-system-requirements-confirmed.1263156/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Genshin Impact will drop PlayStation 4 support due to hardware limitations and platform application size, developer HoYoverse confirmed today.</p>



<p>The game's PlayStation 4 support will be phased out gradually, starting with the game's removal from the PlayStation Store on September 10. All those who have already downloaded the game will be able to continue playing until April 8, 2026, when service will officially end. From February 25, however, the experience will be somewhat limited with the removal of all in-game purchases, but everything that's been purchased but not yet claimed can still be obtained until the end of service in early April.</p>



<p>As technical reasons are behind the termination of PlayStation 4 support, it's unsurprising that the system requirements for the PC and mobile versions have increased. Devices below the system requirements will still be able to run the game after the Song of the Welkin Moon update launches, but users playing on devices with specs lower than the minimum may experience performance and stability issues. Still, the <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/40408846">increased requirements</a> are not particularly high, especially the PC requirements, so most players should have no trouble playing the game even after the Song of the Welkin Moon.</p>



<p>Genshin Impact is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-age-assurance-security-settings-leaks-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grand-theft-auto-age-assurance-security-settings-leak-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1263150/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Reports of GTA Online adding new age verification measures were recently leaked. Now, a new claim has shown the GTA age assurance settings with preview screens that aren‚Äôt live in Grant Theft Auto just yet.</p>



<p>Age verification has gone from being a concept to a full-blown enforcement of the practice. The UK has seen a huge clampdown on certain content‚Äî<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/uk-age-verification-laws-online-safety-act-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including gaming websites</a>‚Äîand it could be spreading to gaming. It was recently claimed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-online-will-soon-require-age-verification-to-play-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA Online was gearing up to add age verification</a> to the game.</p>



<p>A new development shows it‚Äôs more than likely happening.</p>



<h2 id="h-gta-online-age-assurance-preview-leaks">GTA Online Age Assurance Preview Leaks</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What does this mean for the future of GTA? Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Trusted source <a href="https://x.com/TezFunz2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tez2</a> was the one to break the initial age assurance story. Now, the leaker has shared ‚ÄúA preview of age assurance in-game,‚Äù but said, ‚ÄúThis is not active yet.‚Äù</p>



<p>The first screenshot shows a new screen for GTA Online saying: ‚ÄúVerify Age ‚Äì Please verify your age to access online features.‚Äù</p>



<p>Whereas the second screenshot shows ‚ÄòAdditional Settings,‚Äô which include the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Verify Age</li>



<li>Online Access (On/Off)</li>



<li>Store Access (On/Off)</li>



<li>Snapmatic Upload (On/Off)</li>
</ul>



<p>This information should be taken with a pinch of salt as it is a leak. Until Rockstar Games officially announces the introduction of age assurance and verification methods, it‚Äôs not absolute. However, Tez2 is rarely wrong, and we‚Äôve already seen the code in the game files.</p>



<p>Plans could always change, so stay tuned.</p>



<div><article><p><span>A preview of age assurance in-game. This is not active yet.
</span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GTAOnline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GTAOnline</a></p></article></div>



<p>I think this is only the beginning of age verification across the UK and the rest of the world. Many apps, games, sites, and pieces of content won‚Äôt be safe from these new rules and regulations. Will age assurance stop you from enjoying the content you like? Or will you go ahead and do it anyway? We‚Äôre keen to hear your thoughts over at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
