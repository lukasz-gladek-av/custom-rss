<p>This bumps this Switch title up to Version 1.2.1 and follows on from a Switch 2 game update at the beginning of last month. Here's the full rundown via Nintendo's support page:</p>
<h2>Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury: Ver. 1.2.1 (Released July 29, 2025)</h2>

</ul>
<p>Note: Has local user compatibility with Ver. 1.2.0 and Ver. 1.1.0. Does not have local user compatibility with Ver. 1.0.0. Please be careful of the update version on each player's system.</p>
<hr>
<p>If we find out about anything else going on behind the scenes, we'll let you know. The previous update for Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury included visual and frame rate improvements on the Switch 2, as well as HDR support for higher image quality.</p>
<p>This is just one of many first-party Switch titles Nintendo has updated for the Switch 2 over the past few months. More Switch titles have also been made compatible on the Switch 2 thanks to regular firmware updates.</p>

<p>Nintendo has been busy this week with all sorts of updates, and yesterday it released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> for Switch Online's Super Nintendo app.</p>
<p>More details about this latest update have now emerged, and apart from being able to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/psa-you-can-now-remap-super-nes-controls-with-nintendo-switch-online">remap the buttons in this specific library</a>, it seems the CRT filter on this app has also received an update.</p>
<p>The filter update is apparently designed to better capture what the original experience on the SNES was like on older television sets. There are already some before-and-after comparisons doing the rounds online.</p>
<p>Polygon has actually showcased this "improved CRT filter" and just how "transformative" it is in a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/617241/nintendo-classics-snes-crt-filter-retro-games-how-to-turn-on">series of screenshots</a>. You can also see more comparisons like this on social media and elsewhere online:</p>





<p>This follows on from Nintendo releasing a similar update for the Nintendo 64 app alongside the launch of the Switch 2 and the GameCube library.</p>
<p>Once again, the latest update for the SNES app is part of the Mario Paint game drop this week, which also includes mouse control and Joy-Con 2 mouse mode support.</p>

Now, 27 years later, history repeats itself with <em>R-Type Delta: HD Boosted</em>. With its tight level design, three selectable ships, powerful Delta Attacks, and the brilliant Force mechanic, this new edition proves that gaming classics of this caliber are truly timeless. If you played <em>R-Type Delta</em> back in the day, this is the perfect opportunity to return to its dark science fiction <a title="Genres > Action [2,893 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>. If youâve never experienced this essential piece of gaming history before, now is the time.</p><p><strong>Sharper Than Ever</strong></p><p><em>R-Type Delta: HD Boosted</em> features high-resolution graphics that hone the polygonal edges of this <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [48,105 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> masterpiece until theyâre sharp enough to cut glass. You simply havenât experienced <em>R-Type Delta</em> until youâve played it in high definition! Of course, the game also comes equipped with modern quality-of-life improvements.</p><p><strong>Environmental Storytelling</strong></p><p>What has always made <em>R-Type Delta</em> so fantastic is its dark, eerie atmosphere. Shoot-âem-ups are not typically known for storytelling, but <em>R-Type Delta: HD Boosted</em> excels with its simple, minimalist environmental storytelling, characteristic of the late â90s. Itâs a narrative that is as fascinating as it is unsettling, as adrenaline-pumping as it is deeply disturbing. And all this without a single word being spoken.</p><p><strong>The Meaning of Delta</strong></p><p>The name âDeltaâ carries several meanings. Firstly, the Greek letter delta resembles a triangle, which coincidentally has as many sides as there are playable ships in the game. It is also the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet, and <em>R-Type Delta</em> is the fourth game in the <em>R-Type</em> series. Additionally, the delta triangle is the simplest type of polygon, which is fitting since <em>R-Type Delta</em> was the first game in the series to use three-dimensional polygon graphics instead of two-dimensional <a title="Companies > sprite [19 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sprite">sprite</a>s.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>The year is 2163, and the badly damaged R9 <a title="Companies > Arrowhead Game Studios [26 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead</a> fighter has just returned to Earth after its mission to destroy the Bydo Empire. The vessel is rescued by the battle-cruiser Croque-Monsieur and transported to an orbital space station. One year later, astronomers in Central Asia observe mysterious objects falling from the sky, and moments later, control is lost over the orbiting annihilation platform Moritz-G. This high-tech machine, capable of destroying the entire planet, descends over a city and levels it to the ground. Although its planet-destroying weapons have not yet been activated, its advanced defense systems make Moritz-G virtually impossible to approach. A desperate military operation is launched, and the prototype ship R9aII Delta is deployed to resolve the situation. Thus begins the epic battle that is <em>R-Type Delta</em>!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.

Somehow thatâs not even the biggest change in the gameâs first major update since launch. The Switch 2's biggest exclusive is back on the menu. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Mario Kart World </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/~/how-to-update-mario-kart-world&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/~/how-to-update-mario-kart-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">version 1.2.0</a></span> includes new features, lots of game tweaks, and some massive rebalancing. One thing that might bring back some lapsed players is this patch note: âIncreased the frequency of lap-type courses appearing in the selection when choosing the next course in âVS Raceâ and wireless races.â Fans are taking that to mean that traditional three-lap stages will be more frequent, including when playing online. </p><p>A big criticism of the game has been throwing lots of straightaway, interstitial courses into the mix that just have players racing between the actual tracks they want to play on. When<em> Mario Kart World</em> first released, choosing ârandomâ while playing online automatically removed these tracks from the selection pool. The communityâs preference was so strong it became common to see all 24 players in a race choose random. So, Nintendo being Nintendo, they got rid of that workaround in an apparent attempt to âforceâ fans to play <em>Mario Kart World</em> âthe right way.â </p><p>The company now seems to have backed off a bit, though itâs anybodyâs guess whether it was âbulliedâ into accommodating playersâ preferences or simply wanted to try and fix how the random selection option worked without making everyone extra miserable. In any case, <em>Mario Kart World </em>version 1.2.0<em>&nbsp;</em>is so big, thatâs not even the most consequential part of the update. Far from it, in fact.</p><p>âMade COM weaker in everything other than âBattle,ââ reads a major change thatâs already rippling throughout the community with fans unsure whether to embrace the difficulty nerf or call for an unofficial âhardâ mode to return. Grand Prix and Knockout races could get pretty gnarly at 150cc (a 200cc mode doesnât exist in the game yet, though many suspect it will get added at some point), and itâs not just the higher speeds that make things tricky. </p><p>Instead, its CPU racers tricking off every surface in sight and hammering players with shells and other items. <em>Mario Kart World</em>âs item box RNG also tends to incentivize players âbaggingâ it in last place before trying shoot up the ranks with the powerful items theyâve earned. Twenty-four players also means races have huge middle packs with double the carnage of previous <em>Mario Kart</em> games. Weâll see how it shakes out, but some players are already claiming special bragging rights for unlocking three starsâthe highest performance ratingâon all races before the CPU nerf. </p><p>Other significant patch notes include âmade homing of Boomerang weakerâ and âOn the âFree Roamâ map, when you gather all of the P Switches, ? Panels, and Peach Medallions, the colors of the various numbers will now change.â There are also dozens of fixes to race tracks where players were previously falling through the map or getting snagged on trees and other obstacles. Itâll take some time to see how all the changes shake out, but it definitely feels like weâve entered <em>Mario Kart World</em>âs first official âWeâre so backâ era. </p><p>Here are the full patch notes for ver. 1.2.0:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><h2 id="h829714"><a id=""></a><strong>Latest update: Ver. 1.2.0 (Released July 29, 2025)</strong></h2><p><strong>General</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>In the âVS Raceâ of âSingle Playerâ, added âNo COMâ to the COM rules.</li><li>In the âVS Raceâ of âSingle Playerâ and âMultiplayerâ, added âMushrooms onlyâ to the item rules.</li><li>You can now choose âView Replayâ after downloading ghost data in âTime Trialsâ.</li><li>You can now choose whom to watch when spectating in âKnockout Tourâ and âBalloon Battleâ in âOnline Playâ, âWireless Playâ, and âLAN Playâ.</li><li>You can now see the waiting time until the next race or battle starts in âOnline Playâ, âWireless Playâ, and âLAN Playâ.</li><li>When using CameraPlay in âMultiplayerâ and âOnline Playâ, the game will now remember the camera cursor position and size until the player closes the game.If you change the number of people playing, the cursor position and size will return to their original settings.</li><li>On the âFree Roamâ map, when you gather all of the P Switches, ?

<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/37a6d0938a306/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following three updates in June, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>'s first (<em>and probably last</em>) update for July 2025 is now officially live.</p>
<p>This might just be the biggest one yet, as it includes a whole bunch of general updates as well as multiple bug fixes. One, in particular, mentions how the frequency of "lap-type courses" has been increased in some modes. Another note mentions how the computer opponents have been made "weaker in everything other than Battle" mode.</p>
<p>There's much more alongside these adjustments, so here's the full rundown courtesy of Nintendo's support page:</p>
<h2>Mario Kart World: Ver. 1.2.0 (Released July 29, 2025)</h2>

<li>Made homing of Boomerang weaker.</li>
<li>Decreased the probability of getting a Triple Dash Mushroom in the low position, whenever the item rules in a race are anything other than âFranticâ.</li>
<li>Changed it so order of getting ? Block is higher than in the past, whenever the item rules in a race are anything other than âFranticâ.</li>
<li>Made it so there is a wheel spinning animation if the player presses the A button (acceleration) too early when starting a race while driving.
<ul>
<li>Player will not lose speed even when spinning wheels.</li>

                <p dir="ltr">Dungeons &amp; Dragons has exploded in popularity over the past few years, and part of that is due to the success of Stranger Things. The TTRPG features heavily in Netflix's nostalgia-tinged supernatural series--not only do we see the characters play the game, they even give many of the otherworldly creatures they encounter names pulled from Dungeons &amp; Dragons lore. Soon, fans will be able to take part in the Stranger Things crew's tabletop adventures with an all-new D&amp;D crossover game, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dungeons-Dragons-Stranger-Things-Adventure/dp/B0FFKL233T?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stranger Things: Welcome to the Hellfire Club</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The game looks to be a streamlined version of D&amp;D that comes with everything you need, is easy to set up, and includes adventures based on the campaigns made by Stranger Things character Eddie Munson. The final season of Stranger Things doesn't premiere until November 26, but fans will be able to join the Hellfire Club on <strong>October 7</strong>. You can preorder the crossover game for $50 at Amazon.</p><div title="6533505 - Dungeons &amp; Dragons Stranger Things: Welcome to The Hellfire Club Adventure Game" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3985" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6533505 - Dungeons &amp; Dragons Stranger Things: Welcome to The Hellfire Club Adventure Game" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dungeons-Dragons-Stranger-Things-Adventure/dp/B0FFKL233T?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Dungeons-Dragons-Stranger-Things-Adventure\/dp\/B0FFKL233T?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Dungeons-Dragons-Stranger-Things-Adventure/dp/B0FFKL233T?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">D&amp;D - Stranger Things: Welcome to The Hellfire Club</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dungeons-Dragons-Stranger-Things-Adventure/dp/B0FFKL233T?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Dungeons-Dragons-Stranger-Things-Adventure\/dp\/B0FFKL233T?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Dungeons-Dragons-Stranger-Things-Adventure/dp/B0FFKL233T?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$50 | Releases October 7</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Stranger Things: Welcome to The Hellfire Club takes its name from the in-universe D&amp;D club run by Eddie Munson.

<figure><a title="Fall Guys" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d86780b897dca/fall-guys.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Mediatonic, Epic Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Games are already benefitting in all sorts of ways from the Switch 2's upgrades, and with this in mind, Mediatonic's free-to-play title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fall_guys">Fall Guys</a> has now been updated for the new hybrid platform.</p>
<p>In this update, the battle-royale style game has apparently received an "improvement" on Switch 2 in the form of "uncapped" frame rates, allowing it to run at "up to" 60FPS. Here are the official patch notes via the official developer post on Reddit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>IMPROVEMENT:</strong></p>
<p>"We have uncapped FPS on Nintendo Switch 2, allowing the game to run on up to 60 FPS on that platform."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This is part of the 'Tropical Tides' update, so if you're still playing this one, you can update your game now to receive the update. If you haven't played it before, you'll need an Epic account to participate in the cross-platform multiplayer experience.</p>
<p>This title originally made its debut on the Switch eShop in 2022. At the time, we scored it seven out of ten, calling it "chaotic fun" despite the choppy frame rate on the original Switch.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Where Winds Meet: Our Thoughts After 3 Hours in its Wuxia World]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/where-winds-meet-our-thoughts-after-3-hours-in-its-wuxia-world</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/where-winds-meet-our-thoughts-after-3-hours-in-its-wuxia-world.1256670/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Last weekend, a global beta test began for Where Winds Meet, the open-world game published by NetEase that is already available in China. This free-to-play game takes place around the year 1000 between the great Tang and Song dynasties during what's known as the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. In it, players take the role of a lone wandering hero during this time of upheaval where one's own strength matters more than the rules of society. IGN readers may not be too familiar with the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, but donât worry â the same even seems to apply to players in China.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We know that the game takes some influence from Ghost of Tsushima and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild thanks to a past interview with lead designer Chris Lyu, but it can be difficult to imagine exactly what the gameplay will be like. According to Lyu, it is "the world's first wuxia-themed open-world" game. Once I got my hands on the game, I found Where Winds Meet was indeed a wuxia game through-and-through, with the strength of the concept bringing together a variety of elements seen in games today.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Where Winds Meet: State of Play Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you're finished with character creation and begin playing the game, you're first met with a graceful man with flowing hair resting in a bamboo grove while holding a baby to his chest, almost like Zhao Yun from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Then, another handsome and long-haired man comes to talk to him, and it seems that this man with a baby has betrayed his school. He hops on a white horse then gallops through the bamboo while avoiding his pursuer's weapons, at times in slow motion. All of these shots are reminiscent of famous scenes from various Chinese movies of the past, making it clear from the start that this game is closely linked to the wuxia tradition.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This game is closely linked to the wuxia tradition.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A sense of "wuxia-ness" oozes out of this game at every turn even after this opening scene ends and you take control of the character you've created â whether that's through its gameplay in general, its systems and graphics, or its dialogue. A few minutes after I started walking freely through its world, I spoke to an old man on the side of the road who asked me to repel a bear who's been after honey. It seems that the protagonist is able to learn techniques from the movements of the bear, as pressing buttons at the right time according to icons that pop up caused him to learn tai chi from the beast, incredibly enough.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this serves as a tutorial for the Mystic Arts that make up part of your arsenal, but more importantly, this process of observing familiar objects and nature to learn abilities and grow stronger gives the player a strong sense of the game's wuxia flavor. It seems there are other abilities that come from nature, like Lion's Roar and the venomous Toad Style, so I'm sure there will be many other techniques the protagonist learns from all the creatures of the gameâs world. Just as you might expect to be able to use magic to create fire in a game with a fantasy setting, the player in this game's wuxia world is able to master strange powers of their own. It's also interesting to note that these abilities can be used outside of combat as well. For example, nearby fish are caught up in tai chi when it's used by the water's surface, making for efficient fishing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most notable things about this thoroughly wuxia game is its inclusion of many elements we've come to expect from combat systems and exploration in action games today. For example, pressing the correct button just before an enemy's attack lands will parry it, creating a back-and-forth tempo during action segments. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While equivalent to the kinds of parry systems that have become a staple in recent action games, this game goes into slow motion when it's time to parry an enemy attack and displays an icon telling you what button to press (though it is possible to turn this icon off in the options). While similar to Final Fantasy XVI's Story-Focused mode, these icons deplete an Insight Points meter when they're displayed and won't show up if you run out, so you can't recklessly fend off every single enemy attack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are currently seven weapon types that a player can use (with plans to add more). In addition to standard swords and spears, there are also more unusual weapons like umbrellas and folding fans. Each weapon provides for its own unique gameplay, such as the umbrella's skill that temporarily stuns an enemy, or the fan's ability to create a zone that heals the player and their allies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players can equip both a main weapon and a sub-weapon, each enabling a variety of martial techniques. What techniques are available to you will also change based on the school you study under, with a total of eleven available schools. The game's combat style changes quite a bit depending on the combination of mystic and martial skills you use, allowing for a wide degree of customization. Between all of the different attacks, the balance between offense and defense enabled by parries, and the overall voracious approach to combat elements, it felt like the game had taken a menu of popular modern features and ordered one of everything.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The bow and arrow is treated differently whether it's being used as a main or a sub-weapon, capable of attacking enemies from afar while also solving puzzles by burning through vines to open up pathways. The way it's positioned shows the influence of another game that was previously mentioned, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It sounds like upwards of a thousand NPCs have reputation levels, allowing you to befriend them on an individual basis.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The game's core of open world exploration and progression has also been extravagantly created. During the preview, I was able to visit Kaifeng, one of China's eight ancient capitals located in Heinan province that flourished at the time as one of the world's largest cities. Despite the war-ravaged world, the city in the game was open and lively, with its residents chatting away like it was Cyberpunk 2077 after just a short walk through its streets. It sounds like upwards of a thousand NPCs have reputation levels, allowing you to befriend them on an individual basis.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not hard to imagine how people live in the game's detailed streets of Kaifeng, apparently recreated by referring to historical remains that still exist today. Walk down the big street that cuts through it all and eventually you'll find a large arching bridge. A beautiful palace with towering defenses awaits you on the other side, making it clear just how prosperous this Chinese capital was at the time. From there the player will be able to dig into the secrets around their own birth as a wandering hero.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After only about three hours of gameplay, I could tell that Where Winds Meet is packed full of elements that players have experienced before in open-world games. But what shocked me most of all is that while you could call this a mishmash of features, the key concept of wuxia along with the way those elements are presented worked to bring all of them together in a natural way. Perhaps you could say that what best defines Where Winds Meet is this coexistence of the past decade of what has made open-world and action games fun alongside its Chinese creators' love for the genre of wuxia. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/where-winds-meet-our-thoughts-after-3-hours-in-its-wuxia-world]]></content:encoded>

Letâs run it back. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CBB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#CBB</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ItsInTheGame?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ItsInTheGame</a> <a href="https://t.co/iBNhGxn2yj" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/iBNhGxn2yj</a></p>â EA SPORTS (@EASPORTS) <a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTS/status/1939703160479637660?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 30, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">During today's Q1 earnings call, CEO Andrew Wilson was asked about the potential return of College Basketball, likely in response to the above tweet. Per reports back in June and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/16-years-after-the-last-ncaa-basketball-game-ea-sports-is-bringing-back-the-madness">above clever tease</a>, College Basketball is indeed slated to return from EA, though it will be a while yet before we see it - <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6462741/2025/06/30/ea-sports-college-basketball-video-game-return-2028/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it's not expected until 2028</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's Wilson's vague, yet promising, response in full:</p><blockquote>We can't say too much about it yet, but if I think about the opportunity, going back to where we are on College Football, college sport has one of the most vibrant fanbase in the world. And that trickles over to basketball certainly. We're seeing momentum of fandom in college basketball also continue to grow. Fans, athletes, universities pour their passion into these sports. And it is that passion that makes it special, that makes the games different.</blockquote><blockquote>But with that comes high expectations, and a demand for deeply authentic experiences: capturing the action on the field or the court, representing the energy, pagentry, the traditions, and celebrating the unique sights and sounds and stories of every school and rivalry. We feel like we deliver that incredibly well with College Football...we'd love to do the same for basketball. All 350 programs, men's and women's teams, the iconic traditions and rivalries, and of course, March Madness.</blockquote><blockquote>So for us, college sports broadly is an exciting opportunity. We feel like we've done a really strong job, and remain committed to doing that in the context of college football. We believe that with what we've done with the teams, the technology, and our commitment around College Football, we'd have a great ability to do the same for college basketball, and as we look to try and activate against that opportunity, we'll be able to share more.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Per reporting from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6462741/2025/06/30/ea-sports-college-basketball-video-game-return-2028/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Athletic</a>, EA Sports' proposal for a College Basketball game, which was recommended for acceptance by the Collegiate Licensing Company, would include all Division I men's and women's teams (730 in total). The games, of which there would be six in total with releases beginning in 2028, would have similar features to College Football such as Dynasty Mode, Team Builder, Road to Glory, and Ultimate Team. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA last produced a College Basketball game back in 2009, but the series was discontinued amid disputes over its use of college athletes' likenesses, and declining sales compared to the College Football series. However, the success of College Football seems to have sparked a new interest in Basketball from EA...though it may be facing competition from 2K Sports, if <a href="https://x.com/NBA2K/status/1939805441468342727" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this NBA 2K official Twitter/X post is any indication</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The company hasn't factored in any $80 games this fiscal year.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As Nintendo takes the first step toward selling full-priced, AAA games at $80 and Xbox starts to follow suit but backs off, EA has now also made its position clear: no $80 games...for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're not looking to make any changes on pricing at this stage," said CEO Andrew Wilson during today's Q1 earnings call. He said this in response to an investor question regarding publishing competitors beginning to release $80 games, and where EA sees itself in relation to them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wilson continued:</p><blockquote>That's in the construct of, we already offer a fairly broad pricing scheme across our various products. When you think about everything from free-to-play through to our premium products and deluxe editions, our orientation is always to capture the full spectrum of pricing so that we can serve players in the best way possible and offer them the greatest value.

The current fiscal year ends in March of 2026, so don't expect any $80 EA games between now and then. That means games like Madden NFL 26, EA Sports FC 26, and seemingly Battlefield 6 won't be $80, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-release-in-october-for-80-leak-suggests-and-theres-an-open-beta-coming-too">despite one leaker suggesting the contrary</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">EA isn't the only publisher who isn't quite ready to follow suit with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy">Nintendo's Mario Kart World</a> on $80 games.

I was polite as I can be the whole call.â<br></p><p>Martinez is part of a growing backlash to Steam and Itch.io purging thousands of games from their databases at the behest of payment processing companies.

If parents are so concerned over protecting kids, then they should parent their own kids instead of forcing other people to meet their ridiculous demands.â</p><p>Indie horror game <em>Vile: Exhumed</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bloody-disgusting.com/video-games/3890112/vile-exhumed-banned-from-steam/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/video-games/3890112/vile-exhumed-banned-from-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is one of the titles</a></span> thatâs been banned from Steam by Valve. Released last year by Cara Cadaver of Final Girl Games, it has players rummage through a fictional â90s computer terminal to uncover a twisted manâs toxic obsession with an adult horror film actress, using this format to engage with themes of online misogyny and toxic parasocial relationships. âIt was banned for âsexual content with depictions of real people,â which, if you have played it, you know is all implied, making this all feel even worse,â Cadaver <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/dirtlord77.bsky.social/post/3lv2264j6sk2c&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/dirtlord77.bsky.social/post/3lv2264j6sk2c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on Bluesky</a></span> on July 28.<br></p><p>Valve did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p><em>Vile: Exhumed </em>is a textbook example of what critics of the sex game purge always feared: that guidelines aimed at clamping down on pornographic games believed to be encouraging or glorifying sexual violence would inevitably ensnare serious works of art grappling with difficult and uncomfortable subject matter in important ways. Who gets to decide which is which? For a long time, it appeared to be Steam and Itch.io. Last weekâs purges revealed itâs actually Visa and Mastercard, and whoever can frighten them the most with bad publicity.</p><p>âThings are definitely changing as reports of responses to calls have gone from âSorry what are you talking about?â to then âAre you ALSO calling about itch/steamâ to now some [callers] receiving outright harassment,â a 2D artist who goes by Void and who has helped organize a Discord for a reverse call-in campaign told <em>Kotaku</em>. Itâs hard to have any clear sense of the scope of these counter-initiatives or what ultimate impact they might have on the companies in question, but anecdotally the effort seems to be gaining traction. For instance, callers are now needing to spend less time explaining what Steam, Itch.io, or âNSFWâ games are to the people on the other end of the line. </p><p>âFor calls I was originally focusing on Mastercard, but I ended up getting a lot of time out of Visa,â Bluesky user RJAIN told <em>Kotaku</em>. âTwo days ago I had a call with Visa that lasted over an hour, and a follow-up call later on that lasted over 2.5 hours.  Those calls, I spoke with a supervisor and they seemed very calm and understanding.  Yesterday, the calls were different. The reps seemed angry and exhausted. They refused to let me speak to a supervisor and kept insisting that it is now protocol for them to disconnect the call on anyone complaining about this issue.â</p><p>Bluesky user snowlupinwood, an LGBT furry author whose work was impacted on itch.io, said calls were juggled between various managers until one earlier this week led to a 30-minute exchange with a manager reading from a script, while subsequent calls led to quickly getting disconnected. Another person who claimed to call at least 30 times said the interactions have also changed since last week when the purges on itch.io and Steam first happened. </p><figure id="" data-id="cdb956f129ecb431e093e7f8254b663c" data-recommend-id="image://cdb956f129ecb431e093e7f8254b663c" data-format="png" data-width="858" data-height="770" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows scripts advocates are sharing to speaking to credit card companies.

Others started cutting me off and started their âending speechâ informing me they can no longer help me and to email.  Some even started mocking me and telling me that they recognize my number and they ask me before I said anything if I called before.  I am very concerned with my next phone call but I will be continuing to call until they change something. I am not scared of being yelled at, Iâve been working in customer service for almost 5 years now.â</p><p>Visa and Mastercard did not immediately respond to requests for comment. </p><p>Some say the exchanges have remained polite while others say theyâve been put on hold indefinitely. âItâs clearly having an impact,â RJAIN said. âThey are changing how they deal with calls and they sound exhausted with the issue. There are often queue times when I call.â The ACLU, which has been critical of credit card companies being leveraged to censor sex work online, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/aclu.org/post/3lv4g32jhgc2p&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/aclu.org/post/3lv4g32jhgc2p" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">also commented on the issue on Tuesday</a></span>, though it hasnât shared any direct actions it might be pursuing on behalf of effected creators. </p><p>Some industry trade groups have also weighed in. The International Game Developers Association (IGDA) released a statement stating that âcensorship like this is materially harmful to game developersâ and urging a dialogue between âplatforms, payment processors, and industry leaders with developers and advocacy groups.â âWe welcome collaboration and transparency,â it wrote. âThis issue is not just about adult content. It is about developer rights, artistic freedom, and the sustainability of diverse creative work in games.â</p><p>For the time being, that dialogue appears to mostly be taking place at Visaâs and Mastercardâs call centers, at least when they allow it. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/steam-itch-io-sex-game-nsfw-censor-visa-mastercard-1851787281]]></content:encoded>

As such, Blizzard is using a new survey to gauge fan reaction to a whole host of brands it could potentially bring to <em>Overwatch 2</em>, and there are some wild picks in the mix.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195460" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="195460,196880,197589" data-current="195460"><div><p>Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20938.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>A lot of these properties arenât that surprising. Blizzard has collaborated with anime, video games, and even K-pop groups, ranging from fairly modern to ânostalgia bait for people of a different demographic than me,â so nothingâs really off the table. However, I do look at some of these hypotheticals and wonder, âDo we need this?â Crucially, just because a brand shows up on a survey doesnât mean that Blizzard is actively considering an <em>Overwatch 2</em> crossover event. Itâs all just vibes right now, and if weâre feeling those out, Iâve got some thoughts. While my preference is that <em>Overwatch </em>stop <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-street-fighter-skin-collaboration-crossover-1851779908&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-street-fighter-skin-collaboration-crossover-1851779908">becoming <em>Fortnite</em></a></span>, I donât think thatâs going to happen. So hereâs my ranking of every hypothetical <em>Overwatch 2 </em>crossover Blizzard is proposing, ranked from âhell yeahâ to âfuck no.â</p><h2 id="h555932"><a id=""></a><em><strong>PokÃ©mon</strong></em></h2><p>What can I say? Iâm a mark. If Soldier: 76 acknowledges that Pikachu exists in some way, Iâll clap like an absolute clown.</p><h2 id="h555933"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Batman</strong></em></h2><p>The survey says <em>Batman</em>, but Iâm choosing to believe this hypothetical crossover would include all the DC heroes, so Echo can be a Green Lantern, and her transforming ultimate could be her using her ring. Reaper could be Batman since theyâre both broody and wear black.</p><h2 id="h555934"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Evangelion</strong></em></h2><p>Unit-01 Ramattra. Enough said.</p><h2 id="h555935"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Baldurâs Gate</strong></em></h2><p>So many of the characters in <em>Baldurâs Gate 3 </em>map so well onto <em>Overwatch 2 </em>heroes that the collab writes itself. Junker Queen as Karlach? Widowmaker as Laeâzel? Lifeweaver as Astarion? Somebody call Larian.</p><h2 id="h555936"><a id=""></a><em><strong>One Piece</strong></em></h2><p>After 1000+ episodes, thereâs quite a few <em>One Piece</em> characters to pull from, and fans have been making <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/54fsk4/one_piece_x_overwatch_crossover_post_from/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/54fsk4/one_piece_x_overwatch_crossover_post_from/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mock-ups of this for nearly a decade</a></span>.</p><h2 id="h555937"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Monsters Inc.</strong></em></h2><p>The only reason this extremely odd and not-timely choice is so high is because I need to see Winston in Sulleyâs blue-and-purple fur.</p><h2 id="h555938"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Digimon</strong></em></h2><p>While the uninitiated probably look at this and think, âWouldnât this just be <em>PokÃ©mon </em>again?â Iâm here to say, âNo, you absolute ninny.â <em>Digimon</em>âs character designs are so much more varied than those in Game Freakâs monster-catching series, and a lot of them even look human. Lifeweaver as Angemon and Mercy as Angewomon?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clues-by-sam-is-my-favorite-daily-puzzle-game.1256562/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I could never get into Wordle or any of its derivativesâI just hate guessing games. <a href="https://cluesbysam.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clues By Sam</a>, which turns the once-a-day puzzle format into a logic puzzle, is more my speed.</p><p>Wordle is a game about knowing five-letter words. Unfortunately for me, as soon as someone prompts me to name a five-letter word, I forget every word in the English language. I could not be worse at Wordle if I tried, which is unfortunate because many of the group chats Iâm in are sustained by posting Wordle scoresâor scores of the many, many derivatives of Wordle. It turns out âguess something until you run out of guessesâ is a pretty solid framework for a game, and my friends enjoy versions like <a href="https://oec.world/en/games/tradle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tradle</a>, where you guess the country based on their exports, or <a href="https://framed.wtf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Framed</a>, where you guess movies with just one frame.</p><p>The only game of this genre that has tickled my fancy even a little bit has been Clues By Sam, developed by <a href="https://adartis.fi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Finnish developer Ad Artis Oy</a>, who may or may not be named Sam. The game presents you with a five-by-five grid of characters with professions. The goal is to guess which characters are innocents and which are criminals. Youâre given one clue to start, and each time you correctly guess whether a character is innocent or guilty youâre given another clue. A key feature of Clues By Sam is that the game doesnât let you guessâif you mark someone criminal or innocent before the gameâs designer thinks youâd be able to know that from whatâs in front of you, a pop-up appears to stop you from entering your answer.</p><p>Weirdly, Clues By Sam reminds me of SAT prep questions, which are worded extremely specifically so that you can divine the correct answer even if youâre not especially well versed in the topic. And after youâre done, just like Wordle, youâre given a little emoji grid you can copy and paste to share with your friends.</p><p>I got Riley hooked on the game almost immediately after mentioning it at a meeting (Luke took one look at it and said heâd never touch it, based solely on the font it uses.). Itâs a nice little thing to do as my last thing before falling asleep. Itâs easy enough that I can complete it every dayâit helps that you can ask for basically as many hints as you want, which will point you toward a relevant clue on the grid and then, if you ask again, which character you want to be focusing onâbut also just tough enough to get my brain moving.</p><p>âI think it's a really interesting game, even though I find it a little hard to wrap my head around,â Riley told me. âSome of that is the ways it doesn't let you make notes (if I know one person is innocent and another is guilty, I can't indicate that on the game board somehow, like you would in an online sudoku or something) and the way that you sometimes have to keep a lot of clues in your head at once. I really like the way it prevents you from guessing, but I think sometimes that makes it feel like the thing you're solving is the creator's logic rather than the puzzle itself. It feels really constrained to me in a way that I think is ultimately good and necessary, but that as a newcomer to it I definitely find myself clashing with as I learn it.â</p><p>As Riley later saidâitâs Clues <em>By</em> Sam, not Samâs Generic Clues. Still, the personal nature of the game is what makes me like it. Wordle took off because it was so clearly one dudeâs project; famously, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Wardle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he developed it as a word game for his wife</a>. Clues By Sam has that same level of specificity. I wonder if Sam would be proud of how quickly I can solve his puzzles.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/peak-multiplayer-streamers"><h3>Peak Is A Playground For Slapstick Comedy</h3></a><p>Peak creates space for players to really fuck around, punctuated by a swift emphasis on finding out</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/new-york-times-video-games-ai-nyt"><h3>The New York Times Will Never Learn</h3></a><p>We kept getting fed the same bullshit, and itâs being laundered in the same kind of stories</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/spice-girls-anime-production-ig"><h3>Iâm Mad We Didnât Get A Spice Girls Anime</h3></a><p>Look I'm not saying it would have been good, but just look at how cool it looks!</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/clues-by-sam-wordle-daily-puzzle-game]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Renegade Game Studios has announced they are bringing back <em>Ikusa: Samurai Swords</em>. The tabletop publisher is working alongside Avalon Hill to bring an <em>Ikusa: Samurai Swords 40th Anniversary</em> board game via a crowdfunding campaign this Fall.</p>



<p>In an official post, Renegade Game Studios stated that both they and Avalon Hill will bring the <em>Ikusa: Samurai Swords 40th Anniversary</em> board game to players around the world by a crowdfunding campaign on <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/gamefound-acquires-indiegogo-greatly-expanding-tabletop-crowdfunding-platform" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gamefound</a>. This new version of the classic board game, known as <em>Shogun</em> to its most ardent fans, will feature new artwork, updated components, and more modern production values.</p>

If one wishes to gain the title of shogun, they will need to strategically deploy, manage, and command all armies and mercenaries at their command.</p>

<p>The post does confirm that the <em>Ikusa: Samurai Swords 40th Anniversary</em> board game Gamefound campaign will be packed with features and materials for dedicated fans and board game enthusiasts. This will include behind-the-scenes content, sneak peeks at the game's updated components, as well as giveaways.</p>

<p>This edition of the game will only be available via the Gamefound campaign. While a retail reprint isn't out of the question, if you want the most pristine version of this title, you will want to make time.</p>
