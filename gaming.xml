            <p>Breaking news, folks: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> bug basher <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> is a satire on authoritarian regimes, and apparently such an effective one that the United Nations even contacted Arrowhead to ask if they'd give a talk about psychological manipulation. Speaking at GDC as part of a presentation named 'Helldivers 2: Capturing Lightning in a Bottle,' Chief Easily identifiable satire Officer Johan Pilestedt gave some insight into the game's themes, then bragged about having the UN blowing his DMs constantly (said they got in contact once). Cheers, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/the-united-nations-asked-helldivers-2-studio-arrowhead-if-itd-give-a-talk-on-psychological-manipulation-could-we-brainwash-an-entire-community-to-fight-for-a-fascist-state-would-we-be-okay-with-that-turns-out-yeah/">Percy Gamer</a>.</p>

<p>"What is Helldivers 2, fundamentally? It would probably be fun to play a co-op action shooter where you’re put in the shoes of the evil side grunts of pop culture," Pilestedt said. "We asked ourselves, could we brainwash an entire community to fight for a fascist state? Would they? Would we be okay with that? And turns out, yeah, actually."</p>
<p>"We do it all in fun and good spirits, and we actually try to get people to recognise the science of what is a totalitarian state," he said. "If you start wearing the same uniform as everybody else and do salutes constantly, you might be in a totalitarian regime." Pilestedt also told his GDC audience to stop nattering while he was making important points about capes, otherwise he'd get his best mates the UN to come down and sort them out. At least, that's what I imagine happened. "Actually, we got a message from the UN asking if we want to talk, in some form, about psychological defense against manipulation". He didn't elaborate on whether anything actually came of this, however.</p>
<p>Pilestedt went on to say that they pulled aesthetics from the US, the EU, and the UN, alongside "mantras of regimes” like Nazi Germany and North Korea. “It creates pleasing aesthetics,” said Pilestedt, "because there’s something totalitarian regimes are really good at: pleasing aesthetics."</p>
<p>PC Gamer's own use of the words "prevent Helldivers 2 from getting too depressing" in regards to these uniforms is really insightful here, I think - drab deeds in shiny boots being one of fascism's calling cards.</p>
<p>I dislike ending articles with some variation on Howzabout YoU GamErMates ArE You Still Levelling Up For Super Earth?!? (even as these words likely appear above some godforsaken survey that asks you "where you dropping"?) but I'm actually genuinely curious about how the game is these days for people that have been playing since the beginning - I fell off Helldivers 2 for no particular reason months ago and haven't returned since.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Jack Black is set to play Steve in A Minecraft Movie, but that wasn't always going to be the case. Originally, Black was actually going to play a talking pig. No porky pies here - really, a talking pig.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/a-minecraft-movie-game-microsoft-1236341672/">Variety</a>, Mojang senior director of original content Torfi Frans Ólafsson revealed Black's switch to become Steve happened "very, very, very late" in the game. Ólafsson stated the team "needed an expert and host" in the film, and so Black went from being envisioned as a talking pig to becoming Steve.</p>

<p>Now, if you saw the trailers with Jack Black as Steve, and said to yourself (or even out loud), 'hang on, that isn't Steve! That's just Jack Black in a blue shirt!'. Well, you weren't alone, and the A Minecraft Movie team is aware of those reactions.</p>
<p>"This is not my Steve or your Steve - this is Jack Black's Steve," Ólafsson said of the part. "A lot of fans responded when they saw the first teasers and trailers, like, 'Hey, wait a minute -- this is just Jack Black. This isn't Jack Black being someone else.' And maybe it is, because this is literally him interpreting this character and what it means to him."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Meanwhile, Ólafsson got the cast and crew Xboxes for the trailers while on set, and booted up private Minecraft servers. The Mojang exec said Black logged over 100 hours on the blocky game, and became "the most passionate player" on set.</p>
<p>"He was just completely manic, hoarding stuff in the mines, searching for lapis lazuli because he liked the way it sounds," Ólafsson told the publication. "He kept saying it: 'Can I talk about lapis lazuli in the movie?'"</p>
<p>So, I guess listen out for mentions of Minecraft's blue mineral when the film releases next month.</p>
<p>To tie in with the upcoming film, the Minecraft team has also made that leaked movie pack for the game official. The  'A Minecraft Movie' in-game Hero Pack will be available from today, 20th March.</p>

</figure>
<p>The Minecraft Movie is set to release on 4th April. Along with Black's Steve, the film also stars Jason Momoa as Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison.</p>
<p>Away from the big screen, an animated Minecraft series was also announced for Netflix back in May. Netflix will produce the project alongside Minecraft developer Mojang Studios, while WildBrain Studios - the studio behind Sonic Prime - will handle the development.</p>
<p>While further details are thin on the ground, it is said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-animated-series-announced-for-netflix">upcoming show will "feature an original story with new characters</a>, showing the world of 'Minecraft' in a new light".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>What's the going rate for a flight to attend GDC these days? I ask because I'd have loved to be buzzing my merry way about the convention walls when Snail Games USA unveiled this doozy of an AI-generated trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-survival-evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a>'s Aquatica expansion. I'd give it a solid nine on the "we're not even trying to disguise it any longer" scale. How bad is it? Bad enough that original developers <a href="https://x.com/survivetheark/status/1901846059933942125">Studio Wildcard hastily and firmly distanced themselves</a> from the project, reiterating that their focus was on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-survival-ascended">ARK: Survival Ascended</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-2">Ark 2</a>.</p>
<p>If I had to sum up the trailer in a single word, I would attempt to write that word out with four-day old regurgitated Alphabetti spaghetti, invariably failing to give voice to my flailing disgust before retiring to the corner to fart at god. This would still take approximately fourteen times more effort than whoever got paid to write "like the ocean, but worse" into their phone to tease out the following results.</p>

<p>Fans are understandably gobsmacked at the sheer gall of it, as am I, honestly. Nothing builds excitement for a new release like the company behind it proudly declaring they have no respect for the audience's taste or intelligence. It's especially jarring considering Wildcard recently revealed an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ark-survival-ascendeds-first-expansion-recruits-the-studio-behind-jujutsu-kaisen-for-some-flashy-anime-cutscenes">animated trailer for their Lost Colony expansion by Jujutsu Kaisen studio</a> MAPPA. Now, I'm no art critic, but I do enjoy limbs being shown in correct quantities.</p>
<p>If I can say one positive thing about the trailer, it's that I'm actually nostalgic for the blooming synaptic flora shown at 0:43, because it reminds me of the very early days of GenAI-precursor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepDream">DeepDream</a>, a period where slop could at least have been said to have a distinct aesthetic rather than a distinct odour. I'm also tickled by the shirtless shark riding at 0:56 because, yes, it just looks like the cover of a smut novel about a guy who either fucks sharks or does all his fuckin' on sharkback.</p>
<p>Ah well, there's some comfort to be taken in the immediate and unanimous fan comment backlash at least. Wildcard <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ark-survival-ascended-will-be-sold-without-ark-2-after-backlash-but-will-still-cost-60">haven't been free of controversy themselves</a>, mind, but I suppose we're gradually becoming more wistful and appreciative of honest, artisanal fuck-ups in the face of the alternative. In the meantime, the demoralising assault from all angles on all facets of existence will continue until morale improves.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>During a recent online global showcase streamed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/QkXfP9rwrm8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on YouTube</a> and Twitch, inZOI Producer and Director and CEO of inZOI Studio Hyungjun “Kjun” Kim revealed several details about the highly anticipated life simulation game due to launch next week in early access. First and foremost, the pricing was confirmed to be $39.99 with no in-game purchases. This includes all updates and 'DLC' during the early access phase. The developer teased that upcoming content includes freelance jobs, ghost play, a Southeast Asian-inspired cat island called Kucingku, swimming pools and swimming skills, a family tree, new professions, and more.</p>
<p>For those who really cannot wait for March 28, the team has released a free demo called Creative Studio that lets players customize their character and home. However, there is a bit of a trick to getting access to Creative Studio, as you'll need to obtain it as a 'Drop reward' after watching streamed gameplay of inZOI on one of four streaming platforms:</p>
<p><em><b>Twitch &amp; Chzzk</b></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>First, link your KRAFTON ID with your streaming platform account. You can conveniently link your accounts on the following&nbsp;<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fplayinzoi.com%2Fen%2Fevents%2Fdrops">microsite</a>.</em></li>
<li><em>After adding inZOI to your Steam wishlist and watching a broadcast with the inZOI category for at least 15 minutes, a key will be granted.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><b>Steam</b></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>If you watch inZOI streaming on the&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/?snr=1_5_9_">Steam store page</a>&nbsp;for 30 minutes or more,&nbsp;<b>inZOI: Creative Studio</b>&nbsp;will be added to your Steam library.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><b>SOOP</b></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>If you accumulate 30 minutes of viewing on a broadcast with the inZOI category set, a key will be granted.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The Drops event will run until 22 March at 23:59 UTC and may end early if the supply of codes runs out. However, fear not, as right afterward (from 23rd March 00:00 UTC until 27th March 23:59 UTC), the developers will open up inZOI: Creative Studio to everyone.</p>
<p><iframe title="inZOI: Creative Studio Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M-p8SNK9jg4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Toward the end of the online global showcase, Hyungjun Kim said:</p>
<p><em>I hope that players will be able to experience things that they can’t in real life, feel a sense of control over life itself, and have the opportunity to look at life from a slight distance. It has been a rough ride and there may still be some shortcomings, but we are committed to paying close attention to feedback from our community as we continue to improve the game towards its full release as soon as possible.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-will-require-a-rather-powerful-pc-ryzen-7-9800x3d-recommended-for-high-preset/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requires a rather powerful PC</a> if you plan to play it maxed out with the graphics settings. There will be support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution as well as the unique <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-to-power-dynamic-ai-characters-companions-and-bosses-in-pubg-naraka-bladepoint-inzoi-and-mir5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'Smart ZOI' NPC feature powered by NVIDIA ACE</a> and a .5B billion parameter Mistral NeMo Minitron small language model that runs locally on your NVIDIA GPU when playing inZOI.</p>

			<p>After around a year and a half of near-complete silence, Honor of Kings: World has resurfaced at the Game Developers Conference 2025 with a gorgeous new trailer that shows off the game's vibrant biomes and several boss fights, including some featuring a group of players.</p>
<p>Honor of Kings: World takes place in the setting of the extremely popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game. In 2024, Honor of Kings was the top-grossing mobile game with $2.6 billion. Of course, this is a much different game. It was <a href="https://wccftech.com/honor-of-kings-world-is-an-action-rpg-announced-by-tencent-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in October 2021 as an open world action RPG developed by TiMi Studio Group, developer of Call of Duty: Mobile, Pokémon UNITE, Age of Empires Mobile, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-hands-on-preview-revisiting-a-cinema-classic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta Force</a>. It also features a collaboration with acclaimed Chinese writer Liu Cixin, known for The Three-Body Problem. Apparently, he will adapt a story called The Poetry Cloud. In May 2023, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/honor-of-kings-world-to-support-dlss-3-ray-tracing-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Honor of Kings: World would support NVIDIA DLSS 3 and ray tracing on PC. It is likely that before its release, it will be updated to the new DLSS 4.</p>

<p>Honor of Kings: World is playable for the first time at the Game Developers Conference 2025, and our envoy Kai Tatsumoto has an appointment to check it out, so stay tuned for our first impressions of the game. For now, it has been announced to be coming for PC and mobile; you can find the newly launched official website <a href="https://honorofkingsworld.com/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, a Twitch streamer accidentally revealed her viewbotting tool while streaming, prompting her to restart her broadcast and try to cover up the blunder by linking it to an OBS update. This is one of the few tangible examples we’ve got of Twitch streamers (and streamers on other platforms) using viewbotting tools to appear more popular than they are.</p>



<p>It’s a topic that has become all too common of late, with streamers going live to thousands of viewers but only having a few dozen people chatting at any given time – if that. In situations like this, it’s becoming much easier to cast stones at those maliciously boosting their viewer count. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-red-handed">Red-Handed</h2>



<p>In a clip that’s doing the rounds on social media, QueenGloriaRP was caught flashing up a viewbotting panel as she started her stream. It was clipped, captured, and circulated almost immediately, with users slamming the small streamer for cheating the platform.</p>



<p>QueenGloraRP had racked up just 3,600 followers when she was banned by Twitch hours after the viewbotting debacle surfaced online.</p>



<p>Gaming World Media’s Jake Lucky took to social media to share his clear concerns about the situation, along with a copy of the clip:</p>



<div><article><p><span>So if this random Twitch streamer is viewbotting just 20 viewers… how many streamers are doing this? </span></p></article></div>







<p>It’s fair game for the average small streamer to worry about. They’re often punishing themselves for not netting as many viewers as the next streamer, but how often are the numbers being misrepresented by viewbotting tools? In QueenGloriaRP’s slip-up, it’s easy to see how simple it is to generate fake viewer counts, and she was only adding on a humble 20 non-existent audience members.</p>



<p>What about the larger streamers that have viewer counts in the tens of thousands? What percentage of that audience is real?</p>



<p>The panel that QueenGloriaRP revealed broke down how users will <strong>pay </strong>for their fake viewers. It looked like a token-based system was used, with more viewers equalling more credits (10 pcs for each viewer per hour). If it wasn’t bad enough that she was viewbotting, <strong>paying </strong>for the privilege is nuts on another level.</p>



<p>It’s fake growth; it’ll get you nowhere.</p>

<p>Balatro has continued a winning streak at the Game Developer’s Conference in San Francisco. At the showcase’s award ceremony, Balatro secured four major awards, including Game of the Year. It doesn’t come as much of a surprise, as the solo dev spectacle of a game has continued to take the world by storm since being released just over a year ago.</p>



<p>Astro Bot also secured multiple awards at the GDC ceremony, including Best Audio and Best Technology.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-gdc-awards-winners">All GDC Awards Winners</h2>



<p>GDC is getting bigger and brighter all the time, and it’s starting to rival Gamescom with how expansive it is. This year’s GDC Awards ceremony was a showstopper, with last year’s best games being showered with praise by attendees.</p>



<p>Here’s the full list of winners from the GDC Awards:</p>



<ul>
<li>Game of the Year – Balatro</li>



<li>Best Audio – Astro Bot</li>



<li>Best Debut – Balatro</li>



<li>Best Design – Balatro</li>



<li>Best Narrative – Metaphor: ReFantazio</li>



<li>Best Technology – Astro Bot</li>



<li>Best Visual Art – Black Myth: Wukong</li>



<li>Audience Award – Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</li>



<li>Innovation Award – Balatro</li>



<li>Lifetime Achievement Award – Sam Lake</li>



<li>Pioneer Award – Lucas Pope</li>



<li>Social Impact Award – Life is Strange: Double Exposure</li>
</ul>



<p>Recently, Balatro’s solo developer went on record with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/localthunk-the-balatro-timeline-solo-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a feature-length blog post</a> that explained what it took to bring Balatro to life. It was a tale of a stressful, strenuous journey that left his mental and physical health in tatters for a time, but it paid off when the game launched to an overwhelmingly positive reception and made $600,000 on Steam in ‘just a couple of hours’.</p>



<p>The GDC Awards represents one of the last awards shows dedicated to 2024’s spread of games. With that buttoned up, we can now look to 2025’s best games, which have already started emerging. I’m willing to bet that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a> will secure more than a few awards as the year unravels.</p>

        <figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Digimon-Con_Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger_2025_03-20-25_001.jpg"></a></figure><p>“The story begins in Tokyo, Japan.</p><p>“The protagonist is an agent of ADAMAS, a secret organization that specializes in investigating and solving anomalous phenomena.</p><p>“In the course of their investigation, they encounter an unknown creature called a “Digimon” in Shinjuku, an area sealed off by the government, and are caught up in a mysterious explosion.</p><p>“They then reawaken eight years in the past…</p><p>“The protagonist then pursues the mystery of the impending world’s collapse, while searching for a way to stop it. Players can experience an epic story that depicts the bonds and conflicts arising from the complex intertwining of two opposing elements: ‘Past and Future,’ ‘The Human World and The Digital World,’ and ‘Humans and Digimon.’ <a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> an epic story of bonds and conflicts between humans and Digimon!”</p><p><strong>■ Two Worlds: Human World and Digital World</strong></p><p>“The setting of this story will be split between the Human World and the Digital World: Iliad.”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Digimon-Con_Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger_2025_03-20-25_002.jpg"></a></figure><p>“On the Human World side, the story will mainly be centered on Shinjuku and Akihabara. The previous <em>Cyber Sleuth</em> titles featured various areas from within Tokyo, but in this new title, instead of deliberately narrowing things down, we decided to prioritize recreating the city with a greater sense of scale and detail to maximize the sense of immersion in the story. Especially in Shinjuku, where we recreated part of the underground mall. To be honest, I can hardly remember the entire map. Even in the game, there might be times where you leave through the wrong exit and find yourself at a bus stop or something.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Digimon-Con_Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger_2025_03-20-25_003.jpg"></a></figure><p>“Now, let me introduce the other side of the game, the Digital World: Iliad. This is Central Town, which will be at the center of the <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,139 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>. It’s packed with all sorts of Digimon, and also home to a number of shops that will be of great use to the protagonist. Everywhere you turn in this city, there are Digimon of course, and all sorts of trendy bars and whatnot. The city gives the strong impression that it’s a place where Digimon live their lives.</p><p>“In the <em>Cyber Sleuth</em> games, you would travel back and forth between the Human World and Cyberspace, but there were very few opportunities to actually visit the Digital World. In this new title, you will be making frequent visits to the Digital World, and as you briefly saw in the trailer, the game will use a symbol encounter system in which you will battle enemy Digimon by touching them. Since there are Digimon everywhere, we believe that this will give a completely different sense of immersion and impact to the players’ adventure. There are plenty of other fascinating and charming areas in the Digital World, so keep your eyes peeled for more information in the future.”</p><p><strong>■ A Greater Sense of Immersion</strong></p><p>“As I mentioned while introducing the Human World, we really paid attention to the sense of immersion in the story. We took extra care to enhance this, and tried to avoid making any choices that might inhibit it. We’ve especially dedicated our efforts to developing the story. I believe that the overall setting, the construction, and appearance of each area, and so on, are all important parts of setting the stage to enhance the story. After all, if the setting is haphazard or messy, it makes it hard to appreciate the story itself, so we’re taking extra care to depict everything that needs to be depicted.</p><p>“For example, Central Town, which is the center of the whole adventure, is a town full of energy, so when it comes to the three-dimensional space, the sense of life from the Digimon that live there, the distribution of those Digimon, and even the background music and environmental sounds—we created all of them with the hope that it would make the players feel the density of the place, and that its overflowing energy would invigorate players with motivation to set off on their next adventure. Also, to give you a clearer idea, the different areas in Iliad each use the gears that also appear in the game’s title logo in different ways. The gears themselves actually hold a significant hidden meaning, so if you pay careful attention to where they appear during your adventure. I think you’ll find it to be even more enjoyable.”</p><p><strong>■ “Time” as a Keyword</strong></p><p>“This part [the keyword of “Time”] is directly tied to the storyline of the game, so it’s a bit hard for me to talk about in detail, but I’ll tell you a little bit about it. The primary objective of the game is to identify and prevent the cause of the mystery of the world’s collapse, which is destined to come sooner or later. As briefly mentioned in the plot synopsis, the protagonist is not able to travel through time at will, but the story will progress as they grow more involved with it. From the protagonist’s perspective, Digimon are a completely unknown existence to them, and the fact that they are thrown back and forth through time on top of that makes for some extraordinarily unusual situations. The intersection of the Human and Digital Worlds was a plot point utilized in past anime and games as well, but this title will show you just what kind of developments can occur by adding the element of time into the mix. We hope that players will be able to enjoy this unique dramatic experience with their own hands.”</p><p><strong>■ Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Protagonist: Dan Yuki / Protagonist: Kanan Yuki</strong> – Agent of a Special Investigation Bureau ADAMAS. Caught in a mysterious explosion and sent back eight years…</li></ul><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Digimon-Con_Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger_2025_03-20-25_004.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Digimon-Con_Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger_2025_03-20-25_005.jpg"></a></figure><p>“These two are the protagonists that you saw in the teaser visual shown earlier. Their names are Dan Yuki and Kanan Yuki. They are both agents of the secret organization ADAMAS, which specializes in investigating and solving anomalous phenomena. In fact, they are the most promising duo in the entire organization.</p><p>“In the previous <em>Cyber Sleuth</em> games, where you could choose between the two protagonist, Takumi Aiba and Ami Aiba, whichever character you did not choose would not appear elsewhere in the game. However, in this game, players will control the character they choose at the start, while the other character will serve as their operator, providing instructions and advice from the organization’s headquarters. As such, one of the endearing things about this title is that you can see the different ways in which the two characters do their work. To be frank, if you asked me which one of the two roles gets more spoken lines, I’d have to say it would probably be the operator, so it makes sense to make your decision from that point of view as well.”</p><ul><li><strong>Inori Misono</strong> – A kind-hearted girl embarks on an adventure across the worlds with an agent.</li></ul><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Digimon-Con_Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger_2025_03-20-25_006.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Digimon-Con_Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger_2025_03-20-25_007.jpg"></a></figure><p>“Next up, we have the game’s main heroine, Inori Misono, a kind-hearted and caring high school girl. She grew to be like this because of a certain event that she experienced in her past. Her past is also related to what led her to accompany the protagonist on their adventure. Stay tuned for future updates to find out exactly what happened to her, and what kind of active role she will play in the story.”</p><ul><li><strong>Aegiomon</strong> – Inori’s partner Digimon. A Digimon that holds the key to the story. What fate awaits them?</li></ul><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Digimon-Con_Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger_2025_03-20-25_008.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Digimon-Con_Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger_2025_03-20-25_009.jpg"></a></figure><p>“Next is Aegiomon, the Digimon that holds the key to this title’s story. Encountering the protagonists in the human world, and working together with Inori Misono, who we just introduced, as her partner Digimon. In battles, the player will control a party of three Digimon, and Aegiomon will join them as an extra battle member, making them one of the most reliable companions both in the story and in battles. I could even go as far as to say he’s one of the protagonists, so I hope you’ll look forward to seeing what Aegiomon gets up to in the game proper.”</p><ul><li><strong>Partner Digimon: Patamon, Gomamon, and DemiDevimon</strong></li></ul><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Digimon-Con_Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger_2025_03-20-25_010.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Digimon-Con_Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger_2025_03-20-25_011.jpg"></a></figure><p>“Up next, let me introduce the Digimon we briefly saw in the teaser visual. At the start of the game, players will gain either Patamon, Gomamon, or DemiDevimon as their teammate. Players will chose one of these three, which will then be provided to them by the secret organization ADAMAS. <em>Digimon Story</em> games are all about bringing a bunch of different Digimon to your side and training them in tandem, but the one you choose at the start always feels the most special, and players can’t help but favor them… I hope that everyone will enjoy their adventure together with their favorite Digimon!”</p><ul><li><strong>????</strong></li></ul><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Digimon-Con_Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger_2025_03-20-25_012.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Digimon-Con_Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger_2025_03-20-25_013.jpg"></a></figure><p>“Next, this was designed by Oh! great. What is its purpose? How will it stand in the protagonist’s way? What is it in the first place!? Without a doubt, it is a key element in the story. You can see part of its body for a brief moment in the trailer, but you can tell how huge it is. If you’re curious, go ahead and give the trailer another watch!</p><p>“That’s all for the character introductions, but there are plenty of other characters and Digimon that I wasn’t able to share with you today, so please keep an eye out for future announcements.”</p><p><strong>■ Olympos XII</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Digimon-Con_Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger_2025_03-20-25_014.jpg"></a></figure><p>“I had originally planned to unveil [this] information in a future announcement, but since today is <em>Digimon</em> Con, I’ll just come out and say it now! In this game, the Digimon that make up the Olympos XII will play an active role in the story. Simply put, the Olympos XII are 12 Digimon that serve as protectors of the Digital World: Iliad, and their powers are said to rival those of the Royal Knights. Some of their members have made various appearances as Digimon in past anime and games, but they have scarcely ever appeared all together on this scale before… A major event brings them together in this game.”</p><p><strong>■ Over 450 Digimon in the Game</strong></p><p>“<em>Cyber Sleuth</em> featured about 250 Digimon, and if you include the follow-up <em>Hacker’s Memory</em>, that total was brought up to about 330, but this game has one-upped them both, allowing players to train more than 450 Digimon in total! This is the largest roster ever seen in the <em>Digimon Story</em> series. I’m sure everyone will have fun digivolving and dedigivolving their Digimon! We will be revealing more and more Digimon in the future, so please stay tuned and look forward to it! I’m not at liberty to share any more information regarding [whether the three starter Digimon will have more possible digivolutions as well] right now!”</p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Digimon Story: Time Stranger - Sneak Peek at Some of the Digimon" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ej5IPwViq5M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>(Editor’s Note: This is a low-quality stream recording. It will be replaced with an official upload once it is available.)</p><p>“Everyone on the team loves Digimon, so we really wanted to give Angewomon the energy she deserves. The quality was pretty good to begin with, but we ended up redoing the Terra Force animation three times over. We were like, ‘We can make this look even better!’ That’s just how much the creators love Digimon, and that’s what lets the modeling and animation have such a passionate flair to it.”</p><p><strong>A Message to Fans</strong></p><p>“<em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> will be the latest <em>Digimon Story</em> series since the release of its predecessor, <em>Cyber Sleuth</em>, 10 years ago. I can only express my sincerest gratitude to all the fans who have waited so patiently for this new installment, and it brings me incredible joy to be the one who is able to bring it to all of you now. We hope that this will satisfy not only our long-time fans, but also newcomers who have yet to experience the <em>Digimon</em> video games. The entire development team will continue to work our hardest on the game up until its release.”</p></div><p>Watch the <em>Digimon</em> Con archive below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/inzoi-review-early-access<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a lot of fine details that go into making a life simulator fun but also reflective of the real world. You have to balance customizability and creative freedom with just enough rules to make choices feel realistic and challenging, and then invisibly weave those decisions together in a satisfying way. (It turns out recreating life is hard – sorry for all the flak, Dr. Frankenstein.) Yet, despite the difficulties, it’s a task developer Krafton has taken a respectable stab at with inZOI based on what I’ve played of its Early Access launch version so far. Its beautiful, realistic aesthetic makes a striking first impression, and the ambitious simulator systems underneath initially result in some impressive harmony. However, as I continue to spend more time within this simulation, the seams of inZOI’s universe are starting to show, leaving the world more empty than you might expect. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Addressing the elephant in the room first, it’s impossible not to immediately compare inZOI to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-4-review-2024"><u>The Sims</u></a>, a series it’s very clearly both taking inspiration from and attempting to compete with. You play as an omnipotent figure who can create and control little citizens as they live their best, or more often worse, lives. You can build up a house from scratch, manipulate the features of each person (who are called Zoi), and embroil them in all the local drama you can find. They can have jobs, go to school, and explore the local area with as much or as little free will as you allow. These surface-level similarities quickly run thin, though, once you start digging into Krafton’s unique take on this genre. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">inZOI Gameplay Screenshots (Early Access)</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When you start a new game in inZOI, you must first build a household using the detailed Character Creator Studio. Alongside choosing their name, gender, and age, you can select a Trait that defines your avatar’s personality. There are 18 to choose from, ranging from Authoritarian to Individualist, with each option providing a handy Characteristics sidebar describing how this choice will affect how they operate in-game. As a hardworking freelancer, I opted for the Go-Getter trait, which values professional activities and, in an endearing twist, also holds onto nervousness for longer than other Zois. As you press on into the ebb and flow of virtual life, your Zoi will develop their ego further as they encounter likes and dislikes, such as fast food and fitness, that meddle with their mood. inZOI neatly wraps up personality archetypes into simple grab-and-go options, which, while convenient, can feel a bit limiting. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where looks are concerned, you can pick from a sizeable list of presets or take a more fine-tooth comb approach, tugging at the specific anchor points on your Zoi’s body and face – I opted for a combination of both, finding my closest match and generously moulding them in my image. There's a selection of preset colours alongside a granular colour picker for many options too, allowing more nuance in your choices. Courtesy of inZOI’s realistic visual style, my Zoi quickly resembled a real person, and I enjoyed the process of coordinating their make-up and hair with my own.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s inZOI’s fashion sensibilities that really make it stand out.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The system for adjusting facial features is a thoroughly engrossing time-sink, but it’s inZOI’s fashion sensibilities that really make it stand out. During the creation process, you need to curate nine different outfits, including formalwear, sleepwear, and weather-appropriate attire for summer and winter. There’s a decent mix of modern trends, like cargo-style parachute pants, alongside tailored classics like military and leather jackets. Basics like t-shirts also come in multiple lengths, and you can mix and match and layer to your heart's content. Safe to say, I spent even longer here, curating a Y2K-inspired outfit complete with leg warmers, Doc Marten dupes, and an adorable oversized baseball jersey. It’s not a totally flawless system, with the baggier silhouetted clothing options clipping against the Zois in strange ways. Still, this felt like one of the more polished aspects of inZOI, and I thoroughly enjoyed playing dress-up with my creations. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once your family is organised, the next step is finding them a home. Currently, inZOI boasts two locations: the Korean-inspired city of Dowon, and the Californian Bliss Bay. You can build your own house or move into a predesigned lot, with each township featuring a small selection of public plots like shops, cafes, and open spaces like parks or shrines. Unfortunately, it’s here that I first noticed the seams of Krafton’s ambitious project starting to show. Illuminated neon signs coat the streets of Dowon with a dreamy multicolour glow, while in Bliss Bay, the setting sun imbues the beach with a soothing coastal atmosphere. Sit too long, though, and it all starts to feel a bit hollow. Those neon signs sit atop empty buildings, and the gentle sunlight reflects off static bits of set dressing. It’s clear a lot of care has been taken to give the <em>impression </em>of a bustling environment, and I admired those details – particularly the faux McDonalds, which garnered a giggle from me – but I couldn’t shake the feeling that much of the world is mostly a facade.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That nagging sensation continued into my Zoi’s daily life, where I could manage their needs like hunger and hygiene but not really make headway on how they fit into the digital culture. Despite choosing the Go-Getter trait, I didn’t get the impression it was making too much of a tangible difference in my day-to-day activities, especially when my other Zoi was acting essentially the same despite the fact I’d given them an oppositional personality style. I ran into the same blockades when I started a family in a separate household, with many conversations repeating on a loop no matter who I was controlling. Topics like Cryptocurrency and the power of humility kept showing up in my dialogue tree. It was admittedly funny the first few times, but gradually, that repetition made progressing relationships a tad monotonous. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s delightful that the things like your Zoi’s treadmill display seems functional, or that the detail of  their food is so convincing that my stomach often rumbled in unison with my avatar’s as they tucked into their lunch. However, these pockets of well-designed actions can make the simplistic or repetitive alternatives feel cold by comparison. Over time, it was as if my Zoi was less of an individual and more of a semi-controllable drone, performing tasks without rhyme or reason. Perhaps the options will diversify once they fill out their likes and dislikes and make more friends, though I certainly didn’t notice any differences across the roughly 15 hours I’ve played so far. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>inZOI is an Early Access game, and as of right now, it certainly feels like one.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, a salve to this weirdness is inZOI’s Karma system, which punishes or rewards citizens based on their actions. When interacting with other Zois or objects, you’re occasionally presented with a choice accompanied by a yin and yang symbol, letting you know that performing that action will affect their Karmic score. Stealing coins from a parking meter is considered bad, whereas giving directions to a random person is considered good. While I was initially sceptical, I soon came to feel the system’s wrath. I sent my Zoi on an unwarranted tirade, hulking out at the local park and kicking a vending machine before attempting to win a stuffed turkey toy at a claw machine. After a shocking number of attempts, the toy remained trapped in its plexiglass prison. From here, I directed my Zoi to become a model citizen, complimenting strangers and telling gregarious jokes before returning to the same machine. Wouldn’t you believe it, they won a prize on their first attempt this time. Karma is a simple concept that works well in practice and offers a pleasant invisible boundary to rub against – I only wish more actions would impact the score. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is still much more to do and see before I reach a final verdict, like diving into its careers, cars, and the nitty-gritty of the build mode, and that’s just to start. inZOI is an Early Access game, and as of right now, it certainly feels like one. The lifelike visuals and smattering of highly detailed interactions feel at odds with its rougher, less immersive edges, giving the world a sometimes strange and sterile atmosphere. Even so, there’s a surprising amount of depth hidden amongst these blind spots, and I’m keen to see if inZOI can deliver on its monumental promises – both in the long-term, and as I work toward my final review of what’s here at launch in the coming weeks.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p><span>Hitting is one of the most frustrating yet rewarding experiences in all of </span><a href="///">MLB The Show 25</a><span>.</span> One moment, you're sending balls into the stands; the next, you can't seem to hit a single pitch coming your way. While you can go through slumps, just like MLB players do in real life, your struggles with hitting could come down to something as simple as your settings.</p><p>In MLB The Show 25, the ideal hitting style uses the "Zone" Hitting Interface. This interface allows you to more accurately get the barrel of your bat on the ball. The Zone interface is also the only option that allows for the use of PCI, or Plate Control Indicator. PCI is an entirely different ballgame in the settings menu, and going through the various options can get confusing.</p><p>To ensure you have the best chance to hit in MLB The Show 25, check out the guide to see the top PCI settings.</p><h2>Best PCI Settings in MLB The Show 25</h2><p>You can change your PCI settings in MLB The Show 25 by going to the settings menu, selecting "Gameplay," and then scrolling down the "Hitting" section of the settings. As previously mentioned, you can only use PCI settings if you have the Zone Hitting Interface selected. If you have the other two options, Timing or Directional, all of the PCI settings will be locked.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461524-img_6470.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461524" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461524-img_6470.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461524"></a><figcaption>The hitting menu in MLB The Show 25</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461524-img_6470.jpg"></figure><p>The PCI settings encompass a few different areas. You have how the PCI is set up when certain pitchers are on the mound, how the PCI looks at the plate, and whether you can see the PCI icon or not. There are over a dozen PCI-specific settings in the hitting menu, and the game doesn't do a terrific job of explaining what each one does.</p><p>Fortunately, you can view the list below to see every PCI setting laid out and what we recommend for every option:</p><ul><li><strong>PCI Anchor</strong>: This determines if the PCI icon appears in a specific spot depending on what type of pitcher is on the mound. It's usually better to have this off if you want to have full control over the PCI, but you can also enable it if you're just learning how to hit.</li><li><strong>RHP vs RHH, RHP vs. LHH, LHP vs. RHH, RHP vs. RHH</strong>: These can only be changed if you have enabled the PCI Anchor. If you have the anchor enabled, you can choose where the PCI Anchor is parked when each pitcher/hitter scenario arises.</li><li><strong>Free Anchor Reset</strong>: Batter</li><li><strong>PCI Anchor Dots</strong>: On if you are using the PCI Anchor</li><li><strong>Plate Coverage Indicator</strong>: This setting determines whether the PCI icon appears in the strikezone when you're up to bat. Generally, most players want this enabled, as it can get difficult to know where you're swinging without seeing the indicator.</li><li><strong>PCI Center</strong>: Diamonds. This has been the PCI meta for years, as Diamonds don't take up too much room but they're easy to see</li><li><strong>PCI Inner</strong>: Starfighter. This is more preference, but Starfighter is the best all-around option. You can use Basic if you're just learning how to use PCI.</li><li><strong>PCI Outer</strong>: None. This helps to reduce the size of the PCI icon and gets rid of some extra distraction that you really don't need.</li><li><strong>PCI Color</strong>: A bright color that you can see easily. Most players use the standard Yellow color, but you can also use Red or something else. You could go the other way as well and use Black, but that can get lost in the background of a field sometimes.</li><li><strong>PCI Opacity</strong>: 80%. This increases or reduces how transparent the PCI icon is. You want it mostly visible but still a little see-through so it doesn't become too distracting on the screen.</li><li><strong>PCI Fadeout</strong>: None. This either makes it so the PCI icon fades before a pitch is delivered or it stays on the screen until you swing the bat. This is mostly personal preference.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461525-img_6469.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461525" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461525-img_6469.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461525"></a><figcaption>The preferred PCI settings</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461525-img_6469.jpg"></figure><p>Those are some baseline PCI settings in MLB The Show 25 that can work for new and veteran players alike. It's also recommended to head into a practice mode and try out different settings so you have a better idea of what you prefer.</p><p>Some MLB The Show players like the Bat PCI Center, as it allows them to visualize swinging a pitch better. However, others prefer no center and just like a couple of dots on their screen so they can focus more on the pitch. The PCI color is also completely up to you, as everyone has a different eyesight.</p><p>If you're just looking for some basic PCI settings that you can set and never touch again, you have them. However, this is also just a foundation, as you can fiddle with the individual settings more and more as you continue to use the PCI system in MLB The Show 25.</p>
