            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Like video game adaptations, live-action anime adaptations get a bad rap for being so rancid that fans preemptively sling shit at their creators for having the audacity to attempt them. Having been a card-carrying member of that camp for years, when I tuned into <em>Bet</em>, Netflix’s live-action take on <em>Kakegurui</em>, I expected an irredeemable trainwreck. What I got instead was a surprisingly entertaining, campy fever dream. I take pride in contributing to getting it greenlit for a second season.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Bet | Official Trailer | Netflix" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R7xl9QjtNDc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Developed by Simon Berry, <em>Bet</em> reimagines Homura Kawamoto and Tōru Naomura’s 2014 psychological drama series <em>Kakegurui: Compulsive Gambler</em>. The original manga follows Yumeko Jabami, a precocious high school transfer student at a prestigious academy where one’s social status is determined by underground gambling. Think <em>Yu-Gi-Oh</em>’s early manga chaos meets <a href="https://kotaku.com/12-things-to-check-out-after-youve-binged-squid-game-1847875371/2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Kaiji</em></a>’s debt-riddled death games. The anime adaptation by Mappa in 2017 catapulted the series into pop culture prominence, and I even ranked it as the <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-anime-ranked-decade-attack-on-titan-demon-slayer-1850117910/2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30th best anime of the decade</a> at the other website.</p><p>Visually, <em>Bet </em>is Netflix’s CW-esque answer to <em>Riverdale </em>with BBC’s<em> Sherlock</em> levels of overproduction. Its set design and costuming go hard—like, somebody put their whole bussy into it hard. Sure, the show is still campy and wacky, just like its source material, but it leans into that chaos rather than apologizing for it. Unlike Hollywood's more infamous anime misfires (cough cough <em>Dragon Ball Evolution</em> and <em>The Last Airbender</em>), Bet embraces its eccentricity with pride, and while being a more palatable thing to have folks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS7mdn4DFuc&amp;pp=ygUaa2FrZWd1cnVpIGd1biBzY2VuZSBtaWRhcmk%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walk in on you watching</a> than its anime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figure><figcaption><span>Netflix</span></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><span>Netflix</span></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><span>Netflix</span></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><span>Netflix</span></figcaption></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p><em>Bet</em> doesn’t just cosplay the source material—it remixes it by Americanizing it in the most contemporary camp way possible. And in doing so, <em>Bet </em>fixes things that even the manga and anime never quite nailed. Mainly, how it handled adapting three characters from the source material.&nbsp;</p><p>First off is actor Miku Martineau’s Yumeko. In the anime, she’s a manic enigma who gets turned on by the danger of gambling even when the odds are stacked against her. With each episode, she inexplicably wins every game (even when her opponents are cheating), making the viewing experience bereft of emotional stakes. <em>Bet </em>gives her gravity. While she’s still as much a thrill-seeker as her counterpart, her backstory as a girl haunted by the murder of her parents and her quest for revenge, wrapped in that grief, is lampshaded at the start of the show, giving viewers a tangible character to root for from the get-go.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Kakegurui | Trailer [HD] | Netflix" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cTlHQiRNVl0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In contrast, the anime takes forever and a day to reveal that plot point. Thanks to this change, Yumeko’s highs and lows feel earned. Every rare stumble, recalibration, and fight from beneath make her victories feel like actual triumphs instead of a narrative inevitability.&nbsp;</p><p>Then there's Ryan, the race-swapped version of Ryota, played by Black actor Ayo Solanke. In the manga and anime, Ryota is basically a glorified background character whose only purpose is to react to all the wild shit Yumeko does as an analogue for the audience. <em>Bet</em> gives Ryan his own arc where his one-sided crush on Yumeko, in tandem with his own family issues, gives him a seat at the table as a character with as much agency, if not more so, than the show’s leading lady. Even original show moments where the series feels like it's dipping into eye-rolling territory, like a plot line where the school places bets on Ryan losing his virginity to Yumeko, are played with emotional maturity and care. Where the anime would have Yumeko handwave away the danger her gambling has on her cohorts, like a bullishly written Batman, <em>Bet</em>’s Yumeko doesn’t unwittingly gamble with her friends' lives like an asshole.</p><p>Another character I was surprised by was how much I loved Netflix’s adaptation compared to the anime was <em>Bet</em>’s reimagined version of the early villain, <a href="https://kakegurui.fandom.com/wiki/Itsuki_Sumeragi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Itsuki Sumeragi</a>. In the anime, Itsuki is a one-note sadist who takes joy in collecting her victims’ fingernails as trophies. But the adaptation transforms her into <a href="https://kakegurui.fandom.com/wiki/Suki_Hennessey#Appearance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Suki Hennessey</a>, a gender-nonconforming character with a shady influencer past, akin to James Charles. Suki actor <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dnybackact/video/7523628335675575557" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryan Sutherland</a> might as well have been Denzel Washington, given how he chewed up the scenery in every scene he was in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Yumeko Accepts Mary’s Challenge to Skirmish | Bet | Netflix Philippines" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MSASvyra1ZQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Bet</em>’s whole vibe isn’t far off from Netflix’s live-action <em>Death Note</em>—which, yes, features Margaret Qualley for some reason—but Bet scratches the same “if this anime took place in America” itch with more confidence. And, unlike Death Note, which survives almost entirely on the galaxy-brained casting of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMHFlD65hY4&amp;pp=ygUXd2lsbGVtIGRhZm9lIGRlYXRoIG5vdGU%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Willem Dafoe as Ryuk</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1mcQ6CzXo8&amp;pp=ygUcbGFrZWl0aCBzdGFuZmllbGQgZGVhdGggbm90ZQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LaKeith Stanfield as L</a>, <em>Bet</em> doesn’t hedge its bets on a single saving grace. It’s just top-to-bottom unpapologetic cringe, as it was meant to be.</p><p>My inciting incident that convinced me and my friend to watch the series was our collective curiosity about how WWE champion Seth Rollins would make a cameo in the series—a cameo that, out of context, reeked to us of shameless brand synergy following Netflix’s own hosting of WWE Raw. Spoiler: <a href="https://x.com/25_Saurav/status/1906705868831228331" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rollins’ already cunty wardrobe</a> and shrill, whiny tone fit right into the show’s madness as another brilliant point of casting.&nbsp;</p><p>In comparison to <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-one-piece-yu-yu-hakusho-anime-live-action-netfl-1850050620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other upcoming live-action anime projects </a>fans are biting their nails to the nub in anxiety over, <em>Kakegurui </em>isn’t a sacred cow in the grander anime community. It’s a weird, horny, and chaotic mess—and <em>Bet </em>understands that. It doesn’t try to sanitize it. Instead, it Westernizes it in ways that feel playful rather than disrespectful. Like <a href="https://kotaku.com/one-piece-netflix-live-action-oda-luffy-review-anime-1850788857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>One Piece</em></a> being a similar&nbsp; to <em>Percy Jackson</em>’s whimsical energy or <em>Death Note</em> morphing into <em>Final Destination</em>, <em>Bet </em>knows where not to overstep and where to play loudly within its adaptation.&nbsp;</p><p>So if Netflix’s export of live-action anime series going forward is going to lean into CW-style camp, then I welcome it as a chaotic but valuable addition to the anime and manga ecosystem. Adaptations like <em>Bet </em>aren’t slop or guilty pleasures—they’re gateways where normies could join in the fold and check out the anime and manga that inspired them. If Netflix’s <em>One Piece</em> live-action series could become a talking point on <em>The View</em>, pulling normies like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePieceLiveAction/comments/16t4ric/actually_insane_whoopi_goldberg_gave_a_raving/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Whoopi Goldberg into Luffy’s warm light</a>, then why not let lesser-known titles like <em>Kakegurui </em>get their moment alongside shonen royalty? <em>Bet </em>was wildly fun, and if that fun gets more folks to check out the manga and anime, then let the cringe renaissance continue.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-demonschool-delay-silksong"><h3>Why Demonschool Got Delayed, Even Though It’s Nothing Like Silksong</h3></a><p>"It’s frustrating because we’ve really tried very hard to let people know that this game exists"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/long-story-short-bojack-netflix"><h3>Long Story Short Is A Lot, In A Good Way</h3></a><p>The new family drama from the creators of Bojack Horseman is funny, moving, and just the right amount of intense</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/vivi-is-screwing-up-magic-the-gathering-and-you-know-what-good-for-him"><h3>Vivi Is Screwing Up Magic: The Gathering, And You Know What?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>After a new <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a> update, players are discovering that developers Arrowhead have sneakily added a massive and nearly impossible-to-kill super worm, known as the Hive Lord, to the online sci-fi shooter. But one team has felled the beast, though it reportedly took nearly a dozen nukes.</p> <p>On September 2, PlayStation and Arrowhead pushed out a new, free <em>Helldivers</em> <em>2</em> update known as “Into The Unjust.” This big update, available now on PS5, Xbox, and PC, added intricate caves to explore, new missions to complete, and a little surprise. Well, more of a big surprise. <a href="https://youtu.be/yZ34QSm-nJw">The Hive Lord</a>, a bug the size of a skyscraper, is now an enemy you might encounter in <em>Helldivers 2.</em></p>  <p>While the Hive Lords appeared in the first <em>Helldivers</em>, they hadn’t yet shown up in the sequel. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdOs5duY6yI">Hive Lords were hinted at in the update’s trailer</a> and have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1bchk4b/for_those_new_among_us_these_statues_appear_to_be/">been teased</a> in-game since launch. But Arrowhead <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850?emclan=103582791473678397&amp;emgid=516345493302805199">didn’t officially list the new massive enemy in the game’s patch notes,</a> so some players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1n6q1x5/this_was_my_first_experience_with_a_hive_lord/">discovered the Hive Lords completely by chance</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1n6kx48/what_in_sweet_liberty_is_that/">were shocked by their scale.</a> These things are big. <em>Huge</em>. Easily the largest enemy in <em>Helldivers 2.</em> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1n6ocyv/pls_dont_nerf_hivelords/">And they are very hard to kill</a>.</p>

 <p>At first, players weren’t even sure Hive Lords <em>could</em> be killed, with some reporting the beasts had survived tactical nukes and many, many bullets. But players spotted that sometimes a bullet would penetrate the beast’s armor and that it did react to explosions. “If it bleeds, it can be killed” became a rallying call under some posts of Hive Lords laying waste to players and vehicles. Even still, some weren’t sure. Maybe it was too much for the forces of democracy to handle.</p>    <p>Eventually, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1n6m0vo/they_are_real_and_we_killed_one_raaaahhhh/">one squad of brave and dedicated Helldivers killed a Hive Lord,</a> likely becoming one of the first teams, if not the first team, to do so. According to one of the people involved with killing the massive sand worm, it took 10+ Hellbombs, 8+ 500KG bombs, and “a ton of Ultimatums and Spears/RRs.” According to IsJustSophie, one of the Hive Lord slayers, “I shat my pants when it burst out of the ground.” Seems like a totally fair and reasonable reaction to encountering a massive god worm.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate | Cinematic Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Lodi, it turns out, is a time traveler, kidnapped from his place in the distant past of the 1960s and flung through centuries as part of an unknown agenda. That makes him a different kind of character than Destiny 2 usually sees--his frame of reference is a lot closer to the people playing the game than the immortal Guardians who populate it. He's also much more of a "regular guy" than any of the characters the game has told stories about up to now, and that makes him something of an interesting anomaly in Destiny 2's world.</p><p dir="ltr">In The Edge of Fate, Lodi is portrayed by actor Brian Villalobos, a newcomer to the game. Since taking on the role, Villalobos has been immersing himself more in the Destiny 2 world, and has even taken to streaming the game on Twitch (his brother, Michael, is the well-known Dark Souls streamer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lobosjrgaming" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LobosJr</a>). GameSpot spoke with Villalobos via email about the experience of taking on the role of Lodi and finding the humanity in the character amid the space magic.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: I've seen that you're streaming Destiny 2--how familiar were you with the game and its story when you took on the role of Lodi? What was your process like for getting into the character and finding his place in the Destiny world, and how did your familiarity with the game play into that?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Brian Villalobos: </strong>I was <em>not </em>very familiar. So, I'm not necessarily a <em>gigantic</em> gamer--my younger brother's a big, big Dark Souls streamer and he got me into that whole beautiful nightmare for a while, and he'd played Destiny a bit, but I never had. I got the notice that I was cast just over a year ago, and I'd obviously heard of Destiny, and I knew it was a huge, long-standing franchise, and I have friends who've been playing it forever, but I really only knew it as a "space shooter." I thought you just loaded up with friends and went in and blew up robots and aliens or whatever. (Aside from that, I think I maybe knew Nathan Fillion was in it? Haha.)</p><p dir="ltr">What really, truly surprised me and blew me away once I started digging in was the profound depth and breadth of the storytelling, and of these characters and lore. There's a whole cosmology. There's like, space magic; space <em>religions</em>, kind of; cohabitating peoples and societies; a winding military history; Eldritch interdimensional meddling--it instantly felt as expansive and deep as something like Star Wars or Lord of the Rings. So, <em>that</em> part of it--which, as an actor preparing to try to somehow step into that world, was the first part I engaged with and was the first part I really fell in love with--I was not at all familiar with. Which, honestly, in a weird way, played right into the prep for Lodi: One of the very fortunate things about him--and I've been incredibly, incredibly fortunate in so many ways with this dude--is that he's this Timelost, Stranger In a Strange Land kind of guy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4560273-2025_apollo_launch_press_kit_npc_compressed_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560273" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4560273-2025_apollo_launch_press_kit_npc_compressed_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560273"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4560273-2025_apollo_launch_press_kit_npc_compressed_02.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">So, I prepped--I mean, I played the game, I mainlined lore videos and Destiny storylines and did background stuff and all that--but so much of him, <strong>a.)</strong> felt like it was so clearly and beautifully on the page, and <strong>b.)</strong> was rooted in this kind of thing where it's like, "Okay, welcome to Destiny, you're playing this astonishingly regular-ass-seeming guy who's kind of constantly overwhelmed and confused by everything, but very interested by this massive preexisting fantastical future-world that he's just been thrust into, and he kind of has no idea what's going on and is in over his head and really doesn't want to screw things up, but he's just doing his best." And I was like, "Yep. Okay. I can <em>fully</em> relate to that."</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Lodi has some pretty heavy stuff to contend with, as a guy who was abducted by aliens, sent to the future, and now is getting his brain messed with. There are a few moments where a lot of anguish comes through in your portrayal. Can you talk about the challenges of capturing that emotional range? How do you channel all that sort of unknowable weirdness to get to the humanity of such an out-there situation?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>BV</strong>: Man, it was just <em>so </em>much fun. So, so much fun. Honestly. There's a ton of massive-scale weirdness, but that's just what makes this role such a dream--it sucks I can't spoil, but there are things I got to do as Lodi that I literally never, ever, <em>ever</em> would have imagined I'd get to do as an actor. Ever. <em>Ever</em>. Haha. The stakes are huge, everything matters in a cosmic, existence-in-the-balance way, but also, he's just a guy. Dealing with all of it. And he's smart, and adaptable, and kind, and open, which are all wonderful, useful tools, but also, someone just flipped the sheets of reality and spacetime on him, and he's got to take it all in and survive and integrate without letting his face twitch and giving him away. But I think with anything, as an actor, what you have, always and obviously, is the writing, and the thoughts and emotions and experiences of the character. And, if you're lucky, the eyes of another actor, which, for the cinematic stuff, I was very, very lucky: We got to do performance capture in Stockholm with multiple teams of wonderful people, including two truly amazingly gifted actors, Allyson Kulavis and Richard Sloniker--who are Destiny legends and, aside from voicing characters in the game, have done the physical and facial performances of so many characters over the life of the series--who made my job so very much easier.</p><p dir="ltr">We started with [performance capture], which was fantastic, so I had Allyson and Richard as scene partners (and patient, expert PCap mentors, because I'd never done it) to help ground the performance. All I had to do was lose myself in what I imagined Lodi was thinking and feeling and look at their eyes and what they were experiencing, and I was there. And so then, when we did all the booth-recording sessions over the past year, I had that week in Sweden with the team and Allyson and Richard as a foundation, which was such a help, because you're just in a booth by yourself imagining things.</p><p dir="ltr">As for humanity: The humanity is in the writing. Really. The narrative team on Edge of Fate is incredible (and kind!), and they not only created what was, for me, an instantly relatable character; they were immensely supportive--they had a very clear direction in mind, and everything was very precisely scripted, but they also made me feel very, very free to bring my own natural cadences and pauses and vocal idiosyncrasies, and really my whole self and personality to Lodi.</p><p dir="ltr">Early on, I knew the scope of this story was huge--there are almost-incomprehensible cosmic elements, there's interstellar time travel and unknowable space-deities and space wizards and the end of existence, not to mention that it's Destiny, so there are 10-years-plus of incredible performances and storytelling and an incredible, passionate community and tradition and just a whole, whole lot available there that I could choose to pressure myself to live up to if I wanted to. But I'll give myself credit for one thing, which is that I pretty instinctively felt like looking at any of that in that way wasn't part of the job. The job is this guy, and what he's thinking and feeling. What he <em>says</em> isn't even my job. That's taken care of. Just be open, and trust, and don't put any judgment or anything extra on it, and <em>trust</em>, and take a step into the unknown. And trust. Kinda like the guy himself.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4560275-kepler_invitation_altar_of_relativity_with_ikora_01-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560275" data-ratio="0.56296296296296" data-width="1080" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4560275-kepler_invitation_altar_of_relativity_with_ikora_01-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560275"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4560275-kepler_invitation_altar_of_relativity_with_ikora_01-2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Lodi is a really interesting character within the scope of Destiny 2 also, because he's maybe the most fish-out-of-water anyone can be, and anyone </strong><em><strong>has</strong></em><strong> been, in Destiny 2--but he also has to be authoritative in some ways, guiding the player through the course of the story. So what was it like trying to balance those two aspects?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>BV</strong>: Again, it's kinda like the job itself. And in a way, kind of like any job an actor walks into. To paraphrase the brilliant and kind Alison Lührs, Bungie's narrative director, Lodi's a fish out of water, but he's also the most qualified fish from that particular pond. So, as an actor, you come with your own set of experience and skills and perspective, and you can feel some level of confidence and comfort in that, and in the fact that you're here, that the artists creating this story saw something in you that seemed to fit, in their estimation, so you must be somehow "right," in some way, for the job. (That, or the other guy wasn't available.) But so, you were chosen for this purpose. You're "qualified," say. But also, this job is different, and enormous, and strange, and there's a lot riding on it. So, what do you do? You do what Lodi does. He's like the S-Tier fake-it-'til-you-make-it guy. And don't we all kind of do that? Or, not fake it. Trust it. More positive. Trust-it-'til-you-bust-it.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What was the most interesting or compelling part of playing Lodi for you? What drew you to the role?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>BV</strong>: Well, everything, which isn't a good answer, but it's the honest one. Literally everything about this guy was interesting and compelling to me. We also share a somewhat uncanny amount of similarities on the page. We both love languages and people, we're both pacifists at heart, we both share a primary passion of communication and connection, we're both part Latino and speak Spanish but totally pass for a regular white dude, we're both peacemakers to a fault--I mean, it gets silly. I even loved ceviche before I went vegetarian. (I mean, I guess I still love it, technically.) We also kind of look alike.</p><p dir="ltr">One element of the character and story I will say I particularly enjoyed was that there was a fair amount of situational comedy that arose from being "guy from '60s cast into spacemagicfuture." There were some really, really fun beats to play with Lodi when he was getting fully discombobulated while trying to keep his cover and fit in with people who knows how many centuries past his frame of reference. He's like the ultimate, "How do you do, fellow kids?" guy, which, come to think of it, is another similarity we share. I kind of feel like I've been functionally 40 since I was 17. (Without, like, all the responsibility and knowing-about-stocks stuff.)</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4560276-2025_apollo_launch_press_kit_abilities_compressed_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560276" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4560276-2025_apollo_launch_press_kit_abilities_compressed_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560276"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4560276-2025_apollo_launch_press_kit_abilities_compressed_03.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Were there any particular movies or performances that inspired you in bringing Lodi to life? Any other inspirations?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>BV: </strong>I got Kyle McLachlan/Dale Cooper tossed at me lightly, which made me squeal <em>very</em> audibly in the booth, because I'm a massive Lynch and Twin Peaks fan. And there was maybe, I think, a little mention of The X-Files. But honestly, it might sound boring, my North Star, so to speak, was the writing and Lodi himself. There were some <em>very</em> interesting and fun references made while discussing how to approach Lodi's other--let's say "personalities," to avoid spoilers?--but I'm honestly not sure I'm at liberty to discuss those. Heh. Man. That's why this character rules. I really got to do so, so much with him that I never ever saw coming.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Are you aware of the theory that Lodi assassinated JFK? Follow up: Did Lodi assassinate JFK? Have you got a different theory? We're okay with headcanon for this one.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>BV</strong>: Sorry, hold on. I think I'm getting a call. I probably need to answer this.</p>

              <p>Backing up your files is something everyone should think about, especially if you don’t want to risk losing important stuff on your computer. Not everyone can or wants to pay for fast SSD drives, and that’s where classic external hard drives still shine.</p>
<p>Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3869/">Amazon is offering a fantastic discount on the Seagate Portable 4TB external hard drive – it’s dropped to just $99 from $125</a>. That’s about <strong>two cents a gigabyte</strong>&nbsp;which is just utterly fantastic if you need a lot of space without spending a fortune.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3869/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Speedy Transfers</h2>
<p>This drive’s got USB 3.0 which means it’s speedy enough to transfer big files without leaving you waiting forever. And it’s very low-maintenance as well, reads perfectly fine from PCs, Macs and even PlayStation and Xbox. And it doesn’t need a separate power supply since it gets its juice directly from the USB port.</p>
<p>Size-wise, the Seagate portable HDD is thin and light so it won’t be holding you back if you’re accidentally tossing it in your bag. It’s for everyday wear and tear use, so don’t fret about a little bump or two.</p>



<p>And with 4TB of storage, you’ve got plenty of room: We’re talking thousands of photos, stacks of high-definition videos, and hundreds of music files – all in a secure, easy-to-reach location. It’s a good alternative or supplement to <a href="https://gizmodo.com/best-cloud-storage">cloud storage services</a>, if you want your things close at hand or can’t always trust the internet for backups.</p>
<p>The additional sweet touch is the free one-year Rescue Data Recovery Service: That’s right, if anything does happen (like accidentally deleting files or a hardware failure), <strong>you’ve got experts standing by to assist in getting your data back</strong>.</p>
<p>Yes, SSDs are faster because they don’t have moving parts but they’re sometimes ridiculously pricey, especially if you require more than a few hundred gigs. That’s where hard drives like this Seagate shine through – they offer tons of space for far less money. If you’re looking for a high-capacity device that won’t break the bank, this deal is definitely worth considering.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-borderlands-4-collector%E2%80%99s-edition-come-with-the-game.1286970/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Borderlands 4 collector’s edition looks like something that many fans of the series might be interested in investing in.</p>



<p>However, purchasing games with various editions has become more complicated. Will it come with the game? How will the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">content included affect your overall experience</a>? Will the items included actually be worth your money?</p>



<p>You should always know what you are getting into when you purchase something, so here is the answer to whether or not the Borderlands 4 collector’s edition comes with the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-you-get-a-copy-of-borderlands-4-with-the-collector-s-edition">Do You Get a Copy of Borderlands 4 With the Collector’s Edition?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, no, the Borderlands 4 collector’s edition does not come with a copy of the game. While <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/randy-pitchford-borderlands-4-price-game-value/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford</a> has posted on X calling the bundle “pretty rad” and saying it would likely sell out, the answer to our question is answered in his tweet.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Collector’s Edition of Borderlands 4 available for Pre-Order at GameStop. It’s pretty rad and will probably sell out, so grab it if you’re into it:<a href="https://t.co/6eOZ9GYC4g">https://t.co/6eOZ9GYC4g</a></p>— Randy Pitchford (@DuvalMagic) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1934641019636818196?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The image for the bundle displays everything included with your purchase, but it is accompanied by big wording in the bottom right-hand corner saying the game is not included.</p>



<p>Why would Gearbox make a collector’s edition that doesn’t include the game? Like many other examples, it likely comes down to businesses trying to fool consumers into purchasing more. Not including the game does “technically” make the collector’s edition cheaper. However, if you’re buying the collector’s edition, you’re also likely to buy the game, so Gearbox and GameStop don’t have to advertise the purchase at over $200, but they would still be getting all of that money anyway.</p>



<h2 id="h-borderlands-4-collector-s-edition-explained">Borderlands 4 Collector’s Edition, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via GameStop</figcaption></figure>



<p>Otherwise known as the ECHO-4 bundle, this GameStop exclusive will set anyone purchasing it back $150 and comes included with the following items:</p>



<ul>
<li>8 in tall figure of ECHO-4 with LED lights</li>



<li>Cloth map of Kairos</li>



<li>Four double-sided art prints featuring the game’s vault hunters</li>



<li>Vault symbol necklace</li>



<li>SHiFT code card that rewards five golden keys upon redemption</li>
</ul>



<p>While the Borderlands 4 collector’s edition bundle comes with a pretty cool-looking figure that is definitely the main selling point, it seems that this all seems rather overpriced without the game. You are looking at a minimum of $220 to get the full experience here, and that’s if you don’t end up upgrading your standard copy of the game to the $100 deluxe edition or $130 super deluxe. Both of those come with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">various DLCs</a> not included in the ECHO-4 bundle.</p>



<p>We’re not here to tell you what to do with your money, but the Borderlands 4 collector’s edition doesn’t appear worth the money to us. The only in-game benefit you get from the bundle is the five key codes, and with that, you’re guaranteed to be spending over $200 on the game to benefit from weapons that will likely be replaced in your inventory soon. The other items included look like something you could easily find on eBay in a few months for a cheaper price.</p>

It will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/768524/hollow-knight-silksong-pricing-release-timing">cost $19.99</a> and include new zones, more than 200 enemies, over 40 bosses, and an orchestral score from the composer of the first game.</p><p><em>Silksong</em> was first announced <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/hollow-knight-silksong-revealed">in 2019</a>, two years after the release of <em>Hollow Knight</em>, but developers Team Cherry have stayed pretty quiet about the sequel in the years since — even after a planned launch window was announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/12/22175400/hollow-knight-silksong-sequel-xbox-game-pass-trailer">in 2022</a>, which was followed by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/9/23717855/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed">a delay</a> months later.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-gaming-mini-pc-with-ryzen-7-5825u-costs-5x-less-than-a-macbook-pro-amazon-clearing-final-stock-2000622450</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-gaming-mini-pc-with-ryzen-7-5825u-costs-5x-less-than-a-macbook-pro-amazon-clearing-final-stock.1286949/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Not all of us can buy a MacBook Pro or the new ASUS ROG gaming laptop. If your pocket is tight, there are surprisingly cheaper options that deliver just as much punch. One such option is the <strong>GMKtec M5 Plus</strong> gaming mini PC (Ryzen 7 5825U, 32GB RAM 1TB SSD), <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3868/">now available on Amazon at an unbeatable price of $319, originally priced at $400</a>. This is a great discount and with such a price, it’s an excellent opportunity to acquire a mini PC for both gaming and office use.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3868/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Gaming Mini PC</h2>
<p>The GMKtec M5 Plus comes with an AMD <strong>Ryzen 7 5825U processor which is a modern processor that offers 8 cores and 16 threads</strong>. The processor is 2.0GHz in base speed but is capable of turbo boosting up to 4.5GHz when energy mode settings are optimized. This is significantly more efficient than previous generations like Ryzen 7 5700U with about 35% more performance.</p>
<p>Within the memory division, the M5 Plus comes equipped with 32GB of DDR4 RAM that runs in dual channel which is a rich provision for a mini PC in this range. If you ever need to push it further, the system is expandable up to 64GB. With such a figure of RAM, you can go about office tasks, heavy browsing sessions, and gaming without feeling any delay. Storage won’t hinder you either, with a speedy 1TB PCIe 3.0 SSD.</p>



<p>Networking is also addressed quite nicely with dual NIC LAN ports providing 2.5Gbps Ethernet speeds. That is a big bonus if you need good internet to stream or play online games. The speed of Ethernet here is way more than usual gigabit connections, eliminating lag and buffering. With WiFi 6E thrown in, you’ve got solid, quick wireless that handles multiple devices easily and Bluetooth 5.2 keeps your headphones, mouse, and keyboard plugged.</p>
<p>Its graphics are processed by the on-board AMD Radeon Graphics 8-core processor with a speed of 2000 MHz. Its GPU is tuned for games at medium settings, video editing, and ultra-smooth playback of 4K material. Display-wise, three 4K monitors simultaneously can be supported using DisplayPort, HDMI, and USB-C ports.</p>
<p>You get a lineup with USB 3.2 and USB 2.0 ports, USB-C that delivers power and has display outputs, a DisplayPort, an HDMI 2.0, and a single headphone and microphone port.</p>
<p>At $319, it’s a good idea to grab the GMKtec M5 Plus if you want a powerful and budget-friendly PC that can handle work and gaming. If you’re looking for a mini PC that can handle your everyday demands without the Apple-level price tag, this deal definitely deserves a look. Just keep in mind this is a limited-time offer so don’t wait too long before it slips away.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-25000mah-power-bank-with-triple-100w-usb-c-ports-now-costs-peanuts-on-amazon-2000622406</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-25-000mah-power-bank-with-triple-100w-usb-c-ports-now-costs-peanuts-on-amazon.1286943/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon decided to spice up this Tuesday with some quick fire flash sales, and one of them is honestly hard to ignore. Portable chargers usually mean something small for your phone, but this deal is on a proper laptop-grade power bank from Anker.</p>
<p>It comes with a <strong>gigantic 25,000mAh capacity and three 100W USB-C ports</strong>. The kicker? It’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3864/">dropped to $94 from $135, which is an all-time low at Amazon</a>. Over <strong>60% of the stock is already gone</strong>, so if this interests you, you should probably get it while it’s available.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3864/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Airline-Approved</h2>
<p>Most power banks are fine for topping off your phone a time or twice but the second you throw a MacBook (or even a Switch) into the mix, they fold over pretty easily. That is why this model is so coveted: You get <strong>three USB-C ports and each of them can do up to 100W of power</strong>. That means: you can really charge a laptop while out without keeping an eye on the battery draining otherwise.</p>
<p>With <strong>25,000mAh available</strong>, you’re looking at multiple phone charges or good laptop support for hours. If you’re a travel bug, that means extended flights or train trips with no worry of the battery going below 5% when you need it the most. And since this monster is smart about replenishing itself, it doesn’t take forever to refuel. With its 100W input system, you can charge to 30% in 22 minutes. That’s long enough to throw it on the charger while brewing your morning coffee before a flight and be ready to roll. And yes,<strong> it’s airline-approved, under the 100Wh boundary</strong>, so safe in overhead bins.</p>



<p>Unlike most chunky power banks, <strong>this has two internal USB-C cables inside</strong>. One extends up to 2.3 feet but retracts neatly when not being used and the other is a shorter cable that doubles as a strap for carrying the unit around. Both are tested for durability so they won’t deteriorate from regular use. No more digging through your bag or praying you had remembered to grab the right cord. The cords are preattached, which is the kind of little win that makes life a tiny bit easier.</p>
<p>You can definitely have more than two or three devices: <strong>Four devices can be charged at the same time by this unit</strong>: the two inbuilt cables, the extra USB-C port, and one standard USB-A port. That would mean that you could be charging a MacBook, a phone, a pair of headphones and some other device at the same time.</p>
<p>Anker has already established a reputation that is conducive to faith in its chargers, and this one does not disappoint in any way: massive capacity, bidirectional fast charging, intelligent design, and the ability of actually keeping a laptop alive. For $94, it’s a take-and-go type of deal you’ll be sorry not to have woken up to. The only real catch?<strong> Stock isn’t going to hold out for long</strong>.</p>

<p>The original Backyard Football game is being re-released on Steam and mobile devices.</p>



<p>Playground Games announced on Tuesday that Backyard Football 99 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3170570/Backyard_Football_99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">will launch on Tuesday, September 9</a>. Like past re-releases of the original Backyard Sports titles, Backyard Football will include legendary NFL players such as Jerry Rice, Dan Marino, Randall Cunningham, Steve Young, Barry Sanders, John Elway, Drew Bledsoe, and more. In total, there will be 30 NFL legends to pick for your squad.</p>



<p>The game also features a Single Game mode and a 14-game season mode. There are even classic on-field power ups such as “Hocus Pocus”, “Leap Frog”, “Cough Drop”, and “Spring Loaded”.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The re-release of Backyard Football follows past launches of Backyard Baseball ’97, Backyard Baseball ’01, and Backyard Soccer. In addition to the aforementioned four games, Playground Productions and Mega Cat Studios are continuing with work on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/five-more-backyard-sports-classics-are-coming-to-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other classic Backyard Sports titles</a> like Backyard Basketball and Backyard Hockey. </p>



<p>In addition to the re-release of classic titles, Playground Productions is planning on releasing brand new Backyard Sports titles. When those will come, however, is currently unknown.</p>

The award-winning UK studio—known for working on titles such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Still Wakes the Deep</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dear Esther</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Everybody's Gone to the Rapture</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-chinese-room-is-independent-again-following-management-buyout">divested from Tencent-owned parent company Sumo Group in July</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in a bid to secure its future.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was a decision that resulted in the studio becoming a born-again indie and one that should enable it to continue creating original titles. The downside, as has so often been the case recently, came in the form of layoffs. It's unclear how many people were made redundant as a result of that management buyout (MBO), but some employees won't be around to witness the dawn of the new era.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How, though, did The Chinese Room arrive here around seven years after it was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-i-dear-esther-i-dev-the-chinese-room-acquired-by-sumo-digital">acquired by Sumo</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in a deal reportedly worth £2.2 million ($3 million)? And, perhaps even more importantly, where does the esteemed UK studio go from here? We sought answers to both of those questions and more at Gamescom 2025, where we sat down with studio director Ed Daly.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During a candid conversation, Daly suggests the writing was on the wall for The Chinese Room at Sumo Group towards the end. For instance, he explains the development team was happy with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Still Wakes the Deep</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which he says performed "pretty well" and managed to win over critics. Yet, despite those perceived wins, he claims Sumo wasn't necessarily happy with the returns being generated by original projects.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/evil-empire-tells-devs-to-avoid-early-access-unless-their-project-is-90-percent-complete" target="_self" data-discover="true">Evil Empire tells devs to avoid early access unless their project is 90 percent complete</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Given that, you can maybe see that at some point, Tencent or Sumo would decide 'we can't keep investing' [in original products]. I think Tencent would love to have a great new hit IP, but achieving that via Sumo maybe wasn't happening," says Daly.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Daly confirms The Chinese Room had planned to work on two more original projects that would have been funded by Sumo. Yet, when its parent company announced it would be </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sumo-group-ditching-original-franchises-to-focus-exclusively-on-co-development-work">focusing exclusively on work-for-hire projects</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the Brighton-based studio had to search for a future beyond the shadow of that corporate umbrella.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At that point, Daly explains The Chinese Room had two options: The first was to seek out another conglomerate that might be interested in acquiring the studio. The second was to pursue an MBO and become independent.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Daly didn't completely rule out the prospect of another acquisition at first, but says there was trepidation as to whether a prospective new owner would have allowed The Chinese Room to continue building original titles, or would instead position the company as a dedicated support studio.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Maybe [the acquisition option] would have worked, but the alternative opened up," he says. "We thought 'there's a business plan we can produce that means we can fund the company' and it became a no-brainer. There is something to be said for the so-called security that comes of being part of a larger business, but the moment it seemed that we could actually [complete the MBO] it became really compelling for the studio to give that a go. Like I said, we had these two projects that we were really excited about. They were in the pre-production stage and we were really determined to make sure we see these games through and get them made."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/frost-giant-ceo-tim-morten-says-layoffs-are-possible-after-stormgate-underperforms" target="_self" data-discover="true">Frost Giant CEO Tim Morten says layoffs are possible after Stormgate underperforms</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;There is no other business plan in town other than one in which we reduce our costs&quot;">"There is no other business plan in town other than one in which we reduce our costs"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Who, though, remains to wrangle those mystery titles into existence? Daly explains The Chinese Room currently comprises 55 employees and confirms the studio was "bigger" before the MBO. He explains it's difficult to discuss how many people were laid off because there is nuance involved. For instance, he notes that some people transferred to other divisions within Sumo before The Chinese Room bolted for the exit. So, while they're no longer with the studio, they are still employed.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even so, he says it was "disappointing to have to lose people" but claims there was no other way for the company to successfully execute a buyout. "There is no other business plan in town other than one in which we reduce our costs," he explains. "But it was good that some roles were offered to people at Sumo—for them to transfer to other studios—to reduce the impact of that."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/newsbrief-devcom-to-rebrand-as-gamescom-dev" target="_self" data-discover="true">Devcom to rebrand as Gamescom Dev</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With the dust beginning to settle, Daly is hoping The Chinese Room can use the MBO and the opportunity it presents to reset. The indie landscape—and wider game industry—has changed dramatically since the studio was last independent in 2018. The COVID-19 pandemic has been and subsided, bringing with it rampant investment that has since dried up after that particular bubble burst with aplomb. Now, in a world where companies big and small are struggling to secure financing and conglomerates seem intent on swallowing all in their path, Daly suggests the only way forward is to manage expectations with pinpoint precision.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Life is easier if budgets are large because you can take your time, play around, and make some mistakes. That approach no longer feels sustainable," he continues. "So, for our new games we're essentially funding them ourselves at the moment, but we will be looking for partners to help us with that at some point. Beyond that, and maybe it seems like this has always been the case to an extent, but we need to pick our battles, manage scope, and avoid spending too much too quickly before we're ready. I think everyone has become more cost-conscious, which I don't think is a bad thing."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Independence also brings more agility. Daly says having fewer stakeholders means The Chinese Room is able to make decisions more quickly, which can help save money. The studio is also committed to building on previous successes rather than starting from scratch each time it kickstarts a new project. For many companies that will be par for the course, but those are the marginal gains that could make the difference for an indie outfit attempting to bring original experiences to market.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The fact that studio bosses like Daly are now openly talking about the need to scope more efficiently and pragmatically is perhaps the most significant shift.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It feels like, three or four years ago, we were almost under pressure to talk up budgets for games to be taken seriously. So, sometimes we almost had the inverse problem where we had to figure out how to make a game that costs $10 million to $20 million," he continues. "At the moment, lots of people will be dealing with budgets in the low-single-millions to create double-A projects or whatever you want to call them. It's a big change."&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Chinese Room doesn't want to spend more than three years bringing a game to market">The Chinese Room doesn't want to spend more than three years bringing a game to market</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When asked whether those tightening pursestrings might actually do some good in the long run, Daly seems optimistic. "I think it has got be healthy if games are viable and make a profit and recoup their cost. It's not going to work if everybody's expectations are being dashed left, right, and center. That isn't sustainable," he adds.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You know, tools are better. It's becoming a little bit easier to build certain games. We're all-in with Unreal and that's helpful. I don't think it takes away from the creative opportunity to do something original and different even if budgets are half what they were three or four years ago, but we just need to make sure we're not being wasteful."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With that philosophy in mind, Daly explains The Chinese Room is keen to cap production cycles at around three years for the foreseeable future. There's also the question as to whether the studio can be more proactive in ensuring its titles have greater permanence.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Everything we've done in the past, we just built the game, shipped it, and then moved on. We're never going to make a live service game, but we're looking at how we can [ensure longevity]. There's early access. There's a model that's more DLC oriented—or kind of an episodic model. We're interested in how we can get the new game out there maybe at a smaller initial scope, because spending three, four, five years [making a game] is not super appealing at the moment."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Creatively, Daly explains The Chinese Room remains focused on building character-driven experiences that take place in deeply-researched, authentic worlds. "There'll certainly be an emphasis on narrative and world building," he says, before noting that both of the studio's original projects are currently in pre-production.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Notably, Daly emphasizes the studio wants its next original titles to be more "mechanically rich" than their predecessors and offer more scope in terms of player agency. Given Daly mentioned the ideal production timeframe for those projects is no more than three years, we ask where he wants The Chinese Room to be when 2028 rolls around.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think [the ideal scenario] is to have launched that next game and for it to demonstrate the way we've evolved our creative strategy," he says. "I think it would be great to know that everyone in the team also feels secure about the future and to be able to focus without the distraction of 'where is the next deal going to come from?' Over the past year or so there have been a few distractions around the business, and it'd be nice to not have those."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer attended Gamescom 2025 via the Gamescom Media Ambassador Program, which covered flights and accommodation.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

              <p>Gaming laptops do not come at bargain prices. If you’ve ever been walking around for one, you know that the instant you want to have powerful specifications, you’re facing a giant check. That’s why this Amazon sale is like a sweet surprise at the start of the school year. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3860/">2025 ASUS ROG Strix G16 ( has just dropped to $1,274, down from its $1,500 price point</a>, its all-time low.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3860/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fantastic Gaming Laptop</h2>
<p>This is a proper gaming machine, not a stripped-down entry-level model. At its heart, it’s powered by the new <strong>Intel Core i7-14650HX which is one of Intel’s latest 14th Gen laptop processors</strong> and built to handle demanding games. Pair that up with <strong>NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX 5060 Laptop GPU</strong>, based on the fresh <strong>Blackwell architecture</strong>, and you’re ready for modern titles with cutting-edge performance. It also supports DLSS 4, NVIDIA’s new AI-driven upscaling tech, so you can enjoy more frame rates from your favorite games without sacrificing visual quality.</p>
<p>Of course, however, power is just half the tale. You need speed and room for your stuff, and this box has both: It comes with <strong>16GB of DDR5 memory</strong> clocked at 5.6GHz, so running lots of different apps at once or streaming your games is silky-smooth. Storage is also generous: <strong>a 1TB PCIe Gen 4 SSD</strong> gives you speed and space. That’s space for a ton of current AAA games, plus your work, media, and files.</p>



<p>The screen on the ROG Strix G16 deserves some special mention as well: A <strong>16-inch FHD+ display with 16:10 aspect ratio and scorching 165Hz refresh rate</strong> ensures gaming is truly gratifying. That higher refresh rate doesn’t just help with competitive games: it’s also smoothes out scrolling websites, video watching, and even everyday motion. With a 3ms response time, ghosting and blur are reduced.</p>
<p>ASUS has also relied on its ROG Intelligent Cooling solution which involves a<strong> full vapor chamber layout, tri-fan technology, and liquid metal to help cool the CPU</strong>. Translation: you can push the hardware more aggressively without worrying about thermal throttling, and fans stay reasonably controlled compared to past versions. If you’re sweating out a marathon gaming session or exporting a video project, the machine has learned how to stay stable.</p>
<p>At $1,274, this deal really hits a sweet spot: You’re getting a brand-new 2025 model that combines powerful internals with thoughtful display features and cutting-edge cooling in a design that looks sharp. The biggest challenge may not be choosing it but catching it before Amazon runs out of stock!</p>

              <p>After a weekend of online speculation, conspiracies, and jokes about President Donald Trump’s current state of health, the controversial leader held a conference in the White House that was technically about <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-administration-news-09-02-25#cmf2wdo1d00053b6tx5yccrld">Space Command moving from Colorado to Alabama</a>, but served as a proof of life for many online. And when he appeared alive and mostly well, a lot of people were disappointed.</p> <p>Starting late last week, <a href="https://www.doomsdayscenario.co/p/it-s-time-to-have-a-serious-conversation-about-trump-s-health">rumors began to swirl online that something had happened to President Donald Trump</a>. Reports of music being played in the Rose Garden led some to speculate that it was covering up doctors shouting or the aging President crying out in pain. As the weekend continued, Trump seemed to spend most of the holiday inside the White House. When he did appear outside, photos showed a man who many claimed looked extremely tired, out of it, and sickly. It didn’t help that the White House and Trump shared a photo that claimed to be the President golfing over the weekend, but which was actually from earlier. <a href="https://x.com/adamscochran/status/1962233429770285093">A popular thread</a> spread on Twitter with all sorts of claims, including theories related to Trump keeping his mouth open more often and <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trumps-hand-bruise-health-updates.html">bruises seen on his hands</a>.</p>   <p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-administration-news-09-02-25#cmf2biaiq00003b6sjz4wbr6o">So when the White House announced on Monday</a> that Trump was going to make an announcement about…something, people were extremely curious to see the president. Was he dead? Was he alive? Was he being puppeted by VP JD Vance? Sadly for those wishing for the worst, Trump appeared mostly fine and as stable as you’d expect during his Tuesday conference.</p>

 <p>On YouTube and Twitch, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/papapishu.bsky.social/post/3lxurt3xo4k2z">the chat quickly turned hostile</a> and disappointed when Trump appeared and began speaking without any signs of a stroke or other medical issue. And on BlueSky and other social media platforms, people expressed their disappointment that Trump was still alive and kicking. Others pored over every frame of him talking during the event to see if they could spot any signs of something wrong.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Update on the white house stream, chat is disappointed <a href="https://t.co/Y95jgJANYX">pic.twitter.com/Y95jgJANYX</a></p> <p>— RAYMAGEDDON‼️ (@Raymagedd0n) <a href="https://twitter.com/Raymagedd0n/status/1962951241513713695?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>          <p>At one point during the conference, which was primarily about Trump moving Space Command’s HQ from Colorado to Alabama, Trump was asked by a reporter about the rumors of his death and medical emergency over the holiday weekend. This didn’t go over well with Trump, who first denied hearing about this, and then seemingly confirmed he had heard the rumors about his untimely demise.</p>   <p>“I also did a number of Truths,” he said, referring to his posts on social media network Truth Social. “Long Truths, and I think pretty poignant Truths,” said Trump. “No, I was very active over the weekend.” Trump also claimed the media, aka “Fake News,” incorrectly reported on his death or illness, adding: “[The media asked] Is he okay? How’s he feeling? What’s wrong?”</p> <p>Here’s the video of the full conference, which, as of 3:15 pm EST, was still dragging as Trump talked about many other topics, including school shootings, elections, and more.</p>

By many accounts, bosses take seconds to plow through, mining gold is seemingly unlimited, and overall the game is "too easy." But the phrasing is somewhat reductive, not just in relation to Bananza, but when discussing difficulty in games as a whole.</p><p dir="ltr">The stigma of "too easy" might indicate that a game is hand-holdy, not trusting players to act or think for themselves. Or, it's boring and monotonous, lacking in mechanical complexity and resulting in little satisfaction from overcoming obstacles.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Donkey Kong Bananza GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Loosely characterizing Donkey Kong Bananza in this manner misses the point of what makes the game so enjoyable to play. Bananza is a breeze for players because it's built on a framework that is versatile and complex yet accessible and intuitive. By giving you all the tools you need to succeed in Bananza's vast sandbox, Nintendo made a game that feels effortless to punch your way through. If you think the game is easy, then it's doing its job correctly--Nintendo wants it to feel easy.</p><p dir="ltr">Assuming that Donkey Kong Bananza isn't your first-ever video game, you're probably already well-versed and literate in gaming. With Bananza, Nintendo created a gaming "language" that players could pick up with little trouble. As you progress through the game, you learn how to string together basic control functions to execute creative movements. It's not unlike how Mario could use Cappy for platforming in Super Mario Odyssey, but DK has a lot more in his toolset.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4560185-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560185" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2880" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4560185-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560185"></a><figcaption>Donkey Kong Bananza</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4560185-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_07.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Donkey Kong Bananza is a game that requires creative solutions, and it prepares and trains the player well enough in this gameplay language so that these solutions come quickly. Often, Bananza has the answer to a problem right in front of the player, but the game doesn't give it away with a giant arrow (even though there are Fractones literally shaped like giant arrows that will direct you at critical story moments). Instead, the player must recall all of the challenges they've faced and the different contexts and cases in which they used the game's toolset to conjure up a solution.</p><p dir="ltr">Playing Bananza often reminded me of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (and its sequel) in that problems can have multiple solutions, some that feel unintentional. The knowledge of the game's physics and how different materials interact with each other is lodged in your brain, and both Bananza and Breath of the Wild give you space to play around and solve puzzles in the way you want to. The shrines in Zelda and challenge rooms in Bananza are the best examples of these, acting as quizzes on how much knowledge about the games' systems you have retained and how to use them in different scenarios.</p><p dir="ltr">The open-world Zelda games and Bananza offer so many abilities and moves that forging your own path toward a solution almost feels like cheating. Think of every time where it felt like Bananza wanted you to take a certain route for a Banandium Gem, only for you to smash your own shortcut to it; or times when you should have gone through a platforming section, only to bypass most of it by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-transformations-in-donkey-kong-bananza-and-how-to-unlock-them/2900-6727/" data-ref-id="2900-6727">gliding as an ostrich</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">That doesn't mean the game is broken--you're just smart enough to take that approach. And with the amount of testing that any video game goes through, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo undoubtedly knew that you could do that</a>, but Bananza is designed to make it feel like it was entirely your original idea.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4560186-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560186" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2880" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4560186-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560186"></a><figcaption>Donkey Kong Bananza</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4560186-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_04.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">All this said, arguing against the simple labeling of "too easy" isn't to excuse Donkey Kong Bananza for any flaws or to shield it from all criticism. The boss fights are unmemorable encounters that negatively impact the game's pacing, and the abundance of gold essentially breaks the game's economy. There are imbalances in Bananza that warrant discussion. But condemning the game as "too easy" distracts us from the triumph and empowerment that we should feel as players.</p><p dir="ltr">It's probably silly to compare Donkey Kong Bananza to Dark Souls or Elden Ring, games that some players might find to be "too hard." The Souls games from From Software and Hidetaka Miyazaki wear their difficulty on their sleeve. Even still, Nintendo and From Software have the same goal with their respective titles: making the player feel powerful.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170114122457/http://www.gameinformer.com/games/demons_souls/b/ps3/archive/2009/11/05/feature-demon-s-souls-director-discusses-difficulty-sequels-and-more.aspx" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Describing Demon's Souls back in 2009</a>, Miyazaki told Game Informer that making the game "difficult" was never the goal of the developers; instead, From Software wanted players to feel an "intense sense of accomplishment through forming strategies, overcoming obstacles, and discovering new things." The Souls games approach this very differently from Nintendo titles--Souls games are famously unforgiving--but what they have in common is that they both provide players with tools to feel that sense of accomplishment.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4560187-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560187" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2880" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4560187-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560187"></a><figcaption>Donkey Kong Bananza</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4560187-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_01.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While something like Dark Souls might obviously be less approachable and more complex than Donkey Kong Bananza, it is still very much a game designed to be completed. Video games should make you feel successful, powerful, and smart, and the way Nintendo designed Bananza does just that.</p><p dir="ltr">Plus, like most modern Nintendo platformers, anyone seeking a higher level of challenge in Bananza can look forward to the post-game content. If you haven't played any of the Bananza Rehearsal levels, be warned that they can be infuriating. If you feel that the base game is missing some tension, those levels might provide it--and accomplishing them feels pretty darn good, or at least relieving.</p><p dir="ltr">We'll probably never abandon the vocabulary of "easy" and "hard" to describe games. Those words are, well, too easy to use in discussions. Still, with everything these games accomplish in empowering players, we should be able to critically discuss what makes a game feel easy or hard, rather than dismissing the entire experience with a single adjective.</p><p dir="ltr">I understand why someone playing Donkey Kong Bananza might call it too easy--but not only should we give developers the credit for crafting an approachable experience, we should acknowledge that we're pretty good at playing video games.</p>

			<p>Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-02/-perfect-dark-developer-lays-off-staff-after-funding-deal-falls-through?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NjgzNDY3OSwiZXhwIjoxNzU3NDM5NDc5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMVoyQTRHUTdMRlEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.iGoAomXADlAaCsr4KgsTEy8oHTbv4k9XTSl7NVtRZXo&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a> that the Perfect Dark remake was nearly saved before a deal between Microsoft and Take-Two fell through, <a href="https://wccftech.com/crystal-dynamics-announces-layoffs-tomb-raider-unaffected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leading to the recent round of layoffs for developer Crystal Dynamics</a>.</p>



<p>Schreier's sources reveal that, following the cancellation of the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in early July alongside the closure of The Initiative, key people at The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics (which had been helping on the Perfect Dark project) tried to seek funding from another publisher. The most interested was Take-Two, which was looking to purchase the game rights from Microsoft. However, the agreement failed because the two companies could not find common ground on the IP's long-term ownership, which, therefore, remains with Microsoft. </p>



<p>This also means there's no chance of seeing this Perfect Dark project ever come to fruition. Originally announced at The Game Awards 2020, the project could not be developed by The Initiative alone. In September 2021, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/crystal-dynamics-being-available-for-perfect-dark-was-too-precious-of-a-resource-to-pass-on-says-xgs-head/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the studio would partner with Crystal Dynamics for this remake. The Tomb Raider studio already had extensive experience with reboots, after all, and the founder of The Initiative (Darrell Gallagher) had worked at Crystal Dynamics for over a decade, supposedly making the collaboration even easier. </p>



<p>After three years, fans finally got a glimpse at the game in a <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-first-gameplay-footage-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay trailer distributed during the Xbox Games Showcase 2024</a>. The footage was promising, showing a tactical first-person shooter game with influences from stealth games and even immersive sims. It was also supposed to have a parkour-like movement system and in-depth environmental interaction. The plot saw Joanna Dark trying to uncover a conspiracy spearheaded by megacorporations that had stepped in to save the world following major ecological crises, only to use their deployment of advanced technology as cover for their own agendas. The likeness of Joanna Dark herself was crafted using real-life model Elissa Bibaud, while her performance capture featured Alix Wilton Regan (credited in Dragon Age: Inquisition, Assassin's Creed Origins, Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, and The Elder Scrolls Online).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-xbox-showcase-gameplay-1851528864"><em>Perfect Dark</em></a> was one of the most anticipated blockbusters in the first-party Xbox portfolio when it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-reportedly-cancels-that-cool-looking-perfect-dark-1851785531">suddenly canceled</a> earlier this summer amid mass cuts at Microsoft. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-02/-perfect-dark-developer-lays-off-staff-after-funding-deal-falls-through?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NjgzNDY3OSwiZXhwIjoxNzU3NDM5NDc5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMVoyQTRHUTdMRlEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.iGoAomXADlAaCsr4KgsTEy8oHTbv4k9XTSl7NVtRZXo&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall"><em>Bloomberg</em> now reports</a> there was briefly an attempt to find the troubled game a new publisher so that it could still come out.</p> <p>Unfortunately, those talks apparently fell through, at least in part due to disagreements over IP rights. The idea was that Embracer-owned Crystal Dynamics, which was co-developing the stealth shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732">with now defunct Xbox studio The Initiative</a>, would complete the project under a new publishing deal with Take-Two. The two companies reportedly came “close” to a deal but one of the things that ultimately sunk talks was disagreement over who would own the <em>Perfect Dark</em> franchise, which currently belongs to Microsoft, over the long term.</p> <p>If <em>Perfect Dark</em> had been a success, the IP rights would have become way more valuable overnight with the potential for sequels or TV and movie adaptations. But for that to happen it would have had to come out. How much will the IP be worth with no new game in over 15 years?</p>

 <p>This deal falling through is seemingly why Crystal Dynamics announced new layoffs last week. “This decision was not made lightly,” the studio <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366524687985594369/">posted on LinkedIn</a>. “It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market.”</p> <p>Microsoft has found a way to give some of the casualties of its mass layoffs a second lease on life. <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> maker Tango Gameworks briefly shutdown in 2024 before <a href="https://kotaku.com/tango-gameworks-hi-fi-rush-revive-shutdown-krafton-xbox-1851619190">being resurrected</a> later that year under South Korean publisher Krafton. It’s a shame the tech giant couldn’t find a way to make that happen for <em>Perfect Dar</em>k, both for fans but most of all for the people who were working on it.</p>

<p>Here in the year 2025, it's not every day that a classic gaming console from the 20th century becomes playable via emulation for the first time. But that's just what happened last week with <a href="https://ares-emu.net/news/ares-v146-released?ref=readonlymemo.com">the release of Ares v146</a> and its first-of-its-kind <a href="https://techdocs.exodusemulator.com/Console/PioneerLaserActive/Software.html#emulation">support for Mega LD titles designed for the Pioneer LaserActive</a>.</p>
<p>Even retro console superfans would be forgiven for not knowing about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaserActive">LaserActive</a>, a pricey LaserDisc player released in 1994 alongside swappable hardware modules that could add support for Sega Genesis and NEC TurboGrafx-16 games and controllers. Using those add-ons, you could also play <a href="https://segaretro.org/List_of_LaserActive_games">a handful of games specifically designed for the LaserActive format</a>, which combined game data and graphics with up to 60 minutes of full-screen, standard-definition analog video per side.</p>
<p>Mega-LD games (as the Genesis-compatible LaserActive titles were called) were, for the most part, super-sized versions of the types of games you'd find on early CD-ROM console of the era. That means a lot of edutainment titles, branching dungeon crawlers, <em>Dragon's Lair</em>-style animated quick-time event challenges, and rail shooters that overlayed standard Genesis or TG-16 graphics on top of elaborate animated video backgrounds (sometimes complete with filmed actors).</p>

<p>The LaserActive's sky-high prices ($970 for the base unit; $600 for console add-on modules; $120 for LaserDisc games in '90s dollars) and lack of must-have software made it a relative curiosity even among the many game console curiosities of the mid-1990s, with total sales across Japan and the US <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150211202811/http://www.pinkgorillagames.com/console_histories">estimated around 10,000 units</a>. Yet the obscure console has <a href="https://www.pcenginefans.com/forum/index.php?topic=10096.0">still developed a small cult following</a> of <a href="https://laseractive.wordpress.com/">fans</a> who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfHxPjD7PAc">seem to revel</a> in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamecollecting/comments/8wyesp/got_a_pioneer_laseractive_clda100_laserdisc/">tracking down the hard-to-find hardware and software</a> to play some of the few '90s console games that couldn't be enjoyed via emulation.</p>
<h2>“I really don't think it would be very hard to do”</h2>
<p>The new emulator, which has finally made the LaserActive accessible to the masses, was a long-time passion project from a coder going by the handle Nemesis. The excellent Read Only Memo newsletter has <a href="https://www.readonlymemo.com/this-is-the-first-the-16-year-odyssey-of-time-money-wrong-turns-and-frustration-it-took-to-finally-emulate-the-pioneer-laseractive/?ref=read-only-memo-newsletter">an excellent interview with Nemesis</a>, who spent over 15 years working on and off to intimately understand the inner workings of the LaserActive and apply that knowledge to an emulator.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>A Sega fan and collector since his youth and an emulator hobbyist since the early '00s, Nemesis tracked down his first LaserActive unit for $200 in 2004. By 2009, he was <a href="https://gendev.spritesmind.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=563&amp;ref=readonlymemo.com">publicly musing</a> about what might be needed to finally get emulation support working for the short-lived system. "I really don't think it would be very hard to do," Nemesis wrote in a forum thread at the time, in what would end up being a hilariously large understatement.</p>
<p>While monitoring memory registers and reverse-engineering the actual system logic of the LaserActive was relatively straightforward, getting the necessary game and video data from the Mega-LD discs was a massive undertaking. Nemesis explained that the only way to get at the crucial "table of contents" data (needed to make sense of everything else on the Mega-LD disc) was "solder[ing] a bunch of physical tapping wires into my Sega PAC-S10 module, and us[ing] a Saleae logic analyzer clone to do a streaming capture of the data lines."</p>
<p>Then there was the problem of capturing the massive amounts of analog video on a LaserActive disc in a lossless format suitable for emulation. Commercial analog capture cards that worked for standard LaserDisc movies proved unequal to the task, since they usually ignored the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_blanking_interval?ref=readonlymemo.com">VBI control data</a> that was hidden beyond the borders of the 480i CRT displays of the time. The lossy capture cards also often had trouble correctly interpreting the multiple streams of overlapping video data that could be arranged in nonstandard ways on a LaserActive disc.</p>

<p>"Rarely is the [LaserActive] player just playing back a video normally," Nemesis explained to Read Only Memo. "Games will often have completely different video footage per field, with only one shown, or skip over every second frame, to mix four or more video streams in the same area of the disc. Many games use this for seamless 'branching' such as whether you go left or right, and this can change constantly and seamlessly during playback."</p>

    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>By 2016, Nemesis had resorted to building his own video capture setup, tapping directly into his LaserActive hardware to get the raw video signal out. But he couldn't decode that raw footage into a usable format until years later, when community work on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDlbwl3f39Q">the Domesday Duplicator project</a> and Nemesis' own work on <a href="https://github.com/happycube/ld-decode">the open source ld-decode software</a> finally allowed lossless versions of full, uncut Mega-LD video to be captured digitally for the first time (albeit in a format that requires upwards of 28GB per game).</p>
<p>Once those Mega-LD discs were finally ripped successfully, Nemesis said getting the actual emulation working was surprisingly&nbsp;pain-free. "<em>Space Berserker</em> was quickly running, and after that, as more games finished decoding most of them worked on the first try, with no issues," Nemesis said. "Since I'd set out to emulate the complete hardware, with all its quirks and unusual features, whatever a game tried to do, it should just work."</p>

      From "Space Adventure" to "Interactive Movie" to "Action Game," this LaserActive ad truly had it all.

<p>Some might scoff at all this effort to emulate what Wired's Chris Kohler called "quite possibly the most poorly conceived and spectacularly useless game console ever created" <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/09/laseractive/">back in 2009</a>. Still, for gaming preservationists, the new emulator provides a valuable opportunity to study these gaming curiosities without having to track down rare physical hardware and software that's prone to age-related wear or disposal.</p>
<p>And even casual retro gaming fans may get a kick out of <a href="https://techdocs.exodusemulator.com/Console/PioneerLaserActive/Software.html#emulation">digging through the Mega LD library</a> and imagining an alternate reality version of the '90s where LaserDiscs, rather than CD-ROMs, offered gamers a very different take on the full-motion-video fad of the day.</p>

                <p>It's the end of the road for two 2K Sports titles, at least for their online services. The publisher has announced that the servers for two aging golf games--The Golf Club 2019 featuring PGA Tour and PGA Tour 2K21--will go offline on October 30, 2025.</p><p>As of August 30, however, 2K Sports removed the ability to purchase any virtual currency for either game. Beyond that, however, the publisher said players "won't see any effect."</p><p>On October 30, 2K will close the servers for both titles, meaning each game's store, along with all online game modes and functionality--including progression rewards--will no longer be available.</p><p>2K Sports informed players of these changes in an email.</p><p>The publisher did not provide a reason for why the servers are going offline, but it's not uncommon for online servers for older games to close down over time. The games feature official PGA Tour licensed content, so expiring contracts could be a factor as well.</p><p>Released in 2018, The Golf Club 2019 featuring PGA Tour was the first game in the series to feature the PGA Tour branding. There was no entry in the series in 2019, but the franchise came back in 2020 as PGA Tour 2K21. PGA Tour 2K23 was released in 2022, followed by PGA Tour 2K25 in 2025.</p><p>PGA Tour 2K25 is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6281">No. 16 best-selling game for 2025 so far</a>. The series is developed by HB Studios, which Take-Two acquired in 2021.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

He acknowledged fan feedback for that content, such as the Onion Knight and Black Knight classes, but "cannot make any promises" about them coming eventually to The Ivalice Chronicles.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The remake will introduce a new difficulty option called Squire, which is aimed at helping newcomers to the spinoff series and genre. In addition, The Ivalice Chronicles does utilize the script from War of the Lions for the classic version included with the remake. As for a proper sequel to Final Fantasy Tactics, that will depend on the game's reception and sales.</p><p dir="ltr">"If [The Ivalice Chronicles] were to become a success, I do feel that that would then lead to discussions around potentially bringing out sequels, for example, or newer tactical RPGs," said Maehiro, who served as events planner for the original Final Fantasy Tactics in 1997. Earlier this year, the original's art director talked about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ff-tactics-original-art-director-wanted-to-make-it-under-one-unusual-condition/1100-6532552/">becoming obsessed with Final Fantasy Tactics running at 60fps</a> on PlayStation.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-tactics-remake-is-happening-trailer-and-release-date-announced-during-state-of-play/1100-6532075/">The Final Fantasy Tactics remake was announced</a> at the PlayStation State of Play event in June.

<p>Update: It's officially over</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Satoru Iwata Louvre" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9d7866e0533a4/satoru-iwata-louvre.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Update [<time datetime="2025-09-02T18:30:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Tue 2nd Sep 2025, 7:30pm</time>]:</strong> It's official - the Louvre has finally laid its Nintendo 3DS audio guides to rest.</p>
<p>Reported by <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/pixels/article/2025/09/02/louvre-says-game-over-to-its-nintendo-3ds-visitor-guide_6744946_13.html">French newspaper Le Monde</a>, the world-renowned museum ended the service on 1st September 2025. It originally announced it would be retiring the novel museum guides sometime in September.</p>
<p>It's an extremely novel concept, so it's a little sad to see it concluding, but it makes sense at this point — maybe Nintendo could get a Switch or Switch 2 audio guide running for the museum, hmm?</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/3ds/related-articles:36010,35977 @ 1756852224 --><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> The Louvre Museum in Paris, France is retiring the Nintendo 3DS audio guides for the museum later this year.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/louvre-museum-removing-nintendo-3ds-audio-guides/">Nintendo Everything</a>, the <a href="https://www.louvre.fr/en/visit/visitor-amenities">official website for the world-famous museum</a> confirms that the 3DS console audio guides are going "out of operation" sometime in September this year in place of a new system which hasn't been confirmed. A Nintendo Switch 2 app, perhaps...? Oh, come on, you thought it too.</p>
<p>The collaboration between the Louvre and Nintendo first dropped in 2012 — where you could "rent" a 3DS at the Louvre to use as an audio guide. Nintendo even held <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WavLP_3ew-A&amp;ab_channel=NintendoofAmerica">a dedicated Direct</a> on the collab in 2013 to announce a purchasable version of the software, so people could experience the Louvre from the comfort of their own home. We'll pop that Direct below, because seeing Satoru Iwata and Shigeru Miyamoto together gave us the warm fuzzies.</p>

<p>The software itself contained high-quality photos and 3D models of much of the museum's iconic artwork. Over 600 images, 30 hours of audio commentary, and more than 400 3D reconstructions of museum rooms are part of the software.</p>
<p>It was, and still is, an extremely unique collaboration, and we're a little bit sad to see it go. But it's been around for 13 years, so it makes sense. So, if you want to experience the Louvre in a truly unique way, then you've got until September 2025 to rent one of those special 3DS's.</p>

Officially, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696877/xbox-perfect-dark-everwild-cancelled-the-initiative-layoffs">the game was canceled</a>. But unofficially, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-02/-perfect-dark-developer-lays-off-staff-after-funding-deal-falls-through">reports <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Jason Schreier</a>, Microsoft gave <em>Perfect Dark</em>’s other set of developers — <em>Tomb Raider</em> studio Crystal Dynamics<em> — </em>a chance to revive the game.</p></div><p>Here’s where it gets potentially confusing: Microsoft doesn’t own Crystal Dynamics — that studio belongs to the Embracer Group, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/630234/embracer-group-aftermath-saber-matt-karch-stephen-totilo">has had</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24163110/embracer-laid-off-more-employees-than-riot-games-entire-workforce">many</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/28/24114402/embracer-selling-gearbox-borderlands-developer-take-two">troubles</a> of its own. So Embracer was trying to cut a deal with <em>yet another</em> publisher, the giant Take-Two, to buy, fund, and publish the game. But, Schreier reports:</p><div><blockquote><p>the talks collapsed at least in part because the companies involved were unable to come to terms over long-term ownership of the <em>Perfect Dark</em> franchise, said the people, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about sensitive negotiations.</p></blockquote></div><p>When that deal fell through, it reportedly led to the new round of layoffs at Crystal Dynamics <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-more-following-perfect-dark-cancelation">that <em>IGN</em> reported last week</a>, and Schreier writes that Crystal Dynamics has now “fully” abandoned the game.</p><p>Seems Microsoft didn’t want to give up the rights to <em>Perfect Dark</em>, which it presumably obtained when it bought Rare in 2002. (For the uninitiated, <em>Perfect Dark</em> was a spiritual successor to Rare’s hit <em>Goldeneye 007</em> on the Nintendo 64, a game that itself went many decades without a revival because of <a href="https://licensinginternational.org/news/mgm-and-eon-productions-partner-with-nintendo-and-microsoft-to-bring-iconic-goldeneye-007-video-game-to-a-new-generation-of-gamers/">a complicated licensing situation</a>.) That feels like a crummy reason for the game to stay canceled, but we don’t know the details.</p><div><p>Microsoft <em>was</em> able to broker a previous deal to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/12/24218424/hifi-rush-studio-tango-gameworks-saved-krafton-microsoft">save <em>Hi-Fi Rush </em>developer Tango Gameworks by selling it to <em>PUBG</em> giant Krafton</a>, but it was under a lot of pressure there. <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> had already been released, had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152137/xbox-hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-matt-booty">become a “break out hit” that won “prestige and awards”</a>, and gamers were pissed that Microsoft had rewarded its developers with layoffs.</p></div><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/769372/microsoft-perfect-dark-revival-take-two-deal#comments">7<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/769372/microsoft-perfect-dark-revival-take-two-deal]]></content:encoded>

<p>Perfect Dark could have been saved, according to a new report. </p>



<p>The reboot, done by Crystal Dynamics, The Initiative, and Xbox, was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-and-xbox-no-longer-working-crystal-dynamics/">cancelled earlier this July</a> out of the blue. Given the game’s well-received gameplay trailer and excitement, many were disappointed in the news. Plus, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-holds-layoffs/">last week’s layoffs</a>, it felt like a nail in the coffin for the classic shooter from Rare. Sadly, it does look like any chance of the game coming out has been silenced.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-02/-perfect-dark-developer-lays-off-staff-after-funding-deal-falls-through?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NjgzNDY3OSwiZXhwIjoxNzU3NDM5NDc5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMVoyQTRHUTdMRlEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.iGoAomXADlAaCsr4KgsTEy8oHTbv4k9XTSl7NVtRZXo&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a> from industry insider Jason Schreier for Bloomberg, Crystal Dynamics cut staff last week because they were unable to secure a deal with a new publisher for Perfect Dark. Embracer, which owns Crystal Dynamics, was reportedly close to striking a deal with Take-Two Interactive. If it went through, the publisher would’ve bought the game from Xbox and then seen the game to completion. Sadly, the talks ceased due to Perfect Dark’s ownership, though exact details were not disclosed.</p>



<p>Along with the cancellation of Perfect Dark, its studio, The Initiative, closed down. However, the report also states that leadership from the studio and Crystal Dynamics have been trying to get a publisher for the last two months. While negotiations did happen with a few, Take-Two was the farthest along.</p>



<p>While chances for Perfect Dark to return are seemingly unlikely, it could see the light of day. Tango Gameworks, which Xbox shut down after the success of Hi-Fi Rush, was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tango-gameworks-acquired-by-pubg-publisher-krafton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bought by Krafton</a> and can work on their IPs again. Whether The Initiative meets that same fate is unknown, but it all depends on the IP of Perfect Dark and if the rights can be purchased.</p>



<p>Are you disappointed to see Perfect Dark cancelled and, likely, never coming back? Let us know in the comments and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the forums</a>!</p>
