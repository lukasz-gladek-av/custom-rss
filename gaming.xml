                <p>In early 2023, Wizards of the Coast canceled at least <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dd-publisher-wizards-of-the-coast-cancels-at-least-five-video-games/1100-6510284/" data-ref-id="1100-6510284">five video games that were in development</a>, including an unfinished Dungeons &amp; Dragons open-world action RPG by Hidden Path Entertainment. Now, nearly eight minutes of footage from that game have been leaked online, and while the title was far from finished, it shows real promise.</p><p>The footage originated from one of the music supervisors of the game (via <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/look-into-dungeons-dragons-cancelled-open-world-rpg-project-dante-gameplay-concept-art" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>), which was known internally as Project Dante. Given the source of the video, it shouldn't be surprising that it puts a spotlight on some of the game's music. The video notes that the score was composed to seamlessly flow from the open-world theme to more specific tracks, including an ethereal theme for a temple and more forbidding notes as the heroes approached a Troll cave. A band of bards even performs an entire song while the main characters listen.</p><p>Project Dante's world looks enticing even in this early state, but the combat was clearly a work-in-progress at the time that this footage was made. There's enough here to see that this game had real potential, but it's never going to officially see the light of day. Some Project Dante's concept art has also been shared on <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ZCdr9WI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Imgur</a> as another glimpse of what could have been.</p><p>Earlier this year, Wizards of the Coast announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wizards-of-the-coast-giant-skull-announce-new-single-player-dd-game/1100-6531973/" data-ref-id="1100-6531973">a new single-player D&amp;D game</a> in development by Giant Skull, a studio founded by Respawn veteran Stig Asmussen. The classic Dungeons &amp; Dragons game Neverwinter Nights 2 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dd-neverwinter-nights-2-enhanced-edition-coming-this-summer/1100-6532271/" data-ref-id="1100-6532271">is getting an Enhanced Edition</a> later this summer. Wizards of the Coast has also confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-magic-the-gathering-and-dungeons-dragons-video-games-are-on-the-way/1100-6527911/" data-ref-id="1100-6527911">more Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons &amp; Dragons video games</a> are in development.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-terraria-update-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pocketpair has revealed when we can expect the&nbsp;<em>Palworld Terraria&nbsp;</em>crossover to land, and we're just a few days away from the creature-collecting survival game's first ever collaboration.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer, you can expect&nbsp;the appropriately-named "Tides of Terraria" update to arrive on June 25th, and it sounds like you can look forward to a new dungeon to explore, new enemies to fight, and perhaps even some sweet gear to net yourself.</p>

<p>According to Pocketpair, the <i>Terraria&nbsp;</i>bosses Eye of Cthulhu and Moon Lord will both be appearing in the crossover as well, so if you haven't had your fill of fighting those enemies in&nbsp;<em>Terraria</em>, you're in luck.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-terraria-update-release-date-shock.jpg?itok=oYBA9FKt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-terraria-update-release-date-shock.jpg?itok=Va1ltcsk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Palworld</em>'s upcoming&nbsp;<em>Terraria&nbsp;</em>update lands next week.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Palworld Terraria&nbsp;</em>crossover was first announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-terraria-crossover-2025" rel="nofollow">all the way back in November</a>, so Pocketpair and&nbsp;<em>Terraria&nbsp;</em>studio Re-Logic have been cooking this one up for quite some time.</p>

<p>It'll serve as&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s first crossover, but it likely won't be the game's last; in the&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>roadmap <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-roadmap-january-2025" rel="nofollow">released in January</a>, Pocketpair teased "game collaborations (including&nbsp;<em>Terraria</em>)", which would indicate that more crossovers are on the way later down the line.</p>

<p>For now, though, you'll have to content yourself with this one, as well as all the other stuff&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>has going on. Back in March, for instance, Pocketpair released an update for the game that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-crossplay-update-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">introduced crossplay</a>, allowing you to team up with your friends to take on challenges and raise Pals (or exploit them, if such is your wont).</p>

<p>It's not all fun and games, though. In May, it was revealed that some of&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mechanics-changing-nintendo-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">mechanics have changed</a> because of an ongoing lawsuit brought against the game and its developer by Nintendo. As you've probably guessed, the lawsuit alleges legally spurious similarities between&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>franchise.</p>




<p>In any case, the&nbsp;<em>Palworld Terraria&nbsp;</em>collaboration launches on June 26th. You can check the former out right now (albeit in Early Access) on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/palworld/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9nkv34xdw014" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.</p>

		<p><em>Most of Remap, aka everyone not named Janet, is a little on the older side. We have to pick our battles when it comes to games we play, especially games we finish. I mean, who could possibly finish Despelote? </em></p><p><em>But in all seriousness, even when our jobs demand us to play games in unorthodox and rushed ways, the reality is that if our jobs were to disappear overnight, we'd probably still have many of the same struggles.</em></p><p><em>Patrick decided to return to a spring favorite, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and found the experience to be a combination of frustration, excitement, and clarity. Plus, he asks Rob if he's broken any bones. </em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> A few times over this past year, Rob, I’ve noticed myself spending 10-15 hours with a video game, yapping on the podcast about the great time I’m having, and then moving onto the next one. While it’s true that our jobs require and reward spending a little time with a game instead of a lot, it’s not as though I don’t have any free time to spend as I please. I could have kept playing <em>Avowed</em> if I wanted, I could have found time for more <em>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Those are both games that I would have said, in reductive terms, I’m enjoying 8/10. That’s enough to spend more time, to see what else might be hiding in the world. To have enough conversation for a podcast requires far less than 15 hours, yet I put that and more into both.</p><p>It would be say I’ll find time for them again later this year, but in reality, I probably won’t.</p><p>The game I refuse to let this happen to, however, is <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>. I dropped 20 hours into that one by the time I allowed its grip on me to release, freeing me to try games like <em>Deliver at all Costs </em>and <em>Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</em>, but <em>Clair Obscur </em>was different. <em>Clair Obscur</em> was not an 8/10 that I could see myself spending more time with, it was 10/10. <em>Special</em>.</p><p>A few nights back, I booted up <em>Deliver at All Costs</em>, which—look, brief tangent. You cannot predict where the story goes in that game. It has so much story. It has so much story! At a certain point, it seems to forget that its core appeal is being a fun physics-driven driving game! It leaves all that behind to tell, of all things, a sci-fi story! Even though I’ve spoiled that bit for you, there is no chance you have any idea where that story tries to go before the credits begin to roll!</p><p>Anyway, I’m not sure if I’m endorsing that people play that game. But I’m glad I did.</p><p>The point is that credits rolled way faster than I was expecting, leaving me with an hour to play something else. We’d just recorded the podcast, so it was a moment to indulge my own whims, so why not return to <em>Clair Obscur</em>? Well, because that means returning to a video game with some pretty damn intricate systems while being more than a month removed from using them.</p><p>When I shattered my collarbone, I entered physical therapy a few months later. The therapist asked me to lie down and try to lift some small weights. They warned that lifting weights with my previously injured arm would be difficult—but it’s normal. 20lb weight? Couldn’t move it. 10lb weight? Couldn’t budge it. 5lb weight? Buddy, I’m staring at this thing trying to use the Force and nothing’s happening. My atrophy was bad but, again, still normal. It took months of hard, annoying work to get things back into shape. You know, much like grinding one does in a JRPG.</p><p>I knew I wanted to love <em>Clair Obscur </em>again, but it also meant putting in <em>work</em> to love <em>Clair Obscur</em> again. Where was I at in the story? What style of play was I leaning into with this character? Rather than worry about all that, I just started playing. I barely knew what I was doing, but in time, memory matched reality. I haven’t found the enthusiasm to dip into the most annoying parts of that game, aka the equipping and unequipping of skills, but I’ll get there.</p><p>The nice part is knowing it’ll be worth it. Janet’s finished the game and is ready to scream about it from the top of a mountain. Our tastes are basically aligned, which helps give me the motivation, much like a physical therapist, to put in the time and <em>work</em> to get back into things.</p><p>Still, it’s weird to view this as “work.” How have you handled similar situations?</p><p>P.S. My five-year-old broke her arm last week. Have you broken anything before?&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@harlsta?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Harlie Raethel</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>Broken anything? No. But I tore my ACL playing football in high school. We were doing a tackle drill, third practice of the day, everyone was tired. I was sluggish and didn’t get as low as I should have to absorb the hit, the guy tackling me didn’t really use any form he just kind of hurled himself at my shoulders. If I hadn’t been wearing such nice new cleats I might have been fine, but my lower left leg stayed planted while the rest of me arced down to the left from my waist. The pain was instant and unlike anything I’d experienced before. For a beat, I couldn’t see. Was literally blinded for a long second or two, probably just from complete sensory overload.</p><p>It was a stupid way to get hurt, though there are times I also wonder how many programs are still doing full contact practices for six or seven hours a day. I was in the absolute best shape of my life at that moment, the guy who hit me was also in terrific shape. We were just tired because it was the final twenty minutes of our third practice of the day.</p>

Yesterday, when having coffee with a friend, I opened the app to try to remember what it was that the director of the extraordinary sci-fi film <em>Primer</em> had done that meant he wouldn’t be working again. (Accrued repeated accusations of domestic violence, if you’re wondering.) But before I could, I was asked by Wikipedia if I would like to play a game. Um, sure! So my chum and I were entirely sidetracked into playing <em>Which Came First</em>, an incredibly simple concept in which the app gives two short descriptions of historical events, plus sometimes a small picture clue, and asks you which happened first. That’s it. It’s great!</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Which came first?</p><p>Deputies of the French Third Estate take the Tennis Court Oath.</p><p>The U.S. vessel SS Savannah arrives at Liverpool, United Kingdom. It is the first steam-propelled vessel to cross the Atlantic, although most of the journey is made under sail.</p></blockquote><p>That’s the first question of today’s edition. I haven’t the faintest idea! I didn’t have a clue about any of the five questions yesterday, either. My historical knowledge is, without question, <em>atrocious</em>. Thankfully, Paul’s a far more rounded, smarter man than me, and was able to make educated or even informed guesses, and “we” got four out of five! Woo!</p><p>OK, so obviously this isn’t the most groundbreaking of puzzle ideas. But actually, it’s a perfect addition to Wikipedia, because it’s entirely about <em>finding out something new</em>. I may be sitting here wondering literally which century we’re in with that above question, but I’m also dying to know more about the “Tennis Court Oath” now! It’s also wild to realize that the United States Congress adopted the Great Seal around the same era King Louis XVI was trying to flee the French Revolution. I mean, you may say “Duh,” and deeply worry about the standard of British education in the ‘80s and ‘90s, and you’d likely be right to. If my dad were alive to hear my ignorance, he’d be immediately dead again. But, and this is a lifelong philosophy of mine, you never mock someone for not knowing something if they’re willing to learn it <em>now</em>.</p><p>And, with respect to that, Wikipedia’s little game offers direct routes toward some knowledge. At the end of the five questions you’re given your score and streak as you’d expect, but also a nicely presented list of all the articles relevant to the questions you were asked, and indeed dictionary definitions for specific words and terms. Today’s has an excellent 34 boxes to click on for more information, as general as “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Holocaust</a></span>” and as specific as “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazimierz_Piechowski&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazimierz_Piechowski" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kazimierz Piechowski</a></span>.” And indeed, I’m pleased to say, a tile for the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_Court_Oath&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_Court_Oath" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tennis Court Oath</a></span>.</p><figure id="" data-id="9c1c63a6866d55e076cf9eae7f043b31" data-recommend-id="image://9c1c63a6866d55e076cf9eae7f043b31" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The results page for today's game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The results page for today's game." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wikimedia Foundation / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9c1c63a6866d55e076cf9eae7f043b31" data-recommend-id="image://9c1c63a6866d55e076cf9eae7f043b31" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The results page for today's game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When trying to find out more information about Wikipedia’s game, not least whether I’m embarrassingly late to discovering it or one of the first to be offered it, I find there’s the weirdest lack of information out there.

(I have, of course, reached out to Wikipedia to ask all about it.) However, I <em>have</em> discovered that it began on May 20, 2025, because that’s how far back the archive of daily games goes. So a month today! Hopefully you can now find it yourself by opening the updated version of the Wikipedia app on your phone. And hopefully it’ll catch on and become a whole section within the app.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Following a recent wave of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/">Borderlands 4</a> previews, Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford has confirmed that one fan-requested feature will be in the game when it launches in September. While a mini-map won't be in the looter-shooter, a radar will, making situational awareness of a battlefield much easier.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1935803698976022970" rel="nofollow ">In a lengthy thread</a>, Pitchford spoke about how fans had been asking Gearbox to add this feature to the game--many people from the European, US, and Asian preview tours were advocating for it, Pitchford said--and the studio managed to make this happen.</p><p>"As me and head of dev, Steve Jones--and some of the other guys--were poking around with producers trying to figure out what it would take to add these features and if we could make it in time to ship or not, something awesome happened," Pitchford explained. "In classic Gearbox style, where we have an ethos of 'they who builds it, wins,' some developers got together and found some time in the margins of their schedules. Some Gearbox heroes did what Gearbox heroes do!"</p><p>Several Gearbox employees "splintered off" to work on the radar, and Pitchford says they managed to squeeze it into the game before it undergoes some QA testing ahead of its launch. The radar will be off by default when the game launches, and it won't be in the current build of Borderlands 4 on the Borderlands Fan Fest showfloor this weekend. Here's what it looks like in action:</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-adds-long-requested-features-like-mission-replay-and-a-seamless-world/1100-6532503/">Borderlands 4 will also have a few other fan-requested features when it launches</a>, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-is-happy-the-game-is-not-80-and-has-no-paid-early-access/1100-6532526/">base version of the game has an MSRP of $70</a>. "This feels like a Borderlands game through and through where enough has changed for me to feel like this is an improvement over Borderlands 3, but it's not so different that I can expect huge and sweeping changes," Jordan Ramée said in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-continues-the-trend-of-making-sirens-the-most-fun-to-play/1100-6532501/">Borderlands 4 preview</a>.</p><p>Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, with a Switch 2 version arriving at a later date.</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-expanse-osiris-reborn-is-owlcats-first-stab-at-third-person-action-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> of The Expanse: Osiris Reborn was undoubtedly one of my personal highlights of this year's Summer Game Fest season.</p>
<p>The Expanse is one of my favorite sci-fi settings, and I've devoured all the books and the seasons of the great TV series adaptation on Prime Video. A couple of years ago, Telltale <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-expanse-a-telltale-series-gets-nearly-10-minutes-of-gameplay-with-developer-commentary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a game based on the show, but its genre and its scope weren't exactly thrilling.</p>
<p>This project, on the other hand, is a third-person shooter RPG inspired by the likes of Mass Effect, powered by Unreal Engine 5, and developed by Owlcat Games, one of the best cRPG studios of the last few years between the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous-depth-beyond-all-measure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pathfinder titles</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-charting-a-new-course/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader</a>.</p>
<p>It's a combo that got me, and a lot of RPG and/or The Expanse fans, very, very excited. Moreover, even though it will feature its own characters and stories, it looks much more closely linked to the main narrative of the series. So, as soon as I got the chance, I reached out to Owlcat Games to set up an interview and bombard them with as many questions as they would answer at this time. Check out the full transcript of my conversation with Creative Director Alexander Mishulin and Head of Publishing Andrey Tsvetkov below.</p>
<p>The Expanse: Osiris Reborn will be released for PC and consoles at an unspecified time. Pre-orders are already available <a href="https://osirisreborn.owlcat.games/#editions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">through the official website</a>.</p>

<p><strong> When did you decide to make this game, and how did you contact the license holder?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishulin:</strong> With all our projects, it's quite a similar story because, internally, we had a group of friends who came out with an internal pitch for the game. We discussed it. We loved it. We talked a lot about how we could make this game, how it could be different and interesting.</p>
<p>The Expanse IP is a very good match for us because of the stories we would like to tell. It's grounded, with many choices and consequences, and all about people and companions. The Expense is all about how humanity, while being more advanced in 300 years from now, is still very much human with all its genius traits, flaws and everything. When we had an internal pitch that we loved and we understood that we could make it happen, we started working out the business side of the details. We approached Alcon with our idea and they were as excited as we were, so the project began and we started to work on pre-production.</p>
<p><strong>Okay. Is the game still in pre-production, or have you moved to production?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishulin: </strong>The development started in 2021. We spent almost a year doing prototypes, transitioning between the genres because the game we are making is not quite similar to the games we have done previously. So we established new processes, established new approaches, and made sure that everything is working well, the shooting parts are working well, and of course, established all the new processes to make content. After that, we started making our vertical slices, and now we are full in production.</p>
<p><strong>As you mentioned, The Expanse: Osiris Reborn is a big change for you because you have been making cRPGs, a very different genre. Honestly, I thought that maybe the next step for you would be to make a cRPG still, but with a higher budget, like Baldur's Gate 3 for example, or perhaps Baldur's Gate 4, rather. But no, seriously, it was surprising to see you go with this. I also love Mass Effect, so I'm totally in. But I am curious - did you just go directly for the third person shooter pitch, or did you at some point consider making it a cRPG?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishuli </strong>No. From the first pitch, it was all about making a third person game because The Expanse is about people. We want you to connect more with the characters, the protagonist and the companions, and we want you to be immersed in this very grounded, realistic, sci-fi world.</p>
<p>We wanted to show you that, and for that, we needed to change perspective and make things more realistic and cinematic. Because of that, we transitioned to the third person, and yes, we were a little bit afraid at the beginning. We started prototyping and made several combat and exploration arenas.</p>
<p>We experimented with different approaches, how we wanted our cover system to work, how we wanted our enemies to work. Just for combat arenas, we had six prototypes in the beginning just to make the combat basics feel right. But for the narrative part, it's very much still the same Owlcat game with all the different options for you to choose when you're playing new characters, to embrace them, to feel the consequences of those choices, with all the politics and web of intrigue happening in The Expanse universe. It's very much the same approach to narrative we had in previous games, apart from the dialogue being more cinematic, more in line with the genre.</p>
<p><strong>You also changed the engine, since you are using the Unreal Engine 5 this time. Was it harder or easier than you thought?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishulin: </strong>Yeah, it was part of the process when we were in pre-production. We had to establish different processes. It's not difficult or something very special or an unusual transition; it's just a new process to make a new game. Also, we expanded our team for this project. We welcomed new team members from companies that have already done similar games, especially from CD Projekt, so we built not only upon our own expertise and knowledge but also upon our new colleagues' knowledge, which helped us quite a lot.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We have more than 450 people within the studio. We can totally ensure our fans that working on several projects simultaneously wouldn't impact the quality of each of them. There won't be a situation where The Expanse: Osiris Reborn damages Dark Heresy in any way or vice versa.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Can you share how much of the team is working on The Expanse: Osiris Reborn? I know you have a lot going on. There's a new Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader DLC on the way, and there's the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-dark-heresy-is-owlcats-next-inquisition-themed-crpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy</a> game in development. Can you say how much of the team is working on this one?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrey Tsvetkov:</strong> I can briefly jump in here. Sure, we have several projects going on, and right now, we have more than 450 people within the studio. We are very fortunate to have grown to this point with the support of our players. I don't think we'd like to share the exact number of the actual teams just because it's not fixed, right? At specific points of the developer process, some developers join the team to help at a specific moment just because of more tasks within production and everything. And then, when it's needed, some people move forward to other projects as well.</p>
<p>But I can say that we can totally ensure our fans that working on several projects simultaneously wouldn't impact the quality of each of them. There won't be a situation where The Expanse: Osiris Reborn damages Dark Heresy in any way or vice versa. We would never jump into this kind of situation if we had the feeling that one of our beloved projects would actually get hurt in this way and fail to deliver the experience we want to our fans.</p>
<p><strong>Can you tell us which of the two new games is launching first?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrey Tsvetkov:</strong> Not at this point, I'm afraid.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We want our game to be very realistic, cinematic, and approachable. Usually, those are hallmarks of AAA experiences. That said, we are not making it specifically to be AAA. We are making it in such a way that we imagine a great immersive The Expanse experience.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Okay, fair enough. Sticking with The Expanse, do you consider it to be a triple-A game in your ambition and scope?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishulin: </strong>In terms of production and approaches, we want our game to be very realistic, cinematic, and approachable. Usually, those are hallmarks of AAA experiences. That said, we are not making it specifically to be AAA.</p>
<p>We are making it in such a way that we imagine a great immersive The Expanse experience, allowing all the players, be them fans of deep narrative games with choice and consequences or fans of action RPGs or just fans of The Expanse to join in, experience the game, and feel very much at home within the game. As much as The Expanse allows you to feel at home, because it's not really a very cozy universe, but still, this is our approach for this game.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of the timeline, when does this game start in the narrative we know?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishulin: </strong>The game is happening between the first and the second book, or, if we are talking about the show's seasons, from the first season to the second season and a half. We are telling our own story happening in the universe. When we approached Alcon and talked about the project, they told us that they wanted to expand the universe, to tell more stories, and our vision was the same. We are telling a new story that is happening simultaneously with all the events of the books and the show.</p>
<p>So, you'll be feeling the repercussions of the destruction of the Canterbury and the events on Eros. You will see some of the events with your own eyes, but for most of the adventure, you will understand how this universe, how the whole solar system responds to what's happening, and to the adventures of Holden and his team.</p>
<p><strong>I think you teased that some characters may appear in some form, right? I guess it's too early to share who those might be, though.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrey Tsvetkov: </strong>We would really love to share it. It's tempting, but we won't be doing that now. Unfortunately, it's too early for us to speak about it. But yeah, we'll certainly uncover this at some point in the future.</p>
<p><strong>You've said that players will create their own character. Character, right? Usually, in most RPGs, making the character also means choosing between different races, each with its own attributes and abilities. Of course, in The Expanse, they're all humans, except for minor differences, like Belters having a body that cannot bear the full weight of Earth's gravity due to generations of living in space. But, in RPG terms, will there be any differences in the game depending on your choice of Earther, Martian, or Belter?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishulin: </strong>When you start the game and create the character, you select your origin, and that is a huge choice, not only in terms of RPG elements but also in terms of storyline. It's your origin story, how you came to be, and many choices and consequences in the game will react to you being from a certain faction. For example, when you visit Ceres after all the events surrounding the Canterbury, the Belt is agitated towards Earthers and Martians. So, if you are not a Belter, you will encounter some forms of aggression towards you. If you are playing with a Belter character, you will feel more at home.</p>
<p>Additionally, some of the choices and some of the options available to you will be different. The same goes for all the origins. They all have different choices and parts of unique content that they will access as the start of their story. And then when the story takes shape, you'll start to forge your own path, dabble in politics, and probably choose some other faction you want to support, not necessarily your own. Maybe I'm playing a Martian, but I feel that I want to help the Belters, and I want to become friends with this faction, so I build a relationship with them in such a way that I'm supporting their cause and their reaction towards me will slowly change to reflect that.</p>
<p><strong>In the original narrative, Holden and his crew eventually earn the favor of most of the factions. However, sometimes RPGs have mechanics where you must choose between factions and befriending one automatically makes another hostile. What's your approach here? Can you be a very diplomatic character in good standing with several factions at once?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishulin: </strong>I will not answer directly because, first of all, this system and this narrative part are still very much in development. But our vision is that we want you to experience all the political powers and the power plays in the universe. We want you to be able to join a certain faction, try to forge your own path, or try to ignore the factions for most of your decisions. We are trying to provide you with as many roleplaying choices as we possibly can in this regard. Of course, for all those choices, we want you to see the consequences of your actions, whereas a faction will like you or dislike you, or you manage to play one faction against another.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also some light mechanics supporting it. I will not delve into details, but we want the game to be a whole experience, not too narrative-focused or too mechanics-focused. It's a balanced experience. When discussing character creation earlier, I focused more on narrative, which is part of the character creation, but there is also a mechanical part supporting the narrative. The same goes here.</p>
<p><strong>Companions are going to be a big part of the game, right? Can you say how many there will be?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishulin: </strong>I couldn't tell you the exact number of companions, sorry. But as for the approach, we want the companions to be front and center of all our games, but this time around, we are trying to give them an even bigger spotlight. You are going on a mission with two companions, but the rest of the team is not left behind on the ship. They can still help you fulfill your mission objectives in many different ways.</p>
<p>Probably somebody will stay on the ship and help you with the ship throughout the mission, or some of the companions can go fulfill their own objectives, or they can form a second team that goes through the mission on a different path. Sometimes you're meeting them, helping them out, or they're helping you out and you're progressing through those missions. It's not like every mission has a similar pattern, so every time it is different. Sometimes it's more focused on a couple of companions. Sometimes it's more your own personal story. But overall, we are bringing companions to the missions as much as we can.</p>

Overall, we are bringing companions to the missions as much as we can.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Okay. I know you confirmed that there will be romance, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishulin: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>What differences, if any, will there be with the romances seen in your most recent game, Rogue Trader?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishulin: </strong>When we're approaching romances in our games, we try to make it interesting, both in terms of decisions and in terms of how you approach certain characters through romances and how romances show the characters from a different perspective. The same goes here. It'll be deep narrative experiences that allow you to understand your character better, understand the companion better, and go through this story in the way you like.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of combat, can you share how many active abilities you are targeting? I would wager less than in a CRPG.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishulin: </strong>We want our players to have a lot of freedom in how they play the game. You can select a character that is more weapons-focused, and then you will be relying more on weapons, on shooting and your targeting skills, but you can also create a character that has more focus on abilities and playing from abilities' perspective and building your gameplay and your choices to support your abilities depending on that or a mix between the gunplay and abilities. You will feel the difference and you can build your character to support the play style you want.</p>
<p>To do that, we are trying to make a game that is accessible, perhaps not with all the building options like in Pathfinder or Rogue Trader, but there are still a lot of synergies to find and a lot of perks to choose from, so you can rely on that. We want all the players familiar with cover shooters, with action RPGs and, of course, with Mass Effect to feel at home.</p>
<p><strong>Ranged combat obviously plays a significant role given the setting, but can you make a melee-focused character?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishulin: </strong>You can create a character focused on close-range combat, using weapons like shotguns. Also, you saw in the trailer that one of the characters was carrying a shield and had a shoulder cannon, so you can go into close-range combat with a more defensive stance. So, if you favor this approach, there are some options that will be available for you in the game.</p>
<p><strong>As you have noted, The Expanse is quite grounded compared to other sci-fi settings.&nbsp;I've read some comments on places like the Steam forums, where some people feel that it might be duller to make a game in this setting compared to, say, Star Wars or Star Trek. What's your response to this concern?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishulin: </strong>The Expanse is grounded, but it's still over three hundred years in the future. And if you just look at some weapon prototypes available to the military, they already feel like futuristic technology. It's just not a common place.</p>
<p>We're also providing our players with different devices for their abilities. Some of them are very much grounded, but others are a little bit more futuristic. There are also drones that are becoming the staple of modern combat. There are still a lot of things to choose from, even if we are talking about realistic combat right now, and we are, of course, pushing forward because 300 years have passed and allowing players to choose more grounded sci-fi abilities as well, especially for the characters that are more focused on ability use.</p>
<p>Right now, when we play our internal builds, we feel a lot of differences in those play styles. We are making very different builds and have a lot of options to choose from. We are hoping our players will share our experience as well.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Right now, when we play our internal builds, we feel a lot of differences in those play styles. We are making very different builds and have a lot of options to choose from. We are hoping our players will share our experience as well.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Will there be ship combat in The Expanse: Osiris Reborn?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishulin: </strong>There is no huge mini-game that allows you to play ship combat as a mini-game, but traveling on a spaceship is very much part of The Expanse and we want you to feel that. So there is no full-fledged mechanic, but there are some surprises regarding this in the game.</p>
<p><strong>Okay. I guess we'll have to wait and see. Thank you for your time!</strong></p>

            <p>To suddenly make a leviathan 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/victoria-3">Victoria 3</a> free to play the day before the weekend is either an act of historic generosity or a masterstroke of cruelty. My dear friends at Paradox Interactive, I have literally just sent Nic my contributions to this weekend's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/playing-this-weekend">What Are We All Playing</a> round-up. And now, sirs and madams, you would have me reckon with approximately a century's worth of densely tabulated imperialism, optional child labour and people called Leopold. </p>
<p>Not only have I popped my monocle, sirs and madams, but my top hat has gone off like a volcano and my handlebar mustache has twisted itself into a pair of propellers, which are now flying me away into the sunset. I bid you good evening, sirs and madams! I say again: good evening and good night!</p> <!--more-->
<p>The giveaway <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/529340/view/550115608635644077?l=english">runs till 23rd June on Steam</a>, and only applies to Victoria 3's base game. You will need to buy the whole thing if you want to play beyond that window. It coincides with the launch of the Chambers Of Commerce DLC. Yes, this is the familiar Paradox gambit of enticing punters with a timed freebie, then burying them in paid expansions, like, I don't know, Queen Victoria shoving Gladstone's head down the toilet for proposing universal male suffrage.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-respond-to-the-accusation-that-they-fix-games-with-paid-dlc-we-try-to-find-a-middle-ground">had words with the publishers last year</a> about the often-heard claim that Paradox are in the habit of releasing games 'unfinished', then charging for expansions that add key mechanics. They said they were "trying to find a middle ground", while acknowledging that it was a "fail" to release Victoria 3, specifically, without a proper warfare system.</p>
<p>Even in the absence of a chunky military component, Victoria 3 appears to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/victoria-3-review">solid work</a>. Back in 2022, our reviewer Caelyn Ellis called it "a warts and all take on a tumultuous period in history" and "a surprisingly thought-provoking experience", not least for how it handles the whole British Empire thing. OK, Paradox, I have talked myself into trying it now. Witness me returning from the sky, whiskers whirring, exploded top hat held penitentially in one hand.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> Reddit AMA has provided insight into when the next major update may be coming, as well as a firm stance on the design direction of the PvP endgame.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lehj35/official_dune_awakening_launch_ama_with_funcom/">AMA</a> was handled by Funcom developers including creative director Joel Bylos. It was Bylos who responded to questions regarding the endgame PvP, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-is-being-dominated-by-one-busted-technique-crushing-people-with-helicopters">which has proven controversial</a> among those torn on the orniphopter-laden meta that has formed in the game's opening weeks.</p>
<p>When asked whether the team was considering removing missile launchers for scout orniphopters - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-early-meta-helicopter-infested-nightmare">the source of much ire</a> - Bylos responded with considerations from the team.</p>

<p>"Equipping a Scout Ornithopter with rocket Pods [could] reduce overall maneuverability and max speed. This will help solidify this module selection as a desire to engage in combat and balance it versus other combat-focused vehicles," said Bylos. He also noted other ideas, like an increased impact on the scout orniphopters' heat when shooting missiles, as well as a baseline speed increase to orniphopters with boosters equipped to make escaping easier.</p>
<p>As for the overall endgame experience, Bylos expanded his thoughts as to explain more macro goals the team desire.</p>
<p>"We want players to make meaningful decisions about what they bring with them and how they outfit their vehicles," Bylos stated. "Once players have engaged in PvP, we want the experience to be reliable, responsive, and clearly understood. This determines how PvP as a whole feels and how players make their moment to moment decisions in a fight."</p>
<p>Bylos would conclude by addressing concerns regarding connection-related troubles: "To ensure a more reliable experience in ground combat, we are continuing to address issues with movement desyncs and rubber banding, as well as ability activation reliability."</p>
<p>When asked whether or not a Deep-Desert-style zone without vehicles was being considered, Bylos outright stated no, elaborating: "a lot of our adjustments and balancing are going to drive combat towards the core vision, which is people competing over points of interest in the Deep Desert". Bylos continued: "The current balance between vehicles and on-foot is not tuned to our liking and there are multiple changes in the pipeline to address this (above and beyond bugs we will fix)."</p>
<p>So it's certainly been made clear that quality of life changes are being worked on, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-patch-ends-the-reign-of-vehicular-terror-as-ramming-into-other-players-no-longer-deals-damage">like the removal of vehicle ramming damage in PvP</a>, the team stood firm for their ideas on how the Deep Desert works. Which is good, in my opinion. Filing down this "vision", as Bylos puts it, risks removing a substantial amount of character from the game.</p>
<p>The AMA wasn't just focused on PvP! Other interesting tidbits were revealed by the team, such as a quality-of-life update coming in July, the fact that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-new-maps-hagga-basin">major Dune: Awakening updates</a> are planned to release every three-four months with new PvE and story stuff to play through, as well as plans to add new contracts to the game.</p>
<p>In Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-review">Dune: Awakening review</a>, the endgame was described glowingly: "It feels less like structured group activities you'd see in a traditional MMORPG raid, and more like grouping up in Classic WoW for a world boss. Or joining a hunt train in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>. It's organic community play, something that forms bonds, strong friendships, and undoubtedly tense rivalries."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This is the second of the team's zombie games to get the remake treatment. However, reception to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/house-of-the-dead-remake-heading-to-playstation-5-this-week">first House of the Dead: Remake's reception was pretty mixed</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/house-of-the-dead-film-in-the-works-from-resident-evil-monster-hunter-director">The House of the Dead is also set for the big screen, with Paul WS Anderson</a> on board to write and direct. Anderson will also serve as a producer, alongside his partner Jeremy Bolt.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/689596/astro-bot-director-playstation-icon-gdc-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Astro Bot</em> is filled with whimsy and silliness that makes you want to pay attention to the details. But in a presentation at this year’s Game Developers Conference, director Nicolas Doucet shared one particular aspect of Astro the robot that I hadn’t noticed but blew me away.</p><p>Doucet talked about how Team Asobi worked hard to give the game a good tempo with things like enemy placement and how you can interact with Astro’s spaceship with the DualSense’s gyro controls on loading screens. One thing that kept the momentum going was Astro himself and how he shows his impatience. Doucet showed a video of one idle animation where Astro is hopping up and down on his feet and pointing forward, almost like a little kid that’s demanding you go to the playground. </p><p>It’s adorable — and was added “very, very late” in development, Doucet says when I chat with him a few weeks after the presentation. While a lot of games have characters simply breathing or looking left to right while they’re idle, Team Asobi thought that it could do something a little more fun. Since the game is about rescuing characters, the team started to tie the animations to the idea of looking around, Doucet says. The team even reduced the amount of time it takes for the animations to show as a way to more quickly remind the player of the goal to find the bots. Doucet thinks of this as a subliminal way to put players in the mood to move faster.</p><p>Astro actually originates from a 2013 PS4 pack-in game called <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10000974"><em>The Playroom</em></a> that used the PS4 camera. In that game, the robot is named Asobi, but he looks a lot like the charming Astro from <em>Astro Bot</em>: Asobi has big blue eyes and a cute, pudgy robot body. “Back then, the design of the character came from two angles,” Doucet says. One was that the development team didn’t have much time, so they went for a simple character design instead of a human that might require a lot of facial animations.</p><p>But they also picked a robot because of where it would be making its debut: a preinstalled game on (at the time) new Sony hardware. When you think about Sony or PlayStation, Doucet says that there is an “aspiration to the future” or something “a little bit science fiction.” Team Asobi uses the term “techno magic.” The robot’s design came from that: “we wanted the playful fun character, but also coupled with something really cool and futuristic.”</p><p>The PS5 hardware and Astro might share a lot of similarities — white plastic with black parts and blue lights — but that’s an accident, Doucet says. Instead, both the character designers and hardware team were following similar values.</p><p>While it’s flattering to hear that people treat Astro as PlayStation’s mascot, Doucet says that wasn’t the design team’s original intention for the character. Instead, a mascot needs to be something that “grows naturally” and something that the users decide or feel. That happens through repeated consistency and quality, Doucet believes.</p><p>In retrospect, the awards for the game — including Game of the Year at The Game Awards — are well deserved, but the goal was primarily to put platformers and family-friendly games back on the map and release “as good a game as we can.” Doucet used to look at renowned PlayStation studios like Naughty Dog (<em>Uncharted</em>, <em>The Last of Us</em>) and Santa Monica Studio (<em>God of War</em>), and think they knew some kind of “black magic” that Team Asobi didn’t.</p><p>But following <em>Astro Bot</em>, the takeaway was that “actually, it became the sum of lots of small things that are carefully made.” If the team keeps that consistency and makes sure that “every bit” of the game is done as well as possible, then “the sum of it ends up being high quality.” No wonder Astro is impatient to explore. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>While prowling the ramparts of this year's Summer Game Fest, I rode a zipline to a broken attic window and snuck into a sealed chamber containing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thick-as-thieves">Thick As Thieves</a>, the unofficial <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> Thief game from Otherside Entertainment. Also in the sealed chamber: celebrated Looking Glass dude and Deus Exman Warren Spector, who walked us through a hands-off demo of the PvPvE heisting sim.</p>
<p>I didn't, if I'm honest, see much that wasn't broadly covered by Jeremy Peel's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warren-spector-and-thiefs-game-director-are-making-a-multiplayer-immersive-sim-called-thick-as-thieves">write-up of Thick As Thieves from last December</a>. As such, I'm in two minds about whether to do a full impressions piece - this news article is testing the waters. But I did turn up a few objects of novelty. For one, the new multiplayer burgling sim features an ability that lets you pose temporarily as an NPC, as with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/semblance">Semblance</a> power in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a>: Death Of The Outsider. For another, it turns out that when you rob a joint, you can leave a knavish calling card for other players hunting the same treasure. </p>
<p>It's possible, Spector told me, that you'll be able to customise your calling cards, beyond just displaying your player alias. Being a fundamentally vindictive person, I already have a few ideas for what I'd write on mine.</p>
<blockquote><p>[placeholder]</p>
<p>The earlier bird caught the worm.</p>
<p>The second mouse did not get the cheese.</p>
<p>The third anteater did not bag the swag.</p>
<p>The fourth raccoon did not scoop the loot.</p>
<p>You snoozed and you losed.</p>
<p>Opportunity knocked.</p>
<p>The real treasure was hopefully the friends you made along the way.</p>
<p>IOU one quest reward</p>
<p>Let me guess, someone stole your sweetroll.</p>
<p>Behind you.</p></blockquote>
<p>Naturally, a topic like this demands the attention of the full Treehouse. I asked our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/come-say-hello-to-mark-warren-rpss-new-senior-staff-writer">recently recruited</a> newsfiend Mark what he'd put on his card, and he suggested transcribing the entirety of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ria37d9mInY">this Seinfield video</a> into the textbox. James, our hardware Gandalf, came back with "didn't expect weak foe". Reviews reassembler Brendy had the pithiest and, I think, most obnoxious proposal: "first".</p>
<p>But you, reader dear - what would you leave on your catburgling calling card?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>Join forces with Saber and Archer in the Fate/stay night collaboration.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 3.4 update for <em><a title="Games > Honkai: Star Rail [39 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a></em>, dubbed “For the Sun is Set to Die,” will launch on July 2, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [198 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-975048"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>In this update, Phainon and the Trailblazer will stand together at the crossroads of destiny, ready to take a decisive step that may ignite the dawn of the Era Nova. At the same time, three new playable characters—Phainon, Saber, and Archer—will make their long-awaited debut. Each brings a unique background and combat style to the battlefield, adding new depth and flair to this epic journey. Across the version, a slate of limited-time events, feature optimizations, and fresh content promises to challenge expectations and stir excitement in every corner of the galaxy.</p><p>Picking up where the story left off, the Chrysos Heirs gave everything they had, <a title="Genres > Racing [252 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a> against time to help the Trailblazer and Phainon return the final Coreflame to the Vortex of Genesis. As the veils shrouding Amphoreus begin to lift, one truth becomes undeniable: things were never as simple as they seemed. What unfolds next reaches far beyond a single world—the dawn of the Era Nova may echo across the stars. And in the wake of it all, the Trailblazer’s choices could shape the very destiny of the universe itself.</p><p>In the upcoming main story, the long-awaited Phainon will finally join the Trailblazer’s team as a key ally. Born in Aedes Elysiae, he was among the first Chrysos Heirs to extend goodwill to the Trailblazer upon their arrival in Amphoreus. In the face of ever-mounting danger, he has repeatedly stepped forward to shield others from the storm. Behind his calm and reliable demeanor, however, lies the burden of great expectations. In Version 3.4, players will venture deep into Aedes Elysiae alongside the Trailblazer, tracing Phainon’s journey—from his rise as a warrior, to joining the Flame-Chase, and ultimately becoming the person he is today. During combat, Phainon can accumulate “Coreflames” through various means. Once he reaches a certain number of “Coreflames,” he can unleash his Ultimate to transform and create a “Territory,” battling enemies in a powerful new form. His combat power greatly increases. While transformed, allies temporarily leave the battlefield, but their bonus effects remain active. Upon transforming using Coreflames, Phainon unlocks new abilities, channeling the powers of Origination, Calamity, and the Foundation Titans. It’s worth mentioning that when Phainon is in the team, the team’s Technique Point cap increases. His Technique can instantly defeat normal enemies within a certain range without triggering combat. This will make exploring the map and adventuring across worlds much easier.</p><p>Beyond Amphoreus, Penacony too shall unfold its magnificent story: Recently, Trailblazer received a mysterious letter from Old Oti, head of the Alfalfa Family, an invitation to join a special entertainment program called “Sweet Dreams and the Holy Grail War.” This Holy Grail War will take place in Penacony, where seven invited participants will summon Penacony’s historical figures as Servants to fight alongside them. In addition to the Trailblazer, familiar names like Aventurine, Mr. Boothill, and Miss Robin will also appear as contestants. At the same time, three legendary Heroic Spirits will respond to the Holy Grail’s call: Saber, Archer, and Lancer. How will this dazzling and unpredictable “Sweet Dreams and the Holy Grail War” unfold? Who will form a contract with whom? The Trailblazer can uncover all these mysteries firsthand. The <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> × <em><a title="Series > Fate [67 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/fate">Fate</a>/stay night [Unlimited Blade Works]</em> collaboration special story—Trailblaze Continuance “Sweet Dreams and the Holy Grail” and the event “Fate/stay night” will officially go live on July 11. Stay tuned!</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_975052"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>It is also worth noting that Saber will be joining as a playable character in this collaboration. Saber is a 5-star Wind-type character following the Path of Destruction. Her Ultimate, “Excalibur,” deals massive Wind DMG to all enemies and converts her Basic ATK into an enhanced Basic ATK that also targets all enemies. During combat, Saber can accumulate “Core Resonance” through her Technique, Basic ATKs, or when allies use their Ultimates. Once she accumulates enough, she will immediately gain an extra action. Using her Skill at this moment consumes all accumulated “Core Resonance,” increases the Skill’s damage, and instantly refills the Energy required for her Ultimate.</p><p>At the same time, Archer will also be available as a playable character to assist players in battling powerful enemies during the Holy Grail War and the subsequent cosmic adventures. Archer is a Quantum-type character following the Path of the Hunt, skilled at dealing sustained single-target damage through repeated Skill use. When his Skill is activated and he enters the “Circuit Connection” state, casting the Skill will not end his turn. He can continue to use it until all Skill Points are depleted. With each additional cast, the damage increases accordingly. Upon using his Ultimate, Archer will recite the classic chant to activate “Unlimited Blade Works,” unleashing a powerful strike against a single enemy and gaining Special Charge. As the battle continues, whenever an ally attacks, Archer can consume this Charge to trigger a Follow-up ATK and restore 1 Skill Point for the team.</p><p>Starting from July 11, once the collaboration event begins and until the end of Version 3.6, Trailblazers who log in will be able to claim Archer, the limited 5-star collaboration character, for free. It’s worth mentioning here that the character and Light Cone collab banners will be available long-term after the event starts.</p><p>Version 3.4 brings not only the return of many popular characters, but also all-anticipated enhancements and stunning new looks for familiar faces. In the first half of the update, limited 5-star characters Tribbie, Sunday, and Sparkle will return for a limited time. In the second half, Firefly, Jingliu, and Blade will return as well. Even more excitingly, Silver Wolf, Blade, Kafka, and Jingliu will receive substantial enhancements, including adjustments to battle mechanics and Eidolon effects. Notably, players will also be able to freely switch between classic and enhanced combat modes, allowing for flexible gameplay tailored to individual preferences and playstyles. Additionally, Firefly’s brand-new outfit, Spring Missive, will make its debut in this update, bringing a fresh look to this beloved Stellaron Hunter.</p><p>And that’s not all. The long-awaited “skip dialogue” feature, which was previously announced, is finally going live in Version 3.4, letting players freely choose the pace of storytelling based on their own preferences. The all-familiar minigame “Origami Bird” will make a strong comeback, adding a touch of lively fun to the update.</p></blockquote><p><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,778 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [23,544 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/honkai-star-rail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honkai-star-rail/id1599719154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.hkrpgoversea&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer and special program below.

            <p>Limited Run Games has requested Nintendo temporarily remove its Gex Trilogy from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a> eShop.</p>
<p>The Gex Trilogy, which bundles together the cult-classic 90s platformer Gex and its two sequels, launched earlier this week across PC, PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and both Switch consoles.</p>

<p>But while things appear to have gone swimmingly across most platforms, the trilogy wasn't working as intended on Switch 2. A number of Limited Run Games titles which run on its Carbon Engine had compatibility issues with the new console, however a recent firmware update released by Nintendo last night resolved the majority of these. But, alas, the Gex Trilogy was not one of them.</p>
<p>Sharing an <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/limitedrungames.com/post/3lrxtpy5kw627">update on social media</a>, Limited Run Games said: "Since we do not have clarity on when Gex Trilogy on Switch 2 will be fixed in firmware, we submitted our own patch last week to correct the issue."</p>
<p>However, due to the Juneteenth holiday across the pond, this patch is still awaiting approval. While Limited Run Games hopes to issue the patch early next week, it has requested Nintendo for the time being removes the game from the Switch 2 eShop.</p>
<p>"Thank you for your patience as we work with Nintendo to resolve these issues," Limited Run Games wrote, before sharing a list of its games that are now Switch 2 compatible following that aforementioned firmware update.</p>
<p>This list is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clock Tower: Rewind</li>
<li>Jurassic Park Classic Games Collection</li>
<li>Tomba! Special Edition</li>
<li>River City Girls Zero</li>
<li>A Boy and his Blob Collection</li>
<li>Rocket Knight Adventures</li>
<li>Shantae</li>
<li>Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Retro Collection</li>
<li>Xtreme Sports</li>
<li>Trip World DX</li>
<li>Felix the Cat</li>
<li>Rendering Ranger R-2: Rewind</li>
</ul>

<p>The Gex Trilogy has otherwise been a successful launch for the team at Limited Run Games. Soon after its more modern debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gex-trilogy-celebrates-success-with-much-requested-feature-that-should-make-european-fans-happy">the publisher announced the PAL versions of Gex 2 and Gex 3</a> - which feature the vocal stylings of Leslie Philips and Danny John-Jules respectively - will be added in an update.</p>
<p>"We're excited for European Gex fans to relive these games the way they remember and for others to hear them for the first time," Limited Run Games said at the time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Sniper Elite was never really the most obvious option for a zombie spin-off. I mean, generally speaking if a zombie is far enough away for you to be sniping them, you’ve got a good 30 minutes of shambling before they’re a threat to you anyway. Not to mention that you don’t want to spend time watching the gory, bone-crunching details of your precisely placed sniper round making its way through a zombie skull when there’s the rest of the horde still to go, and they’re getting closer. On the other hand, I do love shooting zombies. Also, I quite like VR, so Zombie Army VR should be right up my alley.</p>
<p><iframe title="Zombie Army VR – Launch Trailer | PS VR2, Meta Quest Platforms &amp; PCVR" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ghv_WBpjx8Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Zombie Army VR is so self explanatory it almost defies description. There’s a Nazi zombie apocalypse at the end of World War 2, and so you’ve got to use World War 2 weapons to blast them. Sure there’s technically a story going on in the background, but you’re probably not paying it much attention – in previous games this was because it’s just a thin excuse to shoot zombies, but now it’s also because you’re in VR and you’re poking the poor officer in charge of you in the eyeball with the barrel of your sniper rifle whilst he’s giving his briefing.</p>


<p>At any given moment, you have a sniper rifle, a secondary weapon, usually an automatic like a Thompson, and a pistol. You’ll unlock new options as you find them in game and they can be upgraded with packs that you find in levels as well. You also have three consumable slots which you can use to carry items like healing kits (which are injectors here), grenades, mines, and other kinds of traps. Using these you’re going to fight through a horde of zombies in a style that is, despite being set in World War 2 times, almost identical to every other zombie shooter you’ve played in VR. With that said, you will already know if this style of game is still interesting to you, or if you think it’s all been done to (un)death by now.</p>


<p>It’s not bad if you’re into this kind of thing and just like killing zombies, but Zombie Army VR’s most remarkable quality is how unremarkable it actually is. The only unique feature is the X-ray killcam that has been adapted from the flatscreen games. Something has been lost in translation though, as bullets often just clip through skulls without leaving a hole behind, or a hole just appears in a different part of the skull. Without that feature to differentiate this from other VR zombie games, it’s just a bog standard game where voices chunner at you for a minute before you go out and kill more zombies.</p>
<p>The shooting works just fine, reloading works fine too, using the ammo belt-eject mag-pull slide method you’ve used a thousand times before. Occasionally, doors will be blocked by shadowy stuff until you kill all the zombies in the room in a slightly cheap way of trying to put on pressure on you as zombies just spawn into the room. I’ve never liked this mechanic; it’s much better tackling an enemy when they’re in a particular place and you can plan an approach, and it’s far less interesting to just have them appearing around you like a shooting gallery.</p>

<p>It even has the typical big moments you’d expect from a zombie shooter, like the moment where you temporarily get a massive machine gun turret to mow down a large amount of enemies. It’s just all the same stuff. Again, it’s not bad by any stretch, it’s just not particularly inspired. If this game was released a few years ago before the cascade of other zombie shooters, it would probably be considered very good, but with other games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/06/arizona-sunshine-2-review/">Arizona Sunshine 2</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/14/after-the-fall-review-psvr-meta-quest-steamvr-vive/">After the Fall</a>, Zombie Army just feels a little too…obvious. At least you can play it in co-op, which should help breathe some life into it a bit, but again, both of the aforementioned VR zombie games also feature co-op and are more interesting to play.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		There isn't much to say about Zombie Army VR. It's not bad, but it also doesn't stand out from the zombie shooter hordes, and it even fumbles the series' only truly distinctive feature, the X-ray killcams. It's a by the numbers zombie shooter in VR that might be enjoyable enough if zombie shooting if your gaming version of comfort food, but there are better options out there.	</p></div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cyberpunk-2077-lossless-scaling-3-2-comparison-highlights-how-x2-mode-is-now-comparable-to-nvidia-dlss-4-frame-generation.1223841/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-lossless-scaling-2x-comparable-dlss-4-frame-generation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Lossless Scaling, the PC app that brings frame generation to games that don't officially support it, has been making some great progress lately, and with the improvements introduced in the latest 3.2 version, the 2x option is now pretty close to NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation, at least in Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<p>A recent video by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thefeaj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feaj</a>&nbsp;compares every frame generation option offered by the latest version of the application, now available on&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam,</a> with NVIDIA Smooth Motion and NVIDIA DLSS 4 Frame Generation and Multi Frame Generation.&nbsp;While the x3 and x4 Lossless Scaling options are, unsurprisingly, inferior to DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation in terms of image quality and input lag, the video highlights how the 2x option is now pretty close to regular DLSS 4 Frame Generation in terms of input delay, with only some minor artifacting setting the two apart. Compared to NVIDIA Smooth Motion, however, Lossless Scaling seems to be the superior option, as the slightly better input lag offered by NVIDIA's tech is offset by its low image quality, compared to Lossless Scaling. As such, the app continues to be an excellent choice for those using NVIDIA GPUs that don't support Frame Generation and older games that will never get official Frame Generation support.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lossless Scaling 3.2 VS Nvidia Multi Frame Generation VS Smooth Motion + Setup Guide" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FXLzX_anyEs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 was among the first games to receive support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation. Exclusively available on the RTX 50 series GPUs, the next evolution of the technology introduced initially on the RTX 40 series GPUs can deliver up to<a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/"> 8x performance</a> in supported titles, whose number continues to increase <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-gets-added-to-marvels-spider-man-2-mecha-break-rematch-and-dragonkin-the-banished/">weekly</a>.

"Once players have engaged in PvP, we want the experience to be reliable, responsive, and clearly understood. This determines how PvP as a whole feels and how players make their moment-to-moment decisions in a fight. To ensure a more reliable experience in ground combat, we are continuing to address issues with movement desyncs and rubber banding, as well as ability activation reliability."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also some quality of life tweaks on the way, too, including named storage containers and vehicles, to help you differentiate, as well as "deposit/extract all" buttons for water storages and the like.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/reminder-you-can-use-non-nintendo-usb-cameras-with-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="usb camera article" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/03c6d943f55be/usb-camera-article.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Check out the official details for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> USB camera compatibility on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Hardware/Nintendo-Switch-2/Nintendo-Switch-2-USB-Cameras-2785632.html?srsltid=AfmBOoq6zK5mTXSBzpSY011GVRE952hwn0jSzgAUKbx6ToaOJmHWyDEh">Nintendo's website</a> and you'll be greeted with a surprisingly straightforward message from the Big N stating that, "You can use the Nintendo Switch 2 camera accessory (sold separately) or any compatible USB-C camera you'd like." Nice!</p>
<p>Of course, the reality is that nothing is ever quite so easy; Nintendo does qualify that some cameras may not work and you'll need to use the handy compatibility test found in the new console's settings. This is great, but not much use when you haven't bought the camera yet.</p>
<p>As it turns out, choosing a camera — besides <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-camera-an-elegant-but-nonessential-gamechat-companion">the official one</a>, or the not-quite-as-good <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-piranha-plant-camera-shocking-image-quality-but-its-cuteness-will-snare-you">Hori Piranha Plant one</a>, or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/horis-new-switch-2-camera-is-built-for-handheld-play">the other Hori one</a> — can actually be a little bit of a complicated task. Some cameras work, some don't. Simple as that.</p>
<p>And so, as ever, enthusiastic gamers have been stepping into the breach, compiling master lists of Switch 2-compatible cameras that you can browse and/or add to with your own findings, and there are quite a few popular brands popping up in "Not Compatible" sections thus far.</p>
<p>As pointed out at the very top of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1l5mgn0/tested_usb_cameras_with_switch_2_master_list/?sort=new">this ongoing master list</a> (and this was news to us), some USB-A cameras do appear to work when plugged into the dock or, with a USB-A to USB-C adapter, plugged into the Switch 2 console. New information has appeared! Indeed, in TV mode, it appears you can just directly plug into the dock to potentially use USB-A cameras you have lying around.</p>
<p>With this in mind, this writer did attempt to use a Blink Dog Security camera connected to the dock, but alas no dice.</p>
<figure><a title="usb camera article" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/64d2528759954/usb-camera-article.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Okay, this one didn't work, though the power light did flash on and off, so that was something — <em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Looking through the Reddit list as it stands right now (which we can't vouch for, mind), you can also see some patterns developing around particular brands. Logitech has a whole bunch of cameras, ranging from cheap to expensive, that are seemingly compatible - and a shoutout to whoever it is that's been using an endoscopy cam. Good job!</p>
<p>Here are a few of the included cameras in the 'working' section with some prices (check out the thread for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1l5mgn0/tested_usb_cameras_with_switch_2_master_list/">the full, growing list</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>aoni A20 - 1080p - $19</strong></li>
<li><strong>Logitech Brio 100 - 1080p - $29</strong></li>
<li><strong>Logitech Brio 105 - 1080p - $45</strong></li>
<li><strong>Logitech Brio 300 - 1080p - $39</strong></li>
<li><strong>Logitech Brio 501 - 1080p - $129</strong></li>
<li><strong>Microsoft LifeCam Cinema - 720p - $94</strong></li>
<li><strong>Razer Kiyo - 1080p - $47</strong></li>
<li><strong>Razer Kiyo Pro - 1080p - $129</strong></li>
<li><strong>WAYVOSE ‎WVS0015 Endoscope - ?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>So there's certainly plenty of non-Nintendo gear out there that's getting the job done at various price points, it would seem.</p>
<p>In terms of cameras that won't work, well, Elgato gear seems to have been totally left out in the cold, as does Sony, Insta360, and Microsoft for the most part. There are some surprises and brand outliers, too, such as the very well-regarded (and expensive) Logitech Brio 4K, which is seemingly having issues</p>
<p>So make sure to give this list — and any others you find popping up online — a good read-through before deciding that a very nice and expensive USB-C camera you've seen should 100% do the job. It may not!</p>

            <p>A controversial third-party plugin used by some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> players has been permanently shut down following a cease and desist notice.</p>
<p>A message on the PlayerScope discord (shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1lfgia4/playerscope_stalker_plugin_ceases_development_due/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reddit</a>) details the web back-end has been taken offline and all stored data has been "permanently and irreversibly deleted", while the plugin files have been completely removed from GitHub and GitFlic. "There will be no further updates, support, or development from my side," said the tool's creator.</p>
<p>While PlayerScope hasn't specified where the cease and desist notice has come from, back in January this year Final Fantasy 14 producer and director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> shared news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-considering-legal-action-against-use-of-a-third-party-tool-in-final-fantasy-14-says-naoki-yoshida">Square Enix was considering taking legal action against the creator of a third-party tool</a>.</p>

<p>Eurogamer has contacted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> for clarification.</p>
<p>Yoshida has long warned players against using third-party plugins, which are strictly prohibited in Final Fantasy 14. He's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-world-first-ultimate-raid-challengers-busted-for-cheating-thanks-to-single-pixel">repeatedly called out players for cheating during Ultimate Raid challenges</a>.</p>
<p>However, the PlayerScope tool in particular has been used for nefarious intentions.</p>
<p>The plugin would allow anyone to search for a Final Fantasy 14 character name to receive that player's account details, including information of all characters on that account. Player information was also uploaded to a central server combining all data. Essentially, this allowed for in-game harassment and stalking.</p>
<p>In short, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxivdiscussion/comments/1hvv7k5/comment/m5w6qo1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">one reddit user</a> put it, the plugin was a "stalker's wet dream".</p>
<p>"We strive to offer and maintain a safe environment for our players, which is why we ask everyone to refrain from using third-party tools," said Yoshida back in January.</p>
<p>In February, <a href="https://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/515747-Letter-from-the-Producer-LIVE-Part-LXXXV-%2802-21-2025%29">Square Enix stated</a> it was making changes to how characters were blacklisted, although third-party tools were able to get around this - something the company admitted was "very problematic". While it had countermeasures in place, Square Enix did not disclose what those were.</p>
<p>Now, however, PlayerScope has been completely shut down. "This wasn't an easy decision, but it was necessary," said the tool's creator.</p>
<p>Still, while players have mostly praised the decision, some have concerns the database of player information may still exist elsewhere.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>March to the beat</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Bandai Namco has revealed a new overview trailer for the upcoming remaster of a PSP classic, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/patapon_1plus2_replay">Patapon 1+2 Replay</a>, and it looks absolutely delightful.</p>
<p>This one was initially revealed back in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-march-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">final Switch 1-focused Direct</a> in late March and is set to come our way on <strong>11th July</strong>.</p>
<p>Those who played either <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psp/patapon">Patapon</a> or its sequel on PSP back in the mid-2000s won't find too many surprises in the new trailer, but if you missed out, it does a decent job of filling in the blanks. This is a rhythm game where you take control of an army of tiny one-eyed warriors, and help them journey across the land. Every command you give to your team comes in the form of drum beats, which you'll have to bash out on the buttons to make them follow your instructions.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The new trailer runs through most of these commands while showcasing the game's controls and tactical slant, before detailing some of the gimmicks, character classes and quality of life improvements we can expect to encounter next month — shout out to the 'Drum Command Always Display' function.</p>
<p>All in all, it looks really rather sweet. Bandai Namco have assumed publishing duties on this one, but the original Patapon team are hard at work on a spiritual successor, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ratatan">Ratatan</a>, which is <em>also</em> eyeing-up a Switch release. Man, it's a good time to be a rhythm fan!</p>

			<p>The Witcher 4 development team aims to take full advantage of the generational shift since the release of The Witcher 3, and their ambition to deliver a true next-gen experience had to be shown right from the get-go with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">tech demo</a> shown during this year's edition of Unreal Fest.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-4-devs-are-preparing-for-a-generational-shift-after-the-witcher-3-and-theyre-studying-the-rpgs-biggest-city-to-help/">GamesRadar+</a>, Engineering Production Manager Jan Hermanowicz said that the studio is adapting to the generational shift in hardware, engines, and technology since the release of the third entry in the series. The studio wants to take full advantage of this shift to deliver a true next-generation experience.</p>
<p>This ambition had to be shown right away, which led to the showing of the village of Valdrest in The Witcher 4 tech demo. This village featured over 300 NPCs, a huge character density comparable to The Witcher 3's biggest city, Novigrad, which provided clear proof of how serious CDPR is about stepping up from the previous entry in the series. The city players get to explore as Geralt is searching for Ciri actually served as a basis for the creation of Valdrest's NPC density, according to Hermanowicz, as the team spent a lot of time looking at recordings of Novigrad, looking at what was done in the past, what worked and what couldn't be accomplished at the time. As such, the studio is definitely not stepping into upping the ante blindly, but is actually building on what was already done in the past.</p>
<p>Though just a tech demo that may not be entirely representative of the final game, The Witcher 4's first showing was indeed impressive, and not just for how alive the village of Valdrest looked. The tech demo was running on base PlayStation 4 at 60 FPS with ray tracing, and with the studio making the game with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-is-made-with-console-first-approach-60-fps-on-xbox-series-s-will-be-extremely-challenging-to-achieve-says-cdpr/">console-first approach</a>, there's no doubt that we won't see a repeat of what happened with Cyberpunk 2077's console launch, although Xbox Series S owners may not be able to enjoy the game as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X owners, as getting the game to run at 60 FPS on the system will be extremely challenging.</p>

"Metroid Prime 4: Beyond and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition are not yet available and are scheduled for release in 2025."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has been able to verify the advert currently remains in place at the station — as detailed in our original report below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>ORIGINAL STORY:</strong> A giant advert for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond at London's Oxford Circus tube station states that the game is now available, sparking confusion from Nintendo fans on their morning commute.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First off, if you've seen the advert yourself, no — the current London heatwave hasn't melted your senses. The advert, now spotted by multiple fans and confirmed in person by IGN staff, really does say the game is "out now".</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Officially, Nintendo has not announced a Metroid Prime 4: Beyond release date other than a vague promise it will launch this year. But even if the game isn't out now, its appearance on an advert in such a prominent location is giving Nintendo fans hope its launch is right around the corner.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Any idea why the MP4 Beyond ad in the London Underground says 'out now'?" Nintendo fan orchestar  wrote on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1lfnbga/metroid_prime_4_ad_in_london_underground_out_now/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>. "I’m genuinely confused. Do they mean the Switch 2 is out? I wish the game was truly out though haha."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have speculated that the advert is perhaps outdated — maybe Nintendo did initially plan to launch Metroid Prime 4 now, and the wording wasn't updated? Alternatively, we could be seeing a version of the advert not due until later, alongside the game's actual release date. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For other Nintendo fans, keen to play the game soon after many years of waiting, the advert has sparked hope of a surprise release.

Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's placement here, then, looks just to be part of a wider promotional campaign — rather than a specific placement for the individual game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has contacted Nintendo for comment.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/20/pxl-20250620-103943003-1750416263852.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is "out now", according to this Oxford Circus advert.

                <p>NetEase Game has announced a new game called Blood Message, which it describes as its first "AAA" single-player experience that is under development at Naraka: Bladepoint studio 24 Entertainment.

The story focuses on a father and his son as they navigate a collapsing world and find themselves torn between duty and family.</p><p>"We are ushering players into a new generation of high adventure with Blood Message," NetEase executive VP Zhipeng Hu said in a press statement.
