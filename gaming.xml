Games like Tetris Effect: Connected and Pistol Whip run very well on the headset, and if you're looking to get a good sweat in, you can't go wrong with a few rounds of Les Mills Body Combat. The other nice thing about the Quest 3 is that the controllers don't have tracking rings around them, making them easier to grip and use for play sessions.</p><p>You might want to consider picking up a Meta Quest 3 Elite Strap as well, just for extra comfort, or if you feel like upgrading the headset, the Elite Strap with battery add-on is a very good investment for long VR sessions.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-3-Elite-Strap/dp/B0CD15C641?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta Quest 3 Elite Strap</a> -- $64 (<del>$70</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-3-Elite-Strap-Battery/dp/B0CPYMDPB5?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="nofollow ">Meta Quest 3 Elite Strap and battery (Amazon)</a> -- $130</li></ul><p>We're seeing a lot of other great gaming deals right at Walmart, like the premium <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PS5-DualSense-Edge-Wireless-Controller%2F1707140316%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmeta-quest-3-vr-headset-is-on-sale-for-its-best-price-yet-at-walmart%2F1100-6524762%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DualSense Edge controller for $175</a> and several Nintendo Switch games--<a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FThe-Legend-of-Zelda-Breath-of-the-Wild-Nintendo-Switch%2F55432568%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmeta-quest-3-vr-headset-is-on-sale-for-its-best-price-yet-at-walmart%2F1100-6524762%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252FSuper-Mario-Maker-2%252F367896025%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmeta-quest-3-vr-headset-is-on-sale-for-its-best-price-yet-at-walmart%2F1100-6524762%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario Maker 2</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252FMario-Kart-8-Deluxe-Nintendo-Switch-U-S-Version%252F55432571%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmeta-quest-3-vr-headset-is-on-sale-for-its-best-price-yet-at-walmart%2F1100-6524762%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>--for just $30 each.

Four players can also compete against each other in a five-streak battle or three-point-contest, as well as play two-on-two matches.</p><p>Nintendo Switch Sports included six sports at launch, which were volleyball, badminton, bowling, soccer, chambara, and tennis. After launch, Nintendo added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-sports-update-adding-full-soccer-motion-controls-and-more-new-features/1100-6505760/" data-ref-id="1100-6505760">full soccer motion controls </a>as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-sports-free-golf-update-arrives-on-november-28/1100-6509377/" data-ref-id="1100-6509377">golf</a>. Now, more than two years since its release, it's finally getting basketball.</p><p>To put that in perspective, Nintendo Switch Sports is getting new content even further after launch than Animal Crossing: New Horizons did. That may come as a surprise, given that Nintendo Switch Sports sold 13.11 million copies as of <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/240507_3e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">March 31, 2024</a>, compared to Animal Crossing New Horizon's 45.3 million sales figure.</p><p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons launched in April 2020 and stopped receiving any further content after November 2021 with the Happy Home Paradise update, and has since been only getting patches to fix bugs.</p><p>Nintendo Switch Sports launched in April 2022. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-sports-review-better-together/1900-6417867/" data-ref-id="1900-6417867">Nintendo Switch Sports review</a>, we said, "Nintendo's latest motion-controlled sports game resparks the magic of playing with others, but not without a few fumbles along the way."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-2024-monk-gets-major-buffs-and-reworks<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has previewed another reworked class coming to <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank">D&amp;D</a> 2024</em>. The latest preview for the world's most popular fantasy TTRPG is the <em>D&amp;D 2024</em> Monk. Thanks to player feedback and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-player-handbook-playtest-8-reworks-monk-druid-and-barbarian" rel="noopener" target="_blank">playtesting</a>, this master of martial arts has received several quality-of-life improvements</p>
<h2>The <em>D&amp;D 2024</em> Monk Preview</h2>
<p>In an official post on <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/1758-2024-monk-vs-2014-monk-whats-new">D&amp;D Beyond</a>, Wizards of the Coast went into detail on the <em>D&amp;D 2024</em> Monk. Much like the other classes previewed so far, the core fantasy of the class is mostly unchanged from <em>D&amp;D Fifth Edition</em>. Monks are still balletic martial artists fighting alongside spellcasters and dragons.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-2024-monk-dragonborn-with-lantern.jpg?itok=MYSREIAD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-2024-monk-dragonborn-with-lantern.jpg?itok=OIVNwff9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>No chance of being eaten by a grue here.</figcaption></figure><p>But, as the player base has expressed, the Monk is underpowered in several areas. The <em>D&amp;D 2024</em> Monk rework addresses some of these criticisms. The Monk's Martial Arts damage dice start at d6 and cap at d12. Patient Defense and Step of the Wind no longer cost Ki Points. Also, Ki Points have been renamed Focus Points.</p>
<p>The buffs continue with some reworked class features. Deflect Missiles has been changed to Deflect Attacks, letting Monks stop any source of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. Stunning Strike can only be used once per turn now, but the saving throw effects have changed so the target is debuffed on a success.</p>
<p>In addition, the <em>D&amp;D 2024</em> Monk has received several new class features. Uncanny Metabolism lets you regain all Focus Points when you roll for Initiative once per Long Rest. Self-Restoration lets you end the Charmed, Frightened, or Poisoned condition at the end of your turn. And Heightened Focus improves Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-2024-monk-warrior-of-mercy-artwork.jpg?itok=W5TZe03P 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-2024-monk-warrior-of-mercy-artwork.jpg?itok=P2J0d1ho 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>He can heal you or kill you. Enjoy.</figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, the preview showcases changes to the <em>D&amp;D 2024</em> Monk subclasses. The Warrior of Mercy and Warrior of the Open Palm are mostly unchanged. The latter's Quivering Palm has been nerfed slightly. Instead of instantly dropping a target to 0 hp, it inflicts 10d12 Force Damage.</p>
<p>The subclass with the most changes is the Warrior of the Elements. One of the weakest Fifth Edition subclasses has received a glow-up, providing extended reach on martial arts attacks and the ability to deal fire, cold, acid, lightning, or thunder damage with each hit. They also receive a new cantrip, Elementalism, which creates elemental AoE bursts and provides damage resistance.</p>
<p>The <em>D&amp;D 2024</em> Core Rulebooks are available for pre-order right now.</p>

Thankfully, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-pc-mods-steam-temples-skip-starborn-powers-1850916181&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-pc-mods-steam-temples-skip-starborn-powers-1850916181">PC mods followed quickly after launch</a></span> and let people improve the game.

And if you peruse Bethesda’s official mods launcher you can find a ton of other <em>Star Wars-</em>themed mods that are now available on console, including lightsabers. </p><p>Now that I can wield a lightsaber and fly around in my favorite spaceship—the N1-Naboo Starfighter—I might finally have a good reason to play more <em>Starfield</em> on my Xbox Series X. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That's 13% off the $200 MSRP, which might not sound like too much, but the DualSense Edge is almost never discounted. Walmart+ members have early access to this deal until 5pm EST. This is part of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-deals-sale-is-live-prime-day-competition-heats-up">Walmart's larger sale</a> that competes with Amazon Prime Day. We don't expect to find a better deal during Prime Day. In fact, we doubt that Amazon will offer a deal on this controller at all. This is a professional grade controller for the PS5 console, much like the Xbox Elite is for the Series X.

Like the Xbox Elite Series 2 controller, it offers pro-level features like grips, adjustable analog sticks, mappable rear buttons, profiles, and more. You can swap out the standard analog stick tops with convex replacements that come in two different heights. You have two different options for the back buttons: levers like in the Xbox Elite Series 2 or smaller nubs. One of the most important features of any pro controller are the triggers, and they’ve gotten attention in the DualSense Edge as well. Next to each trigger is a stop slider that lets you adjust how far you have to press the trigger down to make it register.

                <p>Back in June, Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cloud-gaming-is-coming-to-amazon-tvs/1100-6524554/" data-ref-id="1100-6524554">announced a deal with Amazon</a> to bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to Fire TV devices, and today, July 8, that functionality has gone live. What this means is the Xbox experience is now available in yet another place, and people do not need to buy an Xbox console to play.</p><p>As a <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">takeover ad on the Xbox website</a> reminds us, anyone with an Amazon Fire TV stick can now play games from within the Game Pass catalog. Beyond a Fire TV stick, you'll need some kind of controller. Xbox controllers are supported, of course, but a PlayStation controller works as well (<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/games-apps/cloud-gaming/connect-controller-smart-tv" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here is the full list of supported controllers</a>).</p><p>You'll need to be a subscriber to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to get access to cloud gaming as well, and of course, you'll want to have a fast and consistent internet connection. Microsoft recommends a wired connection for the best experience, or a 5Ghz wifi connection with 20 Mbps down.</p><p>Most games from the Game Pass catalog are available to stream over the cloud, but not all of them. You can <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/games#cloud" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visit the Xbox website and use the "cloud" filter</a> to see a full list of supported games.</p><p>Xbox cloud gaming is supported in more than 25 countries around the world. You can <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/regions" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visit the Xbox cloud gaming website </a>and search for your home country to see if you can stream games where you live.</p><p>The rollout of Xbox cloud gaming for Fire TV devices follows the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-samsung-xbox-tv-app-works-great-but-who-is-it-for/1100-6504321/" data-ref-id="1100-6504321">2022 launch of Xbox cloud gaming on some Samsung smart TVs</a>. Users also need to download the Xbox app for the Fire TV stick or Samsung smart TV.</p><p>Microsoft offers Xbox cloud gaming as an option for people who don't own an Xbox but still want to play Xbox games. The least expensive Xbox out there is the $300 Xbox Series S, after all. The company has always said it does not expect cloud gaming to overtake or replace the traditional hardware-based model, and to that end, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-talks-the-future-of-its-hardware-and-the-importance-of-backward-compatibility/1100-6523373/" data-ref-id="1100-6523373">Microsoft is cooking up a new Xbox device now.</a></p><p>Microsoft itself at one point was thinking about creating its own streaming-focused Xbox device of some type, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-on-why-the-xbox-streaming-console-isnt-ready-yet/1100-6509207/" data-ref-id="1100-6509207">Microsoft's R&amp;D teams couldn't get its components price down low enough for it to make sense as a commercial product.</a> So instead, Microsoft is working with companies like Amazon and Samsung to help expand Xbox's footprint in the streaming space.</p><p>Whereas Microsoft used to spend a lot of time, money, and attention on trying to convince people to buy new Xbox hardware, that isn't the company's sole focus any longer. The wider goal, it seems, is to expand the Xbox ecosystem to as many people as possible, and to convince them to sign up for Game Pass.</p><p>Circana reported on Monday, July 8 that Xbox Series X|S sales are down by 13% and also remain slightly behind Xbox 360 figures after the first 43 months in market. For comparison, PS5 unit sales are up 8% over PS4's sales over the same period of time. </p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/25/23423668/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-20-million-people-streamed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">More than 20 million</a> people have already used Xbox cloud gaming, and that figure no doubt stands to grow bigger still in the months and years to come.</p>

			<p>Dutch independent developer KeokeN Interactive, founded by brothers Koen Deetman and Paul Deetman, is <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keoken/deliver-us-home?ref=discovery_category" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back on Kickstarter</a> for Deliver Us Home. KeokeN had to let go of almost all its employees not long ago, and now it's just the two brothers again (plus a couple of collaborators), making the crowdfunding proposition a necessity.</p>
<p>I spoke with Koen Deetman at length about what that means for this third entry in the sci-fi franchise, how they're coping as a small indie team, and much more. As a reminder, the Kickstarter campaign is active for three more days, with KeokeN looking to raise another €12K to fund the project.</p>
<p><iframe title="Deliver Us Home - Kickstarter Teaser [PEGI]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uwzy_hQS-o8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>The last time we <a href="https://wccftech.com/deliver-us-the-moon-next-gen-and-deliver-us-mars-qa-with-keoken/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoke</a> was ahead of the launch of the Deliver Us Mars. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/deliver-us-mars-the-fate-of-a-father/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In our review</a>, we called the sequel an improvement over the first one. But you had some issues in the studio, right? You also had to let go of most employees. What happened there? Was it an issue with low sales or was it something else?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>We had a great development on Deliver Us Mars. It was absolutely a step up. I would like to think that that moment of crafting Deliver Us Mars was also very much part of our ambition in the studio. Besides trying to, of course, get into the same success rate as Deliver Us the Moon, we also tried to do new things and to show a little bit where our ambition was headed.</p>
<p>When we released in February 2023, which is when a lot of games were released, I don't think that the moment of release helped its performance. However, its sales were almost five times quicker than its predecessor. That was definitely not the problem. But when you saw the whole landscape of game publishing change every year, you saw that most of those deals relied on publishers recouping their budget. Once you understand what your landscape looks like, you cannot really sign anything else.</p>
<p>We were very open to our team and said that we had to fight for it in order to land a deal. But if the landscape changes this much, then yeah, connecting another project, was just really, really hard. As much as we tried, and we tried a multitude of things to make that a reality. But in the end, we just didn't make it with our core team intact.</p>
<p><strong>I guess one of the main issues in the industry is that it's harder to get funding. That's also what you're seeing, I imagine.</strong></p>
<p>Right. It's more or less where risks are just not being taken in the same way. Of course, interest rates have gone up. I think it's the publishers who are just not connecting to their investors anymore as much or getting enough resources available to them. They are in a position where they just have to take a bet on something that is far more guaranteed, in a way. That makes the whole landscape a lot harder or a lot more competitive to the midsection towards indie.</p>
<p><strong>Basically, there is no more space unless you are a really, really low-cost indie team or a big AAA developer.</strong></p>
<p>That's essentially the case. You can see that. It seems like the big AAA companies can safeguard themselves in time, and then there's a huge gap where safety only begins if you are an indie developer of, say, three or four or five people.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Risks are just not being taken in the same way in funding games.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>With Deliver Us Home, you're returning to Kickstarter after using the platform for the first game. For a few years, crowdfunding seemed to fall out of fashion, but with all these issues in the game industry, maybe developers are rediscovering this tool as a means to fund their projects.</strong></p>
<p>It's interesting that you say that. It's where it all started. Paul and I were just discussing that we were very much on time to try and pitch a new project. This was in 2020/2021. Throughout those years, we had amazing discussions with several partners. I think that we talked to around fifty publishers. What was eventually the case is that if you have your own IP or a new IP, the risk is more in whether this IP is going to land a big audience or is going to return its investment. But if it's a known IP, then it's more or less, is it something that is lucrative in that business?</p>
<p>After pitching almost 200 times, we always seemed to have been bounced back and forth about something in the end. It was either too expensive or too cheap, or we had something with the game that was not particularly to their liking. Maybe we were too niche, or for someone else, too commercial. It was always about listening to what they wanted.</p>
<p>But we were like, can we go back to what we want? After we had to make this tough decision, and we had something like, ok, so what brought us success in the first place? Then we saw that crowdfunding is not particularly in the same area as back in 2016 because it was different back then.</p>
<p>We felt like, what if we would develop the game closer? We saw that the prototype project that we opened up in a small video was something that was actually very applauded. So we were like, what if that can help maybe develop a better sequel in the series. Right now, it does show potential from a different perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Definitely, if you want to make a specific game that publishers don't want to fund, maybe Kickstarter or crowdfunding in general is the best way forward. Will you be working with the community on certain aspects of the game? How open are you to feedback?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. I have to say that working with a, let's say, 45+ team as we've done for Deliver Us Mars at the peak and now being back to just us two ( plus two very, very nice people who are still with us trying to help out where they can)&nbsp;brought this challenge in front of us. We had all these hard decisions made by getting the company scaled down to zero. But then we were also tasked with creating a demo that is engaging and interesting enough for the Kickstarter campaign, plus the trailer in time to release it literally the month after. So we had this at the start of May and released the Kickstarter campaign in June.</p>
<p>As much as that is a crazy endeavor, this was great. For Deliver Us Mars, I've been running the project as a game director and now here I was creating holograms and parts of the level myself again. Also, it's shown us what we were capable of doing in our series creatively that we didn't necessarily - well, if I look at what the people who played our demo are saying, it doesn't necessarily detract from any expectancy they have. It might actually be more mysterious, something that they really like from the series. So, it's not necessarily a bad thing. That's something we've come to learn now that we are almost through the Kickstarter campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any plans to release the demo of Deliver Us Home at some point on Steam?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, anyone who backs us right now for the game already gets the demo and we are actually developing it now closer to the community. We got a lot of feedback, actually, in great directions. If you look at Steam Next Fest, we explicitly didn't put it in there because we thought we were not really showing a demo of a product that was about to be released. We were like, maybe that's not the place right now, but now that it's forming, we do have ideas on that. We're not sure yet, but it seems to be interesting to try it out, maybe even to get some wish listing interest or to get some eyes on the demo as it really develops in a great state. It is still a prototype demo, but far more finished and interesting to show there. We'll definitely talk about it.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Deliver Us Home will be more in the player's control.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You talked about the studio being much smaller than it was with Mars, right? Can you speak to how this changes what you're able to do with this new game? Should fans expect Deliver Us Home to be a smaller game in content and scope?</strong></p>
<p>Deliver Us The Moon was the debut. We set the tone there; that was the game people take as a basis. Then we got to Mars, which was more about the ambition as a studio and the level of quality we would like to reach.</p>
<p>Of course, now we have scaled back to being this very lean, tiny indie team again. We are super open to first honoring the series' strength. That push to drive forward is something that we want to kind of return to. That goes hand in hand with player agency. Mars was more on rails, so we really want to loosen up that grip. In that sense, Deliver Us Home will be more in the player's control.</p>
<p>Over the years, we didn't want to create an open world, but we did want wide linearity, where the player still needs to rely on their senses and figure out what's going on in the environment. If you combine that with some customizations, you can have more control over your astronaut suit. There's something you can build up to or maybe track towards or collect towards. We added as much as we could do realistically with four people in a month.</p>
<p><strong>In terms of gameplay, what are the main changes players will notice compared to the previous titles?</strong></p>
<p>The platforming aspect in Deliver Us The Moon was nearly non-existent. In Deliver Us Mars, we really took a huge bet on platforming in general. Some of those things were a hit and some of those were a miss. The climbing was something we really like to add a bit of danger, but it was maybe found a little bit hard at times by some players. So instead, we upgraded climbing to be more traditional.</p>
<p>We also thought that you could upgrade your suit, for example, with something like a jet pack part that could give you that double jump to reach other locations. That could give you interesting ways to explore your areas. We're looking into those things.</p>
<p>In the demo, you don't really know where you are. It's almost like an Earth-like planet or something. We also thought, what if you encountered something in your environment that could be a danger to you as a character? In the demo, we toy around with something like a bear. The pressure of that is very interesting and feeds into this element of mystery and unknown. Why is it there? Is it actually there? Where is it? And I think that those elements give you a bit of a thrill while you are finding out more about our story and what happened there.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, that gives that sort of a feel back, especially from Deliver Us The Moon, but even one-offs, such as a Morse code puzzle game where you literally have to listen to the radio and hear some sort of Morse code come through. That code translates to something that you find that you can actually open a door in.</p>
<p>What I like in that Morse code tidbit is that the frequency is always different. If anyone wants to try to find this place, then they cannot look it up on the Internet because you actually have to learn and listen to what the code is. So there's nobody that's going to say what the code is because it's always changing.</p>
<p><strong>From a story standpoint, can you at least give us a hint as to where there is a connection with the previous stories and protagonists from previous games?</strong></p>
<p>When we started Deliver Us The Moon, we always envisioned this as a series, although we were not really sure how long yet. At the very least, we knew there could be a couple of games. Moon and Mars are set up as standalone games, just like Deliver Us Home, but we always try to find something of the backstory or something else that combines all these games together.</p>
<p>Without spoiling the whole surprise with the ideas we had for this new one, it is going to be about an astronaut now fighting to secure a home for humanity. But yeah, players can be assured they will find traces from the previous games. Also, if there is unfinished business in the previous games, we will absolutely make sure that we find creative ways to either answer them or build upon them.</p>
<p><strong>Are you using Unreal Engine 5, or is this still made with UE4?</strong></p>
<p>Right now, to kind of win speed, because we're just a few people now coming from a bigger team, we use UE4. That was the quickest way for us to craft something that could be convincing enough to bring over our ideas.</p>
<p>Of course, there is a huge urge, especially now that we're smaller, to upgrade to UE5, which is, in multiple ways, maybe even better than UE4 for a smaller team. This is one of our wishes. It's part of the plan. Also, we're all aware of ray tracing and all that stuff. We at least want the game to support it, but we're unsure if it's sensible to do that right away. So we are not guaranteeing it. However, we always try to be in tune with what the series is expecting.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We would like to upgrade to Unreal Engine 5.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>I remember the first game <a href="https://wccftech.com/raytracing-and-nvidia-dlss-added-to-deliver-us-the-moon-nvidia-points-out-dlss-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was one of the first to add ray tracing</a>. Now, some games have gone full path tracing.</strong></p>
<p>By the time we're in a close-to-released version, then absolutely, we have the neck to be upfront with those technologies and try to figure out if that's possible for us. That's why we love Unreal 5 and would like to upgrade. The latest version of Unreal Engine has always helped our environments come to life.</p>
<p><strong>You will soon launch Deliver Us The Moon on Nintendo Switch. Would you be interested in launching the rest of the franchise on Nintendo platforms, too, possibly the next console due in 2025?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Interesting question. The reality is we went from a 20-man team to 0. There's nothing we can actually promise anymore on those ports;&nbsp;however, there's always an intent. What we really like about Deliver Us The Moon is that even though it was released sporadically over the course of years, looking back at that cadence, it didn't really seem to have hurt our game.</p>
<p>Maybe the beginning could have been better, but you can see that as a smaller indie fighting for attention, some of those console releases can actually help. They become something of a moment and a part of the campaign or into the lifetime of the game where there's a little bit of attention to it.</p>
<p>So the fact that Deliver Us The Moon came out even on Stadia and old generation consoles, all in due time... Deliver Us The Moon was ported by another company. They said it was just not possible on the Switch. Now, though, they called me back and said they changed their mind. I was like, really? In a month's time, they kind of convinced me, showing that it was playable and I was like, well, maybe it is actually worth looking into. Eventually, we finished the game on Switch, and now it is coming out.</p>
<p>Realistically, though, we cannot promise or investigate these things right now. If we see an opportunity, we would love to bring it to more places, but it only depends on the situation.</p>
<p><strong>Soon, you'll be able to estimate the interest of Nintendo fans in the&nbsp;franchise.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. For me, it's also something of a breakthrough that we finally got something released on Nintendo. That's just really cool.</p>
<p><strong>They also have a really big install base.</strong></p>
<p>Indeed. It would be helpful if the game picked up at a great pace, but we are also realistic. I mean, it's an older game, but it looks quite great on Switch. I wasn't expecting it to be running like this, but I do recognize the game, and it's still a great experience. We're very excited that we made that happen.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Game Pass is absolutely something that we think about as a possibility.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Speaking of new technologies, how do you feel about the use of generative AI in games, such as with NPCs?</strong></p>
<p>Paul and I have had a lot of discussions about this. There's two things we recognize. This industry just keeps evolving. If we look back to where the games industry started 40 years ago, it is impressive how fast that change came about.</p>
<p>I do have sympathy for an artist, for example, who says, hey, it's also something I love to do and I don't want it to be replaced by something that's artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>However, I see it a little differently. If you were working in a shop like a factory and you were flipping pieces of, I don't know, maybe a car. That wasn't necessarily a great job, but at the very least it was making a living for some people, but at some point, that changed for robotic arms.</p>
<p>Now that worker is actually more in a control center, he controls the whole chain. I kind of see it a little bit like this as well. Instead of being very pessimistic about it, let's try to make use of it. Like, how are you able as a creative to control or work with it? As much as you are against it, I think it's inevitable. This is going to be a change of pace. It's gonna significantly decrease budgets in a way that can help evolve your game or your production. Then again, we need to be sensible because we also understand that it might take jobs that people would love to do rather than being happy that they are replaced.</p>
<p><strong>That's certainly the biggest problem in the industry, with some AAA games costing as much as $300 million to make. But generative AI can help indie teams like KeokeN, too, in doing a better game even with just a handful of people.</strong></p>
<p>True. For example, I remember that concept artists were used to create a sense of idea. But now, we don't necessarily replace them because even if you generate something, it doesn't really come down to something that you exactly want.</p>
<p>But helping the artist teams speed up the process of crafting an idea or crafting a certain concept was already—we don't necessarily use it in a final game, but it does help set an idea, set what people want to explain or try out in the game. That's something quite powerful, actually, as it helps rather speed up the understanding.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think about potentially adding your games to a subscription service like Game Pass or something similar? Would that help reduce the risk in a situation like yours?</strong></p>
<p>In the past, we've seen Deliver Us The Moon launch on Game Pass. With all our previous games, there was a publisher with us that was either negotiating this or dealing with it eventually.</p>
<p>I can see how a deal like that can help an independent company. It is absolutely something we think of as a possibility. Then again, there's no guarantees to that. We know there are lines and lines of developers lining up to get there.</p>
<p>I think because the landscape has changed so much, for us, it turned more into that we had to deal with how to get our people to a safe place or get them new jobs.</p>
<p>Of course, we were trying to set things up, but it was not really realistic at that point. Right now, we could actually think of it and how that would change our course of development, especially because we're now so lean in that sense that those deals could be very feasible. But like I said, we're not having any guarantees yet for that&nbsp;or any conversation, for sure.</p>
<p><strong>I asked because some developers are openly pro subscription services, while others are vehemently against them.</strong></p>
<p>Maybe a good thing to say about Game Pass is I am not so sure what the impact on your overall success in sales figures is particularly, but I do know that Game Pass is a great discovery tool for an indie.</p>
<p>We saw a lot of change in pace when we were on Game Pass. People just knew the game. Even the sentiment around it, I think there were over a million plays for Deliver Us The Moon on Game Pass. A lot of people know our game because of it. That is absolutely valuable. In the end, of course, as this is a business, you also need to make sure that you can survive on it.</p>
<p>There needs to be a great middle ground in some way where it is something that you can live from, something that generates enough eyes and commercial value that your game gets discovered.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Scoping down doesn't necessarily mean that the game is going to be less fun to play.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>On that note, did you ever think about whether your games would be successful on mobile? More and more developers are porting their titles. CAPCOM, for instance, has recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-7-biohazard-coming-to-iphone-ipad-and-mac-on-july/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ported</a> Resident Evil games to iPhone and iPad. The Deliver Us franchise may be even better suited since it's more adventure than action.</strong></p>
<p>It has passed our minds. This is maybe a little bit strange because I'm from a generation that was very used to gaming on a PC or console, but I can see with my kids nowadays that the phone or the tablet is probably the first thing that they're going to say that they played a game on.</p>
<p>We haven't really made solid plans for it, but I remember we had some research done on what it would take to bring Deliver Us The Moon to a mobile device. Nothing really came out of it because the fires that we have been fighting were more pressing, but our minds have been there.</p>
<p>Your way of saying it might spark me to check back into this because you're right. It's potentially something to consider.</p>
<p><strong>I believe it could do well. Also, nowadays, phones are powerful enough to run it. Anyway,</strong> <strong>I don't know if you have anything else you'd like to say about Deliver Us Home that we haven't already touched upon.</strong></p>
<p>We are going, to some extent, back to our roots. We always fight to get this game out there because we also see that the community's sentiment is absolutely there and fighting for it with us. That's&nbsp;something that's extremely nice to see.</p>
<p>Maybe not super surprising, but a little bit surprisingly, it gets to a better state, maybe a more unique and surprising state of the game than we initially thought. Scoping down doesn't necessarily mean that the game is going to be less fun to play.</p>
<p>We have a lot of things invested in the series already, and we can creatively use a lot of cool things that result in an exciting third game. We are on Kickstarter until the 11th of July. That's where we pick it off and see where we go up next.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

The episode begins with him hallucinating a Young Rhaenyra in her adult crown taunting him until he beheads her. In another dream, he chases down Aemond, characterized as Daemon with an eyepatch. Daemon sees his late wife Laena as a cupbearer when he meets with Lord Blackwood (who fans will recognize as the little lord who vied for Rhaenyra’s hand back in season 1). Harrenhal is confronting Daemon with all of the people he’s failed. These literal guilt trips have yet to make enough of an impact on his psyche to thwart his general personality, however, as he nonetheless tries to convince the Tully heir to kill his grandpa.</p><p>Alicent is still out of sorts after mistaking her Aegons and is being proactive in the only way she can; taking Plan B tea and doing history research around the castle. Criston Cole runs a successful campaign, taking Duskendale, Rosby, and Darklyn for Team Green.</p><figure id="" data-id="68324a10a81d105caff9538640978c60" data-recommend-id="image://68324a10a81d105caff9538640978c60" data-format="jpg" data-width="1566" data-height="880" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Tom Glynn-Carney as Aegon in House of the Dragon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tom Glynn-Carney as Aegon in House of the Dragon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ollie Upton / HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="68324a10a81d105caff9538640978c60" data-recommend-id="image://68324a10a81d105caff9538640978c60" data-format="jpg" data-width="1566" data-height="880" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Tom Glynn-Carney as Aegon in House of the Dragon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Aegon’s taunting of his brother in the brothel comes back to bite him. He is reminded of his lack of leadership and basic fluency of High Valyrian during the Team Green council. Aemond has put his war plans with Cole in motion and redirected the Green Army to Rook’s Rest instead of Harrenhal.<br></p><p>Aside from the big battles, the introduction to Alys Rivers, the wood witch of Harrenhal, is a highlight of the episode. Actor Gayle Rankin mystifies as she scares the life out of Daemon, recalling his fight with Rhaenyra and his many inadequacies. The line “I’m no woman at all. I’m a barn owl cursed to live in human form” is going to go platinum on social media.</p><p>Aegon, dreadfully bored of the Green Council, retreats to have the most demoralizing conversation with his drunk mother. Alicent holds no bars as she tells Aegon the truth of his position, “Do what is needed of you: Nothing.”</p><p>Rhaenyra finally arrives back at Dragonstone and reveals her peace talks with Alicent. She faces that it’s war or death and agrees to send a dragon to defend Rook’s Rest.</p><p>We then get to the episode’s MVP, Eve Best as Rhaenys. The warrior Queen Who Never Was makes peace with her existence as she governs in Rhaenyra’s brief absence and acknowledges Lord Coryls’ bastard, Alyn. She bravely goes to battle with her dragon Meleys.</p><p>Rhaenyra tells Jace the Song of Ice and Fire as the Battle of Rook’s Rest begins. Cole and Aemond’s plan slowly materializes as a push to start dragon warfare, but Aegon throws a wrench in the plan by getting the Aegon the Conquerer armor out of the closet and riding his dragon, Sunfyre, into the battle. Their lack of fighting experience nearly gets them killed until Aemond rides in on Vhagar. But petty Aemond strikes Aegon first so he can battle with his aunt solo. Aegon and Sunfyre go down in a blaze. </p><p>The ground battle is confused and chaotic as these giant beasts blow fire in the sky. Cole gets knocked off horseback and is out cold for the rest of the battle.<br></p><p>As awesome as dragon fighting sounds, the show focuses on the emotional bond between dragons and their riders. The dragons scream and bleed as they scrap and it tears through your heart. Eve Best provides a stunning  performance as Rhaenys and Meleys perish together in slow motion.</p><p>The aftermath of the dragon battle is total desolation as ground troops are charred in their armor. Cole wakes up to stop Aemond from feeling fratricidal and finds Sunfyre wrapped around a crispy Aegon. Do we still have a King?</p><p>The dragons have begun to dance and the consequences will be mighty. We’ll see which Targaryen will inherit the ashes left behind. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://track.flexlinkspro.com/g.ashx?foid=156085.101105873&amp;trid=1197689.218054&amp;foc=17&amp;fot=9999&amp;fos=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.max.com%2Fshows%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon%2Fc68e69d7-9317-428a-a615-cdf8fe5a2e06&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://track.flexlinkspro.com/g.ashx?foid=156085.101105873&amp;trid=1197689.218054&amp;foc=17&amp;fot=9999&amp;fos=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.max.com%2Fshows%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon%2Fc68e69d7-9317-428a-a615-cdf8fe5a2e06" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a></span> is streaming now on Max. </p><p>.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-tsushima-was-the-best-selling-game-in-the-us-in-may-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest gaming sales data</a> has been released for May 2024, and with it comes the most recent numbers regarding overall current-generation console sales. Both the PlayStation 5 (PS5) and Xbox Series X|S were released the same week back in 2020, but both have had different sales journeys.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1810379504218681666" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Circana</a>, the PS5 is outselling the PS4 by 8% through its first 43 months. On the other side of things, however, the Xbox Series consoles are behind the Xbox One in sales during the same timespan by 13%. They also sit behind the Xbox 360 during that same period.</p>



<p>Though percentages were given, the Circana data didn’t give specifically unit totals for the PS5 and Xbox Series. That said, <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGChartz</a> says that, as of June 1, the PS5 has sold 58.78 million units while the Xbox Series has sold 28.74 million. </p>



<p>For the month of May 2024, specifically, the PS5 led the way in hardware sales in both units sold and dollars. The Xbox Series came in 3rd in total units behind the Switch but 2nd in dollars. As a whole, however, year-on-year sales numbers have declined by a <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1810379249922331004" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“double-digit percentage”. </a></p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch had the “most significant” fall year-on-year.  Overall, sales are 30% lower year-to-date than in 2023.</p>

            <p>
Respawn Entertainment has announced Apex Legends' upcoming Season 22 will make significant changes to the free-to-play shooter's Battle Pass "experience", by releasing two Battle Passes per season instead of one, and then charging full price for each.
</p>
<p>
As of Season 22, Apex Legends will ditch its current season-long Battle Pass in favour of two half-season Battle Passes - one launching at a season's start and another at its mid-point "split" - each featuring 60 levels of rewards, compared to the previous version's 110.
</p>
<p>
Despite the truncated number of progression levels, each new half-season premium Battle Pass costs approximately the same as the older season-long version. Previously, a premium Battle Pass cost 950 Apex Coins (a 1000-coin bundle is priced at $9.99 USD), and Respawn's new half-season Battle Passes cost $9.99 each. A new Premium+ tier (replacing the existing Premium Bundle) is $19.99 every half-season, and a free tier remains available.

<p>
Additionally, the overhauled Battle Pass will no longer be purchasable using Apex Coins (previously,  coins earned in one Battle Pass could be spent on the next) and is only available by spending real money. "The decision to move from [premium currency] is not one that we made lightly," Respawns writes in its <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/battle-pass-update">announcement post</a>, "but it does allow us to decrease the price of Premium+ for our community."
</p>
<p>It also insists the Battle Pass changes are required to make the system "more approachable and realistic for our global player community", and that the "updated aspects... make the Battle Pass more attainable and valuable for your time and money".
</p>
<p>
Respawn's "value" argument more specifically relates to the reward "refresh" it's making across all three tiers of its Battle Passes. These adjustments have seen the removal of lesser-used rewards, twice as many Crafting Materials now being awarded across a season, three more Legendary/Epic Apex Packs per Battle Pass, plus additional rewards for the Premium+ tier as per the infographic below. Respawn claims these changes amount to "double the Battle Pass rewards across the entire season".
</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Respawn Entertainment/EA</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Unsurprisingly, the community response to Respawn's Battle Pass changes has been far from positive, with comments over on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/1dyblr3/apex_legends_battle_pass_updates_season_22/">Apex Legends' subreddit</a> calling the move everything from an "abysmal decision" and "a truly embarrassing money grab" to "the worst fucking shit I've ever seen". The <a href="https://x.com/PlayApex/status/1810330029265420515">announcement on Twitter/X</a> has over 2.9K replies at the time of writing, and the general sentiment is overwhelmingly negative.
</p>
<p>
Will the community outcry be enough to convince Respawn and publisher EA to reverse the decision? Time will tell, but for now, Respawn is hoping to reel players into the new system by giving away Apex Legends' first half-season Battle Pass for free when it launches alongside Season 22 later this year - but it'll only be free for those players who log in and complete a set of challenges within the first two weeks of its release.
</p>
<p>
Apex Legends' 21st season, Upheaval, started in May and is due to conclude in August.

When Dead Rising was originally released in 2006, its soundtrack included several licensed tracks, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLYuGZng3s4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heaven's Creepin' In by Supernova Syndicate</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CU_jMx9cCs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slave by The Evolutionaries</a>. Yet the game's most notable licensed music track was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWZVKU5imx0&amp;pp=ygUUTGlmZXNlZWtlciBnb25lIGd1cnU%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lifeseeker's Gone Guru</a>, played every time the character encountered the Convicts while roaming in Leisure Park. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>There had been speculation about whether Capcom would use licensed music from Dead Rising in Deluxe Remaster, especially with Lifeseeker's Marc Lariviere posting on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lifeseeker1/posts/pfbid02ratWyV37dzGAHmbahkPGfT9j4ZqJ8tgxqCFoByDgDnSnA6LkYWVpB9jD34f62GR9l?__cft__[0]=AZX7I7iffXeILj8lVZFcQKACQsCOUuao0cog9Z8wo6gP4g9JuUd6GiHJEp0IikMYPHd9ti9O-FJFp1jO58e3KRSwDE41DMME79W9fhbqM0xkFwh6q5cs8k6Mj1_pN0-mIdK3te6irRJEHGgVg6S4rAruC31nAuomFd-NNHbsDTulDQ&amp;__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C9I3lnLBZv0/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> that he was unsure whether or not Gone Guru would be included. Though Lariviere did reveal that the last time Capcom remastered the game, referring to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/09/dead-rising-re-releases-get-launch-date-and-price">2016 HD re-release</a>, the studio "did not tell him" whether or not the song would be included. </p><p>In the meantime, fans continue to speculate about will be included in the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. Most notably, many were shocked to learn that T.J. Rotolo, who voiced protagonist Frank West, will not be reprising his role because <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/original-frank-west-voice-actor-says-capcom-didnt-ask-him-to-return-for-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster">Capcom did not ask him</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>On the flipside, fans can expect thhe return of the photography mini-game (with some updates such as an Auto Focus feature) and the <a href="https://www.deadrising.com/1/en-us/floormap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mall's directory and map layout</a>. The most recent gameplay also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/deadrising/comments/1dxyv2n/you_can_see_the_katana/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">showed the katana</a> that you can find off the ledge of the Colombian Roastmasters in Paradise Plaza, implying that item locations will be the same as the original. </p><p>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is a remaster of the 2006 Xbox 360 game. Running on RE Engine, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster will be able to run up to 4K resolution at 60 frames per second and includes a slew of quality-of-life improvements, such as the ability to move while aiming and better AI for the survivors you can rescue. </p><p>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster will be released on September 19 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. </p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/07/08/how-romance-and-relationships-work-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is a BioWare RPG, which means a lot of things, including the fact that the game will feature romance. Based on what I learned during a recent trip to BioWare's Edmonton office for the current <em>Game Informer</em> cover story, Veilguard will be the team's most romantic game yet.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Relationship Level</h2>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="b1bd3189-2248-412f-9626-b67426ecbf13" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>Every companion in the game has a Relationship Level related to Rook, and the choices you make (and not even specifically about the companion, but in the world in general), what you say to companions, how you help or don't help them, and more all play into it. Every time you rank up a companion's Relationship Level, you unlock a skill point to spend specifically on that companion. Though companion skill trees pale in comparison to Rook's expansive tree, which features passive abilities, combat abilities, and more, as well as paths to three unique class specializations, there's still some customization here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each companion has access to five abilities, but you can only take three into combat. Thus, it's important to strategize which abilities to spend a skill point on and how those abilities can synergize with your current build on the battlefield. Though I couldn't confirm, Dragon Age series art director Matt Rhodes hints that companion issues, problems, and personal quests will play into this Relationship Level and how a companion interacts with Rook.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"[Bellara Lutara, for example] has her own story arc that runs parallel to and informs the story path you're on," Rhodes tells me while I watch game director Corinne Busche play through a linear, story-driven mission in Arlathan Forest where Rook is searching for Bellara. Busche adds that "relationships are key, not only romance but friendships. We wanted to lean into not just the relationships the characters have with you but the relationships they have with each other. It's a found family, and at the end of the day, they need to trust they all have each other's back."&nbsp;</p>














<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="d9b523b2-4d7b-4eeb-9d32-a3ede2420061" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>However, fret not, BioWare fans – romance is a key part of relationships in the game, Busche says, noting some of the romances will get quite spicy. However, not all of them will, as "each romance has a very different flavor," according to Busche. Some characters are straight to the point, while others are more awkward, having never been in a relationship before. "You learn who these characters are in how their romances unfold," she says. She likens romantic and platonic relationships to another way to "level up" your companions. It's not just experience and skill points that determine Rook's standing with companions, but diegetic conversations, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>BioWare has already revealed that every companion in Veilguard is pansexual, notably different from the community-dubbed "playersexual" approach in some games, which sees NPCs adjust romantic and sexual interests based on the player rather than their own sense of sexuality. As pansexual companions, they are attracted to people of any gender (or regardless of gender). That's a critical distinction because, in Veilguard, your companions aren't just going to vie for your affection – they might take attraction to other companions in the titular Veilguard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Giving one companion the cold shoulder might nudge them into the warm shoulder of someone else on the team. Busche says companions can form romances with each other, although I'm unable to confirm if that means locking Rook out of forming a romance with them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I saw nothing resembling romance in my very early hours with the game. However, I did see the romantically inclined "emotional" response in Rook's dialogue choices at times, which led to my Rook flirting with ice mage and private detective companion Neve Gallus. Busche says this is the option to flirt and push platonic relationships into romantic territory, though Rook's flirtatious efforts aren't always reciprocated. But that's not to say you should ignore the other options – I saw dialogue choices resembling friendly, snarky, and direct, too, and I can see how these different flavors of dialogue likely mix and mingle into Rook's relationships with companions. It's still a mostly mysterious system to me, but as Veilguard is due out this fall, I don't have to wait too long to learn more and neither do you.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/quests-from-infinite-staircase-dd-review-perfect-for-more-than-one-shot-but-not<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, there's a lot of published content that can be completed in one or two sessions, while the rest will take you over a year of continuous play to complete. Their latest book, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/everything-you-need-to-know-about-quests-from-infinite-staircase-dd-adventure"><em>Quests From The Infinite Staircase</em></a>, is an anthology book of remastered adventures that instead fills the space of "What if I only had a summer to run an adventure?"</p>
<h2>Information Hands To Players Or Potential Infinite Staircase DMs</h2>
<p>Some top-level information about this book for potential players before getting too into the weeds for DMs is that <em>Quests From The Infinite Staircase</em> features six adventures, there adventures range from level 1 up to level 13.</p>
<p>The adventures are all pulled from earlier versions of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons,</em> each published between the years of 1980-1984. The adventures included consist of <em>The Lost City, When a Star Falls, Beyond the Crystal Cave, Pharaoh, The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth, </em>and<em> <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3f193438-c569-4842-9887-3f37e300a96e" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/dungeons-dragons-expedition-to-barrier-peaks-preview-stepping-directly-into">Expeditions to the Barrier Peaks</a></em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3f193438-c569-4842-9887-3f37e300a96e" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/dungeons-dragons-expedition-to-barrier-peaks-preview-stepping-directly-into">.</a></p>

<p>Each adventure has been remade not only for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e</em> but also with an eye on balancing encounters better, adding more tools for the DM to guide the narrative, and a sensitivity pass (at least for Pharaoh)</p>
<p>Unlike <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fd0050cc-2541-4de8-858f-46e54f556d11" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/keys-from-golden-vault">previous anthologies</a> where a book might come with 10 adventures, most only covering a single level of play each of the adventures found within <em>Quests From The Infinite Staircase</em> spans at least three levels of play.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This seems like the right amount of time for any new DM who is interested in running something with a bit more depth than a one-shot, but isn't ready to commit the time to a full campaign (or for a group of friends whose schedules only allow for two or three sessions before things fall apart).</p>
<h2>Nafas and the Infinite Staircase</h2>
<p>Much like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c69efd7c-c5a7-4b44-a82c-59be6e59f819" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-and-dragons-candlekeep-mysteries-review"><em>Candlekeep Mysteries</em></a> had the idea of books as a running theme through adventures, or Van Richten's Guide To Ravenloft was centered on Domains of Dread this book has the Infinite Staircase and the Noble Genie, Nafas, as its central theme.</p>

<p>Introducing the Infinite Staircase the book describes it as "an impossible staircase [that] winds in a surreal demiplane, ascending to every world, every plane of existence, and the adventure found among them."</p>
<p>The book does a good job of introducing who Nafas is and how he can be used to create a narrative tie between each of these adventures. His inclusion is wholly optional to a DM who can just as easily drop any of these adventures into their world, or start with a plot hook that puts the party right at the start of the action.</p>
<p>While Nafas is an optional tool for this book one thing I did enjoy seeing was the way that the book prompted Nafas' use in any other scenario. Being a Genie who hears the wishes of others through the many doors of the Infinite Staircase the book prompts that you might want to use Nafas if your party is looking to learn the true name of a powerful enemy, need to destroy a magic item, or to restore life to a creature.</p>

<h2>Adventures Across Realms And Playstyles</h2>
<p>The adventures that can be found in this book are predominantly dungeon crawls, which makes sense when you remember each adventure is from the 80s. <em>The Lost City</em> has you moving through floors of a Ziggaurat, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3f193438-c569-4842-9887-3f37e300a96e" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/dungeons-dragons-expedition-to-barrier-peaks-preview-stepping-directly-into"><em>Expedition To The Barrier Peaks</em> consists of exploring a buried spaceship</a>, and <em>The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth</em> is self-explanatory.</p>
<p>While players will be moving from room to room hearing descriptions of caves, pieces of furniture, and getting ambushed by various creatures there is also plenty of story to uncover. Hosting each of these adventures within a contained space helps for a beginner DM to let the party lead the adventure following up to provide them with information where necessary.</p>
<p>From the books first adventure, <em>The Lost City</em>, I enjoyed that while it was a contained Level 1-4 Adventure with a narrative start, middle, and end that there were elements left hanging.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The party is able to work with (or against) the different factions and escape the ziggurat, the book then provides two further options for players. Another, far deadlier, floor of the ziggaurat that might have the party return at level 10+, or an Underground City setting that can be used as a launching-off point for further adventures.</p>
<p>The most impressive adventure in terms of sheer scale is that of <em>Expedition To The Barrier Peaks</em>. This four-level spaceship launches level 11 players into the middle of a science fiction adventure. Adding to the regular roster of Magic Weapons there are Technology Weapons and Items including but not limited to the Antigravity Belt, Needler Pistol, Paralysis Pistol and Powered Armor.</p>
<p>Across the 60+ rooms found in this mega-dungeon players will be collaborating with the onboard AI, meeting different factions that reside among the ship, dealing with renegade androids, and trying to minimize threats onboard. There has been upgrading done to this adventure in the form of making less empty rooms, as well as reordering some of the more interesting encounters to be more directly in the player's paths.</p>

<p>Some other key features of the other adventures include the more narrative-heavy When A Star Falls, and Beyond The Crystal Cave, the latter of which can be completed without needing to resort to combat at all.</p>
<h2><em>Quests From The Infinite Staircase</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p><em>Quests From The Infinite Staircase</em> is a fun collection of 'best of' hits from the early age of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. As always it's good to see these kinds of adventures get the reverence they're owed while also being updated to better fit the game in it's current state.</p>
<p>Overall the most exciting aspect of this book for me is that it fills that space for short and medium adventures that aren't a 'one and done' situation. This is a good gateway for new DMs and new Players to get a taste of what it's like coming back to the table a few times over with the same party configuration.</p>
<p>While the Infinite Staircase and Nafas are only briefly delved into what info is provided does a better job of setting up Nafas as a force to use in a larger game than as the throwaway quest giver within the pages of this book.</p>
<p>If you're interested in playing <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> and find 4-6 session adventures are up your alley then this book is a must have.</p>

		<p>No, nothing is wrong with your email filter. These weekly newsletters are one of the things that fell through the cracks while we were doing our in-person stream in New York City, and then upon our return. I'm sorry. I should've just sent a short email saying "hey, this isn't happening" but there was so little time in-between going to and from New York, recovering from New York, and then preparing to be largely offline during the week after. A huge additional pain involved the monumental effort of getting an above ground pool setup in my backyard, the difficulties of which you'll hear in greater detail on an episode of HOA I'm going to record tomorrow with Rob. My back is still a little sore, and I still have mud that I'm finding under my fingernails, I think. It'll all make more sense soon enough.</p><p>-pk, who wishes he was enjoying this season of <em>The Bear </em>a little more</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>Monday: </strong>Planning! I did my best to keep up with email even when I was off last week, but it still left a million follow-up emails to be sent, not to mention the fact that a vacation I've had planned for a year now happens to coincide with our July 4th break, which means I'm stressed all over again preparing for that family event. My stress strategy is to not think about how much is left to do, and simply do what is in front of me, check it off the list, and then move onto the next. Otherwise, I can feel the anxiety creeping up my neck. It's not helping that the video game I'm mostly playing right now is the stressful <em>Nine Sols</em>, but weirdly, I find my time with that game to mostly un-stress me.</li><li><strong>Tuesday:</strong> We'll record an episode of HOA where Rob talks me through a bunch of apartment stuff happening as he considers whether it's time to sell and move on, and I walk you through what it's like to build and fill a pool, only to realize that you did not account for a few things, and now you have to drain the pool, dismantle the pool, buy a bunch of stone pavers, and spend an afternoon digging holes in the rain.

Probably the most important step in the relationship. No goin back now.” The clip in question shows the opening moments of Michael Mann’s 2006 action movie, <em>Miami Vice</em>, based on the ‘80s television series that Mann produced. In it, immediately after the Universal Studios logo disappears, the Jay-Z verse from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFKjzxWITWw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFKjzxWITWw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2004’s rap/rock masterpiece “Numb/Encore”</a></span> needle-drops as the silhouette of a woman shimmies against a trippy background.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193897" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="10 Creatures We Wanna Ride In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="418" data-playlist="193897,194012,194316" data-current="193897"><div><p>10 Creatures We Wanna Ride In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19360.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It’s a pretty wild clip, and when combined with Streuessnig’s glowing words it ignited a firestorm of discourse about whether or not the film, which stars Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx, was any good. Detractors said it was just another bro movie, dismissing it as fodder for straight men. Supporters, including our very own Carolyn Petit who has been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tumblr.com/agameofme/95352476622/time-is-luck&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tumblr.com/agameofme/95352476622/time-is-luck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">singing <em>Miami Vice</em>’s praises for years</a></span>, said otherwise. But I had never seen it, so I sat down this weekend to watch it. And guess what? <em>Miami Vice</em> rules. </p><p>Watching the opening scene felt like someone broke into my house and stabbed me with a shot of adrenaline before I could even register what was going on. I leaned forward in my seat, absolutely flummoxed that “Numb/Encore” was blasting through the sound bar, confused at the complete lack of a title card or opening credits. When Colin Farrell and his beautiful <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.madison-reed.com/balayage&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.madison-reed.com/balayage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Balayaged</a></span> hair swept into view, a small gasp left my lips. When he ordered two mojitos and proceeded to suck them down while hungrily staring at the bartender, I worried the look on my face betrayed my most impure thoughts.<br></p><p><em>Miami Vice</em> is a hot movie, but it’s so much more than that. Mann is uniquely capable of making a film that feels like it has both a huge dick and a huge heart. The fast cars, the preoccupation with tactile tech, and the long, lingering sex scenes could all push this movie into flatly masculine territory, but Mann’s deft hand steadies it. The <em>plot</em> of <em>Miami Vice</em> follows two almost superhuman cops going undercover in a global drug-smuggling operation, but that’s not what this movie is about.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="46ce21edd05095fc7dfdd47de16f6d03" data-recommend-id="image://46ce21edd05095fc7dfdd47de16f6d03" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gong Li and Colin Farrell look at each other while on a speedboat during sunset.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Miami Vice</em> is about love. It’s about loving the right person at the wrong time, and about how clinging to that love could destroy you. It’s about the illogical nature of love, about falling for someone so immediately and intensely that it intoxicates you, your head swimming like you had too many mojitos, the two of you incapable of keeping your hands to yourselves because touching each other is like taking another shot of liquor.<br></p><p>It happens so fast: Farrell’s Sonny Crockett asks to take Gong Li’s Isabella (the financial advisor for the global drug-smuggling ring) for a drink and before you know it, the two are racing across the open ocean on a speedboat, headed to Havana, where they disappear for a few days, falling into each other and out of everything else. They salsa dance, they fuck in the shower, they trade deeply personal stories, they entwine—all while Sonny is undercover, all while the sting is still ongoing. Periodic shots of darkening clouds, bolts of lightning, and rough ocean waters warn us of how dangerous their dalliance is—but the viewer, like Sonny and Isabella, doesn’t care. You&nbsp;don’t have time to.<br></p><p><em>Miami Vice</em> moves at breakneck speed (so much so I was often confused about what was happening and almost delirious from it), recreating the feeling of falling hard for someone you’ve just met. It sweeps you up in that love, so you yourself feel just as crazy as Sonny, just as willing to put yourself in danger for something that moves you so intensely. How can a movie that manages that not be considered an all-timer?</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
