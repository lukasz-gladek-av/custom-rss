            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/siltterhead-is-good-actually<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I deeply regret not playing <em>Slitterhead</em> sooner. I was excited for it before release despite not knowing what it <em>was </em>exactly, and when it came out in November the reviews were divided. This can mean a game is deeply flawed, exceedingly abrasive or both. <em>Slitterhead</em> is both, but more the latter than the former for me. It’s an imperfect game that takes wild swings in gameplay not seen since the PS3 era and one that, like <em>Kunitsu-gami</em>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-feels-like-it-shouldnt-exist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feels like it should not exist</a>. <em>Slitterhead </em>kinda rules.</p><figure><figcaption>If you've ever wanted to fight a big insect guy specifically in a mahjong parlor, you're in luck. Credit:  Bokeh Game Studio</figcaption></figure><p><em>Slitterhead </em>is the product of Keiichirō Toyama, the creator of <em>Silent Hill</em>, the <em>Siren </em>series and <em>Gravity Rush</em>. That is an incredible pedigree unto itself, and you can see the DNA of those titles in this one (particularly <em>Gravity Rush </em>which I was not anticipating). The game takes place in a fictionalized 90s Hong Kong and more specifically a version of the <a href="https://aftermath.site/kowloon-walled-city-cross-section-illustrated" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kowloon Walled City</a> called “Kowlong.” You take the form of a possessing spirit that comes to be known as Night Owl. You have no corporeal form per se, but instead control the bodies of regular citizens, using each person as a jumping off point and utilizing the power of their blood to form makeshift weapons.</p><figure><figcaption>These bugs are straight up nasty. Credit:  Bokeh Game Studio</figcaption></figure><p>Hong Kong is being overrun by parasitic insect creatures known as slitterheads, which inhabit the bodies of otherwise normal humans and burst out of their skulls to feed on brains. Your goal initially is to hunt them down, although your memory of who you were and the events previous to the game remain foggy. What’s more, the slitterheads’ motivations are unclear. As Night Owl progresses through the game he becomes acquainted with special humans known as “rarities” who resonate particularly strongly with his power. These characters each have their own playstyle and add up to something that resembles your party. They exist as both the source of exposition in the plot well as the primary way you build your skills.</p><figure><figcaption>Pairing play styles with different rarities is most of the strategy in this game. Credit:  Bokeh Game Studio</figcaption></figure><p>Combat in <em>Slitterhead</em> is a process of jumping between civilians and rarities, juggling the unique ability cooldowns of your characters and using the ability to shift rapidly between characters to confound foes. In addition to this, the ability to shift between characters is often used to hunt slitterheads, solve stealth puzzles, and rapidly jump though the dense, vertical terrain of Kowlong. When I said it most closely resembles <em>Gravity Rush</em>, this is the reason.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Kowlong Express: Bringing Forgotten Fragments into Slitterhead" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9RUBI-tKguU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>The documentary Bokeh made about this game.</figcaption></figure></div><p>If that entire explanation was a lot to take in, it’s because <em>Slitterhead</em> is structurally confounding and a difficult game to place, although its similarities to <em>Siren </em>and <em>Gravity Rush </em>are crystal clear if you’ve played them. If I dig deep enough, I can pull up other games it reminds me of, but it has been a very long time since I’ve seen a game that is so thoroughly itself. How would you even begin to describe to a friend how this game works? “Well it’s sorta like <em>Phantom Dust</em> but if it also worked like <em>Messiah </em>or <em>Ghost Trick</em> or the PSP-only <em>Parasite Eve</em> spinoff <em>The Third Birthday, </em>and there’s also some <em>Prototype </em>and <em>Edge of Tomorrow</em> thrown in there.” If you understood at least half of those words, congratulations: you’re statistically 40 years old and have a specific kind of taste.</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: Kino International</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>I'm fine with a naked reference when it's a tasteful reference.  Credit: Bokeh Game Studio</figcaption></figure><p>On top of all this, the setting of this game is straight up ripped from possibly one of my favorite eras in cinema — early 90s Hong Kong. This is very intentionally a Wong Kar-ai ass video game — in one of the opening cutscenes they literally recreate the iconic motorcycle shot from <em>Fallen Angels</em>. Toyama explicitly pulled from the work of Wong Kar-ai&nbsp; and Fruit Chan work when creating Cowlong. “I felt sad that I couldn’t get to witness that chaotic aspect from the 1990s.” This game is like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durian_Durian" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Durian Durian</em></a> meets <em>Yakuza: Dead Souls</em>. There is a close, lived-in density and lushness to the setting that is just so satisfying to inhabit. On top of this, <em>Silent Hill </em>composer Akira Yamaoka did much of the soundtrack, and it is one of the most varied and interesting works he’s put out in a while. There’s tracks that just sound like menacing burps. One track is just a noise band screaming in Cantonese, it rips.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Master of Labyrinth" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UnN4YhDABEM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>This track is so good man. </figcaption></figure></div><p>Oh, also the entire thing is a time loop story. In addition to having multiple characters you talk to between levels to progress the story, the game takes place in a three-day time loop, a tiny bit like <em>Majora’s Mask</em>. By returning to those previous days you change the fate of characters, recruiting new rarities and opening up new potential timelines. This involves replaying previous levels and using context clues from your rarities to find new paths in previously-explored missions. This quirk is both one of the game’s most interesting conceits and is also tied to its biggest flaw: repetition.</p><figure><figcaption>The key to combat is rapidly jumping between rarities and regular people at a relentless pace. Credit: Bokeh Game Studio</figcaption></figure><p>I love this game, but even I will agree with its harshest critics that it overextends itself. Not only does it repeat levels by design, but the core loops of the game are too similar from level to level. There's just not enough variation for the story it’s trying to tell, and as a result it overstays its welcome, sometimes to a grueling effect. That repetition can be exacerbated if you don’t know what tiny thing in a repeated stage you are looking for. If you don’t enjoy the game’s core combat, that would make playing the game feel like torture, but I love how this game feels on a base level. Cutting off a fleeing slitherhead by jumping into the body of a Chinese grandma like Agent Smith from <em>The Matrix </em>and clubbing it with a blood mace can wear a little thin after a several dozen times, but the actual sensation of doing it is so satisfying. What’s more, slitterheads are all fairly similar in a functional but not stylistic sense, which adds to a degree of monotony.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Pairing play styles with different rarities is most of the strategy in this game. Credit:  Bokeh Game Studio</figcaption></figure><p>And yet, I found the combat in this game so unique and enjoyable that I was fine with that repetition through most of the game. The combos themselves are shockingly simple, but how the game manages moving in space is where the complexity lives. Blood is your main source of power and health in this game, and so fighting becomes a complex dance of managing that resource among all available characters and shifting perspectives to do health management. You mainly restore blood by sucking it up from pools on the ground. There is a parry system that involves using the right thumb stick while blocking to build up “Blood Time,” and while it has a tendency to halt the flow of combat, it makes it possible to dig yourself out of a hole if things are going south for you.</p><p>But what makes the game truly complex is the rarities. The cast of characters in this game are aggressively normal people — a sex worker, an unhoused alcoholic, an Indonesian housekeeper, a sexy doctor who chain-smokes. Each of them comes with a different perspective on the slitterheads, and each has a wildly different kit. Edo the unhoused man plays like a glass cannon monk type. Anita, the sex worker, can summon civilians to the area. The cool doctor has a shotgun made of blood and can turn any character into a living bomb. A max of two rarities can eventually be taken on missions, and one of their abilities can be extended to civilians, so synergizing playstyles between rarities becomes a vital but also personal choice.</p><figure><figcaption>Your interactions with characters are done like this between missions. Credit: Bokeh Game Studio</figcaption></figure><p>If I am being effusive, it is partially because we do not get a lot of games this weird. When people bemoan what old games used to be, they are not actually harkening back to an aesthetic but an ecosystem. The PlayStation has one of the greatest libraries in history because there’s a lot of weird choices on it. There will always be blockbusters and struggling indies, but there used to be much more room made for middle budget games that colored outside the lines a bit. Both <em>Slitterhead </em>and <em>Kunitsu-gami </em>are in that lineage, and they both take clearly limited resources and stretch them as much as humanly possible.</p><figure><figcaption>This street is beautifully rendered, which is good because you see it a lot. Credit:  Bokeh Game Studio</figcaption></figure><p>I am not the first to notice that <em>Slitterhead </em>feels like a PS3 game fell out of a time portal. It has the soul of an untranslated UMD that you had to import for $90 in 2006 cash. It’s the kind of title that Microsoft would commission and send out to die in Japan in an effort to sell an additional 20 Xbox 360s. This is a game designer’s game. <em>Slitterhead</em> is <em>Dead Rising</em> and <em>Godhand </em>and <em>Chaindive </em>and <em>Boktai </em>and <em>Rule of Rose</em> and <em>Bullet Witch </em>and every little freak game that sticks in your craw while so many games with dangerously large budgets pass through you fully undigested. It exists unstuck in time and beyond the binaries of good or bad reviews. It is an ambitious love letter to a Hong Kong of yesteryear that resists categorization and is wholly itself. It is not perfect, nor does it need to be. It deserves to be studied and dissected like a rare beetle because games anywhere close to it are in shockingly short supply these days.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-games-journalism-2024-game-informer-ign"><h3>The Best And Worst Games Journalism Moments Of 2024</h3></a><p>It was the worst of times, it was the less-worst of times</p></div><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sandisk-logo-rebrand"><h3>Congratulations To Sandisk On A Rebranding That Rules</h3></a><p>More brands should look like they sell Laserdisc players</p></div></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And some of the most popular. The <em>Twilight </em>film series alone grossed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/608468/box-office-revenue-twilight-saga/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/608468/box-office-revenue-twilight-saga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over $3 billion worldwide</a></span>, and likely produced a generation of adults yearning for Edward Cullen (Robert Pattison) and Bella Swan’s (Kristen Stewart) toxic, undying love. </p><p>There have been countless iterations of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-vampire-movies-halloween-interview-dracula-horror-1851676205&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-vampire-movies-halloween-interview-dracula-horror-1851676205">vampire</a></span>: monstrous devils who will stop at nothing to feed (<em>Fright Night</em>), tragic antiheroes cursed to watch the years pass by (<em>Byzantium</em>) and everyone they love die over and over again, brooding lovers with skin that sparkles (<em>The Twilight Saga</em>), or hilarious misfits struggling to adapt their night-dwelling ways to the modern world (<em>What We Do in the Shadows</em>).</p><p>Narrowing down the best vampire films isn’t easy, but we’ve put together a wickedly fun list of the 12 best vampire films that shows all the different ways the vampire mythology has been adapted on screen. No matter which version you choose to sink your teeth into, you’ll have a bloody good time.</p></div></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/quentin-tarantino-toy-story-3-4-perfect-wont-watch-1851632823&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/quentin-tarantino-toy-story-3-4-perfect-wont-watch-1851632823">Quentin Tarantino</a></span>’s punchy dialogue and Robert Rodriguez’s chaotic direction were the perfect match to inject fresh blood into the vampire mythos. The filmmakers throw the crime, vampire, and western genres into a blender and watch the bloody remnants splatter on screen, creating an unhinged movie about a pair of bank robbers (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) who kidnap a preacher and his family, only to end up in a Mexican topless bar with a horde of rabid vampires. Like most of Tarantino and Rodriguez’s films, it’s filled with carnage and tension you can cut with a knife.</p></div><div><p><em>Byzantium</em> is a different kind of vampire story. Centered on a mother and daughter vampire duo, Eleanor (Saoirse Ronan) and Clara Webb (Gemma Arterton), the Neil Jordan-directed flick is far more pensive, questioning the existential burden of immortality and how you can come of age if you’re stuck at the same age forever. Eleanor wants to step out of her mother’s shadow, feeling remorse for her bloodlust, while Clara uses her power to fight back against the men who oppressed her. This patriarchal struggle offers a fresh spin on the typical vampire figure, and  Jordan’s gloomy, atmospheric direction gives vampirism a moving sadness seldom seen.</p></div><div><p>Ana Lily Amirpour’s <em>A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night</em> is a unique vampire movie because it blends the horror, western, and noir genres while giving the vampire figure a feminist and global twist. It tells the story of an Iranian, skateboarding vampire, played by Sheila Vand, who preys on the men who exploit women. The stark black-and-white cinematography is stunning, giving <em>A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night </em>an eerie and surreal quality. In a world that often tries to hide crimes against women, the sharp, exacting colors reflect the clear-cut nature of the revenge she doles out, leaving no room to question what the men have done or what they deserve.</p></div><div><p>What’s cool about <em>Fright Night</em> is that the main character, teenage Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale), loves horror films and is completely obsessed with vampire mythology, which the movie both lovingly lampoons and infects with genuine frights. Charley is convinced his neighbor is a vampire and recruits an over-the-hill vampire killer to help defeat him. A highlight of the movie is the practical special effects, making the hellish creatures so well-made and finely detailed that they feel real. The movie cleverly interweaves monster movie tropes while riffing on neighborhood surveillance and suburban conformity, balancing just the right amount of camp and chills.</p></div><div><p>What if you had to live with your friends for the rest of your life? Ok, what if you were immortal? This humorous concept is at the heart of Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi’s mockumentary, which follows a group of quirky, centuries-old vampires living together in modern-day New Zealand. We observe the vampire flatmates as they go about their rather mundane lives, despite being undead—arguing about household chores, adjusting to new technology, and finding their next feed. With countless pop culture vampires like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-blade-reboot-delay-production-issues-2025-mcu-1851678580&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-blade-reboot-delay-production-issues-2025-mcu-1851678580"><em>Blade</em></a></span>, <em>Twilight</em>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/slayer-shock-is-a-stealth-game-for-buffy-fans-1787546879&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/slayer-shock-is-a-stealth-game-for-buffy-fans-1787546879"><em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em></a></span>, this film stands out as a clever and original satire of vampire tropes.</p></div><div><p><em>The Lost Boys</em> seamlessly fits vampires into the sunny, fun-loving seaside town of Santa Carla, California. At night, the town comes alive with the roar of motorcycles and the bright, twinkling lights of carnival rides. Kiefer Sutherland leads a grungy gang of leather-wearing bloodsuckers, while Corey Haim and Corey Feldman deliver playful performances as the geeky, comic book-loving nerds who uncover the truth about the gang. <em>The Lost Boys</em> is a lot of fun, mixing humor and scares, while giving vampires a new, 1980s punk aesthetic that fits their rebellious, enigmatic cool perfectly.</p></div><div><p>Park Chan-wook is often at his best when he tackles more fantastical stories, and <em>Thirst</em> is no exception. His frequent collaborator Song Kang-ho plays a priest who transforms into a vampire after sacrificing himself for a medical experiment to find a cure for a deadly disease. He becomes caught between his moral values and his killer instinct, especially after he falls for an unhappily married woman. The conflict between his saintly and devilish sides is thrilling to watch in scenes with dark comedic twists, erotic encounters, and blood-soaked violence.</p></div><div><p> Universal Studios’ <em>Dracula</em> (1931), directed by Tod Browning, and featuring Bela Lugosi’s portrayal of Count Dracula, is the most well-known version of the blood-sucking legend in popular culture. Bela Lugosi’s Dracula has piercing eyes that can easily frighten his victims, but he’s also got that suave, seductive sophistication that makes him hard to resist. His heavy Hungarian accent and theatricality adds to the supernatural creature’s sense of mystery and debonair charm. The intricate designs of Dracula’s lavish castle, the melodramatic performances, and the gloomy atmosphere also give this version a lot of bite. This version of <em>Dracula </em>perfectly embodies the Gothic grandeur that immediately comes to mind when we think of the famous vampire. <br></p></div><div><p>Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, and a young Kirsten Dunst star as a makeshift vampire family navigating eternal life together, beginning in early 20th century New Orleans. Based on Anne Rice’s novel, <em>Interview with the Vampire</em> has the brooding vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac recount the story of his long, undead life to a biographer. We learn how tortured they were watching life change across centuries while never changing themselves. While <em>Interview with the Vampire</em> tends to drag in some parts and could have made the queer elements more apparent, the flamboyant performances (especially from Tom Cruise as Lestat) and ghoulish violence really suck you into their macabre world.</p></div><div><p><em>Shadow of the Vampire</em> creatively brings together horror and humor by imagining Max Schreck (a delightfully batty Willem Dafoe), who stars as Count Orlok in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nosferatu-robert-eggers-bill-skarsgard-movies-1851721835&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nosferatu-robert-eggers-bill-skarsgard-movies-1851721835"><em>Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror</em></a></span>, as an actual vampire. He insists that he can only be filmed at night, never breaks character, and eagerly drinks blood. The crew can’t tell if he’s deeply immersed in his role, or if there’s some truth to him being the undead. Director F.W. Murnau (played by a wild-eyed John Malkovich) gleefully embraces Schreck’s unsettling commitment to his role—even to the deaths of his colleagues. <em>Shadow of the Vampire</em> makes us question our obsession with creating art that feels real, even at the risk of something truly monstrous.</p></div><div><p>Tomas Alfredson’s<em> Let the Right One In</em> offers a quieter take on vampire lore by telling a simple story about children. Frequently bullied by his peers, a lonely boy Oskar meets an elusive girl named Eli (Lina Leandersson) and learns that she is a vampire. The juxtaposition between childhood innocence and Eli’s thirst for violence is intense and fascinating, revealing itself in very swift and stark ways on screen. The themes of sadness, loneliness, and the struggle to fit in make vampirism feel perfectly suited to this coming-of-age story.</p></div><div><p>While the image of Nosferatu standing wide-eyed in the middle of the hallway with his claws curled has become more of a joke thanks to his appearance on <em>SpongeBob SquarePants</em>, the 1922 silent film is truly frightening. There’s a sense of dread lurking around every corner in the deep shadows. As Count Orlok, Max Schreck’s wide-eyed, unblinking stare, his hunched, gaunt figure, and those long, sharp curved nails create a truly terrifying character design. The fact that this movie is 100 years old, and you can see that in the grainy film stock, only adds to the creepiness, as if we’ve unearthed something from ancient history that should not be seen.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Year 1 roadmap for Space Marine 2 includes new content up to Season 4, which is set to kick off at some point in 2025 (we're currently in Season 2).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/following-stalker-2s-success-developer-gsc-game-world-contends-with-this-new-reality<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We now have a really big audience."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl">Stalker 2</a> is a hit. Officially, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-has-already-sold-1-million-copies-with-many-more-playing-on-xbox-game-pass">it’s sold one million copies across PC and Xbox Series X and S</a>, with many more playing on Game Pass. Reports coming out of Ukraine, where developer GSC Game World was originally based before Russia’s full-scale invasion of the country in 2022, indicate Stalker 2 is already profitable. There’s even talk of a Netflix series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what does this success mean for GSC Game World itself and the future of Stalker 2? IGN interviewed GSC CEO Ievgen Grygorovych and creative director Maria Grygorovych at BAFTA in Piccadilly, London following a screening of <a href="https://youtu.be/28CITqxwNz0?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>War Game: The Making of Stalker 2</u></a>, to ask if Stalker 2’s big sales were a game-changer for the developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Discussing the impact of Stalker 2’s release in English, which is obviously not their first language, Ievgen  and Maria talked about how the studio now faces “a new reality” and with it a bigger audience than it’s ever had to contend with. The first steps as part of this new reality will revolve around working to improve Stalker 2 itself, something GSC has already done with multiple patches, but also to expand its plans for continued support.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/23/20241202-202049-1733223547947-1734961939345.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><strong>Ievgen and Maria Grygorovych, far right, discuss the making of Stalker 2 at BAFTA 195 Piccadilly. Photo by IGN.</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“You need to think properly because we now have a really big audience and sometimes different parts of this audience want to see different things,” Maria cautioned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So we need to live now with this new reality, with a live community and talking with them and try to understand them maybe deeper because we really want to make our relationship good.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ievgen went into more detail, saying that while GSC’s plan for the development of future video games remains unchanged, it plans to invest even more in post-launch support of Stalker 2 than it had previously earmarked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Around five years ago or maybe six years ago, we had a plan of what we were going to do in the nearest 10, 15 years,” he revealed. “What projects we want to do, how we're going to look like. And all these years we are slightly updating this plan by just moving the dates forward until we release the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And so six years passed and we still want to do the same games as we planned earlier and nothing changed. The only things that changed is that we didn't think that we would like to invest much more time in live updates of Stalker 2 after game release, that we would want to add much more things in this game in live updates.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What does this mean for Stalker 2 and its players, then? Ievgen confirmed that GSC is now in a position to add ideas it was forced to cut from the game before launch because they weren’t ready, and even add new ideas that have sprung up in the wake of Stalker 2’s release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We didn't expect that we would go back to improving Stalker 2 for a lot,” Ievgen explained. “And now we still have the same plan for 10, 15 years of development of other things we want. But also putting much more in development of Stalker 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Because actually I love the world we built. I still find a lot of things that we can make better and we want to make better. And now we have players for whom we can do that, for whom we have to do that. And for me it's very driving.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/499129/stalker-2-gsc-game-world-profitable-dlc-expansions-multiplayer-netflix" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">same reports coming out of Ukraine</a> suggest Stalker 2 will get at least two expansions and even multiplayer, which may be one of the ideas Ievgen was talking about. The hope, it seems, is that Stalker 2’s success could help put Ukraine on the game development map, as CD Projekt’s The Witcher 2 had done for Poland.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the shorter term, updates to fix issues with Stalker 2 continue, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-patch-11-is-a-big-one-adds-first-iteration-of-a-life-fixes">a much-needed patch that improved the crucial A-Life 2.0 feature</a>.

			<p>The ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is closing the year in an excellent state, as the emulator is currently capable of at least booting most major PS4 exclusives.</p>
<p>As highlighted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BRUTALSAMM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrutalSam</a> in a new video shared on YouTube, the emulator is in an excellent state, as it is capable of running several PlayStation 4 exclusives like Gravity Rush Remastered reasonably well. A few other games, on the other hand, still have performance issues and visual glitches, but the fact that the emulator is even capable of booting them is impressive in itself. The star of the show in the video is Bloodborne, which was clearly one of the main focuses for the developers of the emulator, seeing how well it runs nowadays when it was barely possible to only get in-game a few months back.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Status of PS4 Exclusives on ShadPS4 Emulator | December 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T4_uOv4pdwg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With Bloodborne running so well on the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator, it was not surprising to see the release of mods that attempt, and mostly succeed, at improving the game's visuals. The most prominent of these mods is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-new-version/">Remaster project by fromsoftserve</a>, which enhances the game's visuals with new features that wouldn't look amiss in an official remaster, which is still nowhere on the horizon despite the massive demand.</p>
<p>More information on the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator can be found on its <a href="https://shadps4.net/">official website.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/23/game-of-the-year-2024-best-narrative/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>What makes a good game? <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/22/game-of-the-year-2024-best-gameplay/">Mechanics</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/20/game-of-the-year-2024-best-visual-design/">graphics</a> and compelling characters are all integral, but it’s the narrative that all of these other elements hang upon, like an apple tree bearing fruit. A convincing, emotional and intriguing narrative will keep players coming back, and will make a game live on in their memory long past they’ve forgotten how pretty a mountain was or what buttons to press. 2024 has seen its fair share of engrossing stories, but one title stood head and shoulders above the others.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/metaphor-refantazio-review/">Metaphor: Refantazio</a> is built on the legacy of the Persona series, and, if you’re searching for reasons why it’s an incredible piece of storytelling, that tells you everything you need to know. Studio Zero took many of the overarching ideas from the school-based series and transplanted them into a fantasy world that brims with imagination, while staying close enough to our world to ensure that its questions about race, racism, religious fanaticism and democracy hit home every single time.</p>
<p>The grand narrative sees you take the reins following the king’s death, and with his only heir cursed into incapacity, the violent and power-hungry Louis attempts to take control. However, the king foresaw the power vacuum that he’d leave. Instead, he paved the way for a magically-infused election, where the most popular person in the kingdom would become king. You’re thrust into the midst of this, setting out to right wrongs, challenge preconceptions, and build a following, with both the vibrant and personable characters you help on your way, and the populace at large.</p>
<p>Metaphor: Refantazio is constantly surprising, with many moments that will shock and challenge you, all the while pushing you ever forward towards glory and power that you never asked for. To say too much more would ruin some of the game’s best moments, but rest assured, this is by far the most powerful, emotional and exquisitely-crafted story of the year.</p>

<h2>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth – Runner-up</h2>
<p>We all know that feeling where something incredible comes to an end, and you see the next act take to the stage. “Oh god,” you think.”How are they going to follow that?” Cast your mind back a few years and you’ll remember thinking the same after FF7 Remake came to a close.&nbsp;Little did we know that when Rebirth took the stage it would knock our expectations out of the park.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/">FF7 Rebirth</a> follows Cloud and friends as they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0MvE3Q43Gs">escape to the country</a>, desperately seeking to defy the winds of fate and prevent what we all know is coming. There is a lot of ground that we know it has to cover, and a lot of expectations that the devs know they have to meet. The devs, too, must have wondered how they were going to follow that.</p>
<p>If they did, it never shows. We’re been gifted a beautifully paced game, with an expanded (and heavily tweaked) version of the story we all know and love. The narrative additions all add a welcome dimension and depth to the characters we grew up admiring. Though it is effectively a new story, it remains faithful in all the ways that matter.</p>
<p>Cast any fears for Icarus aside: Rebirth is a genuine delight.</p>
<p><em>–&nbsp;Nic B</em></p>
<h2>Threshold – Runner-up</h2>
<p>Some games impress with their epic narratives spanning dozens of hours and a myriad of locations and characters. Others convey their story through casting fantastic voice actors to lend gravitas to emotional and exciting dialogue. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/26/threshold-review/">Threshold</a>, on the other hand, takes us back to basics, taking place as it does in a single small environment and with the minimal amount of characters. What it does offer, however, is a focused and psychologically fascinating narrative that unpacks itself through a series of unanswered questions and mysteries.</p>
<p>You find yourself manning a remote outpost with the responsibility of blowing a whistle to ensure that a huge train runs on time. Where are you? Why are you there? What is the train carrying? Where is it going? All of these questions and more occupy your mind as you carry out the basic duties of your job but things are not as simple as they seem. You have to bite into glass canisters of oxygen to survive as the air is so thin so the longer you go the more bloody the onscreen lips indicator gets. You find mysterious notes from a former worker hidden around the station. And as the game progresses some of the answers to your questions are revealed but in a way that only leads to more questions.</p>
<p>While a relatively short and focused experience, the questions raised and the narrative buildup in Threshold will stay with me for a long time as it’s a game that uses the interactivity of the form to tell a unique story.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov%E2%80%99s-winter-twitch-drops-event-starts-december-30.1068003/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-winter-twitch-drops-2024/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlestate Games has revealed that Escape from Tarkov’s Winter Twitch Drops campaign will start on December 30, all but confirming that the wipe will take place a couple of days before. It’s a tradition at this point – these campaigns always start a day or two after the game has undergone a platform-wide reset known as a ‘wipe’.</p>



<p>This wipe will be accompanied by the 0.16 update, a supersized overhaul that promises to introduce a slew of new weapons, balances, and a rework of Customs, one of the game’s fan-favourite maps.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-with-the-wipe-comes-a-drop">With The Wipe Comes a Drop</h2>



<p>On the Escape from Tarkov website, it was revealed that the Winter Drops campaign will run from December 30 to January 4, and then the Escape from Tarkov Arena drops campaign from January 4 to January 8.</p>



<p>The developer advised streamers <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/event/wintertwitchdropsevent?utm_source=x_post&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=winter_drops_24-25&amp;utm_term=link_1&amp;utm_content=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to enrol if they want to participate</a> in the campaign, with content creators being assigned time slots based on their availability. It’s easy to envision some of the biggest streamers who’ll get a spot in the Winter Drops campaign – this is the time of the year when they make the most money.</p>



<p>The likes of Landmark, Pestily, WillerZ, Glorious, StankRat, Gingy, and Trey will likely all be doing round-the-clock Tarkov streams in support of the wipe and the Twitch Drops campaign.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been confirmed what rewards viewers will receive, but last year, users had to rack up dozens of watch hours to unlock random gift drops in Escape from Tarkov. Some viewers unlocked thousands of rounds of ammunition, while others got packs of noodles or something to that effect.</p>



<p>Battlestate wrote on social media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With the approach of the New Year holidays, one of the most anticipated events of the year for our community is kicking off — the annual Twitch Drops Event. This is a great opportunity to receive in-game gifts and enjoy the festive season.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>2024 was a pretty damn good year for fans of shooter games. Not the best we can recall, granted, especially with the absence of big IPs like Halo and Battlefield, but it still offered lots of fun through various triple-A titles that mostly delivered on their promise, arguably <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2023-solid-transitory-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassing 2023</a> when it comes to this genre's output.</p>
<p>All the titles we picked (except STALKER 2) offer some kind of online feature, which isn't surprising given how shooter games and multiplayer go hand in hand. Most of them are also set in science fiction/post-apocalyptic worlds, with the exception of Call of Duty. Without further ado, here's our shortlist of the best five shooters released in 2024, ordered by release date. Stay tuned for all the other genres, as usual.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/helldivers-2-art-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Helldivers II (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/helldivers-2-not-enough-patriotism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6/10</a>)</h2>
<p>The year of shooter games fans started with a bang thanks to Arrowhead's Helldivers II. Granted, the game didn't get a high score at launch on Wccftech from reviewer Ule Lopez, mostly due to technical issues. However, Helldivers II was a smash hit when it came to sales. By May, it had <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> 12 million copies sold across PC and PlayStation 5, becoming the fastest-selling game Sony has ever published. It might have very well singlehandedly persuaded Sony to always ship live service games day and date on PC, too.</p>
<p>The active user base fluctuated widely throughout 2024, depending on the patches, although an update in September <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-patch-released-playercount-triples-as-a-result/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brought</a> a resurgence of activity. Helldivers II also recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-wins-goty-at-tiga-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won</a> Game of the Year at the TIGA Awards.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Warhammer-40000-Space-Marine-2-Review-03-Image-4.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7/10</a>)</h2>
<p>Saber Interactive's Space Marine 2 is another game that didn't review so well on Wccftech, getting just a seven out of ten from reviewer Chris Wray. However, it was a smash hit among fans. Just one day after the official launch, the game had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-already-sold-two-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> two million units. Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/space-marine-2-is-the-2nd-best-selling-game-of-2024-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">performed</a> especially well in Europe, where it was the second best-selling new launch of the year (before the release of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6). By late November, Space Marine 2 had <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-5-million-units-will-get-dlss-fsr-frame-generation-with-next-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broken</a> through the five-million milestone. With a fresh update just <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-obelisk-update-adds-dlss-3-fsr-3-and-much-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> and many more to come (including planned DLCs), this long-awaited third-person shooter sequel will surely entertain fans well beyond 2024.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFcallofdutyblackops66.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raining-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8.8/10</a>)</h2>
<p>The Call of Duty franchise wasn't in a great state following the releases of Modern Warfare II and III. Neither of the games released in 2022 and 2023 really hit the mark among the Call of Duty community, but this year, Treyarch restored CoD to the throne of first-person shooter games with Black Ops 6. In Wccftech's review, Kai Tatsumoto wrote:</p>
<p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 represents a proper return to form, with Treyarch taking the helm in development once more. This is probably as definitive a Call of Duty title has been in years, with a package that executes well across all three pillars of Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies. While the narrative doesn’t hold up to the spy thriller premise in the lead-up to launch, the online package rounds out the experience well.</em></p>
<p>Activision and Microsoft have <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-the-biggest-ever-says-activision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boasted</a> that it is the biggest Call of Duty game ever in terms of total players, hours played, and matches, though that was kind of a given with its availability through Game Pass.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/stalker-2-art-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8/10</a>)</h2>
<p>The only title on this shooter games list focused solely on single-player, STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl carried the massive hype inevitably attached to its long and troubled development history. Thankfully, Ukrainian developer GSC Game World shipped a game that, despite its bugs and shortcomings, largely maintained its promise of providing a completely unique experience. Here's an excerpt from my review:</p>
<p><em>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is a worthy successor of the original in every regard, good and bad. The vision is the same: an uncompromising game that will often frustrate you, but also offers a unique experience that can hardly be found anywhere else. It's the classic example where the total is more than the mere sum of its parts. Bugs and balance issues are still very much an issue, but they shouldn't stand in your way of playing, especially if you're willing to wait a while for developers and modders to fix them.</em></p>
<p>The team is already preparing a lot of fixes and improvements, and they still have to release the mod tools, the multiplayer, and DLCs.</p>

<h2>Marvel Rivals</h2>
<p>Hero shooter games haven't exactly thrived lately. Concord was arguably one of the year's biggest flops, being <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-offline-september-6th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed</a> just two weeks after its launch, Sony having reportedly spent a $400 million budget for nothing. Overwatch 2 isn't super healthy, either, at least compared to the original.</p>
<p>In this context, Marvel Rivals from NetEase Games looked like it might struggle, especially as it appeared very much like a <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-is-an-overwatch-like-6v6-pvp-third-person-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clone of Blizzard's game</a> ahead of launch. The Marvel franchise also didn't help big triple-A releases such as Marvel's Avengers and Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy.</p>
<p>However, Rivals defied expectations and gained the appreciation of many gamers, <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-launches-with-a-bang-thanks-to-444k-concurrent-users-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> and elsewhere.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-review-cult-of-personality<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“Legacy” is going to be the word of the day here. <em>Soul Reaver</em>, one of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/6-square-enix-sold-ips-we-want-embracer" rel="nofollow">the cult-iest of cult classics</a>, revered by many for its forward-thinking blend of narrative and gameplay, and a title that – while I didn’t personally play it at release – is one I’m assured was the talk of the town at release. 25 years on, Aspyr have released a fresh modern remaster of the 2 <em>Soul Reaver</em> games, with the support of Crystal Dynamics.</p>

<p>Similar to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tomb-raider-1-3-remastered" rel="nofollow"><em>Tomb Raider I-III Remastered</em></a> collection released earlier in 2024, <em>Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered</em> is here to celebrate the <em>Legacy of Kain</em> series. Alongside the fresh updates to gameplay and graphics, you also have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/soul-reaver-remasters-leaked-psn" rel="nofollow">a library of fan celebration and developer collaboration</a>, including concept art and fan art of <em>Soul Reaver</em> and its characters, the script for both games, and a litany of cut content in the form of lost levels.</p>

<p>Famously developed during a tumultuous back-and-forth between Crystal Dynamics, and <em>Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen </em>developer Silicon Knights, <em>Soul Reaver</em> tells the story of Raziel, a vampire formerly of Kain’s lieutenants. After he is seemingly killed by Kain, The Elder God resurrects Raziel, tasking him with the execution of Kain, and the assassination of Raziels former comrades. This eventually leads to an uneasy alliance with Moebius, the time-manipulating guardian who features prominently in the series.</p>



<p>It’s a very straightforward story when it comes down to brass tacks, especially since both games are doing different things with the material. In <em>Soul Reaver 1</em>, Raziel’s commentary, along with the general direction of the narrative and its groundbreaking cutscenes, is made to establish an arc and vengefully charged story beats. In <em>Soul Reaver 2</em> however, the lines blur as a timeline-hopping odyssey told almost entirely from Raziel’s perspective, with internalization constantly spewing out.</p>

<p>What’s interesting is how both games differentiate from each other, and how both games utilize what’s already been established. Part of it comes down to the growth of Raziel as a character, as <em>Soul Reaver 1</em> is more about puzzling and adventuring, but another larger chunk just comes from apprehension regarding how the mechanics are implemented. Whatever the case, the problem largely revolves around combat.</p>

<p>In <em>Soul Reaver 1</em>, combat is an arbitrary gimmick revolving around the “true death” of your vampire adversaries. It’s not just that you slash ‘em to death, but you also have to throw them into direct light, an open fire, or maybe just a stake through the heart. Once that’s done, however, you also have to absorb their soul so they simply don’t just respawn given time. Mind you, all of this is absolved once you acquire the titular Soul Reaver.</p>



<p>An energy blade with nearly limitless easy-killing potential, it gets some tweaks in <em>Soul Reaver 2</em> through the implementation of a risk/reward system. Use it too much and it starts to damage Raziel, which makes sense, and forces you to deal with what is easily some of the worst combat ever conceived for a game of this type. There’s no feedback, there’s no true connection, the hitboxes are way too wide, and Raziel’s movement doesn’t account for much survivability, unless you simply swing without locking on. What replaces strategy is sheer tomfoolery and button-mashing.</p>

<p>As a remastering effort, Aspyr has gone through the usual motions when it comes to retaining the source material’s energy. You can switch between the original and remastered graphics on the fly, and the first thing you’ll discover is that the remastered fidelity can be astonishingly toothless. There are some shining moments, like the upgraded designs of Melchiah and Zephon, which add a lot more menace and fear than previously enforced by their 1999 counterparts.</p>

<p>A lot of the time, however, you are merely just staring at slightly refreshed textures, with <em>Soul Reaver 1</em> benefitting, and <em>Soul Reaver 2</em> suffering from it. Both games utilize a dual-world mechanic in the form of Raziel being able to switch between the Material World, and the Spectral Plane, with more emphasis placed on it in <em>Soul Reaver 1</em>. The way the Spectral Plane twists and contorts is shown off brilliantly in its remastered form, as the Eldritch scrawlings are much more detailed, and intimidating.</p>



<p>The Spectral Plane doesn’t get as much airtime in <em>Soul Reaver 2</em>, potentially due to its placeholder as a glorified extra-life depository, given its larger focus on danger. Still, a lot of the graphic upgrades in <em>2</em> tend to muddy up the true direction and atmosphere of the game, which is still phenomenal. The amount of times you’ll simply stop to sink into the fauna, the fire, the cold, and the song is ridiculous, a true testament to how much visual design and audio design are as much of a game as the gameplay itself.</p>

<p>This is where <em>Soul Reaver</em> shines, not in its gameplay necessarily, but in the ease with which Crystal Dynamics were able to create a world, just as true as when it was proclaimed 25 years ago. That’s why it breaks my heart to find that <em>Soul Reaver 2</em> does nothing with it, and that’s largely down to Raziel as a character. Whereas in <em>1</em>, he’s a frightened little imp powered solely by rage and the heartbreak he suffers when venturing through the new world, <em>2</em> turns him into a cocky counterpart, more akin to Sonic The Hedgehog than a brooding anti-hero.</p>

<p><em>Soul Reaver 2</em> is a rare breed of story, where the main character has main character syndrome. The number of times Raziel will walk into a cutscene with his chest puffed out, bragging that he’s finally figured it out, only to see that one of his former handlers or adversaries has to calmly explain the next step. It’s a fascinating showcase of a simpering idiot, who previously sought to learn the proper precautions, and not once is he proven to be the architect. Does Raziel know that? No! Never! But he has a feeling!</p>



<p>With however many issues this remaster has caused to break out of the ground, I feel like this was to be expected. When conversing with a friend, I mentioned how I was playing the remaster, and he was filled with glee at the memories this news brought forth, regaling about how he and his friends all fell in love with the game when it came out, and how they all figured out the puzzles. When I mentioned that I wasn’t having fun with it, his response was, verbatim:</p>

<p>“Oh, God yeah, I wouldn’t play it now, it’s obviously not the same.”</p>



<p>Maybe I shouldn’t be surprised that so much of <em>Soul Reaver</em>’s magic has ironically been lost to time. The combat is a button-mashing mess with no strategy, and <em>Soul Reaver 2</em> tends to focus on the less interesting parts of the world. That being said, for brief moments, <em>Soul Reaver</em> shows timeless offerings in the form of what it was: A world of intricacies, and history, and even in its infamously cut-down state, it manages to showcase it more than many of its contemporaries, even now, and for that? I'm grateful.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/fairy-tail-2-interview-with-original-creator-and-producer-of-the-sequel<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fairy-tail-2">Fairy Tail 2</a>, the PlayStation 5／PlayStation 4／Nintendo Switch／Steam title which allows players to relive the climax of the highly popular magical battle fantasy series Fairy Tail, was released on December 13, 2024 (December 12 in Japan and Asia). To commemorate the release, we conducted a special interview with Hiro Mashima, the creator of the original Fairy Tail series, and Hiroshi Kataoka, the producer of the game Fairy Tail 2!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>Thank you both for taking time out of your busy schedules to join us today! As Fairy Tail 2 was released on the 12th (in Japan and Asia), to begin with, could you tell us about how this title began – how it was proposed (by Koei Tecmo) to Mashima-sensei?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka: </strong>Four years ago in 2020 we released the first Fairy Tail game, but it only covered up until the Tartaros Arc. The final chapter, the Alvarez Empire Arc, remained as pivotal and unfinished ‘homework’ from the previous game, and we felt that the most exciting part absolutely had to be adapted, but it took us a lot of time to think about the best way to adapt it into a game. Once we had more or less settled on the content that we thought would work, we presented our proposal of the game outline which included both the main story and an original storyline. How did you feel when you first saw it, Mashima-sensei?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> When I saw the proposal this time, while it was an RPG, there were action game-like elements which made me very happy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> This time there can be a chain of combos in battles, so the way it plays is close to an action game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> Yes, the combat system has changed from the previous game! I think it’s really cool.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka: </strong>I think that one of the strengths of RPGs is being able to take the time to showcase grand, elaborate moves. However, since this game incorporates action-like elements and features fast-paced battles, we faced many challenges in enhancing the visual impact of linking combos without disrupting the gameplay flow. We were able receive permission to create shorter versions of consecutive casting sequences of the same magic spells, which I think resulted in it coming together nicely. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fairy Tail 2 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> As you become a lot stronger on the field, you can instantly knock out enemies with a single hit, defeat 10 or more enemies with special moves and more, so I think the action-like feel has increased significantly, which has in turn really increased the gameplay feel as a Fairy Tail game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei: </strong>Also, I thought the map was great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> It really is vast. When I played it myself and arrived at Hargeon, seeing the port spread out before me was really moving.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> Ooh! I’m looking forward to that!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>When making the fields, did the development team focus on any specific points?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> In this game, the reason we made the world map seamless was to faithfully recreate the situation from the original where the Alvarez Empire is attacking from all sides, enhancing immersion and conveying a sense of journey. In the early stages, players primarily explore the map following the story, but in the later stages, the explorable area expands significantly, offering a strong sense of adventure, so I hope players will try running through the field.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei: </strong>I found it really fun to actually be able to walk around this setting of the Kingdom of Fiore. The placement of the towns are faithfully recreated as they would be in the original series. I hope fans of the series will look forward to that aspect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> Additionally, in this game as players journey through the open field, they will see a lot of interactions among characters so I hope players will enjoy that as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>Can you tell us what kind of interactions we can see?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> Since the open field is quite large, just walking around can be a bit boring so we added conversations. Since exploration is done in a party, we included various dialogues that capture the essence of the Fairy Tail guild members. Additionally, for those playing a Fairy Tail game for the first time, we made sure that these conversations can help them understand the relationships between the characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> For example, they even alert you with lines like "I smell treasure" when there's a treasure chest nearby or suggest "Let's take a break" when there's a place to rest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> Wow, that's amazing! It really gives the feeling of traveling with companions, making the journey a lot of fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> For the previous game, you often mentioned wanting a sense of journey, so we were meticulous in capturing that feeling this time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> Also, Plue is hidden throughout the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> “Find Plue,” right!?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> I hope players will try to find him by relying on hearing his voice or from hint dialogues from companions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>We spoke about how the battle system had changed, how about the graphics?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka: </strong>It's been four years since the previous game, so I think the quality of the models and motions have significantly improved! I’d have to say we put the most effort into the facial expressions. While we also worked hard on this in the previous game, the dev team worked hard to make even more variations of facial expressions, so I think we’ve been able to have each character display an expression that best matches the situation for many scenes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei: </strong>The quality is incredibly high, and I was really pleased!　Aside from the models, I think they’re called stills? The single illustrations were all so impressive I’ve lost a bit of confidence (laughs). There was an illustration of Natsu and Zeref facing each other and it had the same impact as the drawings I did back then. Even now, I still think it might’ve been good to use as the box art.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> When I shared that story with the person responsible for it, they were extremely thrilled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>I'd like to ask about the game's story as well. In this installment, players can relive the Alvarez Empire Arc, which is the climax of Fairy Tail. Were there any challenges in developing the story portion of the game?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka: </strong>The original series featured many one-on-one battles, but for this game we wanted to create Fairy Tail vs. Alvarez Empire team battles, so we consulted on making small adjustments to the order of battles and development of the story. And we received a lot of advice and suggestions for adjustments to the story development and dialogue to make it even better, so I believe we achieved a very smooth and coherent gameplay experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>By the way, do you, Kataoka-san and Mashima-sensei, have any favorite characters or scenes from the Alvarez Empire Arc?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> The whirlwind of developments in the Alvarez Empire Arc that included the unraveling of mysteries and the resolution of plot twists are what I vividly remember being amazed at every week when it aired. There are so many iconic scenes and lines, but for me, the moment when Erza suddenly stops Natsu and Gray really struck me and that scene is etched in my memory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> Thank you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> For me, I think it would be August. I think that things that were added to the setting later, including the foreshadowing of the battle with August, worked well and it’s a part that I really like. Even if the entire story isn't included, I want the battle itself to be exciting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka: </strong>We've made sure to faithfully recreate the story, and I think the final scene turned out really well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> I'm looking forward to that!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> So you came up with August’s setting later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> I often come up with ideas later on. Of course, even when I say "later," it's usually a few episodes before it's reflected into the story. In the case of August, it worked particularly well. I’ve heard many people say they were completely fooled by it. “It wasn’t Larcade, it was you!" (laughs)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> I was completely fooled as well. (Laughs)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei: </strong>August was a very strong character in the original series, so I hope the battle with August is as challenging in the game as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> Yes, he's an incredibly strong character because he can copy magic. Even when reading the original manga, I wondered who would be stronger if he fought Zeref. And of course, he's quite powerful in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei: </strong>It would be a problem if he's too strong, though (laughs).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka: </strong>Otherwise, players might not be able to finish the game (laughs). We've made him quite strong as the final buildup before the battle with Zeref.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> One thing I’d personally like to ask is how long ago did you decide on the content of the final chapter?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> I was quite torn until the end about whether Zeref or Acnologia would be last. Because I expanded the story so much, there were many things that were added later. For example, there's a character named Dimaria who can stop time, and she was so powerful that I couldn't figure out how she could be defeated, so the sudden appearance of "that character" was an idea I came up with afterward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> Oh, really!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> It felt like live storytelling! There are a lot of instances where it would have been better without certain settings... While I have repeated some of these regrets, it’s fun to create a story as you go along!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> And was there any particular reason behind having 12 members in the Spriggan 12?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> Initially, I decided on 12 companion characters who would play active roles. From there, I then decided that each of them would defeat one of the 12 enemy characters. However, Erza ended up defeating two of them. (laughs)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> That’s true. (laughs)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> In games, it's usually something like ‘Four Heavenly Kings,’ but here we have 12. (laughs)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> As the ones making it, I honestly contemplated, "12, huh..." (laughs)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> I imagine creating the models must have been a lot of work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka</strong>: But I was determined to make sure that fighting all members of the "Spriggan 12" would definitely happen, so I told the development team from the start, "Fight all of the Spriggan 12! This is a must!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei</strong>: That's wonderful to hear. I'm looking forward to it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: In addition to reliving the original story, this game also includes an original storyline. How did the development of the original story come about?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> From the moment we first proposed the game, we said that we wanted to include an original storyline. And actually Mashima-sensei requested that the original story be very well-developed, so we put a lot of effort into it. For the final boss of the original story, our idea of battling a particular character at the very end was the only part proposed from the very beginning.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> I thought all the original scenarios were great. I think it’s clear that a lot of hard work has been put into them!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka: </strong>Thank you. Since the main story is quite serious as it is the final chapter, we wanted something to bring out the lighthearted and lively feel typical of Fairy Tail that would be more casual to play. We even wondered if we might get in trouble for going overboard... (laughs)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> It wasn’t a problem at all! (Laughs) It was fun!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka: </strong>That’s good to hear. I’m really happy you enjoyed it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Speaking of original content for the game, in the Digital Deluxe edition, there’s an in-game feature called Atelier Lucy. Could you let us know more about this?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> After the previous game, Mashima-sensei mentioned on X that “it would be nice to have something like an Atelier Lucy," and that’s where the idea began. The IP producer of the Atelier series (Junzo) Hosoi also welcomed the idea, so we proposed it, received approval and made it happen. Since matching the synthesis system in the more recent Atelier series would make it a bit too challenging to play, we’ve put in a simple system, and I believe it’s very fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> That's really great. I also love the Atelier series, so even though what you made this time is a parody, it doesn't feel out of place at all. If there's a sequel, I'd love for it to be fully developed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Would it be good to even have a collaboration title like 'Atelier Fairy Tail'?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> Yes, I’d like that to happen someday (laughs).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> Actually, we’ve included familiar elements from the Atelier series, like Barrel!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> I was really happy when I discovered that. There were quite a few character variations too!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> This game includes also includes a wealth of DLC such as outfits and an additional scenario. Were there any particular aspects you focused on in creating these?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> For the DLC outfits of playable characters, we wanted to create a sense of togetherness, so we included outfits from the 8-Island restaurant where they worked in the original series, formal wear with a wedding motif, and school uniforms to evoke an image of school life. As for the additional scenario, I personally really liked the Battle of Fairy Tail episode, so I thought of combining it with a hot springs theme.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> Every time new outfits were sent over, I would say, "that’s awesome!" I thought it was fantastic that each character had their own unique outfit rather than everyone wearing the same thing. It was incredibly creative and impressive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> There are even characters wearing glasses with the school uniforms. (laughs)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei: </strong>The designs are truly amazing! I want everyone to see them all!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka: </strong>We're also considering some absurd battles in the Arena, like fighting Zeref, August, and Larcade simultaneously. Imagine facing six members of the Spriggan 12 at once. (laughs)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> Can you even beat that? (laughs)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka:</strong> That's where players will need to level up their characters and hone their skills. (laughs)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei:</strong> That sounds exciting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> To close, could you share a message for those eagerly anticipating the release?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kataoka: </strong>We've kept you waiting a long time since the previous game, but the release is finally here. Our entire team has poured their love for Fairy Tail into this project and with the cooperation of Mashima-sensei and everyone at Kodansha we are finally at completion. We've created something truly enjoyable in of course not only the story, but the gameplay too, so I hope you'll give it a try.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mashima-sensei</strong>: I truly think this work is filled with love for Fairy Tail, and I'm really looking forward to playing it myself, so I hope everyone will look forward to it too.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

In recent years, our efforts to recognize the best video games of the past 12 months always come with a caveat: Yes, great games undeniably come out, but things are bad for the industry. The world makes another trip around the sun and things only seem to get more dire and precarious for people who make the video games we know and love. Workers are laid off at an unsustainable frequency, if their studios and projects aren’t shut down entirely. All that we have left to celebrate is the work that talented developers still manage to create in the midst of all this instability, and that’s what we’re here to do. It’s remarkable that even under such circumstances, so many games worth celebrating are still being released, and they deserve to be heralded with as much enthusiasm as ever, if not more. It’s games like these that keep reminding us of how vital, relevant, and extraordinary this medium can be, even if some of the people running the industry are making it so much harder for such games to be made.</p><p>Here’s how we arrived at this ranking: Each member of the <em>Kotaku </em>staff submitted a top ten list, with each game being allotted a point value depending on where it was placed. If someone ranked a game as their favorite of the year, it would receive 10 points, with the second-place game receiving nine, the third getting eight, and so on. Once the results of those ballots were tallied, there was some deliberation about the presence and placement of a few games, and in the end, we landed here. Without further ado, here are <em>Kotaku</em>’s top 15 games of 2024.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a5211c87e43b01f3e0a7380473e15549" data-recommend-id="image://a5211c87e43b01f3e0a7380473e15549" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iris holds a bloody knife at someone off-screen while saying &quot;Did I not give you life?&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Iris holds a bloody knife at someone off-screen while saying &quot;Did I not give you life?&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sunset Visitor</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a5211c87e43b01f3e0a7380473e15549" data-recommend-id="image://a5211c87e43b01f3e0a7380473e15549" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iris holds a bloody knife at someone off-screen while saying &quot;Did I not give you life?&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/1000xresist-indie-narrative-time-travel-impressions-1851466481&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/1000xresist-indie-narrative-time-travel-impressions-1851466481" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody"><em>1000xRESIST</em></a></span><em> </em>is so dense and rich in themes that trying to sum it all up here in a few paragraphs feels like a disservice to just how much developer Sunset Visitor’s narrative adventure explores in its dozen or so hours. What starts off as a sci-fi exploration of identity in a society made up entirely of clones ends up interrogating so many ideas that its thesis could be articulated in as many ways as its diverging clones view the world. Despite everything it explores, <em>1000xRESIST</em> feels singular in its vision, building upon its most basic ideas to deliver anime-inspired melodrama that leads to out-of-this-world conclusions grounded in the human desire for connection.</p><p>So much of <em>1000xRESIST</em> is depicted through the memories of one woman, with her clones viewing and interpreting it all through their own eyes. Even then, however, they are limited by her perspective. <em>1000xRESIST</em> ends on a note that suggests history can be defined by the victors in any conflict, no matter how just one’s cause might be. Its final moments ask you to remember what it means to hold that power and decide what to do with it. As much as <em>1000xRESIST </em>juggles, it’s all in service of making you understand the position you’re put in during that final segment. You can resist something a thousand times over and not know what to do when you’ve finally won. <em>1000xRESIST</em>’s ability to concisely reach that conclusion is a testament to what Sunset Visitor achieved. Lesser games would have caved under the weight of communicating so much narrative and thematic depth in such a short experience. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="117ae6ed7537678268240ff2980bf2c5" data-recommend-id="image://117ae6ed7537678268240ff2980bf2c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1919" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man whose burnt face is covered in bandages looks at the screen as an emergency screen flashes in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man whose burnt face is covered in bandages looks at the screen as an emergency screen flashes in the background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wrong Organ</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="117ae6ed7537678268240ff2980bf2c5" data-recommend-id="image://117ae6ed7537678268240ff2980bf2c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1919" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man whose burnt face is covered in bandages looks at the screen as an emergency screen flashes in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Wrong Organ’s psychological horror game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mouthwashing-steam-pc-indie-psychological-horror-1851690195&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mouthwashing-steam-pc-indie-psychological-horror-1851690195"><em>Mouthwashing</em></a></span> excels at packing heaps of mental anguish into a small space without once losing its grip on the point it’s trying to make.

But it also navigates perfectly innocent and silly stuff, like a first date gone wrong, the absurdity of the gig economy, and being inebriated with friends.</p><p><em>Infinite Wealth</em> is also a hell of a good RPG. Combat in particular is excellent, fusing turn-based actions with real-time positioning that allows you to do things like line up attacks and send enemies flying into one another. The game also handles its side content particularly well, with objectives and activities that are more than happy to get out of the way of the main story if you’re not interested in tackling them. But if you do dive in, you’ll find some wildly satisfying and engaging elements to engage with, such as an entire resort management sim, a <em>Pokémon</em>-like collect-and-battle mini-game, and more.</p><p>As a newcomer to the <em>Yakuza</em> series, I was also delighted to find the story very approachable. On occasion, the game would reference previous events in the series that’d largely go over my head, but on the whole, the game was plenty capable of delivering a coherent, if remarkably silly, tale of ex-gangsters trying to survive normal life without getting sucked back into the hell of it all. — Claire Jackson</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="730b31dc405adffad5753b9a7a65a18e" data-recommend-id="image://730b31dc405adffad5753b9a7a65a18e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="James looks up at something off-screen in a dark room." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="James looks up at something off-screen in a dark room." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="730b31dc405adffad5753b9a7a65a18e" data-recommend-id="image://730b31dc405adffad5753b9a7a65a18e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="James looks up at something off-screen in a dark room." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you had a time machine and warped back to 2022 and told me that the Bloober-developed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-review-ps5-pc-horror-2024-1851665482&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-review-ps5-pc-horror-2024-1851665482"><em>Silent Hill 2</em></a></span><em> </em>remake would be not only good, but one of the best games of the year upon its release, I’d laugh.

Many of the game’s moments can be examined from multiple angles, including the conclusion, which throws many of <em>Hellblade 2</em>’s fantastical elements into a contemplative place of uncertainty. What even <em>is </em>real? What are the heroic deeds on display in this game? Is it a vanquishing of giants? Or is it something deeper, more internal? <em>Hellblade 2</em> invites this kind of thought.</p><p>And while the first game was rightly celebrated for its unique depiction of mental illness through the use of binaural audio which brought the voices in Senua’s mind to life (making headphones for it and this sequel a must), I found that this game takes that aspect further, with the voices in Senua’s mind persistently raising doubts in ways that really get inside your head. As someone who struggles daily with complex anxieties and traumas, I found <em>Hellblade 2 </em>deeply relatable. Though I don’t experience the same kinds of mental illnesses Senua does, the game accurately gives voice to what it’s like to wrestle with your own thoughts in complex, obsessive ways.</p><p>It may have a short runtime, and it might have made some sacrifices to the gameplay that made its predecessor so beloved, but taken on its own terms, <em>Hellblade 2</em> is a memorable and powerful experience. — Claire Jackson</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a00a13b0ace77b0c88d5da819461f60f" data-recommend-id="image://a00a13b0ace77b0c88d5da819461f60f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sephiroth and Cloud stand alongside SOLDIER forces in a dark, rainy area." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sephiroth and Cloud stand alongside SOLDIER forces in a dark, rainy area." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a00a13b0ace77b0c88d5da819461f60f" data-recommend-id="image://a00a13b0ace77b0c88d5da819461f60f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sephiroth and Cloud stand alongside SOLDIER forces in a dark, rainy area." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129"><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></a></span> is like a 17th-century Baroque painting: grand, ornate, ostentatious, and confounding.

Some games are greater than the sum of their parts. <em>FFVII Rebirth</em>’s parts are greater than the sum of most other games. It’s not quite a faithful, one-to-one remake of the middle section of the original game, nor is it a risky and bold departure. Rather, it’s a maximalist walking tour through a rich sci-fi fantasy world, blown up in evocative, beautiful, and occasionally heart-wrenching detail.</p><p>The card-based minigame Queen’s Blood is amazing. The flow of combat and the incredible camera work, especially during summons, represent the height of interactive spectacle. I can almost forgive the Cait Sith Shinra Mansion crate sequence because of Chocobo Racing, the Junon parade, the Gold Saucer VR play, and every other mini-game/ quick-time event hybrid that didn’t suck. But where <em>FFVII Rebirth</em> excels most is in giving timeless video game avatars the space to grow into regular people and break out hearts all over again. — Ethan Gach</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fecfd06fbf48af183f600b14c98629cb" data-recommend-id="image://fecfd06fbf48af183f600b14c98629cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1914" data-height="1077" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The cast of different games from UFO 50 surround the logo against a red background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The cast of different games from UFO 50 surround the logo against a red background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mossmouth</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fecfd06fbf48af183f600b14c98629cb" data-recommend-id="image://fecfd06fbf48af183f600b14c98629cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1914" data-height="1077" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The cast of different games from UFO 50 surround the logo against a red background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>A staggering achievement and, for my money, the year’s most surprising, captivating, and incredible game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ufo-50-review-retro-games-steam-1851649865&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ufo-50-review-retro-games-steam-1851649865"><em>UFO 50</em></a></span><em> </em>is actually a collection of 50 games, all released in the 1980s by developer UFOSoft. The thing is, however, that UFOSoft never actually existed. Instead, these are new games, a wonderful smorgasbord of games in different genres—role-playing games, platformers, side-scrolling action games, games in which you explore interesting worlds and find nifty upgrades, and more.</p><p>Diving into <em>UFO 50 </em>is a wonderfully stimulating and sometimes bracing experience: you come across both the intimately familiar and the unfamiliar, games that require you to take a step back and grapple with their various elements as you come to grips with them. Some players have found this frustrating, or even called it evidence of bad game design. I couldn’t disagree more. Perhaps it’s that I’m old enough to remember the games of the 1980s vividly myself, and to recall how, in that era, running up against mechanics or systems you didn’t immediately understand was commonplace. For me, this process is often part of the fun; it feels like a real process of discovery, tinkering with a game until just how it works and what it’s asking of you becomes clear. It’s a kind of discovery that’s become quite rare in games today, but <em>UFO 50 </em>embraces it.</p><p>Of course, that wouldn’t matter much if the games in <em>UFO 50 </em>weren’t good enough to make all that experimentation worth it, but they are. Particular favorites of mine include <em>Grimstone</em>, a JRPG with an Old West-themed setting; <em>Valbrace</em>, a first-person dungeon-crawling RPG that switches to third-person action for combat; and <em>Barbuta</em>, UFOSoft’s “first” game, a slow-paced, mysterious adventure ostensibly from the early 80s. Each new discovery in <em>Barbuta </em>was a wonderful revelation, and eventually completing it (without looking up hints on the internet) was my most rewarding gaming achievement of the year. Alongside those, I also adored some of <em>UFO 50</em>’s breeziest and most accessible action games: <em>Cyber Owls </em>fuses the thematic zaniness of games like <em>Battletoads</em> to an assortment of gameplay types, from top-down, <em>Metal Gear</em>-esque infiltration to <em>Bad Dudes</em>-style side-scrolling punch’ em up; and <em>Seaside Drive </em>bathes you in glorious, summery vibes as you shoot down everything from attack helicopters to giant, flying wizard-sharks while speeding down a coastal road in a red sports car. <em>UFO 50 </em>is a thrilling reminder of how varied and creative video games can be, and it’s the one game this year that, more than any other, reminded me why I love this medium so much. — Carolyn Petit</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="772cb70f8a31b29e16f74bbb00e59a6f" data-recommend-id="image://772cb70f8a31b29e16f74bbb00e59a6f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kay Vess walks toward a pair of Storm Troopers interrogating a civilian." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kay Vess walks toward a pair of Storm Troopers interrogating a civilian." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="772cb70f8a31b29e16f74bbb00e59a6f" data-recommend-id="image://772cb70f8a31b29e16f74bbb00e59a6f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kay Vess walks toward a pair of Storm Troopers interrogating a civilian." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>A key moment I remember distinctly in<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-review-size-how-big-hours-xbox-ps5-pc-1851631123&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-review-size-how-big-hours-xbox-ps5-pc-1851631123"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a></span><em> </em>was flying over to Tattooine, landing, and then walking into the famous cantina seen in the original<em> </em>1977 film. Moseying around its iconic bar was incredible. It’s something I’ve always wanted to do since seeing the original film as a kid. And then, I left the bar and kept walking out into the rest of the city. And then past the city. Into the dunes and rocky cliffs; areas never seen in any <em>Star Wars</em> movie or show before. That was maybe even more mind-blowing. Finally, I had a giant, photorealistic recreation of <em>Star Wars</em> and I was free to wander about it, discovering both iconic locations and spots never before seen. That’s when I knew <em>Outlaws</em> was one of my favorite games of 2024.</p><p>Sure, the game’s story is very<em> Star Wars</em>-y and I like it a lot. Yes, the gunplay feels wild and loose in a way that reminds me of the barely choreographed action of the first film. And of course, I adore Nix—your in-game pet. All of that stuff is great. But a lot of <em>Star Wars Outlaws </em>isn’t. The forced stealth sections, the space battles, the clunky speeder bike, and the janky open world.</p><p>But whatever, I don’t care about any of that stuff because I was able to mingle through a crowded market on Tatooine and grab some sci-fi street food at a nearby vendor, all while recognizable <em>Star Wars</em> aliens walked by me. <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> lets me truly immerse myself in a franchise I love so much, and that’s enough for me. — Zack Zwiezen</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a3d5c4a07aa23ee2f7ff3dc63978b250" data-recommend-id="image://a3d5c4a07aa23ee2f7ff3dc63978b250" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A comic-like collage depicts someone leaving a baby at a doorstep." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A comic-like collage depicts someone leaving a baby at a doorstep." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Furniture &amp; Mattress</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a3d5c4a07aa23ee2f7ff3dc63978b250" data-recommend-id="image://a3d5c4a07aa23ee2f7ff3dc63978b250" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A comic-like collage depicts someone leaving a baby at a doorstep." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Half the games on this list are giant releases that are trying to give you a little bit of everything. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/arranger-role-puzzling-adventure-review-puzzle-game-1851600269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/arranger-role-puzzling-adventure-review-puzzle-game-1851600269"><em>Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure</em></a></span><em> </em>is a bite-sized gem that repeatedly riffs on the same core concept, and doesn’t stick around long enough to trip over itself. Thinking back on developer <em>Furniture &amp; Mattress’</em> sublime puzzle-driven adventure, I think it’s been long enough now since my first playthrough that I no longer remember all the solutions to its environmental puzzles and complex boss fights, and it was so magical the first time through that I’m seriously contemplating a revisit.</p><p><em>Arranger</em> is the type of game that can be described with words but is best understood in motion. There’s something intuitive about how its grid-like paths shuffle around as you move through them. So many of its puzzles can be solved just by feeling your way through its world as it shifts beneath your feet. By the time you’ve spent just a few minutes with <em>Arranger</em>, you come to understand how to navigate its terrain and manipulate it to your needs. One sign of good puzzle design is that you don’t need a giant text bubble to explain it, and <em>Arranger </em>is at its best when it just lets you exist in its ever-moving space and figure it out. Doing so remains one of the most satisfying experiences in the genre, and if the clever puzzles weren’t enough, the heartfelt writing woven into every challenge keeps the world fresh beyond its moving floors. — Kenneth Shepard </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="41192b8691be6ea26a2af158d54b9a53" data-recommend-id="image://41192b8691be6ea26a2af158d54b9a53" data-format="jpg" data-width="1329" data-height="747" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A squad is surrounded by enemy alien forces." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A squad is surrounded by enemy alien forces." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Arrowhead Game Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="41192b8691be6ea26a2af158d54b9a53" data-recommend-id="image://41192b8691be6ea26a2af158d54b9a53" data-format="jpg" data-width="1329" data-height="747" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A squad is surrounded by enemy alien forces." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Some games are overwhelming in their scope and intricacy; others, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a></span>, are pretty straightforward but manage to get a ton of mileage out of doing a few things extremely well. Arrowhead Game Studios managed to take a very simple idea—shooting tons of aliens in open fields—and turn it into one of the most tense, funny, and memorable experiences of the year.

Not <em>Helldivers 2</em>.</p><p>While it’s stayed fresh for almost a full year now thanks to a scary cadence of new updates, patches, and immersive in-game storytelling and content drops, the core appeal is the same as it was on day one: drop down onto a planet, meet some randos, and run, laugh, die together. No other game in recent memory has made scraping through hell and high water feel quite so exhilarating, earned, and enduringly surprising no matter how many times you keep doing it. <em>Helldivers 2</em> is precise, punchy, and endlessly entertaining. It’s a masterclass in modern live-service gaming, but with all of the heart, artistry, and joy of an old-school arcade classic. — Ethan Gach</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="12ada48800ab199050afe7848481efaf" data-recommend-id="image://12ada48800ab199050afe7848481efaf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Heismay looking like a cool guy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Heismay looking like a cool guy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="12ada48800ab199050afe7848481efaf" data-recommend-id="image://12ada48800ab199050afe7848481efaf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Heismay looking like a cool guy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-review-pc-ps5-xbox-persona-atlus-1851665876&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-review-pc-ps5-xbox-persona-atlus-1851665876"><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a></span><em> </em>really couldn’t have come out in a more appropriate year.

There are fewer people to meet than in the studio’s other games, but <em>Metaphor</em> focuses its energies on establishing a strong thematic throughline that unites the characters, and Atlus achieves that here more effectively than it ever has in the past. Each conversation you have, mission you take on, and battle you face feed into that goal, and it makes every moment of <em>Metaphor </em>feel like it matters in a genre that has typically thrived in the meaningless mundane.</p><p>But its overtly political story of fighting prejudice and injustice isn’t just about being ideologically opposed to those ills. <em>Metaphor</em>’s greatest achievement is in how it manages to weave threads about political activism and fantasy-based escapism together to create a pointed story about how we retreat into fiction when shit gets hard. Even if it’s lacking in subtlety and has its moments of poor judgment (looking at you, Catherina subplot), we need stories like <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>when things are bad. We can’t retreat into fiction and call it activism, but we can use it as inspiration and encouragement for the real action we must take. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="626ae449663028840a290d83c01b7cd2" data-recommend-id="image://626ae449663028840a290d83c01b7cd2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Balatro table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Balatro table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->LocalThunk</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="626ae449663028840a290d83c01b7cd2" data-recommend-id="image://626ae449663028840a290d83c01b7cd2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Balatro table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Poker sims have been a stalwart of gaming for as long as I can remember, going back as far as those pixelated demos on magazine coverdiscs for <em>Deluxe Strip Poker II</em>. Almost none have been worth playing, not least because CPU players are incapable of understanding the game and playing it with anything resembling human skill or behavior. It turns out the solution was hiding all along: change all the rules and make it about cheating.</p><p>I think it’s indicative of just what a major impact <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124"><em>Balatro</em></a></span> has had that it feels so much like a game I’ve been playing forever that I have checked at least three times to be sure it should be on this list. Surely it at least came out in 2023! But no, its triumphant release was indeed in February of 2024, and it’s certainly been the one game I’ve come back to most frequently since.</p><p><em>Balatro</em> takes the rogue-ish elements of a deckbuilder like <em>Slay the Spire</em>, but puts them into a deck made up of traditional playing cards, eschewing all the usual dressings of a fantasy setting. It’s poker rules, kinda, except where in the right conditions you can make a straight with just four cards and that skips over a number. Or the much-coveted five-of-a-kind.</p><p>Something that most interests me about <em>Balatro</em> is how—aside from wrinkles introduced by the numerous rule-changing Jokers that can be found—the main adjustment that’s made to your game between attempts is within <em>you</em>, rather than via a tweaked deck. You get better at it. You develop new tactics and approaches, adapting on the fly based on the opportunities that come your way on any given run, and inevitably grow more skilful. That’s so much more rewarding than the game essentially getting easier because of unlocks you added, as is often the case in this genre.</p><p>It’s also stupidly clicky, and the “one more go” factor registers dangerously high. It’s such a pleasure that what could have been a minor indie hit has instead gone on to become one of the most popular games of 2024. — John Walker</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6d2c69c8044b96aa7960dbdb2d8da32e" data-recommend-id="image://6d2c69c8044b96aa7960dbdb2d8da32e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A dark, grass-covered area in Animal Well." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A dark, grass-covered area in Animal Well." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Billy Basso</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6d2c69c8044b96aa7960dbdb2d8da32e" data-recommend-id="image://6d2c69c8044b96aa7960dbdb2d8da32e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A dark, grass-covered area in Animal Well." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There is a genre of indie games in which it’s all about the impossible cleverness of the developer, layers of irony folding into one another, online communities picking apart secrets buried within secrets, and the whole thing just seems exhausting. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/animal-well-review-metroidvania-puzzle-2024-goty-1851465730&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/animal-well-review-metroidvania-puzzle-2024-goty-1851465730"><em>Animal Well</em></a></span> is the antithesis of all this, while <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/animal-well-guide-tips-layers-explained-1851532515&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/animal-well-guide-tips-layers-explained-1851532515">being better at delivering the same</a></span>!</p><p><em>Animal Well</em> is a wonderful platform game in its own right, even if you “only play it once,” or choose not to continue after you reach its initial ending.

Somehow, <em>The Veilguard</em> manages to pull off all of the above with a level of refinement not seen in anything BioWare has done before. <em>The Veilguard</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-reviews-metacritic-score-bioware-1851683347&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-reviews-metacritic-score-bioware-1851683347">has been divisive</a></span>, but even so, here I am, writing about it as #2 on our 2024 Game of the Year list.</p><p>I came into <em>The Veilguard</em> jaded, feeling that BioWare had lost the plot in its constant attempts to make <em>Dragon Age </em>an anthology series, each with a different protagonist, even as it focused on presenting a world influenced by your heroes and their decisions. Some of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s greatest failings are in its inability to marry an anthology structure with the choice and consequence BioWare has become synonymous with, but what it loses in a lack of carryover from decade-old games—importing only a handful of decisions from its direct predecessor—it makes up for in being probably the best foundation for a brighter future the series has had since <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>.</p><p><em>The Veilguard</em> is all about wrapping up loose ends and paving the way for the next generation of <em>Dragon Age </em>heroes. Some of the game’s most moving moments are ones in which it feels like you’re watching an origin story unfold as the heroes of before pass the torch to the next young whippersnapper doomed to save the world.

But despite how much wonderful specificity and detail you can bring to your own Rook, their story is universal for long-time fans of BioWare’s fantasy series. It’s not all great, as there’s an unnerving sense at times that Rook isn’t the one who should be here to watch history be uncovered. But the long-hidden truths they unearth about the world of Thedas are by turns satisfying, thrilling, and shocking, and <em>The Veilguard </em>manages to wield the uncertainty about Rook’s worthiness to pave the way for one of BioWare’s best finales.</p><p>Each tale it tells on the way to its climactic battle, whether it be Neve Gallus fighting for the city she loves or Davrin uncovering Grey Warden history, feels like a fresh start for this world. Given <em>Dragon Age</em>’s past, it’s hard to tell if <em>The Veilguard </em>is setting the series up to finally shed the weight of its long, overarching lore, or if it is ready to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-rook-choice-import-da5-5-1851705496&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-rook-choice-import-da5-5-1851705496">finally use it to its advantage with more forethought</a></span>. But for the moment, <em>The Veilguard </em>did exactly what it needed to do. It put BioWare back on track with <em>Dragon Age</em> to do what it does best: create worlds for us to inhabit and define who our heroes are. We’re given a space to create, destroy, fall in love, hold violent grudges, fight for what we believe in, support those around us, and ultimately save the world we’ve helped define. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="901f86210209edc2fc137855ca2d50dd" data-recommend-id="image://901f86210209edc2fc137855ca2d50dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kratos bot holds his axe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kratos bot holds his axe." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="901f86210209edc2fc137855ca2d50dd" data-recommend-id="image://901f86210209edc2fc137855ca2d50dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kratos bot holds his axe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Astro Bot</em> combines the best of 3D <em>Mario</em> platforming and <em>Crash Bandicoot</em>’s arcade-y death gauntlets into a gorgeous, whimsical, and fun adventure through an elaborate, sci-fi amusement park.

The results can sometimes be so effortless, it almost feels like you’re gliding through the game rather than actually playing it.

<p>It has been confirmed: Johnny Silverhand and ‘V’ from Cyberpunk 2077 are heading to Fortnite soon. It seems bizarre that a character who was iconic for rebelling against corporations and consumerism would appear in a game like this, but here we are. It hasn’t been confirmed when the characters will arrive in Fortnite, but it should be soon.</p>



<p>In a short teaser uploaded on social media, Epic Games revealed the characters – the female variant of V, and the standard model of Johnny Silverhand, who Keanu Reeves famously played in the 2020 open-world RPG.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-night-city-meet-fortnite">Night City, Meet Fortnite</h2>



<p>This will be the second time that Keanu Reeves has appeared in Fortnite. In 2019, the actor was introduced to the Fortnite universe as John Wick, arguably one of his most famous roles to date, beyond playing Neo in The Matrix franchise.</p>



<p>He’ll surface in Fortnite as Johnny Silverhand, one of the most major characters in Cyberpunk 2077 and the catalyst for the events that unfold throughout the game. Also being added is ‘V’, the game’s protagonist. While neither gender is canonical, Epic Games has opted to include the female variant in the upcoming crossover.</p>



<div><article><p><span>We’re expecting some guests from Night City 🌆 </span></p></article></div>







<p>It’s not yet confirmed what’s coming in the bundle, but we’ve seen snippets online showing Cyberpunk 2077’s ‘Mantis Blade’ weapons as a pickaxe replacement.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/1hjz19e/cyberpunk_x_fortnite_collab_skins_leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a leak on other social media platforms</a>, the character models were reportedly revealed, along with the blades, a back bling, and weapon wraps.</p>
