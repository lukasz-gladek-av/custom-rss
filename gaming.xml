            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-4-official-reveal<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt Red has officially unveiled&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 4</em>, previously known by its internal project codename Polaris, and it'll star Geralt's ward Ciri as she embarks on her own Witcher Path.</p>

<p>The cinematic reveal trailer for&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 4&nbsp;</em>was shown during yesterday's Game Awards, where we also got reveals for the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/okami-2-hideki-kamiya" rel="nofollow"><em>Okami 2</em></a>, the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naughty-dog-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet" rel="nofollow">Naughty Dog game</a>, and co-op survival spinoff&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a>.</p>

<p>In the trailer, we see Ciri taking on a witcher contract to dispatch a monster "demanding ritual sacrifice", as CD Projekt Red says. A villager attempts to stop her going after the girl who has been chosen for sacrifice, but she angrily retorts that it wasn't the gods who chose the girl, but the villagers themselves.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-witcher-4-announcement-sacrificial-girl.jpg?itok=6N0y8vuU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-witcher-4-announcement-sacrificial-girl.jpg?itok=WzE-luj7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The debut&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 4&nbsp;</em>trailer shows Ciri dealing with a witcher contract in a village where ritual sacrifice is seemingly the norm.</figcaption></figure><p>We see Ciri venture into the forest where the monster lives, dispatching it in a typically&nbsp;<em>Witcher</em>-esque combat scene that feels very weighty and heavy.</p>

<p>She returns to the village with the monster's head, whereupon the girl from the beginning of the trailer apparently dies in her father's arms. The villagers say they only wanted the girl to "go to the gods", whereupon Ciri responds that "there are no gods here, there are only monsters".</p>

<p>It all looks like typically riveting, typically grounded&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>stuff, and it's nice to see Ciri taking Geralt's role as the protagonist, especially given that she seems to be a less detached and more fiery Witcher than he was.</p>




<p>In <a href="https://press.cdprojektred.com/en/news/1702/the-witcher-iv-revealed-at-the-game-awards" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement post</a>, CD Projekt Red says the trailer was pre-rendered using "a custom build of Unreal Engine 5 on an unannounced Nvidia GeForce RTX GPU", presumably referring to the mooted 50 series, which has yet to be revealed.</p>

<p>Last month, CDPR said production on the new&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-sales-witcher-production" rel="nofollow">was ramping up</a>, so its announcement during yesterday's Game Awards makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>The studio is promising "the most immersive and ambitious open-world&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>game to date", but we still don't have a release window for it yet, unfortunately. We'll likely have to wait a while for more info, so watch this space.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24319689/backbone-one-usb-c-mobile-gaming-controller-logitech-g203-mouse-deal-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>As good as the Backbone One is (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/11/24175498/backbone-one-smartphone-iphone-android-game-controller-deal-sale">read our review of the original version</a>), it can be hard to justify earmarking $100 for a mobile gaming controller. Even at its common $70 sale price, you’re entering pro controller territory. That said, a 50 percent discount for the second-gen <strong>Backbone One (USB-C)</strong> seems worth jumping over the fence for. Today only, you can get it for $49.99 at <a href="https://howl.link/m2izynfmle3vn">Best Buy</a>, which is a record low price and just in time for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/7/24264510/the-resident-evil-2-remake-is-coming-to-apple-devices-on-new-years-eve"><em>Resident Evil 2</em> remake that’s soon launching on the iPhone</a>.</p><p>The Backbone One’s USB-C connector means it works both with Android smartphones and iPhones 15 or newer. It’s sleek with a bubbly grip sized <em>just</em> right to comfortably reach any of its face buttons, triggers, bumpers, or analog sticks. Ergonomically, it’ll lose to bulkier controllers, but should feel pretty good in most hands and is infinitely better than pecking away at the screen. The controller also has USB-C passthrough charging and 3.5mm for headphones and headsets. </p><p>The Best Buy-exclusive <em>Warzone Mobile</em> edition on sale here is mostly a spiritual tie-in: it’s visually and functionally identical to the standard Backbone One, but comes with free in-game rewards. You can use it with any games or apps with controller support, including cloud streaming services like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/14/24269925/xbox-cloud-gaming-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-support">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23561989/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-4080-price-reflex-hands-on-cloud-gaming">GeForce Now</a>. The purchase includes a free one-month trial of Backbone Plus ($40 a year afterward), which unlocks more app features like gameplay recording, live streaming, and Play on Any Screen (the latter enabling wired gaming on PC and tablets). You’ll also get three months of Apple Arcade ($7 a month value).</p><div><p>The Backbone One (second-gen) with USB-C can connect to Android phones and iPhones 15 or later. It’s a fully featured controller complete with dual analog sticks, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and its own software for capturing screenshots and connecting to game streaming services.</p></div><p><h3>More deals and discounts</h3></p><div><ul><li>The&nbsp;<strong>Logitech G203 Lightsync&nbsp;</strong>is on sale starting at $18.99 ($21 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YN82X3B/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://howl.link/3xhkiek28ebwj">Best Buy</a>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/482924/499820/8585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitechg.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fgaming-mice%2Fg203-lightsync-rgb-gaming-mouse.910-005790.html">Logitech</a>. The wired gaming mouse doesn’t boast the same button count or overall features from the brand’s flagship models. That said, it still has six programmable buttons total, plus an accurate sensor 8,000 DPI optical sensor and a scroll wheel with lock. It even has a touch of RGB lighting that you can customize with your favorite colors or sync to the action in your game using the G Hub app.</li><li>You can get the <strong>Anker Power Bank (30W, Fusion, Built-In USB-C Cable) </strong>in black for $19.99 (50 percent off) from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFKSJMVJ/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> when clipping the on-page coupon.<strong> </strong>The versatile travel-friendly charger has a built-in folding wall plug on one end to charge the 5,000mAh battery inside, but you can use the USB-C cable on the opposite end to do the same. There’s versatility in charging modes, too — you can use it in battery mode with the USB-C cable to charge smartphones or other devices at 22.5W speeds, or plug it into an AC outlet and use it as a 30W USB-C adapter.</li><li>Besides its name potentially stoking cravings for a sweet roll, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24239682/ultimate-ears-miniroll-bluetooth-speaker-price-availability"><strong>Ultimate Ears Miniroll</strong></a><strong> </strong>may pique your interest for other reasons, one being the record low $49.99 price <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Ears-Ultra-Portable-Waterproof-Bluetooth/dp/B0DCJ9N5XR/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sweetwater.com%2Fstore%2Fdetail%2FMiniRollMRG--ultimate-ears-miniroll-compact-bluetooth-speaker-majestic-revive-gray%2F">Sweetwater</a>, and <a href="https://ultimate-ears.dubn.net/c/482924/1633468/8590?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ultimateears.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fp%2Fminiroll.984-002015">Ultimate Ears</a> have it for right now. The portable Bluetooth speaker is circular, roundish, and small enough to stow in a bag or pocket, and the integrated clip lets you attach it to belt loops, straps, pole, and any other object thin enough to clamp. The IP67 speaker has oversized buttons and floats in water, too, and lasts up to 12 hours per charge. You can buy a second one and sync it for stereo sound, but you may find it surprisingly loud on its own.</li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-like-a-dragon-fans-are-already-theorizing-what-the-heck-rgg-studios-project-century-is<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ryu Ga Gotoku revealed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/project-century-rgg">Project Century</a> at The Game Awards 2024 last night and Yakuza / Like a Dragon fans are already deep in the theorizing phase to figure out what the heck it actually is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-like-a-dragon-dev-rgg-studio-announces-project-century-the-game-awards-2024">The minute-and-a-half long debut trailer for Project Century</a>, which is presumably just a codename and not the final title, showed what appears to be Tokyo in 1915. But where in Tokyo? Let the theorizing begin.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— VGT Gaming News (@VGTGamingNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/VGTGamingNews/status/1867400418550329762?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 13, 2024</a></blockquote> <h2 data-cy="title2">Where is Project Century set?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Some fans believe Project Century is directly connected to RGG Studio's other games by being set in Kamurocho, the fictional version of Tokyo's red light district at the center of the Yakuza / Like a Dragon series. While its streets are obviously a far cry from the modern metropolis that is Tokyo today, a certain building seen in the trailer looks similar to a prominent location in Kamurocho.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I saw a building that looked like Shangri-la at the start of the trailer," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1hd1vt1/this_is_actually_insane/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> user Jenkitten165 said, referencing the one at the bottom-left of the street in the image on the left, below. Shangri-La, a brothel which has appeared in various states across several Yakuza / Like a Dragon games, is on the right.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/project-1734094013379.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Project Century on the left, Shangri-La in Yakuza 4 on the right.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are differences, of course, but the shape of the building, its position on the street, the large front door, and the balcony directly above it all match. Shangri-La is also a distinctively older looking building than most in Kamurocho.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If it is in fact Shangri-La, this would make the main street seen in the Project Century trailer East Taihei Boulevard, just along the road from where the Millenium Tower now stands and the home of Kobuki Drugs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Details are still slim on Project Century but it seems similar in style to the Yakuza / Like a Dragon games, with lots of street fights and, well, actual yakuza walking around. Sticking to this theme would therefore make Tokyo's red light district, once again, a perfect setting for Project Century.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Is Project Century a Yakuza / Like a Dragon game?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This raises the question of canon, as while Project Century is set in 1915 and therefore 90 years before Yakuza 1, it could still be set in the same universe and timeline. The Yakuza / Like a Dragon series time hops plenty already, with prequel Yakuza 0 going back to 1988 and some cutscenes going back decades earlier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yakuza gangs were active during this time period too, so despite its much earlier presence it could easily be about the Japanese underworld. The main family in the Yakuza / Like a Dragon series, the Tojo Clan, has never had its origins explored either, perhaps presenting an opportunity to do so here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Project Century could still be set within the Yakuza / Like a Dragon canon without technically being a Yakuza / Like a Dragon game, however. RGG Studio has done this before with Judgement and Lost Judgement, a series set within the same world but featuring (mostly) different characters and a different story.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Yakuza Games In (Chronological) Order</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some fans even think it's linked to Judgement directly. "Genuinely think it may be Judgement: Isshin," said crazyred88 on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1hd1viz/project_century/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>. Like a Dragon: Isshin is the somewhat confusingly non-canon Yakuza / Like a Dragon game that is essentially a piece of historical fiction featuring characters from the modern setting games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That's what I'm thinking too," said Shattered_Sans. "The protagonist looks similar enough. It could be to Judgement what Isshin is to Like a Dragon." This theory is backed up by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-yakuza-series-will-be-a-turn-based-rpg-series-fully-going-forward">RGG Studio previously declaring Yakuza / Like a Dragon</a><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-yakuza-series-will-be-a-turn-based-rpg-series-fully-going-forward"> its turn-based role-playing game franchise</a> and Judgement its action game franchise, and Project Century is very clearly the latter.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Who is the main character of Project Century?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">But is the protagonist of Project Century, presumably the man we see beating up baddies in the trailer, an alternate history version of Takayuki Yagami from the Judgement series? The trailer only shows a single shot of his face, so it's still hard to say, but some fans certainly think so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other theories exist too, of course, with the most common comparison being made between the protagonist and the actor who played protagonist Kiryu Kazuma in the 2007 live action adaptation of Yakuza / Like a Dragon, Kazuki Kitamura.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"He looks like Kazuki Kitamura, who played Kiryu in the first movie," said SomeChunkyMilk on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1hd4u0h/this_needs_to_be_said_but_project_centurys/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>. "He's my guess. The nose and the hair look pretty damn similar." FarEast_Frez chimed in too: "He's quite tall as well, which would probably help with the mocap since the character looked quite tall."</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/screenshot-27-1734098446653.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This would mean he wasn't Yagami, of course, who's played by Takuya Kimura. Like a Dragon: Isshin previously brought over all the characters one for one, with the same models and voice actors and so on, so this would dissuade the Judgement Isshin theory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others, again, point to a completely fresh character though: the founding member of the Tojo Clan. " I wonder if it’s the first Tojo patriarch, the one who takes Kamurocho under his control and establishes the family, then later the Tojo Clan," said Hold-My-Sake on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1hd4u0h/this_needs_to_be_said_but_project_centurys/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>. "Dude if this is legit the progenitor of the Tojo Clan I will actually eat a shoe," added Terrible_Guidance599.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Is Project Century a Dragon Engine game?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Whoever he is, the protagonist of Project Century is much more violent than the likes of Kiryu or Yagami. Despite having beaten up thousands of people and taken down helicopters with rocket launchers and so on, Kiryu has officially never killed someone. The same can't be said after 90 seconds of this new protagonist, who's stabbing baddies with crowbars and ripping out their innards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is notable for other reasons though; the current Dragon Engine has so far been used to create Yakuza 6: The Song of Life, Yakuza Kiwami 2, Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise, Judgement, Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Lost Judgement, Like a Dragon: Ishin, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-release-date-brought-forward-a-week-to-avoid-monster-hunter-wilds-clash">the upcoming Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a>, for a total of 11 games over eight years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's therefore getting a touch outdated, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-dragon-engine-unreal-engine-5-masayoshi-yokoyama">something RGG Studio has admitted already</a>, and its technical director <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-like-a-dragon-tech-chief-finally-wants-to-make-a-dragon-engine-for-high-spec-consoles">Yutaka Ito said just last month he's finally eager to make a new engine</a> for use on current consoles. All of the aforementioned Yakuza / Like a Dragon games, including the 2025 release of Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, are available on the PlayStation 4 generation.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are debating whether Project Century is, or is not, a Dragon Engine game. "It's like they pushing the Dragon engine to its limit, even for RGG standard this is insane," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1hd1xnx/project_century_trailer/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> user honoyom said, but was refuted by AnyImpression6 who thought it was Unreal Engine 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others pointed out that Project Century is already reusing animations from other RGG Studio games though, something that's fairly common practice. "Like four of the combat animations are straight from the other games too," said AppealToReason16. "I knew it was an RGG game before the name reveal at that first movement."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">RGG Studio does make clear the trailer footage is pre-alpha, however, meaning very early in development. RGG Studio has otherwise made clear it favors the Dragon Engine for its ability to produce a realistic atmosphere for cities at night time. It could therefore make sense that, for Project Century, which doesn't feature the bright lights of modern day Tokyo, RGG Studio would be more comfortable stepping away from the Dragon Engine in favor of something more technologically advanced.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Project Century Game Awards Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans will just have to wait patiently for answers to all of these questions. Project Century is probably still a while away given it doesn't have a title yet, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sega-set-to-take-on-street-fighter-and-tekken-once-again-with-virtua-fighter-the-game-awards-2024">RGG Studio is currently developing Virtua Fighter 6</a> and Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii alongside Project Century.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is known for its unbelievably speedy development times, however. In the last five years, for example, its released Yakuza 4 Remastered, Yakuza 5 Remastered, Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Judgment Remastered, Lost Judgment, Like a Dragon: Ishin, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, and Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, alongside three Super Monkey Ball Games and an enhanced remaster of Virtua Fighter 5. That's 12 games in total.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">In our 9/10 review of the last RGG Studio release</a>, IGN said: "Sprawling, enthralling, and packed with dynamic brawling, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth isn’t just the best turn-based Like a Dragon game, it’s one of the greatest games in the entire series."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

The developers at CD Projekt Red have now discussed why they wanted to have Ciri be the star and have confirmed that, as suspected, Geralt will appear in the game in some fashion.</p><p>Game director Sebastian Kalemba told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-4-was-always-going-to-be-about-ciri-even-when-we-were-doing-the-wild-hunt-actually-but-dont-worry-about-geralt-definitely-hes-going-to-appear/?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> that it was a "natural choice" for The Witcher 4 to tell its story from Ciri's perspective, building off the narrative in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.</p><p>"There's plenty of room for her and for us, also, to build on top of [her]. There's so much room for exploration, and because she's such a nuanced character, the beginning of her journey gives us freedom and so many opportunities to be able to dig in and use [that] for good," he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c1rokekgnY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4c1rokekgnY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Ciri was a playable character in some parts of The Witcher 3, and executive producer Gosia Mitręga said she is "less defined as a character," which gives the developers opportunities for storytelling.</p><p>Geralt, the hero of CD Projekt's previous Witcher games, will appear in The Witcher 4 as well. Kelamba said Geralt is important to the developers and to Ciri, so he's "definitely" going to appear. His voice was heard at the very end of the game's recent trailer, but that's it so far.</p><p>"I can't tell you more, but I think the promise is enough. But we believe that this journey, this new saga, this new trilogy is definitely for her," he said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4415232-witcher.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4415232" data-ratio="0.56222222222222" data-width="900" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4415232-witcher.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4415232"></a><figcaption>Ciri in The Witcher 4's cinematic trailer.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4415232-witcher.jpeg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4415233-witcher1.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4415234-witcher2.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4415233,1300-4415234" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4415233-witcher1.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4415234-witcher2.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4415233-witcher1.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4415234-witcher2.jpeg"></figure><p>As Kelamba said, The Witcher 4 kicks off a new trilogy of Witcher games, which are in development alongside CD Projekt's other games, including a Cyberpunk 2077 sequel and a Witcher remake.</p><p>Recently, Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle walked back his comments about Geralt appearing in The Witcher 4 after the studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-actor-says-on-second-thought-hes-not-sure-if-geralt-is-actually-in-witcher-4/1100-6528324/" data-ref-id="1100-6528324">"slapped" him for talking about it.</a></p><p>The game's impressive CG trailer at The Game Awards was created by Platige Image and was pre-rendered in a custom version of Unreal Engine 5 running on an "unannounced Nvidia GeForce RTX GPU." The trailer uses assets and models from the game, but is more meant to be a mood piece that aims to show "the kind of experience the game is aspiring to provide."</p>

From light family games about dancing lemurs to in-depth strategy games, and some truly exciting surprises, these are the best new games at at PAX Unplugged 2024 - read on for the games you&nbsp;<em>need</em>&nbsp;to keep an eye out for when they release this year!</p>



<h2><b>Zenith</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-zenith.jpeg?itok=KfmLvIac 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-zenith.jpeg?itok=p_4iVpTf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><i>Zenith</i>, an upcoming board game from <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamepublisher/54347/playpunk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayPunk</a>, immediately caught my attention with its innovative, team-based gameplay. In the game, you and a teammate play a sort of tug of war for control of the planets of our solar system against your opponents.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-zenith-board.jpeg?itok=lgHowGKH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-zenith-board.jpeg?itok=INe4xFrU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With multi-purpose cards that you can play to gain resources, utilize special abilities, and more, I was truly engrossed during my demo play through. There’s a really nice push and pull here. Keep an eye out for <i>Zenith</i>, hitting shelves this Spring.</p>



<h2><b>Butterfly Garden</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-butterfly-garden.jpeg?itok=lDvXumye 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-butterfly-garden.jpeg?itok=43p7SLGy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Another entry in the ever-growing genre of calming games about birds, gardens, and bugs, <i>Butterfly Garden</i> from <a href="https://capstone-games.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Capstone Games</a> reimplements the classic tile-laying game Indigo. Wonderfully puzzle-y, you’ll lay down tiles opening up paths for your butterflies to fly along, hoping to guide them through winding lines toward your exits.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-butterfly-garden-board.jpeg?itok=v2SVJac6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-butterfly-garden-board.jpeg?itok=z1Z3Jsxy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Fun, easy breezy, this would be a great game to play with the whole family. This should be releasing within the next few months.</p>



<h2>Crafting The Cosmos</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-crafting-the-cosmos.jpeg?itok=tjyIZHdh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-crafting-the-cosmos.jpeg?itok=tx1SmIh6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><i>Crafting the Cosmos</i>, an upcoming game by <a href="https://www.officedoggames.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Office Dog</a>, Asmodee North America’s developmental studio, is a game about taking the very essence of the universe - namely elements, gravity, and even time itself, and putting it all together to forge your own galaxy. I got the chance to play through a demo round of the game with the game’s designers David Gordon and TAM, and found the gameplay intuitive but think-y at the same time. Each turn, you’re moving colored marbles around a central track, gathering resources, and plotting them on the board. Visually stunning, this has some of the cleanest design of any game I tried at PAX Unplugged. Keep an eye out for <i>Crafting the Cosmos</i> this March!</p>



<h2>Whisker Wars</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-whisker-wars.jpeg?itok=ckqbkEsE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-whisker-wars.jpeg?itok=fIrVp1gN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>When Mike, Sean, and Logan from <a href="https://play.glasshousegames.co/" rel="nofollow">Glasshouse Games</a> reached out to ask if I’d be willing to try out their upcoming <i>Whisker Wars</i>, I didn’t realize I was agreeing to sit down to play a game that would so thoroughly blow me away! In <i>Whisker Wars</i>, you’ll draw cards from a central deck, each depicting adorably angry woodland creatures waging all-out medieval warfare against one another. On your turn, you’ll draw your cards, lay them face-down in front of you, and then reveal. With hidden cards and a tricky decision-tree, I can’t wait to jump back in.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-whisker-wars-cards.jpeg?itok=jjBkwQOE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-whisker-wars-cards.jpeg?itok=t7kfoCIW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This is Glasshouse Games’ first game, and it’s heading to crowdfunding soon - and I’m calling it now, <i>Whisker Wars</i> and Glasshouse Games, are absolutely going to become household names.</p>



<h2>Overgrown</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-overgrown.jpeg?itok=MZk4Zt6v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-overgrown.jpeg?itok=nWnIHydG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Nature is healing! Another incredible surprise, I stumbled upon <i>Overgrown</i> completely by accident at PAX Unplugged. While my days were full of meetings, each night I walked the gaming hall looking for games to jump into. And on my second night, I happened up <i>Overgrown</i> and its creator Bryan Bell, founder of the new studio <a href="https://goodtimehat.com/" rel="nofollow">Good Time Hat</a>. In <i>Overgrown</i>, players take on the role of - get this - nature, taking over an abandoned city after some horrible disaster.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-overgrown-board.jpeg?itok=OzwXaHBm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-overgrown-board.jpeg?itok=O_QiHrLC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In the game, you’ll lay down a small empty frame upon a grid to collect resources which you’ll lay on your board in combinations to turn them into overgrowth. One of each of the three resources (water, sunlight, and soil) placed next to each other on your board combine to turn into a single tile of overgrowth, opening space back up on your board. And multiple overgrown tiles further combine into a single densely packed patch of greenery. You can also attract wildlife for bonus points. With a nice quick pace, and light puzzle placement, I was completely entranced by the game - and can’t wait for it to hit crowdfunding this year!</p>



<h2>Survivalist</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-survivalist.jpeg?itok=Rdo4g_Fb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-survivalist.jpeg?itok=Ox_p8BXN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With a gorgeous, stark black-and-white game design, <i>Survivalist</i> is all about surviving in the harsh wilderness. Designed by Ryan Courtney and Bob Hewitt of the newly formed <a href="https://www.homesteadnz.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Homestead Games New Zealand</a>, <i>Survivalist </i>is played over a series of seasons. You’ll spend the early game gathering useful resources, and crafting those into necessary tools, while preparing for a final showdown against the game itself.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-survivalist-card.jpeg?itok=wdYj1hjS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-survivalist-card.jpeg?itok=wBlSVShf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Designed purposefully to be difficult - and therefore show the peril of trying to make it out in the wilds - players will compete not to see who can survival the final encounter, but who can survive <i>the longest</i>. I didn’t get a chance to play through the full game, but in my brief demo I was immediately intrigued by both the seamless gameplay loop <i>and</i> the game’s one-of-a-kind artwork and design. With a planned release for early next year, this will be on my watch-list for sure.</p>



<h2>Disco Island Escape</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-disco-island-escape.jpeg?itok=_IuvTlKD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-disco-island-escape.jpeg?itok=z5ZC9vJp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This is another game I happened upon while wandering the gaming area after the Expo Hall closed, and I’m so glad I did! <i>Disco Island Escape</i> designer April Mitchell taught me how to play this fun family-friendly game about dancing lemurs trying to make it off a volcanic island. In this game, you’ll draw cards and play matching colors to chart a course for yourself around the board. Bump into another lemur and you’ll send them back to the start while your lemur flips to their Groovy side, allowing them to move faster.</p>

<p>Perfect for families with kids who can handle a little bit of strategic thinking (but not too much!), <i>Disco Island Fever</i> invites players to boogie down, with each color card also sporting a dance move to encourage the kiddos to get up and dance while they play (I did not dance, sadly, as it was the end of a long day). Published by <a href="https://playhootenanny.com/products/disco-island-escape" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hootenanny Games</a>, <i>Disco Island Fever’</i>s very newly available for purchase.</p>



<h2>Malediction</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-malediction.jpeg?itok=XS9LXwQz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-malediction.jpeg?itok=ZJFAb3Wc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Finally, there’s the upcoming <i>Malediction</i>, a new card and miniature game by <a href="https://malediction.gg/" rel="nofollow">Loot Studios</a>. This game is the real deal, and truly one of the best new games at PAX Unplugged 2024. The elevator pitch is, essentially, <i>Magic: The Gathering</i> meets <i>Warhammer</i>. For a certain subset of our readers (myself included), I don’t have to say anything more! In <i>Malediction</i>, you’ll choose one of four factions, and build up a force of miniatures and a deck of cards.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-malediction-miniatures.jpeg?itok=OT3W3oBz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-malediction-miniatures.jpeg?itok=k_WBvf5s 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>But here’s the fun twist, along with spells and little combat tricks, the cards in your deck also include profile cards for your miniatures - and you can’t bring them out onto the battlefield until you draw their card <i>and</i> pay the resource cost to field them. While the core boxes will come with cardboard cutouts, the game will also include the STL files needed to 3D print some of the most engaging looking models and terrain I’ve ever seen. I played an incredible demo, and took home some samples to try out more fully. Expect a full report before the game launches on GameFound!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Elden Ring Nightreign Is a Survival-Focused Spinoff Coming in 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-is-a-survival-focused-spinoff-coming-in-2025.1060797/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco have announced&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, a co-op survival action spinoff of the wildly popular open-world action RPG, and it's due out next year.</p>

<p>The game, like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/okami-2-hideki-kamiya" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Okami&nbsp;</em>sequel</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naughty-dog-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet" rel="nofollow">Naughty Dog's next project</a>, was announced during yesterday's Game Awards, and a followup <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/fromsoftware-and-bandai-namco-reveal-elden-ring-nightreign" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement post</a> on the official Bandai Namco website sheds some more light on this rather odd-looking title.</p>

<p>The publisher describes&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>as a "standalone multiplayer co-op action survival game" in which players must band together to defeat a creature known only as the Nightlord. You will also be able to "go solo" in&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>, although it very much seems to be designed around co-op play.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-giant-spider-boss.jpg?itok=Z33zjmEl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-giant-spider-boss.jpg?itok=36A9FES6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is a co-op-focused spinoff of the hugely popular&nbsp;action RPG.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>will consist of a "three day-and-night cycle" in which you'll make "split decisions about combat and exploration" while taking down "terrifying bosses", which sounds like par for the course when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>.</p>

<p>This time around, however, you won't be making your own characters; rather, you'll choose from an existing pool of eight, each of which has their own "unique abilities and powerful Ultimates".</p>

<p>The game will take place in the parallel realm of Limveld, where you'll face increasingly difficult bosses at the end of each night, with the third night pitting you against the "chosen Nightlord".</p>

<p>Should you fall, you'll still be granted relics that you can use to "customize and upgrade" your characters, so it sounds like <i>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</i>will have more than a whiff of the roguelite about it as well.</p>




<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s announcement comes just days after FromSoftware head Hidetaka Miyazaki said the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-2-not-happening-fromsoftware" rel="nofollow">wouldn't be revisiting the IP</a> anytime soon, which feels like a particularly brazen statement in hindsight.</p>

<p>However, given the massive sales figures of both&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">itself</a> and its&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales" rel="nofollow">expansion</a>, another game in the series was perhaps an inevitability.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is set to arrive for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010877" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and Xbox sometime next year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naughty-dog-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We finally know what Naughty Dog's new game is, and it's...well, it's pretty different to&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>, by the looks of things.&nbsp;<em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet&nbsp;</em>is a sci-fi action game that's "currently in development for the PlayStation 5 console".</p>

<p>Naughty Dog announced&nbsp;<em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet&nbsp;</em>during yesterday's Game Awards ceremony, which is also where we learned that Hideki Kamiya will be returning to direct <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/okami-2-hideki-kamiya" rel="nofollow">a sequel to 2006&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>-esque action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Okami</em></a>.</p>

<p>As studio head Neil Druckmann says in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/12/announcing-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-a-new-franchise-from-naughty-dog/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">followup PlayStation Blog post</a>, Naughty Dog has been working on this game since it released&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part 2&nbsp;</em>in 2020, and it'll be the studio's "wildest, most creative story yet", according to Druckmann.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/naughty-dog-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-combat.jpg?itok=l1313hPS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/naughty-dog-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-combat.jpg?itok=doUQlmMb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet&nbsp;</em>has been in the works at Naughty Dog since 2020.</figcaption></figure><p>Naughty Dog's new game revolves around Jordan A. Mun, a "dangerous bounty hunter" who finds herself stranded on a distant planet known as Sempiria.</p>

<p>The planet's communication with the rest of the universe "went dark" hundreds of years in the past, and Mun will have to find out why if she wants "to be the first person in over 600 years to leave its orbit".</p>

<p>Although the debut trailer does look rather different tonally from&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>(including an appearance by the excellent Pet Shop Boys album&nbsp;<em>Actually</em>, of all things), Druckmann says it'll still offer "an emotional, character-driven epic journey".</p>

<p>He also promises "the deepest gameplay in Naughty Dog's history", with the studio "taking our learnings from our previous franchises and pushing them beyond anything we've ever done before".</p>




<p>Mun will be played by Tati Gabrielle, who you may know as&nbsp;<em>The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina</em>'s Prudence or the <em>Uncharted&nbsp;</em>movie's Jo Braddock. Coincidentally, she'll also be appearing as Nora in the upcoming second season of the TV adaptation of&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>.</p>

<p>It's not clear whether or not this is the project on which Naughty Dog's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/raf-grassetti-naughty-dog" rel="nofollow">new art director Raf Grassetti</a> is working, but we do know that soundtrack duties will be handled by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, also known as Nine Inch Nails.</p>

<p>That wasn't all Naughty Dog revealed during yesterday's show, either.&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part 2</em>'s long-awaited PC port was also finally unveiled, and it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2531310/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_Remastered/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">hitting Steam</a> on April 3rd.</p>

<p>We likely won't hear much from&nbsp;<em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet&nbsp;</em>for a while; Naughty Dog says its staff will "put our heads back down" to work on the game "for now", so stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <p>Stealth launching a game during an awards ceremony is cool. But you know what's cooler? Stealth launching a union. As many in the games industry settled in for an evening of advertisements and blockbuster backslapping, one group of US workers quietly succeeded in organising something of their own. Employees at Zenimax Online Studios launched their union with 461 members, as announced <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zosunited.bsky.social/post/3ld5jhpai6226">on social media site Bluesky</a> last night. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The members include engineers, artists, web developers, and game designers. Most of these workers are based in Maryland, say the union, but others are spread across the states, in California, New York, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Texas. </p>
<p>"With a union, we are looking forward to collectively pushing for improvements to the workplace," they say, "including job security, protections against AI, better pay and benefits – in an industry that we’re so deeply passionate about."</p>
<p>That mention of "job security" is the obvious concern, given the grave number of layoffs in recent years, thousands of which have fallen upon Microsoft-owned studios. Zenimax Online Studios are the developers behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online">The Elder Scrolls Online</a>, and are themselves owned by the Windows peddlers.</p><p>Microsoft has officially recognised the union, but you should know that a labour agreement following the big fat Activision Blizzard acquisition last year essentially means that they do this because they <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-signs-labor-neutrality-agreement-with-cwa-ahead-of-activision-blizzard-deal">are required to do so</a>. Which partly explains why <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-qa-workers-just-formed-the-largest-union-in-video-games">Zenimax QA workers</a> have also been able to recently unionise with perhaps more ease than a studio under another company.</p>
<p>The Zenimax Online union that arose last night has been formed under the Communication Workers of America, a parent union that has been organising workers across the states for some years now. Earlier this year that parent group also helped another band of Elder Scrolls developers at Bethesda Game Studios to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-game-studios-developers-ecstatic-to-announce-a-241-strong-wall-to-wall-union">form their own union too</a>, consisting of 241 workers. </p>
<p>"We're working against some pretty massive corporations," a CWA organiser told Nic when he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/from-blizzard-to-bethesda-game-unions-are-sweeping-the-industry-heres-how-the-cwa-helps-make-them-happen">spoke to them recently about their organising campaign</a>.“The imbalance of power is very obvious. So you try to organise in secret so that people can't be totally derailed from exercising their rights before they even have a chance to understand those rights.”</p>
<p>I can think of no greater sneak attack than doing it as soon as Geoff Keighly gets up on stage. Nice work. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-to-allow-gambling-sponsors-esports-rumour/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumour-riot-games-to-allow-gambling-sponsors-for-league-and-valorant-teams-in-2025.1060788/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-to-allow-gambling-sponsors-esports-rumour/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been claimed that Riot Games is preparing to make a major change to its sponsorship policies as we head into 2025. It was recently rumoured that the company will allow a limited number of gambling companies to sponsor esports teams in League of Legends and VALORANT, after spending many years standing firm against that very concept.</p>



<p>Most recently, in 2023, the gaming titan issued a statement confirming that there were no plans to change these policies <strong>but </strong>it would continue to ‘evaluate all opportunities’ in the sponsorship space. </p>



<p>Is a cultural shift on the horizon?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-where-the-money-is">Where The Money Is</h2>



<p>Esports betting makes up around half of the industry’s total revenue, while the other half is comprised of ticket sales, sponsorship deals, broadcast rights, merchandise sales, and other investments. It’s a money maker of a business, and that’s why so many esports organisations partner with gambling and betting brands.</p>



<p>On social media, the user ‘MonteCristo’ posted a claim that Riot will alter long-standing policies to allow betting sponsors to align with League of Legends and VALORANT teams going into 2025:</p>



<div><article><p><span>Riot will be allowing esports teams to have betting sponsors in League of Legends and VALORANT in 2025.

Gambling companies interested in sponsoring teams will have to be approved by Riot and will not be allowed to place logos on team uniforms.</span></p></article></div>







<p>Historically, some of the most prolific brands in esports betting have partnered with or sponsored organisations. The likes of GG.BET, Pinnacle, Betway, Parimatch, and 1xBet have all secured visible positions in the esports industry alongside some of the most valuable tournaments in the business.</p>



<p>It’s not too far-fetched to imagine that Riot Games wants in on that action, but it would come at the cost of some morality points.</p>



<p>For now, this is a rumour and should be treated accordingly, but I have reached out to representatives of Riot Games to try and grab a more concrete statement on the matter.</p>



<p>What do you think of this rumour? Can you see it materialising? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <p>Workers at ZeniMax Online Studios have voted to unionise.</p>
<p>The ZOS United-CWA union, as part of the Communications Workers of America, has been recognised by parent company, Microsoft, "signalling a significant victory for workers' rights in the industry".</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/okami-2-hideki-kamiya</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-announces-okami-2-hideki-kamiya-to-direct.1060758/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/okami-2-hideki-kamiya<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>During yesterday's Game Awards, Capcom announced a sequel to cult classic 2006 action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Okami</em>, and it boasts the involvement of one of the original game's most important figures.</p>

<p>In a brief trailer shown during the Game Awards, Capcom confirmed that&nbsp;<em>Okami 2</em>, which is currently known simply as "<em>Okami&nbsp;</em>Sequel", is officially in the works, and that original director Hideki Kamiya will return to direct the project.</p>

<p>The game's <a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/o-kami_newproject/en-us/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new official website</a> sheds a little more light on the project too, although it doesn't give much away. According to the site,&nbsp;<em>Okami 2&nbsp;</em>is being developed by "studios that include various staff members of the original&nbsp;<em>Okami</em>", including M-Two, Machine Head Works, and Kamiya's own Clovers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/okami-2-announced-flower-circle.jpg?itok=MzvqDwD6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/okami-2-announced-flower-circle.jpg?itok=aDf7wS6v 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Okami 2&nbsp;</em>is officially coming.</figcaption></figure><p>In closing, Capcom says it "will be some time" before we get more information about Amaterasu's latest adventure, but that the studio "really hope[s] you look forward to this project". I can only speak for myself, but I'm absolutely hyped for this.</p>

<p>The trailer itself is fairly brief as well. It features Amaterasu herself sprinting across a field while&nbsp;<em>Okami</em>'s distinctive music plays, and she's trailing beautiful flowers behind her, just like in the original game.</p>

<p>We then see a flower with closed petals as a paintbrush traces a thick ink circle around the flower, upon which it suddenly bursts into bloom. It's a reference to a paint gesture in the original&nbsp;<em>Okami</em>, in case you haven't played it.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Okami 2&nbsp;</em>here. I don't know about you, but just seeing this minute or so of footage made me weirdly emotional.</p>




<p><em>Okami 2&nbsp;</em>wasn't all Capcom revealed during the Game Awards, either.</p>

<p>As well as a revival of one classic PS2 franchise, we're also getting another in the form of&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>, a hack-and-slash action game that looks like it owes more than a small debt to FromSoftware's&nbsp;<em>Sekiro</em>.</p>

<p>Reviving&nbsp;<em>Onimusha&nbsp;</em>makes a lot of sense given that the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-onimusha-anime-trailer" rel="nofollow">animated series based on the games</a>&nbsp;debuted late last year. You can check the trailer out for&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p>We'll bring you more on both&nbsp;<em>Okami 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>, as well as everything else Capcom is up to right now, as soon as we get it. Stay tuned.</p>

            <p>No, your ears were not deceiving you. That was definitely Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle popping up at the end of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">Witcher 4's reveal trailer last night</a>, and yes, the white-haired monster hunter will absolutely feature in some way in the upcoming game.</p>
<p>While many had assumed as much -  let's be honest, it is hard to miss the gravelling tones of Cockle's Geralt - developer CD Projekt has now officially confirmed what we all thought.</p>

<p>"Geralt will appear in the game," the Witcher 4 team told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/geralt-is-in-the-witcher-4-and-that-is-indeed-doug-cockles-voice-in-the-trailer-cd-projekt-confirms">IGN</a>. However, it refrained from giving much more away. "We don't want to spoil his role precisely," CD Projekt closed. "You'll have to wait to learn more for now."</p><p>Cockle actually let slip <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-voice-actor-confirms-he-will-be-part-of-the-witcher-4">Geralt was going to have some part in the upcoming Witcher game</a>, which will instead star Ciri in the lead role, back in August. However, the actor had since tried to backtrack on these comments a tad, admitting he <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doug-cockle-got-slapped-by-cd-projekt-for-saying-geralt-is-in-the-witcher-4-but-not-as-the-main-character">"got slapped" by CD Projekt for what he said</a>.</p>
<p>"I don't actually know if that's true now because they came back and they went, 'We haven't put anything out there, don't say anything'," Cockle shared during a recent interview at MCM Comic Con Birmingham.</p>
<p>He went on to state: "The truth is I can't answer the question because I've signed an NDA. So even if I did know, I'd have to lie to you."</p>

		<p>The classic dinosaur hunter is back with Turok: Origins announced during The Game Awards. Saber Interactive is taking the classic IP and mixing it up with the three-player co-op, bringing it to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Turok Origins - Official Reveal Trailer | The Game Awards 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cs4PW9oOPlQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Turok: Origins will be a “fast-paced, third-person, sci-fi shooter, featuring both solo and cooperative action for up to three players,” which sure as heck sounds a lot like Saber’s template that they used for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/04/26/world-war-z-review-wwz-ps4-xbox-pc/">World War Z</a> and this year’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Space Marine 2</a>.</p>
<p>The snippets of gameplay at the end of the trailer suggest that they won’t be featuring their massive horde tech on this occasion, instead focussing more on small numbers of dinosaurs, using your weapons and abilities to down them before absorbing their DNA to upgrade your arsenal.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, there will be a wide array of weapons, including plasma rifles, ray guns, snipers, bows, shotguns and more.</p>

<p>“Turok was one of the first console shooters I ever played,” said Matthew Karch, CEO and co-founder of Saber Interactive. “When we looked at game franchises that we felt deserved to be brought back, Turok was at the top of our list. At Saber, we love taking classic IP and combining it with fresh gameplay. We are excited to finally announce the game, but we’ll be even happier when we deliver this old-school experience with modern-day execution.”</p>
<p>Turok first made his way into video games with the the trilogy of N64 games – Turok: Dinosaur Hunter and Turok 2: Seeds of Evil and Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion. There was also the multiplayer focused Turok: Rage Wars. Since then, however, the franchise basically vanished into nothing, failing to land a hit in the early 2000s with a PS2 era Turok: Evolution or PS3 era Turok reboot. It’s really the N64 games that live on in the memory of gamers, thanks in no small part to Nightdive Studios who released that original trio of games in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/03/06/turok-and-turok-2-remasters-coming-to-nintendo-switch/">2015, 2017</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/24/turok-3-shadow-of-oblivion-remastered-has-been-announced/">2023</a>, respectively.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/farmagia-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p><span data-contrast="none">Have you ever been playing Pikmin and actually wanted to farm the adorable little plants complete with tilling land and ensuring they get enough water? &nbsp;Well, do I have a game for you. Farmagia (pronounced Far-mag-ia instead of Far-mage-ia in the biggest missed opportunity of the year) does exactly this combination of things, allowing you to cultivate your own personal army of part-plant, part-animal creatures to fight for you against other, equally adorable critters.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Farmagia – Launch Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XMlVgNeNp9k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Set in the world of Felicidad, Farmagia follows one of the titular mages, Ten, as he and his friends grapple with being part of a rebellion to overthrow Glaza, the Magus. This deeply villainous character leads the Oración Seis, a set of regional lords that govern each continent of the world who you will get to know in your travels whether you want to or not. The story follows a typical structure as you travel the continents in your attempts to aid the rebellion, meeting new friends and foes alike and dispatching the majority of the latter. I kept wanting the story to take a turn, break out of the predictable path it was on, and be a little more exciting, but it never truly got there.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p><span data-contrast="none">The gameplay is split into two sections, with farming and exploring dungeons being your two main activities. Beginning with the farming mechanics, this is one of the more engaging parts of the game as you plant the different Buddies that can be cultivated. Each one takes a specific amount of in-game time, and you must water them each in-game day as they grow on your farm. You can buy and craft items to help with this, such as increasing the yield from your crop or reducing the amount of time needed for it to grow, then leave the land to do its work as you go off to the dungeons. All activities on the farm cost FP (Farming Points) and you restore all your FP by resting overnight.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Where it gets a little deeper is in the difference between the types of Buddies you can cultivate. Battle Buddies, as the name suggests, will come into battle with you (more on this in a moment), but the Research Buddies are far more interesting. Planting Research Buddies will contribute toward your overall research in not only that creature, but also gain you points to use in the research tree. This then unlocks better farming equipment, larger farming space, new types of craftable items and even more powerful Battle Buddies. The problem being that all of this swiftly descends into busy work. Depending on your tolerance for that, the farming can quickly become monotonous and stale.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p><span data-contrast="none">In the dungeons, the combat is initially very enjoyable, giving the player up to four types of Battle Buddies to use in combat, each of which is attributed to a different face button. Pressing their corresponding button sends them out to attack your current target, building up their gauge to perform a powerful attack called a Unite Blitz. Each enemy you come across will be weak to a particular Battle Buddy, which will increase your damage and also work on breaking their guard. If you do attack enough to break their guard, it will stun them giving you a moment’s reprieve and a great opportunity to do some damage or a Buddy-specific super attack.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">On top of this, you can combine all of your Battle Buddies to shield from attacks, with bonuses awarded for guarding just as an attack hits you, such as boosts to your various gauges. If an enemy is attempting to strike with an unblockable attack, which the game highlights with a red flash, you can even use your Unite Blitz&nbsp;just before it hits to perform a Unite Counter. Your Buddies can be killed though, so using these defensive abilities is integral to survival, as is running over to the little tykes if they’re stunned by an enemy. As a final trowel to your toolkit, you can also&nbsp;combine all of your creatures into one colossal creature with a Fusion to perform a devastating attack that behaves like a Final Fantasy summon.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">You can shake up the gameplay in a variety of ways, the biggest of which is by changing your loadout of Buddies, of which you can even fine-tune how many of each you will bring into battle with you. You can also change your leader, which grants different skills that can be used in battle such as making it easier to inflict debuffs. Finally, each dungeon allows you to choose your way through to some extent and whether you wish to prioritise items, party buffs, or enemy encounters, so you really need to go out of your way to have two runs of a dungeon that are completely identical.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">This sounds very involved, and it is for a time, in the early parts of the game as you gain new types of Buddy and enhance the types you have already. Sadly, most aspects of the gameplay mentioned previously quickly become dull or don’t add much diversity to the game. For example, the dungeons themselves, although technically randomised, aren’t quite randomised enough, leaving each one feeling exactly like the last with maybe a new aesthetic identity to represent a new area i.e. a jungle or a swamp. That’s made worse by them each consistently ending in a remarkably similar-looking open area for their end-of-stage boss encounter.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Speaking of which, even the aesthetics of Farmagia don’t claw it out of the doldrums for me. I’ll concede that the various creatures are adorable, and I will never quite get over seeing the little wolves be pulled from what look like stalks of corn, but the characters play into a particular design philosophy that doesn’t gel with me. In other words, if you like your male characters to look generic as all sin, but your female characters having so much care in their design that they look like they’re from a different game entirely by comparison – you won’t have the same problem as I do here. But I’ll be the first to admit I’m just not a big-breasted anime girl kind of person.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/solasta-ii-announced-powered-by-unreal-engine-5-early-access-in-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/solasta-ii-announced-%E2%80%93-powered-by-unreal-engine-5-early-access-in-2025.1060725/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/solasta-ii-announced-powered-by-unreal-engine-5-early-access-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the TGA 2024 pre-show, French developer Tactical Adventures announced Solasta II, sequel to the solid 2021 cRPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/solasta-crown-of-the-magister-tactics-dragons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solasta: Crown of the Magister</a>. Like its predecessor, it is based on the Dungeons &amp; Dragons SRD 5.1 ruleset, although set in its own world.</p>
<p>The sequel takes place decades after the events witnessed in Crown of the Magister and its <a href="https://wccftech.com/palace-of-ice-dlc-for-solasta-crown-of-the-magister-launches-on-may-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Palace of Ice DLC</a>. This time, a new band of adventurers will set out on the continent of Neokos, which has been conquered by a powerful, corrupting villain called Shadwyn. Her character will be voiced by Amelia Tyler, the award-winning actress behind Baldur's Gate III's narrator and Hades II's Hecate.</p>
<p>This is an inkling of the 'level up' that Tactical Adventures is planning for Solasta II, which will be powered by Unreal Engine 5 to deliver much more advanced visuals than the first entry, as you can see in the debut trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Solasta II - Official Announcement Trailer [TGA 2024]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ruN-X04RxFA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>On the gameplay front, Solasta II will once again allow players to take control of a group of four characters, which will be fully voiced this time, not to mention customizable when it comes to skills and abilities. The online co-op mode feature will be added during the Early Access phase.</p>
<p>Throughout the story campaign, players must navigate the various factions, get to know the inhabitants of Neokos, and most importantly, make wise decisions. Their choices will determine whether they are favored or despised.</p>
<p>Mathieu Girard, the game's Creative Director, said:</p>
<p><em>Our team of 35 combines deep expertise with a passion for crafting immersive and challenging gaming experiences. With our first game, we started as a Kickstarter success story, building on the SRD 5.1 ruleset to create a tactical RPG that has resonated with over 1.5 million players. Now, with Solasta II, we’re taking all that even further – pushing the system with fresh takes on tactical depth, fun and accessibility. Players will explore Neokos, a new continent brimming with magic, colossal landscapes and discover unprecedented lore, while facing the growing force of Shadwyn, a charismatic villain driven by a relentless desire to reclaim her lost power. This project is powered by ambition, respect for our players and a shared belief in the strength of what we’re building together. We can’t wait for everyone to get their hands on it and tell us what they think!</em></p>
<p>Solasta II will launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2975950/Solasta_II/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam Early Access</a> sometime next year, although a free demo will be shared in early 2025, providing fans with a juicy taste of what's to come. Later today, Tactical Adventures will host a developer live stream <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/tacticaladventures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Twitch</a>. It will go live at 9 AM PST / 12 PM EST / 6 PM CET, if you'd like to follow it.</p>

            <p>Will the bulletting of my beloved dinosaurs never cease? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/turok-origins">Turok: Origins</a> will revisit the dino-hunting archery of ye olde Nintendo 64, reimagining it as a story of three native huntsfolk out to lambast large lizards. The big new angle is that it'll be a third-person shooter and you can play in online co-op as a team of T-rex wreckers. You then slurp up their dino DNA to upgrade your character. Come and watch these crimes against nature in the trailer below.</p>

<p>There'll be a lot of melee attacking by the looks of things, but a shootybang is a shootybang. Players are promised "plasma rifles, ray guns, snipers, bows, shotguns, and more" , while the DNA powers will supplement that combat (one power looks like a time-freezing bubble). There's also a story to follow, somewhere, but we're not told what it's about yet. Only that it is "epic" and will see the warriors visit lots of fancy locations "from ancient temples and wasteland canyons to dense jungles".</p>
<p>This isn't the first time the series has been revived. A reboot simply titled Turok came out in 2008 to mixed reviews. It sold well enough for developers at Propaganda Games to start work on a sequel, but not well enough to prevent its sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disney-throws-turok-sequel-in-the-bin">being cancelled the following year</a>, resulting in 70 redundancies at the studio. How times change, eh? We'd never see ruthless layoffs like that today!</p><p>Anyway. It's being made by Saber Interactive, the many-studio'd publishers who specialise in working on licensed properties, and a relatively safe pair of hands. They did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-war-z">World War Z</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/evil-dead-the-game">Evil Dead: The Game</a>, among others. Saber are also working on another dinosaur game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jurassic-park-survival">Jurassic Park: Survival</a>, which looks less violent toward the beautiful creatures and therefore morally more forgivable.</p>
<p>If I am cranky about the jungly shooter, please forgive me. It was shown off at The Game Awards, which aired in the early hours of this morning and has claimed all my Rock Paper Brethren, leaving only two survivors: me and guides guru Jeremy. The team was up posting much of the news, and before Ollie expired from a chronic case of video games, he wrote up a huge summary post of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-game-awards-2024-everything-announced">all the games revealed at the Game Awards 2024</a>. That's massively handy, that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Earlier this week we heard rumblings of a new character announcement for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>, and at the same time a trailer dropped <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tekken-8s-next-character-will-be-revealed-this-week-and-clues-point-to-a-certain-lady-in-red">a big unmistakable hint</a> for red-dressed rabble rouser Anna Williams. Turns out that unmistakable hint was mistakable. My mistake. At last night's Game Awards we learned that the next fighter to come to the game will be... Clive? From <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a>? Sure. Why not.</p>

<p>Ah yes, lots of swooshy fire and ice effects alongside those jabs and slices, as befits the magic man. This is the second <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-game">Final Fantasy</a> character to guest star in the fighter in recent times, as Noctis from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xv">Final Fantasy XV</a> also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/noct-out-with-a-fish-my-quest-to-k-o-someone-in-tekken-with-a-tuna">found his fishy way into the Iron Fist Tournament</a> back in 2018. Some of Clive's warpy movement is reminiscent of the road tripping prince (one air-blipping combo in particular) but most of the moveset looks to be his own angry bashing. At one point he slashes Zantetsuken-style in the manner of Odin, long-standing summon of the RPG series, and for the finale he conjures Ifrit into being for what looks to be the character's Rage art. </p>
<p>He's the fourth and final character for anyone who bought the season 1 DLC pass, standing alongside the already-released <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tekken-8s-first-dlc-character-will-be-series-regular-eddy-gordo-kicking-off-its-season-pass-this-spring">Eddy</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wapN3UqjJmI">Lidia</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heihachi-rises-from-the-dead-as-tekken-8s-third-character-dlc">Heihachi</a>. His fiery Phoenix Gate stage also comes included. There will be some disappointment, I'm sure, given how some fans have been clamouring for years to see Tifa - another Final Fantasy character - included as a guest (or Kiryu from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza">Yakuza</a> series). Once again they haven't seen their prayers answered, but perhaps the sting will fade when they inspect Clive's moveset. Some of his attacks look frighteningly fast. He's getting added to the game next week, December 16th.</p><p>As for my earlier reporting that the new character would likely be the bifferess in red, well, I got confused. Those hints were intended for the <em>next</em> season of the fighting game, suggesting that Anna is coming next year (Anna has been a mainstay in all Tekken games, apart from Tekken 4 for some reason). It serves me right for getting caught up in the prevailing winds of streamer opinion and the YouTube commentariat, instead of trusting my newsboi gut and simply saying in a boring voice: "we don't know who this will be yet." To be honest, I'm just upset we haven't yet seen any sign of drunken master Lei or irritable matador Miguel. Although, now that I look at Clive's hair, there is something distinctly Miguelish about him. Maybe I can dress him up?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The union has been recognized by parent company Microsoft, which acquired ZeniMax and it subsidiaries in 2021.</p><p>The union is called ZOS United-CWA, and like the previous unionization efforts within ZeniMax Media, has been formed with the Communications Workers of America (CWA). The new union consists of web developers, designers, engineers, and graphic artists, with an announcement on Bluesky identifying union members as "a majority of video game workers at ZeniMax Online Studios and the workers behind ESO."</p><p>"We are thrilled to be joining thousands of other tech and video game workers in building solidarity across the industry with CODE-CWA," the new union said in an announcement on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zosunited.bsky.social/post/3ld5jhqijg226" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a>, tagging the CWA's campaign for unionization within the tech, gaming, and digital industries. "With a union, we are looking forward to collectively pushing for improvements to the workplace, including job security, protections against AI, better pay and benefits--in an industry that we’re so deeply passionate about."</p><p>In June this year, Microsoft signed a labor-neutrality agreement with the CWA, agreeing not to interfere with any unionization efforts within ZeniMax Media, and making it easier for workers within ZeniMax to unionize.

<p>Whilst the firm has not publicly confirmed the layoffs, <a href="https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2126300/wb-games-montreal-keywords-licenciements">Radio-Canada</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/wb-games-montreal-lays-off-99-developers">Game Developer</a>) reports 99 roles have been impacted, most of which work as subcontractors for its quality assurance team.

<p>According to anonymous sources who didn't want to be identified for fear of reprisal, staff were called to a video conference meeting on Monday, where the cuts were announced. Impacted colleagues were then invited to a separate call during which they were asked to choose between job hunting support or being placed on a recall list as and when the studio would pick up more work. The studio did stress, however, that this was unlikely to happen before 2026.</p>
<p>Colleagues impacted by the cuts told the news site they felt "stressed and depressed", especially to those with "families who are affected by this announcement and who are preparing to celebrate Christmas".</p>
<p>The redundancies were announced on the same day it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deathstroke-kicks-off-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-final-announced-season">confirmed that the beleagued Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League would see no further new content beyond its fourth post-launch season</a>, which is now officially its last.</p>

The move accompanies the cancellation or downsizing of several projects, with the studio blaming "external market pressures".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Tripwire Interactive has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/killing-floor-3">Killing Floor 3</a> is set to release in March 2025 across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC with full cross-play. Check out the new trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Killing Floor 3 - Game Awards Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1NE0qVN3ua4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Killing Floor 3 will also have closed beta tests, with<a href="https://killingfloor3.com/#signup">&nbsp;sign-ups here</a> on the Killing Floor site.</p>
<p>The trailer takes us to Texas, where a zed outbreak has consumed a Horzine facility, and your of Nightfall characters will need to head in and clear things up.</p>
<p>It gives a first look at the Ninja, Medic and Sharpshooter character classes, as well as a glimpse of the Chimera boss.</p>

<p>These days, character classes also need to have, well, a character attached to them, and so we meet Luna as the Sharpshooter, whose rifles have high damage and penetration, with skills that can pivot her character from precision to run and gun marksman. Her gadget is the Death’s Hand, an explosive homing arrow.<i></i></p>
<p>Obi is the medic, who was fired from Horzine for being too ethical and not profitable enough. He keeps teammates alive with healing darts and grenades, pivoting character build from self preservation to healing allies. His gadget is Sanctum, a field projector that heals allies, while damaging and slowing enemies.&nbsp;<i></i></p>
<p>Finally there’s Nakata the ninja assassin, joining Nightfall to atone for his former sins. With swords and bows, he’s a melee specialist that can block and parry larger enemies, but can pivot from front line melee combat to more nimble hit and run tactics. His gadget is the Hebi-ken grappling hook, which can amp up attacks if you grapple to enemies.</p>
<p>There are six specialists with the game at launch, with the first three having been <a href="https://killingfloor3.com/news/nightfall-news-specialist-deep-dive/">revealed back in October</a>. These included Foster the Commando, Devlin the Firebug and Imran the Engineer.</p>
<p>In general, though, fans of horde more games and previous Killing Floor titles will know what to expect from Killing Floor 3. This is a wave-based zombie horde shooter that will keep you on your toes as enemies hound you, forcing you to get around the map, set traps, use the environment, and survive as long as possible.</p>

			<p>Shortly after its announcement, Square Enix revealed the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2909400/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REBIRTH/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> PC system requirements, detailing what players will need to run the game at different resolutions, quality settings, and target framerate.</p>
<p>The minimum system requirements targeting 1080p resolution, Low quality preset, and 30 FPS are not particularly demanding, although the game won't run on really old GPUs such as NVIDIA GTX series cards and anything older than the Radeon RX 6600. Interestingly enough, for 1080p resolution, Medium quality preset, 60 FPS and 4K resolution, High quality preset and 60 FPS, Windows 11 is recommended as the OS alongside beefier CPUs and GPUs. To enjoy Final Fantasy VII Rebirth at the highest resolution, highest quality setting, and 60 FPS, players will need either an AMD Ryzen 7 5700X or Intel i7-10700 CPU and either a Radeon RX 7900 XTX or NVIDIA RTX 4080.</p>
<p>You can find the full Final Fantasy VII Rebirth system requirements below.</p>

		<p>Obsidian Entertainment shared a new trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, with the not too surprising news that their RPG sequel is also coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC, in 2025. Oh, and day one in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a>, of course.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Outer Worlds 2: First Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I_rvTE-3S4c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>That’s right, the notion of Xbox exclusivity for this game has been vented out the airlock, though that’s fairly sensible in this case. Microsoft acquired the studio back in 2018, but chose not to buy out the publishing deal with Private Division, which allowed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/22/the-outer-worlds-review/">The Outer Worlds</a> to release cross-platform across PS4, Xbox One and PC. The Outer Worlds 2 is Xbox published, but…. well, Xbox is effectively giving up on platform exclusivity. It’s not clear if this will be a simultaneous release, but there’s nothing to suggest timed exclusivity in this instance.</p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 will very much follow in the tone and style of the original, but promises to go bigger and broader on pretty much every level. There’s the new colony to explore in Arcadia, which is the home of skip drive technology, and which you explore as a new Earth Directorate agent trying to figure out if it’s responsible for all the big and scary rifts that are threatening the whole galaxy.</p>
<p>There’s various factions vying for power which you’ll have to navigate, balancing what amounts to the church, state and capitalism, and just as in the original, you’ll have a huge amount of sway over events. Well, depending on your chosen skills and how you do with skill checks and conversations, anyway.</p>

<p>You’ll be able to enlist a crew of companions to help you in your adventure, which will lean in on all of the party tropes of RPGs, with you making decisions and some of them dislike and then remembering that you did that.</p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 will feature within the Secret Level anthology series on Amazon Prime Video this month, with an episode dedicated to this universe to debut on 17th December, featuring a short story that takes place between the events of&nbsp;The Outer Worlds and The Outer Worlds 2.</p>
<p>This isn’t the only Obsidian game out next year, with the tongue being removed from cheek for their more serious fantasy RPG adventure <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/03/avowed-gets-new-release-date-of-february-18th-2025/">Avowed, coming out in February</a>. The Outer Worlds 2 will be a nice tonal companion to that!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-colossus-ico-director-fumito-ueda-new-unnamed-project-revealed-with-a-new-trailer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Fumito Ueda, the man behind excellent games like Shadow of the Colossus, Ico, and The Last Guardian, is working on a new project with his team genDESIGN.</p>
<p>This project, which has yet to be named, was revealed yesterday with a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNBSWSyk9Hg">trailer</a> shown during The Game Awards Show. Published by Epic Games, the yet-to-be-named project looks absolutely like what Fumito Ueda has done in the past, so we should probably expect creative gameplay and a really emotional story.</p>
<p><iframe title="Announcement Trailer For a New Upcoming Game From genDESIGN" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FNBSWSyk9Hg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Fumito Ueda and genDESIGN's last game was the aforementioned The Last Guardian, which was released on PlayStation 4 in 2016 after being in development for over eight years. You can learn more about the game by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-guardian-review/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>The Last Guardian offers something I don’t think I’ve ever experienced in games before – a relationship that feels very, very tangible. Trico implies so many things with his animations, his glances, his whines, the way he stomps his feet – he drips with more personality and charisma than any other game character in recent memory, and all of this can be put down to the fact that he’s not just an NPC, not simply an AI model you must direct about a stage, he feels like a friend. A special friend who cries when you are hurt, nuzzles you when you can stand, and demands his belly rubbed if you want him to do some jumps.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/patch-notes-7-how-an-unlikely-hero-called-wilmot-spawned-a-sustainable-franchise<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content" data-testid="featured-image"><p><span>Image via Hollow Ponds / Logo via Game Developer</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How do you build a franchise in a way that's sustainable ? It's a question the industry is grappling with from top to bottom, with the largest studios attempting to craft billion-dollar series capable of crossing the transmedia divide and smaller devs perhaps hoping to turn their indie darlings into household names.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">UK developer Hollow Ponds, the outfit behind </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hohokum</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot's Warehouse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, might have found an answer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The studio, along with a team of frequent collaborators, has crafted a burgeoning franchise around an unlikely figure. Enter Wilmot, the beaming warehouse manager and star of organizational puzzler </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot's Warehouse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Five years after the title debuted, Wilmot has swapped the stock-taking for jigsaw-making in laid back sequel </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot Works It Out</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. At around the same time, Hollow Ponds also unveiled the Wilmot's Warehouse board game–a cooperative rollick developed with help from&nbsp;design studio and publisher CMYK and board game-focused outlet Shut Up &amp; Sit Down.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing how they transformed Wilmot from blue collar worker into an unassuming leading man, Hollow Ponds founder and creative director Ricky Haggett explains the studio initially benefited from a series of rather happy accidents–but a propensity for pragmatism also paid off. "We weren't like 'we're going to go big on Wilmot,'" explains Haggett, noting the board game and the video game sequel were "two completely different things."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although they eventually launched at a similar time, the board game actually coalesced during the pandemic. Before lockdown, Haggett would host regular board game hangouts with a few friends, including game designer, researcher, and lecturer David King. King has made a bunch of board games and would often bring concepts to those soirees–including a very roughshod morsel inspired by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot's Warehouse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">King unveiled that particular concept during the very last meeting the group held before COVID-19 (and lockdowns) took hold. Yet, despite being in the primordial stages of development, Haggett was able to refine the idea, which riffs on the concept of the video game without replicating it directly, throughout the pandemic by continuing to host virtual game nights.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We started figuring out what be a good size of grid. We started figuring out what a good cadence adding objects [would be]," he says. "For a while, we had things being added and taken away constantly. We had lots and lots of cards, which did lots of weird spatial things to the warehouse. We made lots of changes, and we just gradually whittled it down in a very unpressured way."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Time and freedom. Two things most game developers crave, but can very rarely count on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Haggett says that by constantly tweaking the project during the pandemic, he was able to reach a point where it was 80 percent done by the time he approached CMYK. Shut Up &amp; Sit Down production and marketing manager Matt Lees also provided valuable feedback that "fixed the last weird problem" plaguing the project–which largely revolved around how to end the game by way of a frantic card-matching (or order fulfilment) phase. "The whole experience of designing that game was ego free," says Haggett. "People from all directions were suggesting things and having an open chat. [...] None of it generally felt stressful. It's actually a lovely antitheses to trying to fix all the bugs in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">."</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bHa17b9fJAE?si=hSn7uEE_pFeS9TGk" height="100%px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, where is the overlap between Wilmot's exploits in the digital and physical realms? Well, it's difficult to untangle. Haggett says Hollow Ponds has noticed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot's Warehouse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> sales spikes that could be linked to the launch of the board game–although with the sequel also hitting shelves at a similar time, it's hard to separate the two. It has, however, visibly expanded the Wilmot footprint–a soaring achievement given the character's lack of feet. "We've definitely see people talk about the video game on board game-centric places saying 'hey, this is a video game as well,' and we've definitely seen people who just like the video game buying the board game, even though they're not necessarily board game people."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's cross-pollination, then, but what about the financial aspect? Haggett says Hollow Ponds hasn't quite made its money back on first quarter sales of the board game, but that it isn't far off. He notes that second quarter sales will include the holidays and retailers who've just ordered units, and feels the board game will be akin to a snowball gathering momentum. As we've already mentioned, it also landed at a fortuitous time, placing more eyes on Wilmot as Hollow Ponds prepared to debut a sequel in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot Works It Out</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Haggett tells us that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot's Warehouse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is still pulling in thousands of pounds each quarter, but massively surpassed expectations when it launched in 2019 thanks in part to an Xbox Game Pass deal the studio secured. The company then received cash from Sony to deliver a PlayStation port. Haggett acknowledges those deals, however, are by no means guaranteed and advises caution when working on titles of that scale. "I think if you were making a Wilmot-sized game I would be scared of spending more than around £200,000," he says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He explains the budget for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot Works It Out</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was bigger but still in the "low hundreds of thousands of pounds." Hollow Ponds also secured financing from the UK Games Fund (£25,000) that allowed them to hire a programmer to create a prototype, which according to Haggett was "pretty much what the game ended up being." It helped that Haggett was able to kickstart the project by taking the source code from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot's Warehouse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and stripping out all of the warehouse jiggery-pokery to create a "little jigsaw prototype." Meanwhile, Wilmot co-creator Richard Hogg set about creating the artwork that would become the myriad of jigsaws featured in-game, taking on a huge amount of work in the process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Haggett estimates production took around 12 months in total, although that time was spread across years due to the need to support other projects. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot Works It Out</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> launched on Steam on October 23, 2024, for £12.79 (a similar price point to the first game) and sold twice as well as its predecessor during its first month on shelves. It marks the second title the studio has released in 2024 after multiplayer adventure </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which was a much larger and more complex undertaking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Haggett says </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> hasn't sold "incredibly well" but again highlights that Hollow Ponds was able to sign an Xbox Game Pass deal, presumably mitigating some financial risk. He remains "very happy" with the game itself, and notes the reception and feedback from players has been "great." Still, cashflow is important–and therein lies the balancing act.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Making big things is useful," says Haggett, explaining how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>I Am Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> enabled the company to secure larger amounts of funding and work with influential publishers such as Annapurna Interactive. "But you can't guarantee you're going to be able to find publishers to fund your video games, and if you can't do that then it's helpful if you have smaller projects to fill in the cash flow at times," he continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You know, we're not a studio that has all of our employees working on a game. We don't really have many employees at all–we're a husband and wife team with one producer as a full-time employee.

If we did we'd be screwed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Nonetheless, there are gaps between [projects]. Even in the best case scenario there are naturally gaps. And its nice to be able to fill those with the smaller projects that bring in money that bumps the cashflow. Every little thing you have out there in the world is a little revenue stream, and it's a lot easier to get lots of little trickles of revenue from smaller, low-risk projects than massive mega projects."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In an era when phrases like 'survive to 2025' have (perhaps rather naively) been tossed around, perhaps there's something to be said for tempering blockbuster ambitions and championing reliable stalwarts like Wilmot.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Status Report: The Headlines that matter">Status Report: The Headlines that matter</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/itch-io-taken-down-by-collectible-maker-funko-and-ai-tool-brand-shield">Report: Itch.io taken down by collectible maker Funko and AI tool Brand Shield</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> // Indie game marketplace itch.io was briefly taken down last weekend and co-founder Leaf Corcoran said the culprit was none other than collectible maker Funko. He claimed Funko is leveraging AI-powered brand protection technology called Brand Shield that sent a "bogus phishing report" to itch's registrar, which proceeded to disable the domain. The storefront was eventually restored, but the ordeal looks to have kickstarted a feud between Corcoran and the Funko Pop! maker. This might become the most bizarre beef in the game industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/future-publishing-signs-content-partnership-with-openai">Future Publishing signs content partnership with OpenAI</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> // UK media company Future Publishing has signed a deal with OpenAI that will enable the ChatGPT maker to access content from its 200-plus brands. Those brands include game industry publications such as Edge, GamesRadar, and PC Games, and the response from a number of journalists who've worked for the company indicated the deal has gone down like a lead balloon coated in cement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/ubisoft-kills-xdefiant-and-closes-studios-in-san-franciso-and-osaka">Ubisoft kills XDefiant and closes studios in San Francisco and Osaka</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> // Ubisoft wasn't the only company to make layoffs over the past couple of weeks, but it was particularly notable to see another major studio carve through internal teams after trying and failing to launch a live service shooter. XDefiant only debuted in May but is now being tossed on the scrapheap. Ubisoft said 277 people will "likely" be laid off as a result. Don't worry, though, because the French publisher also confirmed the games-as-as-service model will remain "central" to its business strategy moving forward. What a relief.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Feature Creep: Originals and interviews for the discerning reader">Feature Creep: Originals and interviews for the discerning reader</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/google-latest-ai-innovation-offers-a-putrid-vision-of-game-development">Opinion: Google's latest AI innovation offers a putrid vision of game development</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">// Google recently unveiled a new AI-powered world model called Genie 2 that was being paraded around as a tool with the potential to change video game development forever. What it actually proved, was that companies like Google simply do not understand how or why game developers create-outlining exactly why there's a growing, often ferocious, disconnect between AI-touting tech firms and the development community.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/insulation-vs-isolation-the-question-defining-the-future-of-australia-s-game-industry">Insulation vs isolation: The question defining the future of Australia's game industry</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> // A couple of months back, roaming reporter George Osborn spent a few weeks down under to learn how the Australian game industry is faring after a turbulent year that has left studios around the world struggling to survive–including some of those in the sprawling region.
