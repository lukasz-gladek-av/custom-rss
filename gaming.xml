<p>The catchily-titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> was one of our favourite announcements out of the Switch 2 reveal Direct back in April. A lot of us missed the original remake when it arrived on beefier consoles back in 2020, and even those who did manage to get around to it were excited by the prospect of playing it on the go.</p>
<p>Nintendo and Square Enix have kept quiet on any further information about the game in the months since (come on, we want a release date!), so we were pleased to see it join the third-party lineup in Nintendo's Switch 2 booth at Gamescom this year. With its 40+ hour campaign, this has the potential to be a pretty hefty port, so would the new hardware be able to keep up?</p>
<p>Fortunately, the lovely Felix was on hand in Cologne to blast through a 15-minute FFVII preview and fill us in on what we can expect. In short, it's looking really rather good.</p>
<p>Mr. Felix was happy to report that the portion of the game he got to sample ran super smoothly, with a frame rate that he put somewhere between 30 and 60fps. The accompanying over-the-shoulder footage shows it in action, and we have to agree, that smoothness is a welcome sight (particularly after the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-uh-oh-elden-ring-on-switch-2-has-issues-in-handheld-mode">worrying stories</a> of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a>).</p>
<p>Of course, he only got the opportunity to see the early introduction in this preview, so there's no guarantee that things will be quite so strong as the game opens up, but it looks promising so far! You can check out Felix's thoughts in full in the above discussion with the wonderful Zion.</p>
<p>Now then, how about we go more specific on that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-scores-switch-2-release-window">'Winter' release window</a>, eh?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This week was a big one for Activision and all the studios that work on the popular <a href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-call-of-duty-games-from-worst-to-best-1844765026"><em>Call of Duty</em> franchise</a>. At Gamescom, devs took to the stage of Opening Night Live to show off our first real look at <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-opening-night-live-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trailer-2000618479"><em>Black Ops 7</em></a>, the new main entry in the franchise. But due to various reasons, including hype for EA’s <em>Battlefield 6</em> and fans feeling burned out, the vibes are all off, and for the first time in years, it feels like the <em>Call of Duty</em> empire is shaking.</p> <p>Even before <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s big gameplay reveal at Gamescom, the upcoming shooter was being targeted online by fans and critics who loved the <a href="https://kotaku.com/oh-thank-god-the-battlefield-6-open-beta-is-back-2000617797"><em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta</a>. Players, myself included, praised <em>BF6</em>‘s gritty combat, boots-on-the-ground action, sharp visuals, squad gameplay, and snappy shooting. For many players online, it felt like a return to the realistic military sims that once dominated the industry back in the early to mid aughts. I’m talkin’ games like <em>Battlefield 3</em>, <em>Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</em>, <em>Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter</em>, and<em> Rainbow Six Vegas.&nbsp;</em></p> <p><em>BF6′</em>s beta, its popularity, and the reaction to it led to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/former-blizzard-president-predicts-battlefield-6-is-going-to-boot-stomp-black-ops-7-because-call-of-duty-has-become-lazy/">former Blizzard president Mike Ybarra tweeting</a>: “<em>Battlefield</em> [6] will boot stomp <em>CoD</em> this year. But the real win here is <em>CoD</em> won’t be lazy anymore, and we’ll all get better FPS games for it.” It didn’t help that during the <em>BF6</em> beta, <a href="https://x.com/CallofDutyWire/status/1954624776921894980">a <em>Call of Dut</em>y rollercoaster gun went viral</a> for all the wrong reasons. And before that, players were upset over expensive crossover skins, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmvByyks-Fc">including<em> American Dad</em> and <em>Beavis &amp; Butthead c</em>osmetics</a>, that some felt were turning<em> Black Ops 6</em> and <em>Warzone</em> into <em>Fortnite</em>, a game famous for its wild IP sandbox that features Goku, Batman, and more.</p>

 <p>This all led to Tuesday, when <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s first gameplay trailer premiered at Gamescom. It did so under a lot of scrutiny and in an atmosphere where even longtime vets of the series weren’t happy about the state of the game. So when the trailer showed off wild, trippy gameplay involving dream worlds and robots and strange sci-fi tech, it went over very, very poorly online. On Reddit, you can find fans saying they are done.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9txkGBj_trg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Another indicator that this new <em>Black Ops 7</em> reveal isn’t landing with fans is how poorly it has been received on YouTube. The comments below the trailer are filled with players claiming they are going to pre-order <em>BF6</em> instead and wondering what happened to <em>Call of Duty.</em> <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1958183849877201177">As reported by <em>CharlieIntel</em></a>, the <em>Black Ops 7</em> reveal trailer has only around 36k likes. That makes it one of the least liked trailers in the franchise’s history.</p> <p>Things only got worse when <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-devs-paying-attention-to-community-feedback-on-goofy-skins"><em>IGN</em> asked Miles Leslie</a>, associate creative director on the game, if<em> Black Ops 7</em>&nbsp;was going to feature silly crossover skins. Leslie claimed that the devs were “always looking at community feedback” and then proceeded to offer up a nothingburger answer about trying to “calibrate” future skins based on “feedback” and making sure “all fans feel represented.”&nbsp; This answer didn’t go over well with players, especially when <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/it-has-to-be-grounded-battlefield-6-devs-say-cosmetics-wont-be-as-goofy-as-call-of-duty-but-that-sounds-almost-too-good-to-be-true/">compared to the response given by <em>BF6</em>‘s design director Shashank Uchil</a> when asked a similar question about cosmetics.</p>

 <p>“It has to be grounded. That is what <em>BF3</em> and <em>BF4</em> was—it was all soldiers, on the ground,” said Uchil. “It’s going to be like this. I don’t think it needs&nbsp;Nicki Minaj. Let’s keep it real, keep it grounded.”</p> <p>It would be foolish to count <em>Call of Duty</em> out in 2025. The franchise is still incredibly popular, especially with people who aren’t online every day, posting on Reddit and Discord. In 2024, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgg2djbq4c2n"><em>Black Ops 6</em> was still the best-selling premium video game of the year</a>, and the overall franchise sold more games last year than any other series. I would be shocked if <em>Battlefield 6</em> outsells<em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> this holiday season. Still, it’s clear that the vibes are rotten with this year’s <em>Call of Duty.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>It feels like fans are getting burned out on back-to-back direct sequels (something the franchise avoided for nearly 20 years), expensive cosmetics, <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-generative-ai-call-duty-gamescom-2025-slop-2000618833">AI-produced slop</a>, the series getting wackier and weirder, and a sense that the people making the games aren’t listening to the people playing the games. This isn’t entirely new. For as long as<em> Call of Duty</em> has been popular, people have been hating on it. But this year, grumpy fans and tired vets have<em> Battlefield 6</em> to rally around, an FPS that feels like it was designed in a lab to recreate the experience of playing those old Xbox 360-era military shooters people loved so much. In a way, it almost feels like <em>CoD</em> fans are hoping for <em>BF6</em> to punish<em> Black Ops 7</em>, and they seem willing to pay money to help kick Activision in the gut.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>TT Games is back with a bang with the upcoming release of LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, telling the story of decades of the Caped Crusader’s history, and multiplayer details have already been announced.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-revealed-at-gamescom-onl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Revealed at Gamescom</a> with a 2026 release window, eyebrows have been raised following news that LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight seemingly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-will-feature-only-7-playable-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only has seven playable characters</a>, which would be a huge change given previous titles have featured hundreds of minifigures to choose from.</p>



<p>Multiplayer has been a core feature in TT Games’ LEGO franchise for years, with no major changes to the format so far. Here, we’ve got all the details on whether that approach is being adjusted with the new LEGO Batman title.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-have-online-multiplayer">Will LEGO Batman: Legacy of The Dark Knight Have Online Multiplayer?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Switch up. Image via TT Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight will not support online multiplayer or co-op, it has been confirmed.</strong></p>



<p>In an <a href="https://legogamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/43979623023123-LEGO-Batman-Legacy-of-the-Dark-Knight-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FAQ post</a> about the game, it was announced that online co-op will not be available, continuing the trend from other LEGO titles from TT Games.</p>



<p>The most recent release, LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, also did not feature online co-op. While there has been a desire from players for the feature to be added, it will not be available in LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight.</p>



<p>It remains be seen whether any future LEGO games from TT Games change this trend, though it doesn’t seem likely currently.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-have-split-screen-co-op">Will LEGO Batman: Legacy of The Dark Knight Have Split-Screen Co-Op?</h2>



<p><strong>While LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight does not have online co-op support, two-player couch co-op has been confirmed as a feature.</strong></p>



<p>Couch co-op is a staple of TT Games’ LEGO titles, and, while couch co-op is becoming increasingly rarer in modern gaming, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight will not be removing the feature.</p>



<p>Only two players are supported at a single time, however, which makes sense given that a fair amount of screen space is required to truly enjoy the LEGO experience.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for the next couch co-op title to play with a friend, partner, or other relative, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight could tick the boxes.</p>



<p>What do you want to see featured in LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight? Let us know in the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

            <p>
John Carpenter's Halloween is the latest horror movie classic to get the multiplayer treatment, and it's coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime in 2026.
</p>
<p>
Halloween is being developed by Illfonic, the studio behind the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/friday-the-13th-the-game">Friday the 13th: The Game</a>, Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game, and Predator Hunting Grounds. And like those movie adaptations, Halloween is also being designed as a "one-versus-many" asymmetrical horror affair as the iconic Michael Myers pursues the residents of Haddonfield.
</p>
<p>
"In dynamic and ever-changing 1v4 asymmetrical multiplayer matches, hero players must arm themselves with everyday household items, weapons, and knowledge to combat an unpredictable and unkillable enemy," Illfonic explains. "Convincing townsfolk and contacting the police will lead to increasingly powerful and thorough neighbourhood patrols. To even the odds, you can command and equip NPCs with weapons to outsmart or even overpower The Shape, providing precious windows for escape."

<p>
Illfonic reckons its take on Halloween "masterfully recreates" the ambience of the original 1978 movie, with talk of multiple maps set across "authentic" Haddonfield locations, and a soundtrack inspired by John Carpenter's classic score. Notably too, its familiar asymmetrical multiplayer mode will be accompanied by an offline single-player story mode featuring bots.
</p>
<p>
There's no word of a release date for Halloween beyond its "2026" arrival on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, but there's a mood-setting trailer above.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Excitement levels continue to rise for Hollow Knight: Silksong ahead of release, and a flood of new gameplay from a demo has made its way online, leading to the question of whether it can be downloaded.</p>



<p>In our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/">hands-on preview</a>, we made it clear that the hype for Hollow Knight: Silksong is well placed, and the assessment from others who have gotten a chance to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-playable-demo-confirmed-by-xbox-for-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">play at Gamescom</a> is similar. Now, though, players around the world want their own chance to play.</p>



<p>The guide below details everything we know about the Hollow Knight: Silksong demo, including whether you can add it to your library to try out.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-hollow-knight-silksong-demo-available-to-download">Is The Hollow Knight: Silksong Demo Available to Download?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Worth the wait. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, there is not currently a Hollow Knight: Silksong demo available to download, and all gameplay footage currently emerging is from Gamescom.</strong></p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is playable on both Xbox and Nintendo Switch platforms at Gamescom in Cologne, but it is exclusively available at the event for the time being. Therefore, it cannot be downloaded.</p>



<p>The demo is also the same stage of the game that was first playable at E3 2019 six years ago, which, though it may be surprising, could mean it takes place very early in the game.</p>



<p>Fans around the world will need to wait at least a little while longer to get a taste of the game, as currently the only details we know about the playable demo is it’s availability at Gamescom. </p>



<h2 id="h-will-there-be-a-hollow-knight-silksong-demo">Will There Be A Hollow Knight: Silksong Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>No announcements have been made regarding a Hollow Knight: Silksong demo, but there could be one provided before launch.</strong></p>



<p>A big Hollow Knight: Silksong announcement is coming today via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGeJwsUP9c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>, which could reveal the release date or details about a demo, early access, or other details.</p>



<p>If there is a demo, expect it to be available across all platforms, though given the hype for the game, it could release without one. </p>



<p>For now, though, there isn’t a way to play Hollow Knight: Silksong early, but keep an eye on Insider Gaming for more coverage and news as it breaks.</p>



<p>Is Hollow Knight: Silksong going to be a Game of the Year contender? Let us know your thoughts in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>. </p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> has received its official ESRB rating, sparking hope that release date news is on the way soon.</p>
<p>Now updated on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/metroid-prime-4-beyond-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOoq0XKl9zufnvocUdO1Qzyc9ZClShISZIsMBBfKAd94rNIsaJFY2">US eShop</a>, Metroid Prime 4 has received a Teen rating, with animated blood and violence. In the UK, it has a provisional PEGI 12. These ratings are the same as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a>.</p>

Oi oi, where my Janeway fans at? Where my Parisians and my Torresians? Can I get a whoop, whoop for Chakotay? A high five for Seven of Nine? Daedalic have announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown">Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</a>, a "story-based survival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game" adaptation of the loneliest of the classic Treks. Created by developers gameXcite, who I may yet forgive for capitalising their name that way, it asks you to "manage systems and crew, engage in diplomacy, navigate difficult moral decisions, and face the unknown". It's got a cutaway dollhouse spaceship and a HUD made up to resemble a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek">Star Trek</a> bridge display. Also, Ensign Harry Kim is here! He wants orders. Kim, your orders are to roll that trailer.

<p>
Here's some blurb from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2643390/Star_Trek_Voyager__Across_the_Unknown/">the Steam page</a>: 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Set aboard the U.S.S. Voyager and deep in the unexplored reaches of the Delta Quadrant, Star Trek Voyager: Across the Unknown invites players to relive--and redefine--the legendary starship's journey back to earth. The game blends exploration, ship &amp; resource management, roguelite elements, and meaningful choices. Experience crew dynamics and a fresh take on a beloved sci-fi universe -- with what-if scenarios that open up new possibilities. 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
If you're like me, you are presently being torn in half by the contrast between your apathy for yet another set of "roguelike elements", and your enthusiasm for the what-if scenarios. Maybe an episode where Janeway becomes the Borg Queen? Maybe the Doctor gets to be captain? Maybe Neelix undergoes some kind of Garrus-style reinvention as a badass with hairy ears? All that may have actually happened, I can't remember. Some more from the Steam page: 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Take a risky approach or play it safe. Be diplomatic or let phasers do the talking. Research technologies that were shunned by the crew. But: Be prepared to deal with the consequences of your actions! The game features rogue-like elements, so in each run you will encounter different situations and even iconic characters might meet an early end if you don't react accordingly. 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
There's a base-building component: you'll add facilities to the Voyager's innards as you go, in the manner popularised by XCOM: Enemy Unknown. I'm less sold on the tiddly, top-down spaceship movement within solar systems, which recalls <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> at its dinkiest and makes the Delta <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quadrant">Quadrant</a> seem as strange and enveloping as Center Parcs. But I do like the sound of the away missions, in which you get to handpick a team of named faces and redshirts.</p><p>"A team with skills that complement each other might be best suited for the task, but it is up to you to call the shots," the developers comment. "Minimize the risk for the team's members, rush headlong into danger, or take a scientific approach - you decide." All this and, of course, ship-to-ship combat, in which you'll assign crews to stations and target individual systems.
</p>
<p>
There's no release date. In case it wasn't obvious already, my excitement about this game is at least 80% nostalgia spike, with another 5% consisting of furtive teenage memories of certain saucy fan fiction websites. Finally, we can make Paris and Chakotay bone. The developers don't have much form for space sims: going by their website, they have hitherto specialised exclusively in Asterix comic adaptations. I guess a starship is a kind of Gallic village? Let's finish off by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMHx7fiLEow">watching the original Voyager intro</a> again.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>WarGaming’s World of Tanks: HEAT might have turned a few heads when it was first announced during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live, but after getting hands-on with the game in a behind-the-scenes opportunity, I’m pleased to say it’s awesome!</p>



<p>For full disclosure and context, I have played a few hundred hours of World of Tanks and World of Tanks: Blitz, so I am pretty familiar with WarGaming titles and the mechanics behind tank combat in their games (important for later). Unfortunately, my hands-on opportunity was limited to around 15 minutes against AI bots, which, for a multiplayer title, is never great. Still, I managed to gain a good understanding of where the developers want to take HEAT and why they picked this particular direction.</p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-meets-tanks">Call of Duty Meets Tanks</h2>



<p>I don’t think anyone was crazily surprised to see yet another free-to-play multiplayer shooter announced during Gamescom, but WarGaming’s World of War: HEAT has something fairly unique going for it – Tanks. Sticking with the World of Tanks has been criticised by the community that has been testing the game under the codename Project Cold War, but honestly, after getting hands-on with the game, it makes sense. While I understand that the World of Tanks brand is catered to a specific audience that prefers accuracy, HEAT offers the brand a chance to tap into a wider and more accessible audience.</p>



<p>The only way I can logically describe HEAT is that it’s similar to Call of Duty in terms of accessibility and gameplay loop. If you view the Tanks as Weapons (which I suppose they are), things make a lot more sense. In HEAT, your Tank can be fully customized just like a weapon in Call of Duty with paint jobs, charms, and even a 100-point system for different upgrades (similar to Battlefield 6’s 100-point system for firearms). </p>



<p>The Call of Duty similarities don’t end there, either, with HEAT offering players various game modes, including Domination, Kill Confirmed, and Search and Destroy.</p>



<p>However, one layer of complexity that’s still maintained in the game from the classic World of Tanks title is that players still have to learn Tanks’ weak spots and vulnerabilities in their armor. However, to make the game more accessible to players, the crosshairs are similar to those in World of Tanks Arcade mode, where they indicate the armor’s penetration points, but this time in a handy x-ray-like vision.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-a-hero-shooter">A Hero Shooter?</h2>



<p>The game’s setting in an alternative WW2 universe gives the developers the chance to be a little bit more creative with the tanks and their accessories, allowing for some tanks to have Gatling guns, missiles, and so on attached to the vehicle. </p>



<p>In HEAT, the ‘heroes’ are the Tank drivers, who, at launch, only have two tanks assigned to them. The developers tell me that on launch, each character will have an initial tank unlocked, with the second tank being unlocked through progression, or, of course, paid premium features to make the progression faster. They also tell me that this is just for the initial launch of the game, and that more tanks per character will come at a later date.</p>



<p>Other additions to tanks outside of the customization options are a boosting feature, which allows you to get from point A to point B quickly, or flank around enemies to hit their weak spots. At one point, I needed to unleash my inner ‘Fury’ and boost around an enemy and hit the tanks weapon spot from behind.</p>



<p>Just like in other hero shooters, Tanks also have abilities, which charge up over time, allowing for some hectic moments with weapons, shields, and more, which can change the course of a match in a matter of moments.</p>



<h2 id="h-genuinely-great">Genuinely Great</h2>



<p>It isn’t often that I walk away from a game demo, especially at a convention where you’re tired and playing on an unfamiliar setup, but overall, I think that WarGaming does have something special on their hands with HEAT.</p>



<p>The potential to grow the game beyond what I played with other progression options, expansions, and even Esports, which the developers say they currently don’t have planned, but is something they will do if there’s a demand, is exciting.</p>



<p>As for the release date, the developers tell me that while an exact release date isn’t planned, they are aiming to release World of War Tanks: HEAT in 2026 on the PC (and Steam Deck!), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. I did ask about Nintendo Switch 2, but currently, they are focused only on these platforms and will reevaluate when the game launches.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to World of Tanks: HEAT?</p>

<p>Dubbed the <strong>TT PRO</strong> and <strong>TT MAX</strong>, the design is kind of a cross between the Xbox and PlayStation, utilising the former's overall shape, yet shifting the left analogue stick to the bottom for a more symmetrical design. The controller was originally showcased last year as the 'Libra MAX', but Gulikit has since been hard at work finalising the design and specs.</p>
<p>Both models utilise Gulikit's brand new 720° tension-adjustable TMR analogue sticks with adjustable star-ring RGB lighting, rumble motors with a total of nine adjustable levels of vibration, 'Smart Trigger' technology to let players toggle between mouse-like micro-switch triggers and pressure sensitive analogue Hall Effect triggers, and of course, gyro aiming.</p>
<p>You've also got two different types of 'floating' d-pad designs (though we're not <em>completely</em> sold on the satellite dish-inspired design), four swappable rear paddles, and an extra ABXY key-cap kit in case you want to swap between Switch and PC layouts.</p>
<p>As for the differences between the two models, the TT MAX offers up an extra stick cap kit to customise your analogue sticks between three different height options, the ability to toggle between 8-directional and 4-direction d-pad functionalities, and motion-sense technology for PC gaming.</p>
<p>Gulikit is aiming to release both controllers in <strong>October 2025</strong>, with the PRO priced at <strong>$49.99</strong> and the MAX at <strong>$69.99</strong>. As with the company's recent releases, both models will be able to wake the Switch 2 from Sleep Mode - bosh.</p>

</p>
<p>
But then came the revelation that this much-delayed sequel to a quintessentially faction-led RPG from a company <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-respond-to-the-accusation-that-they-fix-games-with-paid-dlc-we-try-to-find-a-middle-ground">famous for downloadable add-ons</a> would <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-sticks-two-bloodsucker-clans-including-the-sexy-one-behind-paid-day-one-dlc">sell two of its vampire clans as day-one DLC</a>. How we laughed! How we clutched our faces and chittered like gerbils! How we ran outside, begging for the moon to fall on our heads! Despair springs anew.

<p>
Our reporter on the ground at Gamescom is hardware editor James 'Hardwearing' Archer. He caught up with current and hopefully, final Bloodlines 2 developers The Chinese Room in person yesterday and, much like a parent coaxing a child away from a poisonous snake, casually asked them 'What's the thinking behind splitting off two of the clans as DLC?' 
</p>
<p>
The answer, broadly, is that the new clans represent additional work on top of The Chinese Room's original plans for the game - sometimes at Paradox's request - so it's fair to flog those bits separately. As for releasing the DLC alongside the main game, which naturally suggests that it could be sold as part of the main game, a PR told James, not in so many words, that they don't want players to have to wait.
</p><p>
Narrative director Ian Thomas attempted to spell it all out. "It's worthwhile saying that the game - well, I've only been on the game, I think, for two and a half years - but during that period, we've had huge cycles of 'What are the player base thinking? What are they asking for? How does that fit in? What does the early alpha testing say, and what are they actually asking for?'" he said. (Side note to any more prosperous game developers reading: I feel like you are all taught by media training people to stall for time with rhetorical questions. Please stop doing this, it's very exasperating and only makes me suspicious.)
</p>
<p>
"So we've made a huge amount of changes over that time, based on that cycle, if you like," Thomas continued. "Including a massive amount of story content and features and all the rest of it. So we have been expanding it from where we originally planned to land it, I think, constantly, and Paradox have been really good when we go, or when the clients go, or when Paradox go: 'We should add a bit more here. Let's push the date back.' As you know, the date has pushed back, but that has been to fatten it out into something that we feel does land where the players want it."
</p>
<p>
According to Thomas, The Chinese Room are still "adding additional content even over the last few weeks". The extra clan material and associated story bits fall into this rubric of post-concept 'fattening'. So do certain character customisation features like hairstyles, piercings and tattoos, according to project design director Jey Hicks. "It's not all, like, just fluff that we're chucking in," he said. "It's all got that same quality there." 
</p>
<p>
The original Bloodlines shipped with seven vampire clans, including one of the clans Bloodlines 2 wants to paywall. They appear to be very different games, however - Paradox have taken to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2-is-more-spiritual-successor-than-sequel-to-a-a-competently-good-game-by-2004-standards-say-paradox">describing the sequel as a "spiritual successor"</a> - as one might expect from the fact that The Chinese Room have sod-all experience making CRPGs. I think it would be fair to argue that Bloodlines 2 only having four clans by default simply reflects a necessary change of direction, however much fans of the original might dislike that change of direction. It's also worth noting that the conditions of game development have changed enormously since 2004, and that given <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-again-and-hardsuit-games-are-no-longer-developing-it">the turmoil of Bloodlines 2's overall development under Paradox</a>, it's miraculous they have anything to show at all.</p><p>But that's not the case the developers made to us at Gamescom. And in particular, none of the above really explains the decision to ship features returning players would reasonably expect to form part of the base package as day-one 'extras'. The "additional work" argument would ring truer if the DLC clans landed after release; as it is, the designation as to what constitutes the original concept and what constitutes an 'extra' seems totally arbitrary. The language about not wanting fans to wait just feels like predictable camouflage for the boring truth that they'd like to make more money.

<p>Marvel Rivals continues to grow bigger and better, and Season 4 is now rapidly approaching. We’ve got all the details on when it’s expected to drop and what could feature.</p>



<p>Following the drop of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-3-5-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 3.5</a>, which introduced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-blade-guide-release-date-stats-abilities-team-up-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blade as a playable character</a>, the game has been transitioning toward Season 4, which takes place after the defeat of Knull and Hela, who became the Queen in Black.</p>



<p>If you’re anxiously awaiting the drop of the new season, we’ve got all the details you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-4-release-date-amp-time">Marvel Rivals Season 4 Release Date &amp; Time</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New battles. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Although yet to be officially confirmed, Season 4 in Marvel Rivals is expected to begin on September 12, with several hints suggesting this is the case.</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, that would mark the four-week point since the start of Season 3.5, which is the Marvel Rivals schedule for new season drops, and the <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250819/41548_1254783.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ancient Powers Awaken event</a> is due to end on September 12.</p>



<p>The end date for the event should line up perfectly with the start of the new season, though the rewards will be available to earn permanently if you purchase the Premium Pass. The end time has been confirmed to be <strong>September 12th at 2am PT.</strong></p>



<p>In the table below, we’ve detailed what time the release will be in your timezone. However, remember that end of season patches come alongside downtime, so you’ll need to wait a little while longer for servers to open.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Marvel Rivals Season 4 Release Date &amp; Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">02:00, September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">04:00, September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">05:00, September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">British Summer Time (BST)</td><td data-align="center">09:00, September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST)</td><td data-align="center">19:00, September 12</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-what-s-coming-in-marvel-rivals-season-4">What’s Coming in Marvel Rivals Season 4?</h2>



<p><strong>Full details of exactly what is coming in Marvel Rivals Season 4 are yet to be shared, but we know it will feature a new character, new maps, and a new Season Pass.</strong></p>



<p>Following several leaks at launch, we know a long list of characters that have been found in datamines, but developers are keeping their cards close to their chests. However, there have been some teases during Season 3.5 on what may be coming.</p>



<p>In the game’s lore, Hela was defeated by Blade with Dracula’s sword and escaped to a mysterious Eighth City, expected to be the ancient city of K’un-Lun, and met a shadowy figure by the name of Dizang. Artwork for the character, who has glowing eyes and horns, has led many to speculate that one of the new heroes will be Daredevil.</p>



<p>The lore text also mentions that Hela is likely to be pursued by “one of her kin” for her actions and, with Loki and Thor already in the game, that could open the door to Angela.</p>



<p>If the pair are to feature, it could be Angela that appears first, as Dizang has previously been a possessed version of Daredevil who leads The Hand, and he could therefore take the role as Season 4’s main antagonist, before being rescued and restored to a normal state for the second half of the season.</p>



<p>This is all merely speculation at this stage, however, but it won’t be too much longer until we have an official reveal.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> is getting a new DLC update as well as its next story chapter on the 10th September.</p>
<p>The story update, which will be free, has you investigate a series of murders. It follows on directly from the main story of the base game, and will take you beneath Arrakeen where all manner of secrets await you.</p>
<p>As for the DLC, it'll cost $12.99 and is dubbed the "Lost Harvest" DLC. In it, you'll be called to a mysterious crashed ship out in the desert, and be able to build a new ground vehicle: The Treadwheel. This offers "no material benefit" over base vehicles in the game according to the Dune: Awakening DLC blog post, and can be traded with other players without the DLC.</p>

            <p>JRPG Lost Hellden has received a fresh gameplay trailer to show off its "Deep 2D" painted art style and action battle system.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Outside of video games, books are one of my biggest passions. I have been an avid reader for as long as I can remember, have had a library membership near enough my entire life, studied literature at university, and I have an ever growing collection of books at home. Ideally, I would like to have my own small bookstore but alas, some things are out of reach. Tiny Bookshop is a cosy book selling game that lets me live my dream, and it could be one of the best games to relax with.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tiny Bookshop Launch Trailer | Wholesome Games Celebration" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RFjy4EK7B_Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Tiny Bookshop you have moved to the small town of Bookstonbury with all your belongings in you car, and a shed hitched to the back of it. This is not any old shed, but the base of your travelling book selling business, where all sorts of people will come to get some page turners. The game starts small with your constrained collection of books, one shelving unit, and one location in which to sell, and you grow from there.</p>


<p>You have different genres including crime, drama, classics, fact, fantasy, travel, and kids books which means there’s a wide variety for customers to choose from, but it is not as simple as putting every genre out on display. As you come to know the people and the town, you will come to realise that each place has its own type of clientele that like certain genres. At the Waterfront, the sailors primarily like the travel books and fact books, while kids books are unlikely to sell so there is little point having them on display.</p>
<p>You have a limited stock of books that depletes each day as you sell them, so you need to spend money on acquiring more stock to sell. That is not the only thing you can spend your hard-earned money on though. Various characters have their own stores you can buy goods from, as does the local newspaper, and these items can provide bonuses. Certain objects will boost the sale chance of specific genres, while others may bring you in more money. However, it is not as simple as picking the items and activating them. You have to have the space in and around your little bookstore and also be aware of the negative traits some items have. For example, some scarier items will lower the chances of selling kids books as fewer kids may visit the shop. Once you open up the shop for the day, you cannot just sit back and let the customers peruse the shelves.</p>


<p>Occasionally, customers will ask you for a recommendation, giving you specific criteria. This is perhaps the most challenging part of the game, because when you stock your shelves before opening you have no idea what titles are going to be there. Each recommendation challenge has its own difficulty rating, with this affected by the types of books you have on your shelf and the number of books left in stock. Someone coming in early when the shelves are full are more likely to get what they are looking for, compared to someone coming in near closing time with shelves almost bare. The majority of the books are real books, so if you have some literary knowledge that can make it easier to recommend a title, and it feels good to get a match, but when you get it wrong it does feel annoying. Most of the time it will be down to you just getting it wrong, but there were a few instances where a books description and what someone was looking for seemed to match up, but the game did not like it so it was a failed recommendation.</p>
<p>In your life as a bookseller, you will get encouragement and tips from those that have made Bookstonbury their home. There are some regulars that come to visit who will have their specific tastes, like Tilde and her crime books, and as time passes you will learn more about each of these characters. As you get to know them, the different characters will make requests to help them, such as helping to put on a play, or set you a challenge like selling out all of your books in a specific location. There is no time limit or fail state with these requests or challenges so you can relax and get to them when you are ready to do them.</p>

<p>Tiny Bookshop has a calendar of events to look to as well, allowing you to maximise your book selling as you set up at these locations with higher footfall. The game also goes through the different seasons, and in each season some locations may be off limits or have minimal footfall so it is not worth the cost of setting up in those places. The artstyle throughout the game is easy on the eye, colourful, and adds to the chilled vibe of Tiny Bookshop. The music is also very good at setting the cosy atmosphere in a very lo-fi style. The characters are all decently written, but as time goes on you do start seeing repeated lines by each one. They also do not keep track of what they buy so sometimes you can just recommend them the same book they bought before.</p>

<p>"It's been kinda locked behind the GameCube/Nintendo wall all this time"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nightdive Studios' CEO Stephen Kick has once again reiterated his desire to remaster <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/eternal_darkness_sanitys_requiem">Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem</a> (or at the very least see <em>some</em> sort of rerelease), originally released on the GameCube in 2002.</p>
<p>If you remember back in 2022, Kick posted on social media to state that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/02/nightdive-studios-wants-to-remaster-titles-like-eternal-darkness-but-hasnt-had-any-luck-with-nintendo">Nightdive had been involved in discussions with Nintendo</a> about remastered some of its games, but noted that the company was "gun shy" about working with third-party developers. He followed up by saying that "Eternal Darkness is #1 on my list".</p>
<p>Now, in a new interview with Shacknews, Kick once again mentioned Eternal Darkness as one of the games high up on his so-called 'bucket list' of titles to remaster. At the very top is the 2000 FPS title <strong>The Operative: No One Lives Forever</strong> from Monolith Productions; a game that may well prove difficult to revisit thanks to complications around the IP rights.</p>
<p>Here's what Kick said about Eternal Darkness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I will say that there's another game really high on that list, and that would have to be Eternal Darkness. It's been kinda locked behind the GameCube/Nintendo wall all this time, and it's something that I would personally love to see get rereleased."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nightdive's next release for the Switch is a remaster of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/outlaws_plus_handful_of_missions_remaster">Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster</a>, originally released in 1997 and built on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/star_wars_dark_forces_remaster">Star Wars: Dark Forces</a>' Jedi engine.

<p>PowerWash Simulator 2 will be released day one in the Xbox Game Pass catalog to subcribers of the service, it has been revealed.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-revealed-with-new-announcement-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal earlier this year</a> confirmed a release before the end of 2025, which has since been narrowed down to Fall 2025. While there’s not an exact date, there is one huge bit of news.</p>



<p>Confirmed during Gamescom, where PowerWash Simulator 2 has a playable demo, the title will land on the Xbox Game Pass catalog as a day-one release.</p>



<h2 id="h-powerwash-simulator-2-releasing-on-game-pass">PowerWash Simulator 2 Releasing on Game Pass</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s coming. Image via FuturLab</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/PowerWashSim/status/1958197918210433486" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on X</a> (formerly Twitter), which came with fresh gameplay footage, it was announced that the title is coming to Xbox Game Pass day one and will make “Xbox feel a bit more gnomely this Fall.”</p>



<p>The confirmation isn’t super surprising, considering the initial game, which released on consoles in July 2022 after an early access period on Steam, also launched day one with the Game Pass service, where it has remained ever since.</p>



<p>Crucially, though, expansion packs for the first game are not included with a Game Pass subscription, and it remains to be seen whether the same approach is taken with the sequel.</p>



<p>PowerWash Simulator 2 features a fresh campaign to wash through, with new locations, new multi-stage jobs, new tools, and a home base that you can decorate with things you have collected on your journey.</p>



<p>New tools include an abseiling rig and a cherry picker, helping you get to those hard-to-reach spots that always seem to be just out of reach. For those playing online co-op, progression is shared, while couch co-op is also supported.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Forza Horizon 6 could be set in Japan, following a fresh leak that seemingly confirms the location for the title, which has yet to be officially confirmed.</p>



<p>With Forza Horizon 5 now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released on PlayStation 5</a>, and Forza Motorsport studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-motorsport-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Turn 10 suffering huge layoffs</a>, all eyes are cast towards Horizon 6 as the next entry in the beloved franchise, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-forza-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phil Spencer confirmed would release in 2026</a>.</p>



<p>Since first releasing in 2012, Playground Games has brought the Horizon Festival to Colorado, Southern France, Northern Italy, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Mexico. Now, it appears the franchise is heading to Japan.</p>



<h2 id="h-forza-horizon-6-leak-hints-at-japan">Forza Horizon 6 Leak Hints at Japan</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Tokyo Drift. Image via Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a now-deleted post, which was shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1mvq1t0/australian_car_import_company_cult_classic_may/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, Australian car import company Cult &amp; Classic posted an image of someone, said to be from the Forza Horizon team, down under, scanning Kei cars to feature in the series.</p>



<p>Kei cars are the smallest approved in Japan to drive on expressways and are rarely seen outside of the Far East, hence why someone from the Horizon development team would need to fly out to scan them.</p>



<p>If the setting is indeed in Japan, having an accurate representation of Kei cars would be needed for accuracy, as it would be weird to drive on the roads without seeing them, and it could tease that they will be purchasable in the game.</p>



<p>Of course, take this all with a significant pinch of salt as it is far from an official confirmation, but Japan has long been requested by the Horizon community, so it would be a perfect choice for Forza Horizon 6.</p>



<p>Japan is iconic in the street-racing scene, having been the location for The Fast &amp; Furious: Tokyo Drift movie.</p>



<p>Is Japan top of your wishlist as a location to play host to the Forza Horizon series? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/3356/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

"It may have been the shortest of demos, but so far, Silksong is very much singing to me, maybe even more than the original."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Kirby Air Riders – The First Preview</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">its big Nintendo Direct,</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-the-first-preview">we had the chance to play Kirby Air Riders at gamescom.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The maximalism of Kirby Air Riders is its core charm; it feels brewed from impish, chaotic-neutral alchemy," our previewer, Leanne Butkovic, said. "Even Nintendo is calling this a “vehicle action game,” not a kart racer, which honestly seems apt – a silly genre distinction for a purposefully unserious game.

handheld mode on Switch 2 and came away very disappointed with the game's performance, especially when in the open areas like Limgrave. Frame rate drops were significant when turning the camera whilst exploring outside of the tutorial area, and this, combined with a confusing button layout on Switch 2, made combat confusing and exploration fairly dispiriting. We weren't allowed to record gameplay at the booth, probably due to this fact, but you can hear our thoughts on Elden Ring Switch 2 handheld gameplay in this video.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is edging ever closer to release, and now the game has received an ESRB rating ahead of launch.</p>



<p>The ESRB rating follows on from receiving a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-rated-for-switch-2-by-south-korea-classification-board/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rating from the South Korean Rating Board</a> last month, with the game ticking yet another box ahead of a 2025 release window, which has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-reconfirms-2025-release-window-for-metroid-prime-4-beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reconfirmed by Nintendo</a>.</p>



<p>While a precise release window has not been shared, the news must surely be on the horizon, given that ratings from two separate regions have now been confirmed.</p>



<h2 id="h-metroid-prime-4-beyond-rated-t-by-esrb">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Rated T by ESRB</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s coming. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/metroid-prime-4-beyond-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo store</a> has revealed the rating for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond issued by the ESRB is T for Teen, with the game featuring animated blood, violence, and in-game purchases.</p>



<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is currently playable at Gamescom with a demo, further indication that a release is edging closer, and Nintendo could now be diverting attention toward the release following the recent Nintendo Direct focused on Kirby Air Riders.</p>



<p>Since the launch of the Switch 2, Nintendo has adopted an approach of handing big releases their own Direct show, having done so for Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, and Kirby Air Riders—the latter of which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kirby-air-riders-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">releases November 20</a>.</p>



<p>While Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, unlike the other three titles, is not a Switch 2 exclusive, it is still one of the biggest Nintendo releases set for this year, alongside the likes of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">releasing October 16</a>.</p>



<p>Release date details for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond should now be on the horizon, given the ESRB rating, with only a few more boxes left to be ticked.</p>

<p>Prologue demo also announced</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Falcom and GungHo have today confirmed the upcoming title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> will be getting a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Switch 2 Edition</a>.</p>
<p>This particular version will be a digital release and includes higher resolution and frame rate "for sharper" and "smoother graphics", along with reduced load times. This is part of a paid upgrade path for existing Switch owners and is priced at <strong>$1.00 USD</strong> (or your regional equivalent).</p>
<figure><a title="Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2dcd98f04fd51/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter.large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>As you can see in the fine print above, to "play Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, you must purchase the paid Upgrade Pack" and this "Upgrade Pack alone" does not give you access to the full game. A standard physical release will be available for the Switch as well as a 'SteelBook' and 'Bracer Edition'.</p>
<p>Along with this news, a <a href="https://trailsfirstchapter.com/trial/">prologue demo has also been revealed for Switch</a> and other platforms. Players will be able to carry over their save data to the full version, when it arrives next month on <strong>19th September 2025</strong>. The demo is now live in Japan.</p>

<p>After a restart, delays and an incredibly long wait, it appears Retro Studios' anticipated release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> may have <em>finally</em> been rated by the Entertainment Software Rating Board.</p>
<p>A rating has recently been spotted on Nintendo's website in the US, taking it from "Rating Pending" to a 'T' for "Teen" classification.</p>
<p>The currently attached description on the same page references animated blood and violence. As noted by <a href="https://shinesparkers.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-has-been-rated-by-the-esrb-what-it-means/">Metroid fan site Shinesparkers</a>, this age rating would be consistent with the main <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a> games <em>before</em> the fourth entry.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Here is ESRB's basic summary of this age rating, describing what a game under this classification may contain. The guide on its <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide/">website also goes into detail</a> about "interactive elements" referenced by the rating above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Teen - content is generally suitable for ages 13 and up. May contain violence, suggestive themes, crude humor, minimal blood, simulated gambling and/or infrequent use of strong language."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ratings for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a>, 2 and 3 in this same region contained "animated blood" and "violence". The classification and "rating summary" for Beyond has not gone live on ESRB's official website yet, so if there are any changes or updates, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>This discovery follows the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/metroid-prime-4-beyond-rating-spotted-fuelling-nintendo-direct-hopes-again">game being rated in South Korea</a> by the Game Rating and Administration Committee in July, so hopefully, all this recent activity means an official release date isn't too far away. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is currently targeting a <strong>2025</strong> launch and the Switch 2 version will include enhanced resolution and frame rate as well as Joy-Con 2 mouse support.</p>
<p>Nintendo's lineup of games for the remainder of this year is already looking quite busy, with the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon</a> game scheduled for October and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> now locked in for November.</p>
