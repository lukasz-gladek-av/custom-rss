<figure><a title="switch 2 battery poll" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/31fdc712f2c15/switch-2-battery-poll.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>With gamers across the globe now settling in to put their <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> consoles through their paces, we've been seeing a bunch of media outlets, alongside eager social media and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/">Reddit</a> users, report in on how they're finding the battery life thus far.</p>
<p>For full transparency, we've yet to run a rigorous battery test here at Nintendo Life, but from this writer's personal experience it's taking around the two-hour mark roughly, to drain things right down whilst playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>. Our editor, Gavin, is getting about the same running <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Welcome Tour</a>, too.</p>
<p>This may be disappointing, though <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-battery-life-how-does-it-compare">it falls pretty much in-line with what we expected</a> given Nintendo's officially indicated <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250402.html">2-6 hours</a> estimates and roughly the same as Switch 1 (before it saw a few model revisions).</p>
<p>Gamers online are reporting roughly the same figures in some cases. However, there seems to be a growing number of folk saying that they aren't even managing to reach the magic 2-hour mark whilst playing bigger games.</p>

<p>Of course, with the fact Mario Kart World is such a big, beautiful, online sort of deal, we expect the battery to drain faster, but it's not great news to see that, in some scenarios, people apparently aren't getting two hours out of it.</p>
<p>What's more (and we can confirm this one), the battery in standby mode — when you've set your Switch 2 down for the evening — seems to be draining seriously quickly in some cases. It seems it goes from a full charge to 59% on some consoles doing this, (as it has done with mine left overnight).</p>

<p>Judging from some of the responses to the post above, there are a whole bunch of players who are finding that the battery is draining too quickly for their liking. Obviously, there are a lot of factors at work here; screen brightness, downloads running in the background, whether you're using GameChat, and so on, but there's a pattern of complaints developing.</p>
<p>We'll be carrying out some tests of our own and will return with our own official findings in due course. But, in the interim, we'd love to hear how you have found the battery so far. How's it been for Mario Kart? What about 'smaller' games? And, if you've had time to take note, how does the battery do whilst in rest mode?</p>



<hr>
<p><em>And make sure to let us know all about your experiences with the Switch 2 battery in the comments. Are some games giving you better results?</em></p>

<p>Some of my favourite memories from the Switch 1 came from those opening few weeks following the launch in March 2017. Like everyone else, I was utterly glued to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, but I also poured a huge amount of time into Shin’en Multimedia’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fast_rmx">Fast RMX</a>. It was <em>the</em> game to showcase what the console was capable of in those early days, and the developer is back again with a launch title for Switch 2: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion.</a></p>
<p>Now, I know everybody has quite rightly been playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> almost non-stop since the Switch 2 launched, but I’d be lying if I said it was my favourite racing game at launch (and no, it’s not <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-ridge-racer">Ridge Racer</a> either). That honour goes to Fast Fusion. While somewhat slight in terms of content, this entry is the most accomplished yet, with astonishing visuals, rock-solid performance, and blisteringly fast racing.</p>
<p>At first glance, it's extremely familiar to Fast RMX veterans. You still race around tracks against CPU opponents while phasing between red and blue colours to benefit from boost pads on the ground. Picking up little energy orbs fills your boost meter, while pressing ‘R’ gives you a significant (albeit short) speed burst, quickly depleting your boost supply.</p>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Fast Fusion (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156604/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>So far, so good, then. The biggest change with the core gameplay is the ability to jump at any point. Honestly, when I first heard about this, I thought Shin’en had lost its marbles. Jumping? In a futuristic, high-speed racer? Madness! It turns out, however, that it works wonderfully well, adding an extra layer of strategy.</p>
<p>I should clarify that when I say ‘jump’, I’m not talking about the measly hop you might see in Mario Kart. Fast Fusion's jumps launch your vehicle meters into the air, giving you time to control your direction before landing. This has multiple uses: you can either use it to cross a deadly gap on the course, reach energy orbs way up high, or swap to an adjacent road to avoid obstacles or make use of a boost pad.</p>
<p>It’s got loads of potential, and I even noticed a few moments in which I could cut corners or discover hidden shortcuts. Granted, there’s nothing quite like the astonishing feats seen in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/f-zero_x">F-Zero X</a>, but I reckon it’s possible to cut your times dramatically once you master the mechanic. You can also use it to land on top of your enemies, spinning them out and netting you some sweet cash. Very satisfying.</p>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Fast Fusion (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156603/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the tracks themselves, you've got a total of 12 split across 4 different leagues. It's definitely a step down from previous games, but the quality on display here is insane. The torrential rain and tornadoes in Tempesta are a real visual treat, and the gigantic robots stomping around Port Genkai can do a number on you. It's thrilling stuff, and with Shin'en confirming that free content updates are on the way, we're optimistic that there'll be additional tracks in the future.</p>
<p>Outside of races, the big change here is — as the title suggests — the ability to fuse vehicles to create completely new ones. You’ve only got a few unlocked from the start, but you can tinker with the fusion mechanic straight away, provided you have the currency. It’s simply a case of selecting which vehicle you want to alter and browsing the rest of the catalogue.</p>
<p>Completing the fusion results in a mash-up of both the designs and names. You’ll also see that some of the stats have been altered depending on your chosen vehicles’ strengths. Blending Cebra Genetics with Vasp Optics, for example, yields increased boost performance thanks to the latter’s strength in that department. There are loads of different combinations you can try out, and it’s a joy to see what kind of stunning monstrosity you can come up with; you may even find you can completely max out your acceleration or top speed.</p>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Fast Fusion (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156597/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Fusing does, however, cost money; in fact, everything in this game costs money. Not real money, before you grab your pitchforks, but in-game currency obtained by competing in races, performing well, and collecting items. You’ll need moolah to unlock new vehicles, complete fusions, and open up new Championship cups. The game is pretty generous with its cash prizes, but I felt deflated a couple of times realising I had to replay tracks I’d already won to grind the required funds.</p>
<p>Once you get over that initial hump of unlocking every track, however, accumulating currency is pretty painless, and you’ll find that playing races for the sheer thrill of it will soon result in heaps of the stuff. Another good way to spend it is via the Jukebox feature. Fast Fusion contains some awesome new music, and you can unlock it to listen to whenever you like, along with a whole bunch of tracks from Fast RMX, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu-eshop/fast_racing_neo">FAST Racing NEO</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiware/fast_racing_league">Fast Racing League</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard Championship mode, you’ve also got Time Attack and Super Hero Mode. The former is pretty self-explanatory, requiring you to beat the stages’ record time, while the latter is about as close as we’re likely to get to a new F-Zero. The stages are mirrored, and your boost bar also represents your ship's health. Boost too much (or crash out entirely) and it’s game over. Generally, you’re able to boost much more than in the standard Championship mode, but it also comes with that thrilling risk vs. reward structure that makes F-Zero so great.</p>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Fast Fusion (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156609/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And of course, you’ve got multiplayer, offered up via standard splitscreen play (up to four players) or the new GameShare capabilities (two players). Splitscreen works phenomenally well with performance maintained at a solid 60fps for all. It’s not often you get such robust performance with local multiplayer these days, so seeing the Switch 2 handle this without breaking a sweat is a joy.</p>
<p>GameShare is similarly impressive in terms of performance, though being the second player on a Switch 1 does yield some pretty fuzzy visuals thanks to the streaming involved. The whole screen also shrinks slightly for both players to provide the necessary GameShare information at the top. It’s not a huge deal, and you’re going to find the same happens if you’re using the screen-share feature during GameChat, but it’s worth noting all the same.</p>
<p>While on the subject of performance, it’s worth just stressing how incredibly beautiful Fast Fusion is on the Switch. In docked mode, if you have a TV capable of hitting 4K resolution, nailing that 4K/60fps balance is absolutely magical. Shin’en Multimedia has stated its desire to potentially add in a 120fps mode at a later date, but honestly, if this means dipping the resolution down to 1080p, I’m perfectly happy sticking to 4K/60fps.</p>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Fast Fusion (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156611/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>As for the other performance modes, you’ve got ‘Ultra Quality’ in docked mode that boosts the visuals slightly, but brings the performance down to 30fps. It’s fine, and the added texture details and shadow maps are certainly noticable, but it's not my go-to option.</p>
<p>Handheld mode delivers more or less the same, maxing out at the screen’s 1080p display while offering up the option of either a 60fps performance mode or a 30fps quality mode. The latter again offers the same visual upgrades as docked mode, but the compromises to attain this aren’t really worth it.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Fast Fusion may not have the most comprehensive collection of tracks, but it's easily the most accomplished entry in Shin'en Multimedia's series so far. The new jump ability adds a new layer of strategy to the gameplay, while experimenting with the fusion mechanic to find the perfect vehicle is a joy. The occasional grinding to save up money can be a momentary drag, but if you're after something a bit more 'hardcore' than Mario Kart World, Fast Fusion is a no-brainer, and an absolute must-buy.</p></section>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-low-energy-mode-handheld/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-upcoming-low-energy-mode-reducing-performance-to-save-power-strongly-hints-at-handheld-system-%E2%80%93-rumor.1210971/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-low-energy-mode-handheld/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 SDK is getting updated in the near future with a new low energy mode which strongly hints at a handheld system.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">Moore's Law is Dead</a>, Sony is briefing developers and sending out documentation on a new low energy mode for the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro, which is getting added soon to the system's SDK. This new mode is a third flag, or performance profile, besides the base mode and Trinity mode for the PlayStation 5 Pro which indicate which system is supported by a game, and comes with plenty of limitations: it limits the system to eight threads, reduces 3D Audio processing to 75%, reduces the GPU core clocks by around 10%, 20%, essentially forcing them to the minimum clock speeds required to run a game, and GDDR6 memory bandwidth by half, limits the systems to 36 compute units, and removes PSSR and VR support. All of these limitations reduce power consumption by around 20% and 30% while keeping 90% of the console's capabilities without breaking backward compatibility. Interestingly enough, the documentation provided to developers encourages them to have proper VRR support.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Handheld Secrets Leak, AMD RX 9060 XT Launch Analysis, Nintendo Switch 2 Review | May Loose Ends" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rlRcj_OoHpc?start=560&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While a reduction of the PlayStation 5 power consumption would be welcome in a variety of situations, this likely isn't the primary goal of this new low energy mode, according to Moore's Law is Dead. The introduction of this new flag is probably the beginning of handheld support, and framing it like this would be a means to prevent leaks. Known AMD leaker Kepler L2 also believes this new energy-saving mode is an emulated performance profile for a handheld system, since the biggest weakness of that APU is memory bandwidth, which is one of the things the new performance profile addresses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Oh this is 100% an emulated performance profile for the Handheld, since the biggest weakness of that APU is memory bandwidth and this profile is reducing PS5 bandwidth in half as you said.</p>
<p>— Kepler (@Kepler_L2) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kepler_L2/status/1931134328710513013?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As of now, this new PlayStation 5 low energy mode is not mandatory for developers, but the fact that it is being added soon suggests that something is indeed cooking up at Sony. Trinity Mode, for example, was added roughly one year before the PS5 Pro launched and made mandatory a few months later, so its addition suggests that the device related to this performance profile could be coming relatively soon. It has been rumored for a while that the home PlayStation 6 will launch together with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-handheld-amd-18-cus-1-8-ghz-gpu/">handheld device</a>, and with the next-generation system getting closer to release, it makes sense to start planning support soon.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/674953/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tmnt-tactical-takedown-is-a-radical-twist-on-turn-based-strategy.1210959/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/674953/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I usually struggle with strategy games. They’re typically too hard for me, and I often get overwhelmed at managing multiple characters or squads. But I couldn’t put down <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em>, which blends ideas from strategy games <em>and</em> classic <em>TMNT</em> arcade games to keep things snappy, easy to play, and full of action.</p><p>One way <em>Tactical Takedown </em>— developed by <em>I Am Your Beast</em> maker Strange Scaffold — keeps things simple is by having you play as just one character in each of the game’s 20 levels. The four turtles have different movesets; Leonardo, for example, uses his swords to aggressively attack enemies, while Michelangelo can zip around the playing field on his skateboard. You’re able to customize each turtle’s arsenal by buying new moves, but I didn’t change the movesets at all and got through the game just fine.</p><p>Battles take place in a grid overlaid on small chunks of very <em>TMNT</em> locations, like a street, sewer, or subway system. Every turn, you have six “action points” to spend as you please, whether that’s moving around the level or attacking bad guys. You just press a button to use one of your moves, no menu required, which speeds things up considerably. You have six hearts and three “lives” — lose a life and the game will quickly flash a “Continue” sign before letting you choose where you’d like to drop in the level to keep the fight going. (You also lose a score multiplier.)</p><p>The levels feel like tiny dioramas, and while characters will move into a kick or a punch when attacking or a fall when taking damage, they aren’t actively animated moment to moment. It all creates the sense that you’re playing with action figures.</p><p>Perhaps <em>Tactical Takedown</em>’s best trick is that the levels are constantly shifting around you. Every once in a while, the game will show you that a new piece of land is going to drop in on the next turn, and after that spot is in place, you’ll get a warning that another part of the level is going to fall away. It means that you’re constantly dealing with new terrain, layouts, and hazards like poisonous sewage or cars driving by while also strategizing on how to fight bad guys. Sometimes, after adding a new chunk of a level, the game even flashes the word “Go,” encouraging you to move forward like you would in an arcade game.</p><p>Even better, if there isn’t a wall, you can send enemies flying off the edge of a level into the void, defeating them instantly. It took me a bit to understand that the game <em>wants</em> you to do that as much as possible; occasionally, there will be a lot of bad guys in a level, and the only way to efficiently take them out is by sending them to their doom.</p><p>For me, it all came together in a level where you play as Leonardo in a subway tunnel. The level started on a subway platform, and then the game signaled that a subway car would appear. I navigated my way onto the subway car, and the platform fell away. After a few turns on the subway car, it “arrived” at the next subway stop, and I had to hop off. It really felt like I was “advancing” through a level in a faster-paced game, and all while managing a legion of enemies with Leonardo’s swords. </p><p>The genre is usually slow, but when you get in a good rhythm, <em>Tactical Takedown</em> almost feels as crisp as the <em>TMNT</em> arcade games — despite being a turn-based strategy game.</p><p><sub>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown<em> is now available on PC.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-attack-vector-a-modular-switch-2-case-which-opts-for-comfort-over-protection<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Review: Genki Attack Vector - A Modular Switch 2 Case Which Aims For Comfort Over Protection 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7fdf76c49e119/review-genki-attack-vector-a-modular-switch-2-case-which-aims-for-comfort-over-protection-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Accessory maker Genki has a whole host of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/genki-unleashes-some-slick-new-switch-2-accessories">Switch 2 accessories</a> on the market to support the console's launch, and the excellently named <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/attack-vector-pre-order?variant=42025271623754">Attack Vector</a> is one of the ones which caught my attention from the get-go.</p>
<p>Described by Genki (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/accessory-manufacturer-genki-responds-to-nintendos-switch-2-lawsuit">which is currently in Nintendo's bad books</a>) as a "modular grip case for serious handheld command", the Attack Vector comes in three different parts. The main bodywork clips onto your Switch 2 console, while the other two pieces bolt onto your Joy-Con 2 controllers.</p>
<p>On a basic level, these are designed to offer slimline protection for your shiny new purchase, but in reality, they're nowhere near substantial enough to prevent damage from severe drops; you might avoid scratching or marking the Switch 2, but that's about it.</p>

<p>The three-piece modular design means you can remove your Joy-Con 2 when you want to, and the main part of the case is so thin it doesn't prevent you from docking the Switch 2, which is a plus. The rear of the case also supports snap-on accessories thanks to a small MagSafe-style magnetic section; this is handy for clipping on plug-in external battery packs, for example (naturally, Genki has its own option here, called the <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/energy-pack-pre-order">Energy Pack</a>).</p>
<p>However, by far the most interesting element of the Attack Vector is the trio of swappable grips that bolt onto the back of the Joy-Con 2 sections of the case. The smallest set ("Feather") gives you small bumps to grip onto, while the most pronounced pair ("Anchor") is pretty huge but provides the most agreeable ergonomic experience. The "Balance" set is somewhere in the middle of these two extremes. To be honest, with the exception of the "Feather" set (which doesn't really seem to make a huge difference), the other two grips are excellent and really do make the Switch 2 more comfortable to play for prolonged periods.</p>
<p>The grips have a rubberised texture, so they're super-tactile, and there are "sweat-resistant bands" (according to Genki) that mean they don't get slippy when the action heats up.</p>

<p>Prior to getting my Switch 2 this week, I've been playing an awful lot on my <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/reviews/steam-deck-oled-the-best-just-got-better">Steam Deck OLED</a>, and I have to admit the ergonomics of that device are a <em>lot</em> better than Nintendo's new hybrid console. However, with the Attack Vector installed, the difference is less obvious.</p>
<p>It's a shame, then, that some elements of Genki's modular case let it down. As previously mentioned, the Attack Vector feels very flimsy, and there's a lot of flex and movement in the main case, even when it's clipped onto the Switch 2 itself. While the Joy-Con 2 grips are great for improving overall ergonomics, it feels like they add extra 'pivot' to the controllers. I actually think the magnets which hold the Joy-Con 2 to the Switch 2 are great, but I have never been so aware that they are separate components than when I used the Attack Vector. The amount of 'wobble' you feel during use is pretty extreme.</p>
<p>This complaint aside, I actually found myself liking the Attack Vector case. It's pretty expensive for what essentially amounts to three sections of thin plastic, but the swappable grips are genuinely useful, and having a trio of size options means you're almost sure to find the grip that suits you. It's just a shame that more robust protection isn't part of the package.</p>



<p><em>The Genki Attack Vector is available directly from the manufacturer and costs <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/attack-vector-pre-order?variant=42025271623754">$49.99 / £42</a>.</em></p>

            <p>Developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> is developing a co-op mode for Hitman: World of Assassination.</p>
<p>Announced last night, this mode is still relatively under wraps, but does feature two names you may recognise: Stone and Knight. These two popped up in the Hitman Sniper mode.</p>
<p>On this co-op mode's release, players will be able to pop into "exciting missions" from the Hitman world with their pal by their side. These missions will "challenge" players to rethink how they approach things now they are going in as one of a pair. Someone once said to me a good friend will always help you hide the bodies, so I guess that is very fitting for this story.</p>

<p>IO noted it was "early days" for its upcoming Hitman co-op mode, but it would share more news about it all with us "soon", so stay tuned.</p>
<p>In addition to this little nugget, IO has also announced that Hitman: World of Assassination has now reached the 25m units sold milestone. The developer added the game has registered 80 million players, which takes into account players from World of Assassination, as well as its Free Starter Pack.</p>
<p>"Agent 47 continues to resonate with audiences around the world, proving the enduring appeal of the franchise as it approaches its 25th anniversary," said IO head Hakan Abrak.</p>
<p>"Everyone at IOI extends its sincere thanks to the global community of players, and we look forward to delivering many more hours of stealth, creativity, and signature assassinations in the years to come."</p>

Here's everything that was shown during this year's Summer Game Fest presentation!</p>

<hr><h2><em>Mortal Shell 2&nbsp;</em>looks suitably brutal, out 2026</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mortal-shell-ii-summer-game-fest-2025.jpg?itok=e9LlRZC5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mortal-shell-ii-summer-game-fest-2025.jpg?itok=aGUNkDhX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Mortal Shell&nbsp;</em>is on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>A sequel to the grimdark Soulslike&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mortal-shell" rel="nofollow">Mortal Shell</a>&nbsp;</em>was the first trailer on the ticket, and it looks like exactly what you'd expect from a&nbsp;<em>Mortal Shell&nbsp;</em>sequel. It's coming to PC and current-gen consoles in 2026.</p>

<h2>Kojima talks&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em></h2>

<p>Next, we got to see a Summer Game Fest-exclusive clip of the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>, which launches for PlayStation 5 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">on June 26th</a> (so in just a couple of weeks!).</p>

<h2><em>Chronicles: Medieval&nbsp;</em>is a strategy sandbox with a silly name</h2>

<p>After Kojima's&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>talk, a new medieval sandbox strategy game by the name of&nbsp;<em>Chronicles: Medieval&nbsp;</em>(yes, really) was revealed. We didn't get to see gameplay, just a rain-soaked trailer. It's coming to Early Access on PC in 2026.</p>

<h2><em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds&nbsp;</em>launches in September, gets&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>team-up</h2>

<p>If you haven't gotten around to playing&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">Mario Kart World</a>&nbsp;</em>yet, don't worry; as usual, Sonic is here to pick up the slack.&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds&nbsp;</em>launches on September 25th, and it's getting a&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>crossover as well.</p>

<h2><em>Code Vein II&nbsp;</em>brings more anime Soulslike action next year</h2>




<p>Everything in this show is lining up for 2026, isn't it? Well,&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II&nbsp;</em>is no exception. It's a followup to Bandai Namco's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/code-vein" rel="nofollow">2019 anime Soulslike</a>, and it's got plenty of nasty monsters to slay and anime cuties to gawk at.</p>

<h2><em>End of Abyss&nbsp;</em>is a horror game from ex-<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>folks</h2>

<p>Next up, we got a first look at&nbsp;<em>End of Abyss</em>, a watery top-down horror game from a new studio comprising some of the folks who worked on&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>at Tarsier Studios. Take a guess when this one's coming out! (It's 2026.)</p>

<h2><em>Game of Thrones: War for Westeros&nbsp;</em>is a "premium real-time strategy game" for PC</h2>

<p>We didn't get much info about the next title,&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones: War for Westeros</em>, other than the fact that it's a "premium real-time strategy game" built for PC. Hey, you'll never guess wh-yep, it's 2026.</p>

<h2><em>Atomic Heart II</em>'s debut trailer looks suitably wacky</h2>




<p>Developer Mundfish announced the sequel to 2023's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/atomic-heart" rel="nofollow">Atomic Heart</a>&nbsp;</em>next, and it looks about as crazy as you'd expect; it seems that the studio is leaning into the wackiness inherent in the first game's setup. No 2026 release for this one yet; we don't know when it's coming.</p>

<h2><em>The Cube&nbsp;</em>is another Mundfish game, and it sounds like it wants&nbsp;<em>Destiny</em>'s crown</h2>

<p>After the&nbsp;<em>Atomic Heart II&nbsp;</em>trailer, we got to see a reveal for&nbsp;<em>The Cube</em>, another Mundfish game that takes the form of an "MMORPG shooter" set in the same universe as&nbsp;<em>Atomic Heart</em>. Again, no release window for this one.</p>

<h2><em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword&nbsp;</em>looks like it's got parrying in it</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-summer-game-fest-2025.jpg?itok=Id-cRYf7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-summer-game-fest-2025.jpg?itok=P4PqXPUL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword&nbsp;</em>is another parry-centric action game, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>Next, it's Capcom's turn to show off, and a new trailer for&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword&nbsp;</em>appears to confirm that yes, the game will have a parry system in it, like many other action games (and turn-based RPGs) nowadays. 2026 for this one, shockingly.</p>

<h2><em>Felt That: Boxing&nbsp;</em>appears to be some kind of Muppet-like boxing game</h2>

<p>The next trailer to be shown during Summer Game Fest 2025 was an odd duck, to say the least.&nbsp;<em>Felt That: Boxing&nbsp;</em>is a Muppet-style boxing game with adorable fuzzy characters and lots of swearing. No release window, but it does have a Flying Lotus soundtrack.</p>

<h2>Square Enix's&nbsp;<em>Killer Inn&nbsp;</em>is a social deduction game with a unique style</h2>

<p>Next, it's&nbsp;<em>Killer Inn</em>, a social deduction game from Square Enix. Someone has been murdered, and players will either take the role of the hunter or the hunted. From there, you'll need to deduce who committed the crime. This one's coming soon, and there'll be a closed beta too.</p>

<h2><em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>gets an October release date</h2>

<p>Extraction shooter&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>is up next, and it's got an October release date now, plus a new sparkly trailer that shows off its aesthetic.</p>

<h2>MMORPG&nbsp;<em>Chrono Odyssey&nbsp;</em>will let you try it out later this month</h2>

<p><em>Chrono Odyssey</em>, the upcoming "<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/open-world-mmorpg-chrono-odyssey-made-in-unreal-engine-5-finally-reveals-gameplay" rel="nofollow">next-generation action MMORPG</a>", will be hosting a Steam playtest between June 20th and 22nd, so if you want to try out this (admittedly great-looking) action RPG, that'll be your chance.</p>

<h2><em>MIO: Memories In Orbit&nbsp;</em>has a demo you can check out now</h2>

<p>Want to give pretty-looking Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>MIO: Memories In Orbit&nbsp;</em>a go? Well, the good news is that you can do exactly that right now on PC, since a demo was revealed during the Summer Game Fest 2025 showcase.</p>

<h2><em>Out of Words&nbsp;</em>is a "handcrafted" platformer from Epic</h2>

<p>Epic Games Publishing stepped up next to reveal&nbsp;<em>Out of Words</em>, a "handcrafted" puzzle-platformer that looks like it has more than a touch of&nbsp;<em>Unravel&nbsp;</em>about it. You guessed it: this one is coming in 2026.</p>

<h2><em>Lego Voyagers </em>looks adorable, frankly</h2>




<p>Annapurna Interactive and Light Brick, the folks behind&nbsp;<em>Lego Builder's Journey</em>, have announced&nbsp;<em>Lego Voyagers</em>, a rather cute-looking co-op puzzler coming to PC and consoles...err, sometime in the future.</p>

<h2><em>Nicktoons &amp; the Dice of Destiny&nbsp;</em>brings Nickelodeon characters together</h2>

<p>Nickelodeon characters like SpongeBob, Danny Phantom, and the FairlyOdd Parents together for a fantasy action game from the folks at the rather unfortunately-named GameMill. This one is coming in fall.</p>

<h2>Surprise!&nbsp;<em>Lies of P</em>'s DLC is out now</h2>

<p>The next trailer was for the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lies-of-p-dlc-q1-2025-new-ip" rel="nofollow"><em>Overture&nbsp;</em>DLC</a> for puppet Soulslike&nbsp;<em>Lies of P</em>, and hey, it's available to play right now, so if you want more of P's adventures in Krat, you can check that out at your earliest convenience.</p>

<h2><em>Fractured Blooms&nbsp;</em>is a cozy game with a dark twist</h2>




<p>As someone who's pretty burnt out on cozy games, this one intrigued me.&nbsp;<em>Fractured Blooms&nbsp;</em>is a "time loop life sim" in which you must tend your garden while "something" blooms. It looks creepy as all get-out.</p>

<h2><em>Jurassic World Evolution 3&nbsp;</em>has an October release date</h2>

<p>Just like&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>, the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Jurassic World Evolution&nbsp;</em>series of management games now has a release date, and it's October 21st. Some art in the game uses generative AI, though. Boo.</p>

<h2>Yacht Club's Game Boy homage&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>launches on Halloween</h2>

<p>Next, it's time for a look at Yacht Club's newest game&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower</em>, which pays homage to Game Boy-style action games. It's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mina-the-hollower-release-date-yacht-club" rel="nofollow">coming on October 31st</a>, and you can check a demo out right now on Steam.</p>

<h2><em>Deadpool VR&nbsp;</em>sure is a thing, and it's Meta Quest 3 and 3S-exclusive</h2>

<p>I'm pretty sure nobody wanted a VR-exclusive&nbsp;<em>Deadpool&nbsp;</em>game, but I'm also pretty sure that list of people dwindles even further if it's a Meta Quest-exclusive&nbsp;<em>Deadpool&nbsp;</em>VR game. Ah, well. Late 2025 for this one.</p>

<h2><em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>launches in August</h2>

<p>First revealed back in 2024,&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>got itself an August 22nd release date during this year's Summer Game Fest showcase, so if you're after more zombie-killing action, you know when you'll get it.</p>

<h2><em>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree&nbsp;</em>sure has a real long name</h2>

<p>Next, it's Bandai Namco's&nbsp;<em>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree</em>, an isometric roguelike coming to PC and current-gen consoles (and also the Switch) on September 19th. It looks fine, I guess.</p>

<h2><em>Acts of Blood&nbsp;</em>has very strong&nbsp;<em>Sifu&nbsp;</em>vibes</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/acts-of-blood-summer-game-fest-2025.jpg?itok=bVY6l1n2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/acts-of-blood-summer-game-fest-2025.jpg?itok=qQzWIkcE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Acts of Blood&nbsp;</em>bears more than a passing resemblance to&nbsp;<em>Sifu</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Acts of Blood&nbsp;</em>is a beat-'em-up from a solo developer with extremely strong&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sifu" rel="nofollow">Sifu</a>&nbsp;</em>vibes; in fact, I'm pretty sure the corridor shown in the trailer is making a cameo appearance from Sloclap's brawler. Summer 2026 for this one.</p>

<h2><em>Scott Pilgrim EX&nbsp;</em>is a "brand new brawling adventure" due next year</h2>

<p>Another game that's due next year is&nbsp;<em>Scott Pilgrim EX</em>, which appears to be a brand new game despite its rather "remaster"-implying title. You'll have to wait until 2026 to find out.</p>

<h2><em>The First Descendant: Breakthrough&nbsp;</em>is coming in August</h2>

<p>A major new update for&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant</em>,&nbsp;titled&nbsp;<em>Breakthrough</em>,&nbsp;is coming in August. It'll add hoverbikes, eight-player raids, and more to the looter-shooter, so if you're into this game, that's something to look forward to.</p>

<h2><em>SCUM&nbsp;</em>1.0 launches in just a few days</h2>

<p>Open-world survival-crafter&nbsp;<em>SCUM&nbsp;</em>finally has its 1.0 release date, and it's June 17th, so you won't have to wait too long to check out the full version of this one.</p>

<h2>IO Interactive has some stuff to reveal</h2>

<p>Next, we get a look at what IO Interactive is cooking up. There's a new trailer for&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>, a collaboration between&nbsp;<em>Hitman&nbsp;</em>and that game, and the appearance of Mads Mikkelsen's iconic 007 villain Le Chiffre in&nbsp;<em>Hitman&nbsp;</em>as well.</p>

<h2><em>Lego Party&nbsp;</em>looks like a pretty blatant&nbsp;<em>Mario Party&nbsp;</em>tribute</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lego-party-summer-game-fest-2025.jpg?itok=ccNYAeVq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lego-party-summer-game-fest-2025.jpg?itok=hyF0wFqU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hey, look! It's&nbsp;<em>Mar</em>-erm,&nbsp;<em>Lego Party</em>!</figcaption></figure><p>Have you ever wanted to play&nbsp;<em>Mario Party</em>, but with Lego characters? Well,&nbsp;<em>Lego Party&nbsp;</em>will let you do just that when it launches sometime later this year. It looks pretty fun.</p>

<h2><em>Wildgate&nbsp;</em>is a shooter promising "space shenanigans" in July</h2>

<p><em>Wildgate&nbsp;</em>is a colorful, fast-paced shooter blending "tactical ship-to-ship combat with fast-paced first-person action", and it's out on July 22nd, with an open beta available between June 9th and 16th.</p>

<h2><em>Blighted&nbsp;</em>is the next game from&nbsp;<em>Guacamelee!&nbsp;</em>studio Drinkbox</h2>

<p>Offering yet more&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hades" rel="nofollow"><em>Hades</em></a>-style isometric action is&nbsp;<em>Blighted</em>, the next game from<i>&nbsp;Guacamelee!&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em>Nobody Saves the World&nbsp;</em>developer Drinkbox. Once again, this one is coming your way next year.</p>

<h2><em>Ill&nbsp;</em>wants to scratch your&nbsp;<em>Condemned&nbsp;</em>itch</h2>




<p>If you've been after more first-person survival horror a la&nbsp;<em>Condemned&nbsp;</em>or the last couple of&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>games,&nbsp;<em>Ill&nbsp;</em>looks like it'll scratch that itch. It doesn't have a release window yet, though, so you might have to wait a while.</p>

<h2><em>Mecha Break&nbsp;</em>launches on July 1st</h2>

<p>When its demo launched in February,&nbsp;<em>Mecha Break&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mecha-break-demo-player-count-300k" rel="nofollow">managed to hit a 300,000 player count</a> within its first day, so the full release on July 1st will almost certainly be even more spectacular.</p>

<h2><em>Infinitesimals&nbsp;</em>looks like&nbsp;<em>Grounded&nbsp;</em>meets&nbsp;<em>Pikmin</em></h2>

<p>From Cubit Studios comes&nbsp;<em>Infinitesimals</em>, a sci-fi adventure in which you play an alien who crashlands on a planet and must find their way back to safety. Yeah, it's&nbsp;<em>Pikmin&nbsp;</em>meets&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/grounded" rel="nofollow"><em>Grounded</em></a>, and it's coming next year.</p>

<h2>Capcom isn't ready to reveal&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 9&nbsp;</em>yet...</h2>

<p>Aww, it looks like Capcom just isn't ready to lift the lid on the much-mooted&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 9&nbsp;</em>yet, huh? Never mind. On with the show!</p>

<h2><em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>is getting more DLC fighters</h2>

<p>Surprise, surprise: more DLC fighters are heading to&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/street-fighter-6" rel="nofollow"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a>, with fan favorites like Sagat due to come to the game over the next few months.</p>

<h2><em>Last Flag&nbsp;</em>has clearly taken a look at&nbsp;<em>Team Fortress 2</em>'s homework</h2>

<p>Next up, it's a capture-the-flag shooter by the name of&nbsp;<em>Last Flag</em>, and judging by its deliberately retro stylings and cartoony visuals, this one has been cozying up to Valve's&nbsp;<em>Team Fortress 2&nbsp;</em>of a cold evening. No release window for this yet.</p>

<h2><em>Wu-Tang: Rise of the Deceiver&nbsp;</em>is a weird-looking anime brawler</h2>

<p>Up next is&nbsp;<em>Wu-Tang: Rise of the Deceiver</em>, an anime brawler that has that distinct&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hi-fi-rush" rel="nofollow"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em></a>-slash-<em>South of Midnight&nbsp;</em>low-frame look. I have to say, this one definitely wasn't on my bingo card.</p>

<h2><em>Stranger than Heaven&nbsp;</em>is the next game from Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio</h2>




<p>Remember&nbsp;<em>Project Century</em>, the next game from <i>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</i>developer Ryu Ga Gotoku? Well, it's now called&nbsp;<em>Stranger than Heaven</em>, and it looks stylish as heck. No release window though, sadly. Hopefully it'll be sooner rather than later.</p>

<h2>Psych!&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Requiem&nbsp;</em>is coming in February next year</h2>




<p>Oh, Capcom, you rascals! It turns out&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Requiem&nbsp;</em>was ready to reveal, although we don't really get to see much in the way of gameplay. This survival horror game takes you back to Raccoon City, and it's coming on February 27th next year.</p>

<hr><p>Well, that sure was a show! That's it from Geoff for now, and that's it from us as well. A few announcements piqued my interest here, and I hope they did for you as well!</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>What a shock, what a horror, I’ll be spending my weekend playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. What a quirky little individual I am, eh? You know what else I’ll be playing? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Welcome Tour</a>. Why? Because it’s sweet! On top of all that, I’m fighting the urge to replay <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> in its entirety because it looks so gosh darn pretty now, and I finally have the excuse that I’ve been looking for to dive into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, it’s also my Granny’s birthday, so I’ll be squeezing in all of that around some nice family time. Busy weekend for old Jimmy!</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Of course I'm playing the Switch 2, come on now. I've not quite been suckered into Mario Kart World yet, so I'm mostly bouncing between <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. The latter is an absolute marvel in handheld mode. It's hard to believe I'm playing something of such high quality while sat on the bog.</p>
<p>Have a good one, folks!</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Mario Kart World! Fast Fusion! Mario Kart World! Cyberpunk 2077! Mario Kart World! Street Fighter VI! Mario Kart World! <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a>! ...did I mention Mario Kart World?</p>
<p>But I ain’t packing in my Switch 1 just yet, I still need to transfer several virtual game cards from it to the Switch 2. The future is a bit confusing, but it does work. Plus I also got my physical copy of <strong>Sonic Wings Reunion</strong>, so plenty of life left on the old eight-year-old system. Wow, was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-ridge-racer">Ridge Racer</a> really this great in its arcade debut?</p>
<p>Game of the Week is… being alive and a part of this exciting time in the industry. For all you folks out there who did not manage to secure a Switch 2 already due to reasons, please don’t give up on your dreams and enjoy video games in any way you can.</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>I'll be playing more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fantasy_life_i_the_girl_who_steals_time">Fantasy Life i</a>. I know, I wrote a whole review — but this is one of those 250-hour games, and I have a lot more grinding to do to get up to Hero rank on all the Lives!</p>
<p>I'm also making my own game. Does that count? I've had a lot of stops and starts, because every one of my game ideas ends up petering out when I get to the hard part (spoilers: it's UI) but this time I'm also learning the programming aspect, rather than just relying on my partner to do it. I'm noodling around in Love2D, if anyone wants to know!</p>

<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I really, really want to play Mario Kart and Cyberpunk, but I've got to power on through Welcome Tour for review - keep your eyes peeled for that soon. Beyond that, I'm gagging to start <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">No Man's Sky</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vruJnZDxpMw">Felix's Odyssey comparison</a> has me jonesing to replay it on S2.</p>
<p>Because there's not enough other stuff to be getting on with! Have a great one, folks.</p>

			<p>Atomic Heart's Mundfish had a third announcement at SGF 2025 after <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-ii-announced-coming-to-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atomic Heart II</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-cube-is-an-mmorpg-shooter-set-in-the-atomic-heart-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The CUBE</a>: it will publish ILL, an intriguing survival horror game developed by Team Clout, headquartered in Cyprus. This is part of the new Mundfish Powerhouse publishing label <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-has-reached-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> last week.</p>
<p>Set in a mysterious research facility, ILL is a realistic first-person action/horror game that plunges players headlong into an immersive, atmospheric body horror narrative. Players can expect&nbsp;innovative gameplay mechanics, including a cutting-edge dismemberment system, binaural audio implementation, and realistic physics. ILL is a tribute to and an evolution of the survival horror genre.</p>
<p>Grotesque monsters can be mutilated and mercilessly torn apart. Ripped flesh, exposed bone, disemboweled bodies – all this will make an unprecedented impression and shock players. The binaural audio system aims to amplify the emotional impact.</p>
<p>Enemies are unpredictable, and the game's realistic physics makes the environment more than<br>
just a background. It becomes an active part of the gameplay of ILL, including during puzzle-solving.<br>
The player's actions can affect the behavior of monsters and cause unexpected reactions, from<br>
impulsive interaction with the surroundings to disturbingly human-like reflexes.</p>
<p>Players will feel the weight of weapons in their hands with elaborate animations that reflect their unique physical properties. Not only is precision necessary, but so is the maintenance of a diverse<br>
arsenal: checking for malfunctions, installing modifications, and upgrading. Strategic inventory<br>
management is critical to survival, as the ability to craft an item could literally mean the difference<br>
between life and death.</p>
<p><iframe title="ILL - Official Trailer I SGF25" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZBPi85S2MmA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Some of Team Clout's developers have previously worked on horror movies like V/H/S/Beyond, Longlegs, IT: Welcome to Derry, and Azrael, which explains the game's cinematic vibe. ILL doesn't have a release date yet, but it can be wishlisted on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1757350/ILL/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Mundfish CEO Robert Bagratuni said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Mundfish Powerhouse is proud to announce our partnership with Team Clout on their upcoming title, ILL. Powerhouse was created to empower daring, visionary developers by providing meaningful support where it matters most. We’re committed to backing artists with bold, transgressive, and uncompromising creative visions - and we believe ILL is a striking example of that spirit.</em></p>

<p>Forge swords and unbreakable bonds this September</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Bandai Namco and Brownies have today revealed the new roguelite action title <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/towa_and_the_guardians_of_the_sacred_tree">Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree</a></strong>.</p>
<p>It will be making its way to the Switch on <strong>19th September 2025</strong> and includes melodies from Hitsoshi Sakimoto (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles">Final Fantasy</a>). You can check out the new trailer above and here's some PR (via Bandai Namco):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this roguelite-RPG adventure set in a far-off mystic realm, ancient forces stir, and untold dangers await.</p>
<p>As Towa, lead the guardians of the sacred tree in forging strong relationships and powerful swords to fight Magatsu’s forces and determine the future of Shinju Village.</p></blockquote><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p><blockquote>
<p>Enter a vibrant world filled with beauty and perilous danger.</p>
<p>On your quest to restore peace, play as Towa and the Guardians as they explore far-off lands threatened by Magatsu’s evil influence. In a world where even splendor hides a lurking threat, courage is the only way forward.</p>
<p>As Hitoshi Sakimoto’s melodies guide the way, a breathtaking yet untamed landscape unfolds where the fight to save Shinju Village begins.</p>
<p>Towa, priestess of Shinju, stands united with 8 trustworthy companions to defeat Magatsu.<br>
Fight alongside a fellow guardian and wield the power of the sacred sword (Tsurugi) and staff (Kagura). Each guardian has its own abilities and sets of swords, making each combat style and guardian pair unique.</p>
<p>Together, pave your way through colorful lands, conquer dungeons, and defeat Magatsu’s minions!</p>
<p>As the guardians pursue their quests across different timelines, the village evolved over the years.</p>
<p>Develop unique bonds with its residents and learn more about their customs and stories that are woven into the inner workings of the village.</p>
<p>Each visit is a chance to train at the dojo, summon powerful Graces, and craft new swords at the smithing shop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brownies, in case you didn't know, is the studio led by former founders of Brownie Brown (now Nintendo's 1-UP Studio) - who originally worked on the Mana series for Square Enix back in the day as well as titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/mother_3">Mother 3</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/sword_of_mana">Sword of Mana</a>.</p>

I’ve been entrusted with a sacred mission.”</p><p>One of the most influential <a title="Genres > RPG [17,324 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a> of the last 20 years is finally coming to Steam. Take control of the Batter as he seeks to purify an uncanny and hopeless world haunted by specters, guided by a cryptic, grinning cat called The Judge.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Allow Me to Confess That I Find You Quite Tangible for a Phantasmagorical Being</strong></p><p>I must say, this is really quite strange. You are the first living being I have ever met in this place. Nevertheless, I will introduce myself. I am the Judge.</p><p><strong>The Batter Has a Sacred Mission to Fulfill</strong></p><p>He seeks to purify the world. You, then, the controller, the soul that he harbors, must aid him in this laudable task. Alongside my sportive companion you will find it necessary to solve puzzles, rain blows upon certain hostile individuals of our wild zones, and oversee the headways and logistics of a network of swan boats and interurban locomotives.</p><p><strong>I, Too, Travel Widely Among the Zones of This World</strong></p><p>Open your wings and fly toward the zones ahead without hesitation! All of them are filled with strange and enchanting beings as well as every modern convenience. All of them appear, it must be said, to require the beneficent application of our friend the Batter’s muscular wrist. Do not worry, my dear phantasm—I, the Judge, will be with you (in spirit and body) at all the most crucial moments of your quest.</p><p><strong>I’m Going to Cut That Insufferable Smile Right Out of Your Face</strong></p><p>How dare you talk to me? Why have you decided to be such a pain in my ass? The Queen chose me to protect Zone 1, and I’ve dedicated my whole life to it. </p><p>Listen.

    <p><span>From Semblance studio Nyamakop.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>South African developer <a title="Companies > Nyamakop [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/nyamakop">Nyamakop</a> has announced <em><a title="Games > Relooted [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/relooted">Relooted</a></em>, an Africanfuturist heist game in which you plan, parkour, and reclaim real looted African Artifacts from Western museums. It will be available for <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,306 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a> and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,336 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3255890/Relooted/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/relooted-89fdd7" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a>. A release date was not announced. <span id="more-971423"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Nyamakop:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>A crew. A job. A plan. Toss those ingredients together, and you’ve got yourself a classic heist—but with a few twists. Your crew members are everyday citizens (from different countries in Africa) with pretty normal careers. The job is to liberate African artifacts from Western museums. And the plan? Well, that’s up to you to create.</p><p><strong>Africanfutur-heist</strong></p><p>Near the end of the 21st century, the political powers that be brokered a Transatlantic Returns Treaty, promising the repatriation of African artifacts from museums. Good old fashioned diplomacy was working—until it wasn’t. An amendment switched up the terms and conditions of which objects were to be returned. Museums, now knowing that only publicly displayed artifacts would be given back, were slowly removing artifacts from public display.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>When life gives you lemons and museums pulling shady moves, it’s time to chuck the lemons back at life and try a new, <a title="Genres > Stealth [87 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">stealth</a>ier form of diplomacy. You’ve got 70 of these artifacts to (re)loot, all of which exist in real-life and are of huge cultural, historical, and spiritual significance to the people they were taken from.</p><p><strong>Teamwork Makes The Heist Work</strong></p><p>It all starts with a troublesome little brother, who, yeah, gets you into all sorts of messes. But thankfully, as Nomali, you’ll meet more reliable crew members from different African countries. Recruit people from the classic hacker to… your prim and proper grandma? Don’t worry, grandma pulls her weight.</p><p><strong>Case the Joint</strong></p><p>Plan ahead to lay the groundwork for a beautiful masterpiece of an escape. Check the getaway route, fiddle with puzzles and obstacles, and find spots to recruit the help of the right teammates.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_971428"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Get In. Get Out.</strong></p><p>Once you’ve set the stage carefully and the artifact is sitting all pretty—looking quite not-stolen, but no worries, you’re gonna fix that ASAP—this is the moment to perform. Plucking an artifact from its resting spot starts the countdown timer, and with Nomali’s flow-based parkour abilities, escape should feel like you’re in the fun, montage part of a heist movie. But if you slacked on the planning phase, you’re gonna pay for it!</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Pull Off Heists</strong> – Plan and prepare your escape route by solving puzzles and placing teammates in the right place. When you’re ready, take the artifact and escape with Nomali’s flow-based parkour abilities.</li><li><strong>Recruit a Crew</strong> – Meet and gradually recruit different team members with their unique abilities.</li><li><strong>Explore an Africanfuturist Setting</strong> – With a Hideout based in South Africa, you’ll see parts of Johannesburg imagined in the future.</li><li><strong>Reclaim Real Artifacts</strong> – Recover 70 artifacts that exist in real-life, all of which are of huge cultural, historical, and spiritual significance to the people they were taken from.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

<p>Punching onto Nintendo platforms this year</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>During the Summer Game Fest, Marvel fans were treated to another look at the beat 'em up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">MARVEL Cosmic Invasion</a>, along with a look at two more playable characters.</p>
<p>She-Hulk and Rocket Raccoon will join multiple other characters from the Marvel universe including famous heroes like Captain America, Wolverine and Spider-Man. Here's a bit of PR and you can see the new trailer above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After Annihilus has launched an unprecedented attack across the galaxy, all life hangs in the balance… To face this threat, She-Hulk forgoes litigation and takes matters into her own hands; get ready to grapple and toss enemies around with her gamma-powered might! And if you’re more into firepower, blast your way through a barrage of bugs with Rocket Raccoon and his hard-hitting futuristic arsenal! With his penchant for sporadically lobbing grenades, you’re looking at MARVEL Cosmic Invasion’s most chaotic fighter yet.</p></blockquote><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p><blockquote>
<p>She-Hulk and Rocket Raccoon join Captain America, Wolverine, Spider-Man, Storm, Phyla-Vell, Venom, and Nova as part of an out-of-this-world roster inspired by classic MARVEL comic books!</p>
<p>Get ready to brawl through the streets of New York City all the way to the depths of the Negative Zone to foil Annihilus’ vow to spread death across the cosmos in classically inspired side-scrolling combat!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is another game from Dotemu and Tribute Games (known for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_shredders_revenge">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge</a> and the upcoming release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/scott_pilgrim_ex">Scott Pilgrim EX</a>).
