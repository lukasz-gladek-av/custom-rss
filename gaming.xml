<p>Baaaaaa!</p>

<p>If you've played Ultimate Chicken Horse before, then you'll know just how brilliant it is when you're able to play with a handful of friends. Well, now developer Clever Endeavour Games is back with a sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ultimate_sheep_raccoon">Ultimate Sheep Raccoon</a>.</p>
<p>Better yet, it's launching on Switch and Switch 2 this <strong>Winter</strong>!</p>
<p>Like the original, Ultimate Sheep Raccoon has you race across courses in which you place obstacles to make life much harder for your opponents. The twist, however, is that they also affect <em>you</em>. So you need to make sure you're making the course as difficult as possible while also ensuring it's still actually doable. Kinda like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_maker_2">Mario Maker</a>!</p>
<p>This time, you'll be racing along on bikes, so you'll have the opportunity to pull off some sick tricks while avoiding buzzsaws, hammers, electric fences, and what have you. Cross-platform play is also supported, with up to 8 players able to take part in each race.</p>

<p><em>What do you make of Ultimate Sheep Raccoon? Will you be picking it up? Let us know with a comment in the usual place.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Nintendo Life’s resident horror fanatic, when he’s not knee-deep in Resident Evil and Silent Hill lore, Ollie likes to dive into a good horror book while nursing a lovely cup of tea.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/honor-of-kings-world-resurfaces-with-gorgeous-gdc-2025-trailer/">Honor of Kings: World</a> is a new spin on the widely successful mobile MOBA, Honor of Kings, which is consistently one of the most played games across the entire planet. World brings the mobile series directly to PC alongside its mobile version, and players will get their first chance to try it out at Gamescom 2025.</p>



<p>TiMi Studio has announced that it will be at Gamescom later this month with a demo of Honor of Kings: World in hand, and if you'll be at Gamescom in just a couple of weeks from the time of this writing, then make sure to head over to Hall 9, Booth B040 to check out the PvP and PvE gameplay that'll be featured in World.</p>



<p>Unlike the original Honor of Kings game, World is not a MOBA, but a multiplayer adventure RPG, and plays significantly differently from the mobile MOBA. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>While this is the first time the general public will get the chance to try out Honor of Kings: World, Wccftech and other members of the press got the chance to try it out earlier this year at GDC. Even though it was just a small slice of the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/honor-of-kings-world-gdc-2025-hands-on-and-developer-qa/">Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto and Alessio Palumbo still walked away impressed</a> from what they played and saw.</p>



<p>"<em>It may not have been on my radar before GDC 2025, but I would absolutely check out Honor of Kings: World again sometime later this year. While no PlayStation release is a bit of a bummer, the UI and bite-sized missions would be perfect on the go for mobile gamers</em>."</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/demonschool-release-date-september-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/long-delayed-rpg-demonschool-finally-gets-september-release-date.1264602/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Necrosoft and publisher Ysbryd have announced that&nbsp;<em>Demonschool</em>, the long-delayed tactical RPG about balancing demon-hunting and university life, is coming this September.</p>

<p>This news was announced during today's Nintendo Indie World show, but for some reason, the announcement was left out of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-indie-world-august-2025-show" rel="nofollow">the Western presentation</a>; instead, it was revealed during the Japanese show. Strange, but that's life.</p>

<p>Of course, this isn't the first time we've had a promise that&nbsp;<em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/demonschool-release-date" rel="nofollow">would be launching in September</a>&nbsp;(albeit not this September), but hopefully, the game won't be delayed again and Necrosoft can finally release it. This certainly feels like a full stop rather than a tentative comma.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/demonschool-release-date-2025-combat.jpg?itok=0nzmYzpV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/demonschool-release-date-2025-combat.jpg?itok=P3-fniAb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>is finally bringing its demon-hunting, school-attending RPG goodness this September.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Demonschool</em>, it's a tactical RPG that was first announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/demonschool-persona-inspired-tactics-rpg-announced" rel="nofollow">all the way back in June 2022</a>. Inspired by the&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>series, as well as Italian horror movies, the game essentially marries the tactical combat of&nbsp;<em>Into the Breach&nbsp;</em>with the life-sim elements of Atlus' celebrated RPG series.</p>

<p>You play as Faye, the last in a long line of demon-hunters. She "loves to punch up", but she's not just about violence; she's also a caring person, as you'll learn through her relationships with her companions.</p>

<p>Necrosoft is promising a "light horror narrative told through huge avatars with side quests aplenty" in&nbsp;<em>Demonschool</em>; you'll be able to build relationships with each of the game's 15 characters, and doing so will also help you to strengthen your party for combat.</p>

<p>That combat takes the form of a turn-based tactical system in which you can strategically rewind in order to create combos and outfox your opponents. You can also use your environment contextually for extra bonuses.</p>




<p><em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>will finally be launching across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1900250/Demonschool/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10007754" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on September 3rd (assuming it doesn't get delayed again, at any rate). Stay tuned for more.</p>

I am neither a wrestler nor a wrestling fan. I have never attended a cage fight or hit somebody with a folding chair. I have never had a blowoff or no-sold somebody's attempt to lay the smackdown on my randy ass. I <em>cannot</em> smell what the Rock is cooking. I cannot. Nonetheless, I think a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades">Hades</a>-style roguelite built around grappling sounds like a fun time, especially when it's set in a cursed Byzantine citadel. This is Realm Of Fame from Black Cube Games. Can you smell what the trailer is cooking?

<p>
"In this mystical roguelike, you play as Maj, a wandering soul driven by redemption and purpose," explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3310030/Realm_of_Fame/">the Steam page</a>. "Master grapples, throws, and counters in battles where every encounter with twisted spirits and mythic heroes feels like an ancient duel of strength, wit, and resolve."
</p>
<p>
The game's combat certainly appears to lean into the wrasslin' gimmick, though it's just as defined by magic. When you do a groundpound (is this a "smackdown"? Sources cannot confirm at the time of writing) on a burly wolfman, it may send energy waves shooting out in all directions. Expect an "ever-shifting labyrinth of storms and enchanted valleys", too, with boss fights in which you go up against corrupted classical celebs such as Hercules. If it were Achilles, we could make a joke about turning heel.
</p>
<p>
Maj's unlockable moves have names like "falcon dive", "slumber serenade" and "bubble suspension", all of which sound far too lyrical for WWE. As for where he gets his sorcerous buffness, it comes from "a mystical force called the Lover's Wind". Unfortunately, on acquiring the Lover's Wind, Maj accidentally unleashed a countervailing Evil Wind, which is the source of the world's corruption. Is <em>this</em> what the Rock was cooking? I think the Rock needs to lay off the sprouts for a while.
</p>
<p>I realise I'm leaning on the WWE gags here, but lobbing dudes around like sacks of potatoes is a pastime that stretches far beyond WWE. Amongst other things, I've just learned that "wrassling" is actually a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornish_wrestling">Cornish profession</a>. Are there any other athletic precedents and traditions I should be invoking here? The developers are also the creators of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/916140/The_Tale_of_Bistun/">The Tale Of Bistun</a>, which is based on an epic Persian romantic poem from the 12th century, "Khosrow and Shirin".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zangief-basically-gets-his-own-game-in-hades-style-wrestling-roguelike-realm-of-fame]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Starting today, Xbox Insiders who have enrolled in the PC Gaming Preview will find Gaming Copilot (beta) in the Game Bar for Windows PCs. </p>



<p>Gaming Copilot is a feature that helps players reach gameplay faster, sharpens their skills, and guides them through obstacles. The early beta version was previously available through the Xbox Mobile app, enabling players to access Copilot on a second screen. Now, select players have received an even more integrated experience. </p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-gaming-copilot-beta-features">Xbox Gaming Copilot Beta Features</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Gaming Copilot beta will track the player’s Xbox activity “to provide an experience centred around you”. Players can ask for help with the game they are playing, or with games they are interested in or want to discover. Additionally, you can also ask questions about your account, play history and achievements. </p>



<p>The Gaming Copilot widgets can be pinned to the screen and used through Voice mode. This mode allows players to use the feature while actively playing the game. Players can ask for tips or any other help without stopping the gameplay. All they need to do is select the ‘Microphone’ option in the Gaming Copilot widget, and the conversation can be continued seamlessly whenever the player is stuck. </p>



<p>Moreover, when the Xbox Insider asks Gaming Copilot for help during voice mode, it will take screenshots of the player’s gameplay to provide more helpful responses. This allows players to refer to events in the game as they occur, without needing a detailed description. </p>



<p>The Gaming Copilot (beta) is also available on Windows Handhelds for Xbox Insiders, albeit with limited functionality. The early preview is currently available only to Insiders in select regions. You can check out the complete list <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/06/gaming-copilot-beta-begins-rolling-out-to-xbox-insiders-on-game-bar-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>. </p>

Explore a variety of genres, from <a title="Genres > Platformer [723 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/platformer">platformer</a>s and <a title="Genres > Shoot 'Em Up [807 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shoot-em-up">shoot ’em up</a>s to puzzle games, <a title="Genres > Roguelite [269 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelite">roguelites</a>, and <a title="Genres > RPG [17,483 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a>. Our goal is to combine a familiar 8-bit aesthetic with new ideas and modern game design.</p><ul><li><strong>50 Brand New Games</strong> – These are NOT minigames or microgames! Although the size of each game varies, every one is a complete experience with its own title screen, intro, and ending. Some are small arcade-style games but there are also larger open-world <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,441 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>s and a <a title="Genres > JRPG [1,736 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/jrpg">JRPG</a> that could take many hours to beat.</li><li><strong>An Alternate Universe</strong> – According to the story of <em>UFO 50</em>, the games were all created by a fictional 80s video game company that was obscure but ahead of its time. Some games are sequels to other games in the collection and various characters appear in multiple titles as part of a shared continuity.</li><li><strong>An Instant Library</strong> – All 50 games are available to play at the start! The concept was inspired by multicarts, retro collections, and the experience of going to a friend’s house and perusing their game library. Jump in and out of games at a whim – exploring the collection is part of the fun!</li><li><strong>Authentic But Also Modern</strong> – We carefully chose what elements to modernize. Every game shares a unique 32-color palette and we took great efforts to make them look and sound like actual 8-bit titles from the 80s. On the other hand, it was important to us that <em>UFO 50</em> was fun and surprising for modern players, so we chose not to limit ourselves to the genres and design conventions of the past.</li><li><strong>Versus and Cooperative Play</strong> – Roughly a third of the collection features local multiplayer, including <a title="Genres > Co-Op [310 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> play and versus. You can compete head-to-head in a new fighting or <a title="Genres > Strategy [271 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/strategy">strategy game</a>… or team up to beat a classic <a title="Genres > Arcade [84 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/arcade">arcade game</a> from an alternate timeline. It’s great for groups!</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Here are some of games you’ll get to play in <em>UFO 50</em>:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Campanella 2</em></strong>&nbsp;– The sequel to Campanella (another game in <em>UFO 50</em>), <em>Campanella 2</em> features procedurally-generated levels where you can explore in your UFO but also hop out to enter shops and dangerous caves. You play as the intrepid treasure-hunter Isabell, but she hasn’t always been a hero – by playing the entire collection you can learn more about her past.</li><li><strong><em>Quibble Race</em></strong> – In this unique sci-fi “horse-<a title="Genres > Racing [265 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a>” game, the goal is to win more money than your opponents, but why stop at betting? Thanks to the seedy alien underworld, you can hire thugs to tamper with the race or even sponsor your own quibble to earn extra credits. But your opponents can do the same, so the question is… how well can you anticipate their actions? Up to three players can compete in this turn-based game of betting and bluffing.</li><li><strong><em>Pingolf</em></strong> – A fan favorite at PAX, <em>Pingolf</em> is another fun multiplayer game that mixes golf with pinball. As you navigate 18 holes filled with bumpers, trampolines, and other crazy obstacles, a dot matrix display will light up at the bottom of the screen to cheer you on!</li><li><strong><em>Seaside Drive</em></strong> – Sometimes you’ll want a break from long, <a title="Genres > Open-World [689 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world games</a> and challenging strategy titles, so why not jump into a straight-forward arcade-style <a title="Genres > Action [2,912 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a> like <em>Seaside Drive</em>? But even in a popular genre, <em>UFO 50</em> brings something new to the table—in this case, Ojiro Fumoto (the creator of <em>Downwell</em>) designed a stylish car-based shoot ’em up where “drifting” across the screen is how you power-up your gun.</li><li><strong><em>Grimstone</em></strong> – Yes, there is a full blown JRPG in the collection! <em>Grimstone</em> follows many conventions from 8-bit console RPGs, but is streamlined for a modern audience. Also, to make combat more engaging, we added a skill-based component to battles and encounters on the overworld can be strategically avoided. The story takes place in the American Wild West, where somehow the land has been swallowed up by Hell! Creating your party from the ashes of a burned-down saloon, you’ll be looking for answers as to why it happened.</li></ul><p>And that’s just five games! Out of 50! So come join us and enjoy this collection of 8-bit classics from another dimension! There’s something for everyone!</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/ufo-50-now-available-for-switch]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Sony's live-service video game releases haven't all succeeded like Helldivers 2 did, with Concord being a particularly high-profile failure. Sony CFO Lin Tao said during the company's earnings briefing this week that "it's not entirely going smoothly" as it relates to live-service games. But Tao pointed out that Sony has come a long way in the past half-decade.</p><p>"If you look five years ago, live-service games were almost non-existent for PlayStation Studios," Tao said, <a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/sony-on-marathon-live-service-strategy-its-not-entirely-going-smoothly/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by This Week In Video Games.</a> "In terms of the transformation, it's not entirely going smoothly, but from a longer-term perspective, if you look at the changes over five years, you see that there has definitely been change."</p>

<p>Tao went on to say that Sony is still working through "many issues" in its pursuit of live-service games. "So we should learn lessons from mistakes and make sure that we introduce live-service content, where there's less waste and it's more smooth," Tao said.</p><p>For now, Tao pointed to games like Helldivers 2, MLB The Show 26, Gran Turismo 7, and Destiny 2 as live-service games that have been "contributing to sales and profit in a stable manner."</p><p>One of Sony's upcoming live-service projects is Bungie's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/" data-ref-id="1100-6514617">Marathon</a>, and Tao acknowledged there has been "somewhat negative news" surrounding the game in recent times. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/" data-ref-id="1100-6530826">Hands-on previews</a> with the game were not overwhelmingly positive, and after the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-responds-to-marathon-art-theft-claims/1100-6531591/" data-ref-id="1100-6531591">discovery of stolen artwork</a>, Sony <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-delayed-with-no-new-date-announced/1100-6532505/" data-ref-id="1100-6532505">delayed Marathon indefinitely.</a> The game remains lined up for release by the end of March 2026, but Tao said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-exec-expects-marathon-to-launch-by-march-31-says-bungies-independence-is-getting-lighter/1100-6533759/" data-ref-id="1100-6533759">"this is not a commitment."</a></p><p>Before this, Sony boss Hermen Hulst said Sony learned from Concord's mistakes, pledging that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-re-commits-to-live-service-games-says-bungies-marathon-wont-suffer-concords-fate/1100-6532419/" data-ref-id="1100-6532419">Marathon would not suffer the same fate.</a> Concord launched in August 2024 and quickly shut down, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-shuts-down-concord-permanently-shutters-dev-firewalk-studios/1100-6527460/" data-ref-id="1100-6527460">developer Firewalk shuttered.</a></p><p>Beyond Marathon, Sony also has the live-service game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fairgames-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529539/" data-ref-id="1100-6529539">Fairgame$</a> coming up, but<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jade-raymond-leaves-fairgame-studio-game-now-delayed-to-spring-2026/1100-6531583/" data-ref-id="1100-6531583"> its studio head recently left and the game was reportedly delayed due to poor feedback to a recent test.</a></p><p>Sony had grand plans in the live-service department, at one point saying it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-projects-launching-12-live-service-games-by-2025/1100-6503924/" data-ref-id="1100-6503924">a dozen live-service projects in the works</a> before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-halving-the-number-of-playstation-live-service-games-that-it-aims-to-launch-by-march-2026/1100-6519039/" data-ref-id="1100-6519039">cutting that number in half.</a> One of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-went-wrong-with-the-last-of-us-online-according-to-an-ex-sony-exec/1100-6529585/" data-ref-id="1100-6529585">scuttled projects was The Last of Us Online</a>, while a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/" data-ref-id="1100-6528869">live-service God of War game was also reportedly axed.</a></p><p>Sony's live-service games are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-boss-reveals-why-sony-doesnt-release-most-ps5-games-on-pc-day-and-date/1100-6523804/" data-ref-id="1100-6523804">released across PC and PS5</a>, and Sony's expansion to new platforms continues when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-published-game-helldivers-2-is-coming-to-xbox-in-august/1100-6532942/" data-ref-id="1100-6532942">Helldivers 2 comes to Xbox. </a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The past few months have been rocky for my mental health, so I’ve come back to a reliable source of joy: fixating on a specific piece of media until it is my entire personality. My weapon of choice at the moment is <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>. I have read mountains of comics, re-watched all the movies, and bought a fan-made T-shirt. The only thing left for me to do was play the much maligned Eidos Montreal <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> video game. I really enjoyed it, which surprised me. But what I found most interesting about it was the ways the game is straining against the limitations of when it was made.</p><p>Despite strong reviews, 2021’s <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> is often credited with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enixs-embracer-sale-300-million-sale-opinion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prompting</a> Square Enix to sell Eidos Montreal to Embracer Group after the game’s <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/square-enix-claims-marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-has-undershot-sales-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sales failed to meet Square’s expectations</a>. It’s a shame that this is the game’s legacy, because well, it’s fun. I was a hater about the dialogue when the game released; I was <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/when-joss-whedon-was-our-master/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">neck deep in Joss Whedon collected works</a>, and they do actually say “that happened!” in this game. But the more I waded into <em>Guardians </em>recently, the more I appreciated the craft at work in its dialogue.</p><p><em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> lore is incredibly convoluted, especially because the Guardians are perhaps the biggest victims of Marvel wanting to synergize the comics with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The first modern appearance of Peter Quill, Starlord, is in a 2004 <em>Thanos</em> comic, written by Keith Giffen and illustrated by Ron Lim (the character originated in 1976 as a generic space hero, but these appearances have been removed from continuity—or maybe not? It’s hard to tell.). In this appearance, Quill has cybernetics in his face and has been imprisoned in the galactic prison The Kyln for collateral damage to the tune of 350,000 people while trying to save a planet from a cosmic threat. Over time, he manages to escape prison, put together the Guardians of the Galaxy, die, then get better. When James Gunn was asked to adapt this character for a movie, a lot of this background was changed, and thus, Quill’s depiction in the comics also changed to match the movies. Gone was the grizzled war veteran, replaced instead with a snarky outlaw.</p><figure><figcaption>My blorbos from my show | <a href="https://press.na.square-enix.com/Marvels-Guardians-of-the-Galaxy#?tab=combo&amp;scrollto=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eidos Montreal</a></figcaption></figure><p>I mention this because I remember complaining with my friends that the Peter Quill who appears in this game felt too similar to his depiction in Gunn’s movies. The truth is, Peter Quill is written differently basically every time he appears. What the Eidos Montreal game does is take the best parts of all the lore of the characters and mix ‘em together into a big stew. It mostly works, but it does make one wonder who the audience for this game actually is.</p><p>Peter Quill, like the movies, is still kidnapped the day his mother dies—but she dies from being shot by aliens, not cancer. He’s still desperately grasping onto the Earth culture he remembers, but it’s hair metal and 80s pop songs instead of James Gunn’s Gen Xer classic rock. Gamora is still the deadliest woman in the galaxy and Thanos’ daughter, but like the comics, she doesn’t have a romantic relationship with Quill. Drax is overly literal, but he’s on a revenge quest to kill Thanos, not Ronan the Accuser. Rocket Raccoon still has a Brooklyn accent, but he’s from Halfworld this time. Groot is pretty much the same, and he’s my friend.</p><p>This game was released at a time when the MCU was like a parasitic entity in every facet of popular culture. This was the era of <em>WandaVision</em> and <em>The Eternals</em> and <em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em>, media so mediocre and so successful that I wound myself up into a frenzy trying to explain to people on the internet why I didn’t like them. I can understand why <em>Guardians</em> was a hard sell in this ecosystem. It’s not enough like the movies to appeal to fans, and not dissimilar enough from the movies to appeal to non-fans. Yet in playing it, I can feel it striving to be its own thing: a very playable, charming action game that makes you feel like you’re hanging out with The Guys. The Guardians of the Galaxy here are less like a band of outlaws and more like a musical group that’s spent a little too long on the road with each other. It really gives “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IM472k0Md8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">If This Tour Doesn’t Kill You, I Will</a>.”</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://press.na.square-enix.com/Marvels-Guardians-of-the-Galaxy#?tab=combo&amp;scrollto=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eidos Montreal</a></figcaption></figure><p>People who are irritated with each other will often come off as irritating to others. In the early portions of the game, listening to everyone argue is a struggle. But the arc here is obvious—as time goes on, everyone opens up to each other, and the way they riff as they grow closer is often very funny. In a middle game chapter, the Guardians are tasked by Cosmo, a psychic dog, to explore a destroyed space station. Drax, taking this task very literally, narrates out loud “dog report items” to send to Cosmo. <em>Everyone</em> in the group hates this incessant narration, but by the end of the mission Rocket has started pointing out extremely obvious dangers as “dog report items” because he knows it’ll make everyone groan. Reader: that is something I would absolutely do in real life. And I would do it because it has the same effect in this game as it does in real life. It takes the edge off of the hostility towards another person. It creates comradery. Eventually, it becomes funny.</p><p>I think when people talk about “good writing” in video games, they often mean “writing that is dark.” I appreciate the dedication to realism in dialogue here much more than twists and turns or melodrama. It becomes easier to see what audience Eidos Montreal was aiming for when you think about it in this way. They wanted the kinds of people who watch CW shows and like action movies, who might not be into the MCU but like 80s music and aren’t above the occasional pop culture reference. They want players like Peter Quill: people who grew up listening to metal songs about alien invaders, reading fantasy novels, and who have enough real life responsibilities that a twenty hour game is maybe the only thing they have time for. A general, non-gamer audience.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s there that the game becomes a little fraught for me, because the gameplay is what is straining against these parameters.The gameplay doesn’t suck, exactly, but while playing it I could really feel the economy of assets and mechanics. For instance, at least once a chapter, you go down a big slide. Every environment, from an alien planet to a Nova Corps battle ship, has a big ol’ slide. Once Quill gets the ice mode for his element guns, you’re constantly freezing over pipes that leak out poison gas. Enemy variety is basically non-existent. And while I disagree with the reviews at the time that said you’re not incentivized to use your fellow Guardians’ combat skills—fights feel so snappy and kinetic when you’re bouncing off your allies—I do agree that battles feel grindy, and that most bosses are just bullet sponges.</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://press.na.square-enix.com/Marvels-Guardians-of-the-Galaxy#?tab=combo&amp;scrollto=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eidos Montreal</a></figcaption></figure><p>What’s most frustrating are that mechanics that are fun to play with feel like the studio just… ran out of money or time to see them through to their fullest expression. Throughout the game you’re given choices to make as Peter Quill, leader of the Guardians, and each choice does have a real impact on what happens in the story. Early on you’re given the chance to either hide illegal tech or a space llama from the Nova Corps. If you choose to hide the llama, you’ll miss out on advanced weaponry for your ship, but the llama will be able to help you escape your room when you get trapped inside it later on. Some choices happen in the heat of battle—in one scene, Gamora ran off to chase after the game’s big villain, and my Peter followed her. Not only does this make her furious with you for the rest of the chapter, it makes the boss fight way harder. All of this is great, especially because it leans on the best aspect of the game: its characters and dialogue. But it just doesn’t happen enough.</p><p>Given the privilege of time, I can understand why <em>Guardians</em> is like this. In some ways it reminds me of the smoothed edges of <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, a game that was seeking to bring in a new audience to its longrunning fiddly RPG epic. In order to appeal to non-gamers, it made its gameplay systems less complex, gave you less interaction with its characters, simplified everything lest it make potential players confused or intimidated. No one really liked this—not me, a longtime player of <em>Dragon Age</em>, and not non-gamers, who I imagine felt condescended to in the same way I did.&nbsp;</p><p>In a post-<em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> world, it’s clear that more is more. Non-gamers don’t care if a game is extremely complex or fiddly. They <em>like</em> that. They like trying things and discovering what they can do. They like optional, and missable, conversations with companions. They like dying by accident, trying and failing, crowdsourcing knowledge to learn the best ways to get through combat. They like it so much that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-larians-huge-2023-profits-revealed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Baldur’s Gate </em>sold 15 million copies</a>.</p><p>Can you imagine a world where <em>Guardians</em> could have taken cues from <em>Baldur’s Gate</em>’s success? Where it could have had <em>more</em> systems, a more reactive environment for the element guns, more choices, more dialogue, where the infamously horny Peter Quill could have had a romance system? Where we weren’t all so fatigued by the MCU that the idea of willingly playing an MCU game didn’t feel utterly exhausting?</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/merge-maestro-addictive-roguelite-ios-puzzle-game"><h3>Oh No, Merge Maestro Is Going To Be A Problem</h3></a><p>Merge Maestro is an addictive, deck builder that's easy to pick up and surprisingly complex.

</section></header><section>

<p>After a few lengthy delays, the tactical RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demonschool">Demonschool</a> has finally secured a final release date for the Switch, and you've not got long to wait. As announced during the Indie World Japan showcase, the Necrosoft Games-developed title will launch on <strong>3rd September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>The game is influenced by the likes of <strong>Persona</strong> and <strong>Shin Megami Tensei</strong>, along with – and this is brilliant – italian horror cinema..? <em>Excuse</em> me?! So cool. Plenty of footage has already been made available through trailers and gameplay showcases, so if you haven't checked out Demonschool yet, then definitely take a peek when you can. It looks awesome.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it's nice to finally get a proper release date, and it sounds like Necrosoft's Brandon Sheffield is equally relieved, stating "“At long last, Demonschool is finally coming out. It's been a long road but we're through certification and ready to go. We really put a lot of ourselves into this thing and now the future of Demonschool is in your hands. We truly hope you will enjoy it."</p>
<p>We hope so too!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Kitfox Games and Freehold Games have announced that <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/caves_of_qud">Caves of Qud</a></strong> is finally on its way to Switch via a Q4 2025 release. That's not even very far away!</p>
<p>For those who haven't heard of the game before, Caves of Qud is a game that spent a whopping 15 years in development and early access on PC, before releasing on that platform in December of last year to some outrageously gushing reviews.</p>
<p>We're looking at a retro-styled roguelike that's apparently got all of the goods here. Enough to make it a standout in one of the most oversaturated genres of all time, even. Wow. It certainly looks unique, with some fairly busy visuals that meld retro gaming chic with what looks like root directories from your dad's old PC. The good stuff, in short. You can also tell by the barmy text on-screen, and tons of lore at every turn, that there's a depth to the world you'll blast through.</p>
<p>You can check out the trailer above, and we'll leave you with some further details about the game itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Caves of Qud is a science fantasy roguelike epic steeped in retrofuturism, deep simulation, and swathes of sentient plants. Come inhabit a living, breathing world and chisel through layers of thousand-year-old civilizations. Decide: is it a dying earth, or is it on the verge of rebirth? Do anything and everything. Caves of Qud is a deeply simulated, biologically diverse, richly cultured world.</p>
<p><strong>DEEP PHYSICAL SIMULATION</strong> — Don’t like the wall blocking your way? Dig through it with a pickaxe, or eat through it with your corrosive gas mutation, or melt it to lava. Yes, every wall has a melting point.</p>
<p><strong>FULLY SIMULATED CREATURES</strong> — Every monster and NPC is as fully simulated as the player. That means they have levels, skills, equipment, faction allegiances, and body parts. So if you have a mutation that lets you, say, psionically dominate a spider, you can traipse through the world as a spider, laying webs and eating things.</p>
<p><strong>DYNAMIC FACTION SYSTEM</strong> — Pursue allegiances with over 70 factions: apes, crabs, trees, robots, and highly entropic beings, just to name a few.</p>
<p><strong>RICHLY DETAILED SCIENCE FANTASY SETTING</strong> — Over fifteen years of worldbuilding have led to a rich, weird, labyrinthine, one-of-a-kind storyworld, layered on top of the simulation, all for you to explore. Live and drink, friend.</p>
<p><strong>TACTICAL GAMEPLAY</strong> — Turn-based, sandbox exploration and combat offers as many solutions as you and your mutations, implants, artifacts, and skills are creative enough to invent.</p>
<p><strong>RPG ELEMENTS</strong> — Quests, NPCs, villages, historic sites; some dynamic and some handwritten, interwoven to produce a transportative RPG experience.</p>
<p><strong>Play one of four modes:</strong></p>
<p><strong>CLASSIC</strong> — Like other traditional roguelikes, this mode has permadeath, meaning you lose your character when you die. Extremely challenging even for experts.<br>
<strong>ROLEPLAY</strong> — Play it like an RPG. Save your progress at checkpoints located in settlements.<br>
<strong>WANDER</strong> — Focus on exploration. Most creatures will not attack you, you don’t gain experience by killing, but you DO gain experience by discovering new locations and treating with legendary creatures.<br>
<strong>DAILY</strong> — One chance with a fixed character and world seed. How long will you survive?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Get to your ships!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/arcade_archives_d-day">D-Day</a>, Jaleco's 1984 arcade shooter, will arrive today on Nintendo Switch as part of Arcade Archives. The game, which this writer remembers quite enjoying back in ye olden days, sees players control a warship as it sails right up the screen, shooting down planes and blowing everything to ribbons as it goes.</p>
<p>Players have a selection of two weapons, and the little reticles on the screen, that you can see in the trailer above, pertain to each of these. Now, there was another D-Day game, in fact there have been a few, but this is the vertical shooter one, not the 1985 strategy game (which was impossibly difficult).</p>
<p>Watching the above trailer, we're also brought back to the wonderful world of mid-80s era arcade tunes and sound effects. A cacophony of ill-fitting music and incredibly loud beeps, boops and blasts await any soldiers brave enough to take on the challenge. The longest day, indeed.</p>
<p>Here's some more details and pics from the official press material:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"D-DAY" is a shooter released by JALECO in 1984.<br>
Your mission is to pilot your battleship, fending off enemy battleships and bombers, and destroy the enemy fortress.<br>
Today is the day the operation is to take place. The longest day begins...</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/demonschool-announced-for-pc-and-consoles/">Demonschool</a>, the tactical role-playing game developed by Necrosoft Games and published by Ysbryd Games, will launch next month on PC and consoles after being delayed indefinitely last year.</p>



<p>As announced during today's Nintendo Indie World Japan, the game will launch on September 3 on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Serie S, and Nintendo Switch. To celebrate the announcement, a new short trailer was also shared, showcasing some of the fifteen playable characters, all with unique fighting styles, the game's retro graphics, the battle system, and more. You can find the trailer below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Demonschool release date trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fazy1L9KXFQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Demonschool has been in development for quite some time, and at one point, it looked like work on the game had stopped.&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/demonschool-preview/">Last year</a>, however, the game was relaunched with a playable demo that did an amazing job showcasing its unique premise and, most of all, its excellent battle system. You can learn more about it in my preview.</p>



<p><em>A few rather unique quirks make the Demonschool combat system intriguing. For starters, units can only move in straight lines and must use a special maneuver called Sidestep, which doesn't cost AP to adjust their movement range. Attacking enemies requires positioning characters in the correct range, and each attack also pushes the attacked unit, allowing the player to plan things out so that it will become possible to attack an enemy out of range at the start of the Planning Phase. Additionally, just defeating enemies is not enough to win, as not only players must defeat a required number of demons, but they also have to reach the opposite side of the combat arena with any character to seal a portal. Add in different roles for playable characters, frequent demon respawns, and special attacks with different properties, and you get a uniquely challenging battle system that could take some time to understand, but it offers a lot of strategic depth, making battles extremely fun.</em></p>



<p>Demonschool launches on September 3 on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Over the past decade and a half, <em>Eurogamer’s</em> <em>Digital Foundry </em>has become the most knowledgeable and trustworthy place to find out <em>just</em> how powerful a new video game console might be, where the hottest new games run the best, and why they sometimes <em>don’t</em>! <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-sony-ps5-pro-tech-interview-with-mark-cerny-and-mike-fitzgerald">Even Sony</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2017-project-scorpio-tech-revealed">and Microsoft</a> often favor <em>DF</em> for exclusive access to technical details.</p><p>But as of today, <em>Digital Foundry </em>is no longer a <em>Eurogamer</em> sub-brand, and it’s no longer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/21/24161718/ign-gamer-network-acquisition">controlled by <em>IGN</em></a>. <em>DF</em>’s founder has purchased the publication and its complete archives, and a team of five is taking it completely independent.</p><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/664747/giant-bomb-independent-gaming-site-employee-owned">Like <em>Giant Bomb</em></a>, or the former <em>Kotaku</em> writers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/7/23949269/aftermath-video-games-kotaku-defector">who created <em>Aftermath</em></a>, it’s the latest example of video game journalists finding a path that’s different from corporate ownership. “We answer to nobody but you, the audience,” <em>DF</em> now says, as part of <a href="https://youtu.be/tl7bIJ2yu4I">a new podcast episode explaining the change</a>.</p></div><p>Buying <em>Digital Foundry </em>wasn’t much of an uphill battle, to hear editor and founder Richard Leadbetter tell it, partly because he only had to buy 25 percent. Leadbetter had been holding onto 50 percent of its shares since 2015, when he originally sold his other half to <em>Eurogamer</em> to help fund <em>DF</em>’s popular YouTube channel. <em>Eurogamer</em>’s parent company Gamer Network obtained that half, which then got acquired by ReedPop, before making its way to <em>IGN</em> when parent company Ziff Davis purchased Gamer Network in turn, each time postponing Leadbetter’s own attempts to buy the rest of his company again.</p><p>Then, this year, <em>IGN</em> suddenly offered to sell its half back: 25 percent to Leadbetter and 25 percent to investor Rupert Loman, who originally founded <em>Eurogamer</em> in 1999 with his brother Nick. But even 25 percent of the company wasn’t cheap: “I think this is pretty much easily the biggest thing I’ve ever bought, more than my house,” Leadbetter says.</p><p>Thankfully, <em>Digital Foundry</em> doesn’t need to worry about building an audience from scratch to pay its journalists. It’s already profitable all on its own, Leadbetter tells <em>The Verge</em> — with an <a href="https://www.patreon.com/digitalfoundry">established audience of paying subscribers on Patreon</a>, whose website estimates it pulls in roughly $200,000 a year, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">a YouTube channel</a> with nearly 1.5 million subscribers.</p><p>But <em>DF</em> wants to <em>build</em> on that profitability, Leadbetter says, and he thinks the team can do that better without corporate ownership. He explains that the previous relationship where he owned half, and <em>IGN</em> or Gamer Network owned half, meant that all new investments had to be agreed upon by two parties with different priorities. “When you’re part of a large corporate entity, that spirit of innovation kind of gives way to the hard numbers,” he says.</p><div><p>(Leadbetter won’t tell me if he ran into any particular difficulties with <em>IGN</em>, but we know that Ziff Davis recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/715220/ziff-davis-creators-guild-cnet-layoffs">cut workers</a> in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/718692/ign-entertainment-layoffs-creators-guild-ziff-davis">back-to-back layoffs</a>, and <em>IGN</em> was one of the affected Ziff Davis brands. The decision doesn’t seem to have anything to do with the time a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V10wHzV5zp0">full-length Nintendo ad was placed on <em>DF</em>’s YouTube channel without initially being labeled as an ad</a>; “The guy who presses the button on YouTube is not <em>IGN</em>, it’s me,” Leadbetter says, calling it an error that won’t happen again.)</p></div><p>So, what does <em>DF </em>plan to build? Without <em>Eurogamer, </em>one thing the team doesn’t have anymore is a proper place for its <em>written</em> words to go. While <em>DF</em> does own <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/">digitalfoundry.net</a>, Leadbetter says it’s currently just a portal to direct people to its videos. He says <em>DF</em> wants to “figure out the business case” to justify creating a larger site.</p><p>The dream is to take nearly two decades of archived <em>Digital Foundry</em> content and turn it into something new, something that’ll additionally make <em>DF</em>’s findings more accessible to a wider audience like many news sites (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/626952/sony-fsr-4-upscaler-coming-to-ps5-pro-reimplementation">shameless plug</a>) try to do. The team would also like to launch a retro games podcast, something <em>DF</em>’s John Linneman says would have been difficult under corporate owners; do more game developer interviews; and try to hire an additional editor to beef up PC coverage if funds allow.</p><p>Leadbetter, Linneman, and colleague Alex Battaglia don’t sound like they’re planning to change the formula much, though. <em>DF</em> plans to stick to PC gaming, retro gaming, and console performance analysis as its “three pillars” and doesn’t plan to chase SEO. Much of this is just about controlling <em>DF</em>’s own destiny, taking control of everything from hiring to sponsorships, ad sales, and merch.</p><p>Nor should you expect to see <em>Digital Foundry</em> move to a subscription-only model. Leadbetter plans to keep the vast majority of content free, the same as it is now, and you shouldn’t even notice a difference on its YouTube channel, where <em>DF</em> plans to deliver the same number of videos without interruption.</p><p>“If we do a website, it’ll be a public-facing website without any sort of pay-gating,” Leadbetter tells me. “There’s always been smaller subscriber bonuses, but ultimately the pitch we’re making is to support us. If you love what we do, please support the team, it really does make a huge amount of difference.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/743535/digital-foundry-game-console-analysis-going-independent]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-4-old-country-august-launch-ps5-xbox-50-trailer-1851779729"><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em></a> brings back the period-piece gangster franchise after almost a full decade with a more streamlined, linear adventure set in early 1900s Italy. Has the experiment paid off? So far it sounds like the results are mixed. Early reviews of the new <em>Mafia</em> are praising the look of its world and the quiet details in-between missions, while some are criticizing what they see as tropey storytelling and dated gameplay.</p> <p><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> is out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on August 8, which technically means it goes live for players in the earliest time zones later today and at midnight for everyone on Steam. Today’s reviews, arriving less than a day out from launch for some some fans based on where they live, are also only for the PC version of the new <em>Mafia</em>. The developers at Hangar 13 have promised a PS5 Pro update for the game will follow, and it’s “targeting” 60fps in performance mode on base PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. But no one will be able to actually test how well that works in practice on console until the full release.</p> <p>The game follows the story of indentured laborer Enzo Favara as he climbs out of the Sicily’s sulfur mines into the family of one of the country’s more notorious crime families. The turn-of-the-century setting makes <em>The Old Country</em> the earliest game in the<em> Mafia</em> series. It’s also been touted as an overhaul of the franchise’s open-world design which got increasingly bloated with <em>Mafia III</em>. The new game is only $50 and takes just 12-14 hours to beat. Does it pay off?</p>

 <p><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> currently sits at 75 on Metacritic, one of the higher scores in a series that usually hovers somewhere around “good but not great.” <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mafia-the-old-country-review-look-but-dont-touch/1900-6418393/"><em>GameSpot’s</em>&nbsp;Jake Dekker praised</a> the characters and look of 1900s Sicily but criticized the simplistic gunplay and lack of depth. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-review"><em>IGN</em> was more upbeat</a>. “It doesn’t reinvent stealth, and there’s nothing especially remarkable about its typical third-person cover shooting – but with great writing, excellent vocal performances, and a wonderful eye and ear for detail, <em>The Old Country</em> is a potent and immersive time machine to a rarely explored era,” wrote reviewer Luke Riley.</p> <p><em>Kotaku</em> will have its own review in the coming days once we’ve had time to test <em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> on console. In the meantime, here’s what other early reviews are saying about the gangster drama’s semi-open-world return:</p> <h2><em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/mafia-the-old-country-review/">Polygon</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>It’s not just about the mafia, nor is it about Italy in the early 1900s.&nbsp;<em>Mafia: The Old Country</em>&nbsp;is a sobering reminder that tough times still create a breeding ground for exploitation today, just as they did in Sicily. When the money is tight and our backs are against the walls, our options narrow as survival becomes a necessity. There are plenty of ways that we end up carrying out someone else’s dirty work that don’t involve pulling a trigger at a don’s behest.<em>&nbsp;The Old Country&nbsp;</em>doesn’t expect you to agree with Enzo’s choices, but it does ask you to understand the societal forces that drove him to them. — Giovanni Colantonio</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/07/arts/mafia-old-country-review.html">The New York Times</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>Resisting the expectation for single-player games to be chockablock with content, <em>The Old Country</em> is sparing and restrained. Its pacing, especially in the first few chapters, is slow and deliberate. Walking as Enzo often feels more natural and rewarding than breaking out into a sprint. It’s the best way to take in the postcard beauty of [developer] Hangar 13’s depiction of Sicily, and to listen in on the conversations between other characters. This world is believable and well-realized. The sprawling Torrisi vineyard, your home base for much of the game, is alive with activity: Cars and horse-drawn carriages come and go constantly, workers pick grapes out in the field, cooks and maids chatter in the kitchen. — Yussef Cole</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/mafia-the-old-country/an-offer-you-can-probably-refuse">Game Informer</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p><em>The Old Country</em> isn’t bad; it’s also not great. Perhaps most depressing, it’s simply fine, inoffensively so. There’s nothing in here you haven’t seen elsewhere, cast included. And worse yet, probably done better. For all the great prequels out there, <em>The Old Country</em> is proof that going backwards isn’t always an interesting way forward.&nbsp; — Wesley LeBlanc</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/mafia-the-old-country/">VGC</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> returns to the series’ roots with a more linear adventure, delivering a solid story (if a cliché-heavy one) and satisfying combat. The character models and environments are stunning to look at, but the latter raises our main issue: as much as we appreciate the focus on a linear story, this wonderfully sculpted Sicily map is begging to be explored more and is sorely underused as a result. — Chris Scullion</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/mafia-the-old-country/review">PCGamesN</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>All of this stems from a confidence in vision that makes <em>The Old Country</em> far richer than its adherence to mob genre storytelling might suggest. There’s a purity to its concentration on small-scale character work, mood setting, and straightforward action that stands apart from the tendency toward convolution and inflation found in so many other big budget videogames. <em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> is a game that knows what it wants to do and rarely deviates from offering just that. In the end, as with any take on a familiar type of story, that makes all the difference. — Reid McCarter</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mafia-the-old-country-review-look-but-dont-touch/1900-6418393/">GameSpot</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> relies on a handful of dated instant-fail stealth segments with poor checkpointing to break up the pace of driving, shooting, and cutscenes in a typical mission. These range from inconvenient to frustrating. One in particular sees Enzo sneaking into a government facility to crack a safe. It’s a fun premise, but one slip-up puts you back outside to start over, regardless of how deep you make it into the building. At first, I gave these instant-fail stealth missions the benefit of the doubt, since there are obvious story reasons why Enzo wouldn’t want to be spotted. However, most of the time, a gunfight erupts anyway, making all that trial and error feel trivial. — Jake Dekker</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-review">IGN</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>Part mob drama and part Western, <em>The Old Country</em> may be a safe and conventional third-person action adventure on the surface, but it’s a moody and engaging one that makes great use of its uncommon setting and is brimming with old school atmosphere so heady you can practically smell the sun-dried tomatoes. — Luke Riley</p></blockquote>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-4-is-getting-a-paid-mods-system-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-4-is-getting-a-paid-mods-system-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1264503/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bethesda is reportedly working on bringing Creations to Fallout 4 to introduce paid mods for the game. </p>



<p>Fallout 4 is yet to receive a proper update since the next-gen upgrade for the title. The developers have released a bug-fixing patch since then, but no major updates have been revealed. As Fallout 5 doesn’t seem to be releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-5-fully-greenlit-bethesda-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anytime soon</a>, players are expecting more content out of Fallout 4, especially after the Amazon Prime series. It seems developers might be fulfilling this wish with a paid mod system that exists for several other Bethesda games. </p>



<h2 id="h-fallout-4-paid-mods-could-arrive-before-season-2">Fallout 4 Paid Mods Could Arrive Before Season 2</h2>



<p>The claim about Fallout 4 paid mods comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-AwL2IrXLw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">JuiceHead</a> on YouTube, who has confirmed these details from multiple sources. JuiceHead has also accurately claimed in the past that Skyrim would receive a new paid mods system, and Creations was released soon after. Moreover, the recent changelog updates on SteamDB suggest that Bethesda is working on something for Fallout 4. The YouTuber also shared that Fallout 4’s press build has undergone some changes as well. </p>



<p>The fact that Fallout 4’s press build is receiving changes hints that Bethesda is testing out new features by giving select users access through the Steam beta. The core aspect of the upcoming update is bringing Creations to Fallout 4, the same system available in Skyrim and Starfield for paid mods. It is speculated that this new system will enable players to view both paid and free mods, and also allow authors to create new paid content for the game. </p>



<p>The Fallout Amazon Prime series has been influential in bringing audiences back to the Fallout games, with Fallout 4 experiencing the most significant growth. As Bethesda has now observed that their games could benefit from other media, they might plan to release the Creations update after or alongside Season 2 of the series, which is scheduled to arrive in December 2025. However, as all of this information doesn’t come from an official source, players should take it with a grain of salt. </p>

<p>In other news, the former Interplay co-founder has revealed that Fallout <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-was-a-sequel-to-eas-wasteland-former-interplay-co-founder-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was a sequel to the 1988 game Wasteland</a>. Additionally, the Fallout: Bakersfield trailer&nbsp;offers an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-bakersfield-trailer-reveals-insane-take-1997/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intriguing take</a> on the 1997 classic.

This puzzle adventure game requires the two players to communicate and work together to solve the puzzles. A new story unfolds in BOKURA: planet’s new setting. Newly added actions and puzzles will be added.</p><p><strong>Progress Through Stages Through Two-Player Cooperation and Puzzle-Solving</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>BOKURA: planet</em> requires two players using two machines to communicate to play this two-player puzzle adventure game.</p><p>The two players must convey what they each are seeing to their partner and work together to solve the puzzles in each stage, but a new “push” action has been added to <em>BOKURA: planet</em>! Players can send each other flying as they play the game…</p><p>…which means that players can push each other off cliffs if one is in the other’s way. Cooperation alone might not be enough this time! Players must not only work together, but anxiously navigate the possibility of confrontation.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>The earth was destroyed, and the few survivors began anew from the Stone Age, and a new civilization was built.</p><p>Eventually, they were able to journey into space, and so they planned to investigate faraway planets.</p><p>However, the distance between the earth and those planets was great, and it would take several hundred years to complete the journey.</p><p>Therefore, those condemned to death row were chosen to carry out the investigation.</p><p>On the journey, the research ship breaks down and two crew members must make an emergency escape.</p><p>They make an emergency landing on an unknown red planet, and they both have their own reason why they must return to Earth.</p><p>Will they be able to return safely?</p><p><strong>The Newest Work from <a title="Companies > Tokoronyori [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/tokoronyori">Tokoronyori</a> (<em>Planet of the Lonely</em>, <em>BOKURA</em>)</strong></p><p>Tokoronyori has continually created mysterious works brimming with originality with his unique worldview and artistic sense. In 2016, <em>Planet of the Lonely</em> became a hot topic on social media.</p><p><em>BOKURA</em> was released in February 2023 as a member Kodansha Game Creators’ Lab Vol. 1, and has sold more than 600,000 copies. It garnered attention from streamers and VTubers in Japan and around the world.</p><p>His specialty is creating experiences that can only be lived in games by incorporating unique settings in his games.</p><p><strong>Message from the Creator</strong></p><p><em>BOKURA: planet</em> is based on ideas from the planning stages of <em>BOKURA</em>.</p><p>At the time, I was able to expand ideas that were antithetical to <em>BOKURA</em>, but I chose to bring various ideas into equilibrium to create <em>BOKURA</em>.</p><p>I am confident that I made the right decision, but at the same time, I often wondered what would have happened if I had pursued some of those other ideas. Eventually, I couldn’t stand wondering what might have been and created <em>BOKURA: planet</em>. It has turned out wonderfully.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/bokura-planet-now-available-for-switch-2-switch]]></content:encoded>
