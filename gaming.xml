            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-transmission-announced-silent-hill-f<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has announced a brand new&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>Transmission showcase for this week, and it sounds like the show will focus pretty much exclusively on the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/SilentHill/status/1899218771375481118" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Konami reveals that the stream will air on March 13th at 3pm Pacific, which is around 6pm Eastern and about 10pm GMT. It's going to be a fairly late one if you're in the UK or Europe.</p>

<p>According to the post, the stream will "uncover&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>", so presumably, we'll get a full reveal for the game. I'm not sure you should hold your breath for a release date, but at the very least we should get a full story reveal and perhaps some gameplay as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-f-reveal-next-week-flower-girl.jpg?itok=otsaKKu5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-f-reveal-next-week-flower-girl.jpg?itok=4fw1eN9z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>was first revealed back in late 2022.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>was revealed via a rather effectively creepy teaser trailer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-and-more-all-but-confirmed" rel="nofollow">back in 2022</a>, but we don't know too much about the game outside of that initial reveal.</p>

<p>The trailer featured some pretty creepy imagery, including a Japanese-style doll and a girl covered in some kind of strange floral growth, but it's not clear yet how those things will fit into&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>'s story.</p>

<p>In the interim, however, Konami didn't forget about&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>; the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake was released late last year, going on to sell <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">over two million copies</a> at last count. It seems the game performed well enough to prompt Konami to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-konami-new-game-ip" rel="nofollow">work with Bloober on another game</a> based on one of the publisher's IPs, too.</p>

<p>You can rewatch the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>teaser trailer (or perhaps even watch it for the first time, if you missed it back in 2022) right here.</p>




<p>The next&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>Transmission will air on March 13th (that's this Thursday!) at 3pm Pacific. It's worth noting that Konami hasn't ruled out other franchise news, so we could well learn more about what's in store for&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>on Thursday as well.</p>

            <p>
The passage of time is unfortunately an unstoppable thing, and I seem to have blinked and five years have passed since the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20">Call of Duty: Warzone</a>. In the intervening period, a sort-of-sequel was released simply titled Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 - now just called Call of Duty: Warzone, too - and the single, bountiful map players War upon has changed several times over. Yesterday on March 10th, the day Warzone officially released back in 2020, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/activision">Activision</a> shared a teaser trailer confirming that the game's original map Verdansk will be making a comeback.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The trailer, which you can check out below, is set to Nat King Cole's classic Unforgettable, all while different characters in a range of military gear lovingly look at dirt, embrace shot-up walls, and cry over the return of Verdansk.
</p>

<p>
To be honest, it feels like a bit of a tone deaf trailer given the general state of the world, but I suppose Call of Duty has never been known for treating these kinds of things sensitively. 
</p>
<p>
It was thought that season 3 of Warzone and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-guns">Black Ops 6</a> would be arriving later this month on March 20th, but last week the official Call of Duty X (formerly Twitter) account <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1896636715143704641">confirmed that it will instead be coming April 3rd</a>. That's when you'll be able to jump back into Verdansk, too.
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty is obviously following in Fortnite's footsteps here, given that Epic's more popular battle royale did the exact same thing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fortnite-og-is-here-bringing-back-planes-hamster-balls-tilted-towers-and-more-over-the-next-four-weeks">back in 2023</a> by bringing back a whole bunch of features from the earliest iteration of the game, including its original map. Fortnite found a lot of success with that move, something I'm sure Activision will hope repeats with the return of Verdansk to Warzone.

But it also leaves plenty of questions. For example, how long does it take to finish <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>? Well, it’s something of a trick question, as the story mode is more of a prologue or tutorial for the grind to come!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,196394,194842" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h234"><a id=""></a><strong>How long does it take to beat Monster Hunter Wilds?</strong></h2><p>If you’re the type to rush through a game’s story—and in the case of <em>Monster Hunter</em>, I don’t blame you one bit—then you can finish <em>Wilds </em>in approximately <strong>20 to 30 hours</strong>, give or take. That was easy, eh? The whole campaign is split into two parts, each taking 12 to 15 hours to tackle. But again, that’s just the story! It’s just the opening flourish of the game! There’s still a whole expansive world to explore, monsters to hunt, crafting and upgrades to explore, side quests and challenges to tackle, and of course, the ever-present grind the series is known for.</p><p>Then, of course, there are achievements to consider. If you wish to 100 percent the game and show off a shiny Platinum trophy, expect to spend between <strong>60 to 80 hours</strong> to tackle everything <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> offers.</p><h2 id="h235"><a id=""></a><strong>What about top-level ranking tiers?</strong></h2><p>Once you complete the main story path of the game, you’ll unlock access to High Rank monsters and zones. Here, you can craft some of the game’s most potent weapons and armor sets, allowing you to contend with the more formidable beasts in the desert.</p><p>That’s cool and all, but what about Master Rank? In <em>Monster Hunter World</em> and <em>Rise</em>, Master Rank offered additional challenges that made the game even more of a grind, more difficult to master, but offered players the opportunity to show off their hunting prowess. Currently, Master Rank isn’t available in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, but we won’t say ‘never.’ This top-tier rank didn’t release in the past two titles until post-launch expansions hit the scene. Therefore, we suspect <em>Wilds </em>will follow the same path!</p><hr><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is available now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.

<p>If you’re looking for your next fix of horror and hilarity, REPO might be what you need. The valuable-extraction title blends comedy and claustrophobic scares, and tackling it with more players is necessary if you want to sleep better.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lethal-company-coming-fortnite-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lethal Company</a> came along in late 2023 to stun the indie gaming community. It racked up a peak of nearly 250,000 players on Steam, and it still attracts thousands of players each month. Imitators have come and gone, trying to replicate its meteoric success, but REPO might be the one to crack the case.</p>



<p>It’s also an online <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-co-op-games-like-it-takes-two-split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-op game</a> where you need to “Locate valuable, fully physics-based objects and handle them with care,” according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241660/REPO/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, and if you have a lot of friends, you might be pleased at how many people can join up and play REPO at any one time.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-people-can-play-repo-in-online-co-op">How Many People Can Play REPO in Online Co-op?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>My face when the McDonald’s milkshake machine works. Credit to semiwork</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Up to 6 players can team up and play REPO together in a party.</strong></p>



<p>This gives REPO a slight edge over Lethal Company’s four-player squads. It also means even more chaos and calamity can ensue. </p>



<p>One of the biggest differences about REPO is keeping the cargo safe. Dropping the valuables or bringing any harm to them will decrease their value. This reduces your earnings, and disappoints your creator greatly.</p>



<p>Given that you need to use voice chat to communicate with your allies and negotiate obstacles, enemies, and other ungodly hazards, having more teammates could go either way for your survival chances!</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-repo-solo">Can You Play REPO Solo?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, you can play REPO solo, but if you’re not privy to the game’s contents, you’ll understand why that’s a bad idea.</strong></p>



<p>Teamwork is <em>key </em>in REPO. Again, the more players with you, the faster you’ll find loot, and the more decoys and human shields you have to take the brunt of enemy attacks—grim, but true. Solo survival in REPO is extremely difficult, and even the game’s official description suggests you should: “<strong>Use teamwork to make sure that the precious cargo will safely reach its destination</strong>.”</p>



<p>REPO may get tweaked to be more accommodating to solo players as time goes on. Conversely, REPO may get options to broaden the player pool for each lobby. We’ll update this guide if developer semiwork makes such changes.</p>



<hr>



<p>Indie horror games are a popular genre on Steam. REPO is a breakout hit already in 2025, so let us know if you get the chance to play it and what you think.</p>

<p>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is the first 3D entry in the series and is considered, still to this day, as one of the best entries in the series. As such, there's high demand for a modern remake of the game, but Nintendo seems more focused on working on new entries in the series rather than remaking older 3D games that would require way more work than the remasters released so far. Still, the remake released on Nintendo 3DS is a solid upgrade to the game, so it is definitely a game that's worth playing to experience a slightly modernized take on the classic N64 game.</p>

That’s part of the reason why every show from <em>The Sopranos </em>and <em>Lost </em>(in the PS2 era) to<em> M*A*S*H </em>(way back on the Atari 2600) have been turned into (mostly pretty lousy) video games. (Of course, it also helps that studios want to milk successful IPs for all they’re worth). <em>The Last of Us </em>is that rare example of a property that is finding great success in both forms: the original games are widely beloved and have millions of fans around the world, and the HBO series is only pulling even more people into the fold. Given the success of the video game adaptation of <em>The Last Of Us </em>(and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-trailer-dina-ellie-dance-1851768672&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-trailer-dina-ellie-dance-1851768672">the impending arrival of its second season</a></span>)<em>, </em>we decided to flip the script and take a deeper look at the TV shows we wish we could play as video games. </p></div><div><p>Over the last 14 years, whenever we hear that an AI chatbot influenced a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/30/tech/teen-suicide-character-ai-lawsuit/index.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/30/tech/teen-suicide-character-ai-lawsuit/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">child to commit suicide</a></span>, or a reality TV star becomes President of the United States, or a global pandemic breaks out, at some point many of us think, <em>“</em>Man, this feels like a <em>Black Mirror</em> episode.” The dystopian anthology series has complicated the human experience by placing people in deadly moral quandaries with a level of creativity that would be a thrill to explore further in a video game. There have been episodes in which people are dog-like robotic killers (“Metalhead”), a museum of unethical technological experiments like a brain implant allowing a doctor to feel his patient’s pain is explored (“Black Museum), and the British Prime Minister is blackmailed into having sex with a pig on national television (“The National Anthem”). They’ve also already ventured into the dark world of video games in an episode in which two friends fall in love in a <em>Mortal Kombat</em>-esque VR game (“Striking Vipers”) and one in which a guy tests an augmented reality game implanted in his head where he experiences his worst nightmares (“Playtest”).</p><p>This show would make an excellent video game in which a character is banished to a purgatorial void for some moral infraction, and they can only escape by going through a series of mirrors that are portals into wild scenarios that test their willingness to live. </p></div><div><p>Espionage has been the basis of some of the greatest video game franchises ever, like <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>, <em>Splinter Cell</em>, and <em>Watch Dogs</em>. The cutscene dialogue is usually rich with dramatic doublespeak and societal commentary that excites the inner conspiracy theorist in us. Few shows over the last 25 years have all that and the benefit of two dynamic leads, but <em>The Americans </em>does. The show is centered around two Russian spies posing as a suburban American family in the early 1980s, leaking intel back to their motherland. They and their network of spies have to intercept valuable assets in broad daylight through choreographed distractions, infiltrate a U.S. military project to steal defense communication codes, and bug the FBI office by placing a listening device in a mail robot. </p><p>Even when the series ended, there were  nuances of the show that fans wanted to delve back into, which a video game could help with. Since the show is more about stealth than murder (though there’s a fair amount of that too), it could be a great two-player game in which you and a partner extract intel to send back to Mother Russia, but it presents you both with different paths you must choose from that could ultimately lead you two to hate each other. The world will never get enough of spy games.</p></div><div><p>If guns, drugs, and the occasional wrestler-turned-gangster are what you are into, <em>Snowfall </em>is your show. The final piece of art the late John Singleton gave us is a gripping drama about a young man named Franklin Saint (Damson Idris) who starts selling drugs to get him and his mother out of the ‘hood. That is, until it turns into an empire and he becomes a power addict who destroys everything he loves. Watching Franklin devolve into a prisoner of his power by killing one of his best friends to prevent a gang war and then killing the father of the love of his life to prevent being arrested is truly heartbreaking. There’s also enough drive-by shootings, cocaine smuggling, and sex to make this a great <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>-style<em>&nbsp;</em>video game in which you can either play as Franklin or one of the numerous members of his empire to see where this gangster life will lead you.</p></div><div><p>The show that took <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sterling-k-brown-paradise-season-finale-hulu-season-2-1851767682&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sterling-k-brown-paradise-season-finale-hulu-season-2-1851767682">Sterling K. Brown’s badass levels</a></span> up to 100 has scenes  that I wanted to leap into my TV screen to participate in. Certain members of the U.S. government and private sector build a city inside of a Colorado mountain to escape an extinction-level event they knew was coming. The first season’s penultimate episode is already being hailed as the best TV episode of 2025 so far and contains a tense scene in which the President of the United States needs armed guards to make it out of the White House after he told America that the world is ending, and the government knew about it. In a video game, you could play as Secret Service agent Xavier Collins (Brown) and be tasked with getting the president through a mob of angry government officials without him being shot or assaulted.  Ratcheting up the stakes further, you also have to make sure you don’t lose the “nuclear football,” the briefcase device that allows the president to launch nuclear attacks. That’s just one of the exhilarating and video-game-ready scenarios from a show that has  survivors being killed by mercenaries, the sky itself getting hacked to flash messages, and some of the most emotional scriptwriting of any show this year.</p></div><div><p>Yes, we’re getting <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-gamescom-gameplay-showcase-survival-mmo-1851630351&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-gamescom-gameplay-showcase-survival-mmo-1851630351"><em>Dune: Awakening</em></a></span> game later this year, but that game won’t be focused on the strongest group of people in the <em>Dune </em>universe: The Bene Gesserit<em>. </em>The sensational HBO series <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dune-prophecy-finale-recap-desmond-hart-valya-harkonnen-1851727517&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dune-prophecy-finale-recap-desmond-hart-valya-harkonnen-1851727517"><em>Dune: Prophecy</em></a></span><em> </em>is mostly told from the perspective of this ancient sisterhood that acts as confidants and advisors to royal families while surreptitiously influencing powerful people in a way that keeps their secretive group close to power. We’ve seen them tap their fingers and peer into someone’s soul to see if they’re lying and use a powerful voice technique that can make almost anyone who hears it do what they say. The only person proven capable of withstanding the Voice is a man who was swallowed by a sandworm, operated on by thinking machines, and had devices implanted in his eyeballs that allow him to infect people with an airborne virus that burns them alive. </p><p>This would be the perfect basis for a game in which you choose your member of the Bene Gesserit, each with their unique skillset, and have to make nuanced interpersonal decisions with the intent of finding the messiah. Imagine using your voice to make the prince of the Atreides family marry the princess of the Harkonnen family simply because of their family names, and seeing it result in one of them killing the other because you didn’t spend enough time with them to know that their families have had a secret war going on for generations. This game would be like <em>The Sims </em>in space but with a lot more murder.</p></div><div><p>It’s a bit baffling that Amazon’s violent spin on superheroes isn’t on its third PlayStation game by now. <em>The Boys</em> is a fever dream of a series in which a ragtag anti-superhero militia known as the Boys works to stop the reign of the superhero consortium The Seven. The central appeal of the show is that, even while it’s focused on genetically modified super freaks who can do things no ordinary human being can do, it’s also grounded in human imperfections like jealousy, carnal temptations, and greed. It doesn’t let that humanity get in the way of over-the-top action, though. We’ve seen a protestor get his head lasered off, a man’s body ripped apart by a miniature person who crawled inside of him and then expanded, and a superhero orgy too graphic to even try to describe. With superhero video games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-netease-game-director-layoffs-season-2-1851765290&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-netease-game-director-layoffs-season-2-1851765290"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>popping up every two seconds and making a gazillion dollars, there’s no reason a similar type of game can’t be made within <em>The Boys</em> universe.</p></div><div><p>This should’ve happened a long time ago. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-penguin-the-batman-part-ii-questions-connections-1851693100&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-penguin-the-batman-part-ii-questions-connections-1851693100"><em>The Penguin</em></a></span> was one of the best TV shows of 2024 and a true testament to the wealth of possibilities contained within the <em>Batman</em> universe. Set after the events of Matt Reeves’ <em>The Batman</em> film, <em>The Penguin</em> focuses on how people like “Oz” Cobb (Colin Farrell) and Sofia Falcone (Cristin Milioti) try to fill the power gap in Gotham’s underworld left by the death of Carmine Falcone. The show’s titular character is the main star of the action, and we get to see how he’s as strategic as he is ruthless, willing to kill his closest partner so his enemies can’t exploit his love as a weakness. Thus far, whenever video games have let us travel through the seedy underbelly of Gotham it’s been as the Caped Crusader dishing out bone-breaking justice, but it would be just as fun to do so as the nefarious Penguin, trying to take out the crime families standing in his way as he’s determined to be somebody in this world. </p></div><div><p>When I realized the first season of <em>Creature Commandos </em>was done after only seven episodes that were under 30 minutes each, I was legitimately upset. You don’t want to leave a world in which a black ops team composed of non-human inmates from Belle Reve Penitentiary is assembled in an attempt to protect Princess Ilana Rostovic (Maria Bakalova), the rightful heir to the throne of Pokolistan. This ragtag team of misfits includes a radioactive walking skeleton, an undead Bride of Frankenstein, and a Nazi-hating killer robot, and that’s just the start. They’ve torn someone’s head off by punching through their headrest, had their limbs magically turned into balloon animals mid-fight, and had a rabid weasel tear through someone’s flesh. How could we not have fun running through the world with these agents of mayhem in a video game, violently ending more lives than we save?</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We never thought it would return. But get ready, because Verdansk is coming to Warzone 2. Long-time fans are worried it won’t feature Superstore or other famous POIs, so we’re here today to answer any questions regarding its hotspots.</p>



<p>Call of Duty Warzone 2 is the successor to Warzone Caldera. It’s kept the CoD battle royale boat afloat for a couple of years now, but it’s taken some damage in recent times. Some have even labeled it as a sinking ship. Warzone’s lessening impact is getting so concerning that a potential <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-warzone-3-if-verdansk-does-not-retain-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone 3 is in danger</a>, as is the potential future of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-warzone-being-shut-down-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone shutting down</a> altogether.</p>



<p>Warzone was once arguably the battle royale powerhouse of the world. It needs a serious injection of players to kickstart the excitement again, and a fully-loaded Verdansk armed with classic POIs could be what it needs.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-confirmed-verdansk-poi-in-warzone-2">Every Confirmed Verdansk POI in Warzone 2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It stores goods and campers. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Warzone 2’s Verdansk map will feature most POIs from the original including Atlas Superstore, Storage Town, Prison, and many more.</strong></p>



<p>We learned a little while back we’re getting “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-return-to-warzone-og-march-2020-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pretty Much the OG March 2020 Version</a>” of Verdansk. I couldn’t imagine Activision dropping a version of Verdansk no one wants, or even Verdansk ’84. So, get ready for what appears to be the complete, classic Verdansk experience.</p>



<p>Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/WZStatsGG/status/1895902878293692854" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Warzone Meta</a>, here’s every POI leaked so far, with more presumably to come:</p>



<ul>
<li>Atlas Superstore</li>



<li>Block 17</li>



<li>Block 23</li>



<li>Boneyard</li>



<li>Coast</li>



<li>Gora Bridge</li>



<li>Gora Tunnel</li>



<li>Gora Village</li>



<li>Grazna Bridge</li>



<li>Great Bridge</li>



<li>Jarvdinsk Spomenik</li>



<li>Karst Bridge</li>



<li>Krovnik Farmland</li>



<li>Lozoff Pass</li>



<li>Novi Grazna Hills</li>



<li>Prison</li>



<li>Storage Town</li>



<li>Styor Memorial</li>



<li>Zhokov Boneyard</li>
</ul>



<p>Some notable favorites are missing for the time being. Dam is absent, as is Airport and many others, but Verdansk is gigantic, so this is likely an incomplete inventory. We expect more details to leak ahead of its much-hyped return to Call of Duty and Warzone.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-verdansk-returning-to-warzone">When is Verdansk Returning to Warzone?</h2>



<p><strong>Verdansk returns to Call of Duty courtesy of Warzone 2 Season 3 on April 3.</strong></p>



<p>Yes, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-officially-returning-to-call-of-duty-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk is returning to Call of Duty Warzone next month</a>. The official Call of Duty X account had a message for everyone on March 10: “As we celebrate Call of Duty: Warzone’s 5 Year Anniversary, it’s time to revisit a place of unforgettable memories. Verdansk returns to Call of Duty: Warzone on April 3.”</p>



<div><article><p><span>As we celebrate Call of Duty: Warzone’s 5 Year Anniversary, it’s time to revisit a place of unforgettable memories 🪂

Verdansk returns to Call of Duty: Warzone on April 3 💥 </span></p></article></div>



<p>Whatever your thoughts on Verdansk or how it will be received, this is no doubt a special time for CoD Warzone users. Expect a huge influx of players looking to lap up the initial nostalgia.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen if the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-many-people-are-playing-warzone-right-now-player-count-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty Warzone player count</a> drops off as the days and weeks pass.</p>

<p>Rainbow Six Siege X’s changes to UI, map reworks, and new skins have appeared online due to a new leak.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-leak-first-look-seasons-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, new details about Rainbow Six Seige X have leaked ahead of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-rainbow-six-siege-x-showcase-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showcase planned for March 13</a>. The leaks arrived from the Rainbow Six Leaks Discord server, giving players an idea of how the upcoming game could look. Moreover, these leaked images appear to be from an early game build.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding UI, Siege X has added a new label for ‘Operation Prep Phase’ at the right-hand corner of the screen. Players will also find additions of a ‘battle pass progression tracker’ and a ‘challenge system’. Players should know that all these elements are subject to change with the game’s final build.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The following leaked image for Siege X provides players with a look at the type of skins we might see. The skin showcased is Valkyrie’s Paragon Elite skin, which also has a matching Black Eye camera skin.

Playdead, the developer behind indie darlings <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/limbo">Limbo</a> and Inside, has responded amidst an increasingly ugly spat between the company's co-founders.
</p>
<p>
Reports of a rift between Playdead's Dino Patti and Arnt Jensen are nothing new, and first circulated around the time Patti left Playdead following the launch of Inside in 2016. 
</p>
<p>
This month, however, the friction between the two men has become public - following a claim by Patti that he was the subject of "bullying", and that Jensen had "repeatedly" sent legal threats to him since his departure from the company. 
</p>
<p>
The latest of these legal claims, Patti says, involves a now-deleted LinkedIn post in which he discussed Limbo's development and shared a photo of an "unauthorised" photo taken by Jensen. Patti says he has now been asked to cough up the equivalent of £56k in compensation.
</p>
<p>
In response to Patti's claim being made public, Playdead has issued a statement confirming it has "submitted demands" based on a claim of "infringement and unauthorised use of Playdead's trademarks and copyrighted works in a commercial and marketing context" (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/playdead-co-founder-dino-patti-claims-fellow-co-founder-keeps-legally-threatening-him">Game Developer</a>).
</p>
<p>
"We have found it necessary to take this action to protect our trademarks and copyrights," the company said, "which are essential to Playdead's business and reputation".
</p>
<p>
In a legal document shared by Patti, Playdead wrote that "by providing recipients with core insights to the process of developing Limbo, you are falsely giving the impression that you played a significant role, including a creative role, in the development of the game".
</p>
<p>
Sharing the document online, Patti said he was a "significant part of building Playdead from the ground up" and that without him, "Playdead wouldn't have existed". 
</p>
<p>
"Arnt, please stop the bullying," Patti concluded. "I will not stop being who I am. I will never erase my own history. You can't rewrite the past just because of a bad breakup." 
</p>
<p>
Playdead is currently working on its third game, which it began teasing in 2017. In 2020, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-announces-publishing-deal-with-control-inside-and-the-last-guardian-devs">Epic Games confirmed it would handle publishing duties on the game</a>.
</p>
<p>
Patti launched Somerville, his first game at new studio Jumpship, in 2022. An adventure platform game with physics-based puzzles, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/somerville-review-a-tasteful-apocalypse-with-a-little-light-puzzling">received decent reviews, amidst comparisons to Playdead's work</a>.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-ai-characters/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-is-working-on-ai-powered-versions-of-their-characters-parts-of-the-technology-can-run-on-playstation-5-with-little-overhead.1130862/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-ai-characters/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony is working on AI-powered versions of PlayStation characters that can respond to voice input from the player during gameplay, a new leaked video revealed.</p>
<p>The video, which was shared with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/626695/sony-playstation-ai-characters-aloy-horizon-forbidden-west-prototype" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Verge</a> by an anonymous tipster before it got taken down on YouTube, shows an AI-powered version of the Horizon series protagonist Aloy that can respond to queries using synthesized voice and facial movements both in a demo setting and during Horizon Forbidden West gameplay, as highlighted by SIE director of software engineering Sharwin Raghoebardajal who demonstrated the technology in the removed video. The technology, powered by OpenAI’s whisper for speech-to-text and both GPT-4 and Llama 3 for conversations, is augmented by Sony's internal Emotional Voice Synthesis system and by Mockingbird technology that handles audio-to-face animation.</p>
<p>While this AI-powered version of Aloy was developed to show the technology internally, there's a very good chance that we will eventually see it implemented even on consoles, as parts of the technology can run directly on PlayStation 5 with little overhead. This glimpse of what the technology is capable of achieving doesn't exactly provide hints at how it could be implemented to enhance gaming experiences, but there's little doubt that it will impact future games considerably, considering the direction the industry is taking and how the PlayStation 6, in particular, is said will go <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-most-powerful-generation-amd/">all-out on AI.</a></p>
<p>Sony isn't the only major console manufacturer investing heavily in AI. Last week, Microsoft unveiled its&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/xboxs-muse-ai-model-is-a-one-of-a-kind-model-that-can-generate-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Muse AI model</a> capable of generating gameplay. This&nbsp;should help developers, especially in the early stages of development, although the contrary is more likely, given the current state of the industry.</p>

It’s positively massive, and you cannot man the entire vessel solo: even as the coolest yakuza in Hawaii you require a crew. In <em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>, your ship crew is split into two groups: Cannon Squad and Boarding Squad.</p><p>Your Cannon Squad is relatively self-explanatory. It’s the crew working the various cannons and weapons on your ship. However, the Boarding Squad is where running a pirate crew becomes slightly more complex. You see, it’s not a single squad: you have four. Each Boarding Squad consists of four members and a Squad Leader. As a Squad Leader, the assigned crew member has access to a unique ability that enhances their skills and, occasionally, yours.</p><h2 id="h1885"><a id=""></a><strong>The best Boarding Squad Leader Traits in Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="0882672d979183fa4f45d565200414e9" data-recommend-id="image://0882672d979183fa4f45d565200414e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The mini-boss fight against Jason Rich in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The mini-boss fight against Jason Rich in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0882672d979183fa4f45d565200414e9" data-recommend-id="image://0882672d979183fa4f45d565200414e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The mini-boss fight against Jason Rich in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s a touch of strategy to the over-the-top beat ‘em up <em>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>, especially regarding your pirate crew. When assigning Squad Leaders to your Boarding Squad, picking wisely from the roster means the difference between overtaking the competition and succumbing to Davy Jones’ Locker.</p><h3 id="h1886"><a id=""></a><strong>Nishida: Indomitable Will Bonded</strong></h3><p>You’ll meet Nishida on Nele Island relatively early in the campaign, where he’s actively searching for Majima. Well, he finds the man. As it turns out, Nishida is one of the best healers in the game, thanks to his ability, Indomitable Will. It’s a Squad Leader trait that boosts healing, plus includes Shock Resistance. You’ll deal with Shock frequently during combat, making Nishida a staple for any pirate crew!</p><h3 id="h1887"><a id=""></a><strong>Misaki: Succession of Will Bonded</strong></h3><p>Misaki, the daughter of Namioka, will join your pirate crew deeper into the game and, as expected, provides a nice buff to your Boarding Squad when assigned as a Squad Leader. Her ability, Succession of Will, boosts Attack Damage and increases the charge rate of the Voltage Gauge, which allows your support units to utilize powerful abilities mid-combat.</p><h3 id="h1888"><a id=""></a><strong>Masaru Fujita: Marine Cuisine Bonded</strong></h3><p>The first crewmember you’ll recruit in <em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>, Masaru Fujita, is another of the most powerful to assign to your Boarding Squad. His ability, Marine Cuisine, boosts attack power for everyone in his squad and increases Poison Resistance. Now, you won’t deal with Poison frequently, but when you do, it’s a painful, annoying experience that will make you beg for higher resistance!</p><h3 id="h1889"><a id=""></a><strong>Jason Rich: Hunter’s Knowledge Bonded</strong></h3><p>As one of the first crewmates you’ll unlock, alongside Masaru Fujita, Jason Rich also offers one of the strongest Squad Leader Traits in the game. As you level Jason and his abilities become more powerful, you’ll note that his Squad Leader Trait, Hunter’s Knowledge, is genuinely one of the best in the game. It provides a significant buff to attack and defense, while also boosting firearms resistance to the entire squad.</p><hr><p><em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em> is easily one of the wildest experiences on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2025 so far, so long as you don’t mind the lengthy story and side content!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/chrono-trigger-30th-anniversary-celebrations-will-include-%E2%80%9Cvarious-projects%E2%80%9D.1130844/</guid>

			<p>Square Enix is planning to celebrate Chrono Trigger's 30th anniversary with various projects, according to a new post shared on social media today.</p>
<p>On the publisher's official Japanese <a href="https://x.com/squareenix_jp/status/1899298993613791338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1899298993613791338%7Ctwgr%5E28ba345c8804a38a6acfe4646e646ed32e8e603c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Fsquare-enix-celebrating-chrono-trigger-anniversary-with-new-projects-sparking-re-release-hopes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a> profile, Square Enix highlighted how today, March 11th, marks the 30th anniversary of the release of Chrono Trigger, a dream project that brought together the creator of the Final Fantasy series Hironobu Sakaguchi, the creator of the Dragon Quest series Yuji Horii and the creator of Dragon Ball Akira Toriyama. To celebrate the game's 30th anniversary, the Japanese publisher is planning to launch various projects this year that will go beyond the world of the game to thank all those who have played the game.</p>
<p>Chrono Trigger is among the few 16-bit-era JRPGs released by Square Enix that have yet to be properly remade. While the game was released with additional content on the Nintendo DS, which is also available in the Steam release, it was never effectively remade. Hopefully, in light of the success of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-has-already-sold-2-million-copies/">Dragon Quest III HD-2D remake</a> released last year, the Japanese publisher will consider at least an HD-2D remake of Chrono Trigger to introduce what is, in my opinion, one of the best JRPGs ever released, if not the very best, to a wider audience.</p>
<p>As of now, the only way to play Chrono Trigger on modern gaming hardware is on PC with the aforementioned Steam release. The game launched in a rather poor state back in 2018 but has since been improved with <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-trigger-update-3/">new features and enhancements</a>, making this version one of the best ways to enjoy the classic game.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-officially-extraction-shooter-evolving/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gray-zone-warfare-is-officially-an-extraction-shooter-and-it%E2%80%99s-evolving-in-2025.1130835/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-officially-extraction-shooter-evolving/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>When Gray Zone Warfare was released in April 2024, it was penned as being ‘an intense tactical FPS’ with some extraction elements mixed in. In the months that followed, changes were deployed, and updates were rolled out, evolving the game immeasurably in its first year on the market.</p>



<p>I’ve caught up with the developers at MADFINGER Games on multiple occasions, and during my most recent chat with the team, I learned that they’re now perfectly happy to call Gray Zone Warfare an extraction shooter.</p>



<p>But it’s more than that – it’s the <strong>world’s first open-world extraction shooter</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-an-evolutionary-year">An Evolutionary Year</h2>



<p>Gray Zone Warfare has <strong>stacks </strong>planned for the year ahead. The developers have worked tirelessly with the community to introduce a long line of changes and upgrades to improve the senses of immersion, challenge, and engagement in the fictional world of Lamang.</p>



<p>It might have blown by the average fan, but Gray Zone Warfare’s core description on Steam was updated <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-whats-next/">at the end of 2024</a> to reflect the new attitude towards the game. It went from being described as an intense tactical FPS to being dubbed an open-world extraction shooter emphasising realism.</p>



<p>That was the first indication of MADFINGER’s pivot, but my recent chat with Rick Lagnese, the PR and Communications Director at the firm, set the story straight. The developer is now on board with being branded an extraction shooter, and it’s now striving to redefine what that tag means.</p>



<p>That’s something that I learned first-hand <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madfinger-ceo-interview-tarkov-extraction-shooter-gray-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when I spoke to Marek Rabas</a>, MADFINGER’s CEO, at Gamescom 2024. </p>



<p>In recent years, we’ve seen plenty of extraction shooters emerge and then fall flat. Some have been extinguished after mere weeks on the market, but Gray Zone Warfare has continued to innovate and exceed expectations after almost a year. There’s a dedicated community supporting the ongoing evolution of the game, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-roadmap-revealed/">the roadmap</a> is looking <strong>tasty</strong>.</p>



<p>If you’ve not played Gray Zone Warfare and you’re a fan of extraction shooters, now is the time to get on board. There are major changes lined up that are set to challenge the existing paradigm and alter the gameplay loop.</p>



<p>I’ll have all the latest for you in the coming days.</p>

We all know what's coming up in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">The Last of Us</a> season 2, right? I mean, everyone knows what happens quite early on in the game, because it was a pretty controversial narrative choice so everyone and their mum has spoiled it. I haven't played it myself and I know what happens, but it seems like streaming service Max is happy to pretend that everything is peaches and cream (more or less) in their adaptation.
</p>
<p>
A new trailer for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us">The Last of Us</a> season 2 dropped over the weekend that is full of drama and light on spoilers, which is why I'm staying quiet too, but it has been funny watching all of these trailers knowing that they're lying just a little bit.

<p>
For the most part, season 2 look like more of the same; it's dark, it's depressing, everyone's angry all the time, and, yes, there are still not-quite-zombies to be worried about. It's not too long until you can watch the show, as it's set to premiere on Max this coming April 13th, with a weekly release every Sunday for a total of seven episodes. UK viewers will be able to check out the first episode the day after, April 14th, where it'll be shown on Sky and its streaming service NOW.
</p>
<p>
April will be a big month for The Last of Us: Part Two in general, as the remastered version of the sequel is also set to arrive on PC April 3rd. Originally the PC release <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-will-require-a-psn-account-to-play-on-pc-making-it-unplayable-in-over-100-countries">would have required you to sign in with a PSN account</a>, despite that causing so many issues with previous PlayStation releases on PC. PlayStation has since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-finally-drop-the-psn-account-requirement-that-annoyed-every-pc-player">dropped that requirement</a> for The Last of Us: Part Two, alongside a few other games, so that at least knocks off one reason for the review bombs. Here's hoping it also avoids <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-last-of-us-part-1s-pc-port-is-being-ripped-apart-by-steam-reviewers">the bugs and performances issues that plagued the PC release of Part One</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-finals-current-player-count%E2%80%94how-many-people-are-playing-the-finals-in-2025.1130817/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-finals-current-player-count/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Finals burst onto the scene with its unique blend of map destruction, arcade-like gameplay, and blaring sounds and visuals, but let’s look at The Finals’ player count in 2025.</p>



<p>It’s so hard for new shooters in the live-service online multiplayer sphere to stand out. Call of Duty rules the roost, and the likes of Marvel Rivals, Fortnite, and Overwatch own large market share segments. So it was quite the feat for The Finals when it arrived in 2023 to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-finals-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">huge acclaim and hefty player numbers</a>. This was despite reservations and emerging details of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-finals-use-of-ai-isnt-going-away-anytime-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI use in The Finals</a>.</p>



<p>The first few weeks of a hyped multiplayer title are usually the best. Everyone checks in to see what it’s about, how it plays, and numbers eventually dwindle. So we’re here to analyze The Finals’ player count numbers to see how it’s faring.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-finals-player-count-in-2025">The Finals Player Count in 2025</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What a scene. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Using Steam Charts, we can see February 2025 had an average of 11,760 players in The Finals—reaching a peak of 19,499 users.</strong></p>



<p>The first thing to note about The Finals player count numbers is <strong>this doesn’t factor in PlayStation or Xbox users</strong>. There’s no reliable piece of software capable of telling us this data, and it’s been this way for years. It’s baffling—given this age of technology—but this is the reality.</p>



<p>Any official figures come from <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/2073850" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Finals’ Steam Charts page</a>, and this has the game’s monthly figures going back to its December 2023 launch. The Finals achieved its <strong>all-time peak of 242,399 players</strong> during its debut month. Compared to its most recent month (as of writing), its <strong>recent monthly peaks are nearly 90% down since launch</strong>.</p>



<p>It took just two months for The Finals player count numbers to see a huge drop-off. From December 2023 to February 2024, the shooter went from <strong>120,211 players on averag</strong>e to <strong>24,848</strong>. </p>



<p>March 2024 saw an average of <strong>21,712</strong> in-game users, and the monthly average has <strong>never gotten back over 20K</strong>.</p>



<p>This makes it all sound negative, but for a relatively new shooter in a feisty market, it’s doing well. The last few months have seen a <strong>peak</strong> of nearly 20,00 players or more, and it continues to tick along. Remember, this doesn’t include PlayStation or Xbox figures, meaning there’s still a fair few thousands logging in each month.</p>



<p>The start of 2025 has been slightly worrying though. <strong>The Finals has dipped below 12K</strong>, and continues to dwindle month by month. With more seasons and content on the way, these figures should receive a new boost every so often.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-finals-worth-playing-in-2025">Is The Finals Worth Playing in 2025?</h2>



<p><strong>The Finals’ gameplay and nuances make it worth playing in 2025, but it could depend on Battlefield 6’s success.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant</a> showed no matter how tight your game is, if there’s not enough content, players don’t like it, or other games are doing it better, people won’t play. I think The Finals has a terrific niche in its <strong>level destructibility</strong>—a unique selling point mastered only by the Battlefield series.</p>



<p>EA’s Battlefield has been absent and fairly anonymous for several years, due to the failings of Battlefield 2042. But Battlefield 6 AKA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 2025</a> is currently testing the waters with its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-labs-first-playtest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs</a> program. Pre-release footage has already shown destruction is the name of the game, and EA and DICE want their crown back.</p>



<p>The Finals is free-to-play, which always makes it a great bargain. However, with more games coming out, and Battlefield on the way, Embark might have to do something special if The Finals’ player count monthly numbers continue to diminish, and Battlefield 6 makes a huge splash. </p>



<p><strong>I recommend playing The Finals while you can, because it might not be around forever given today’s toxic and volatile climate.</strong></p>



<hr>



<p>We have the 2025 player count figures for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-many-people-are-playing-warzone-right-now-player-count-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty Warzone</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-player-count-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite’s numbers</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-player-count-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> players this year too.</p>



<p>I’ve been quite surprised by The Finals’ success and longevity so far. Do you think it has the potential to reach the next level? Or is it solid enough to maintain The Finals player count enough to help it stay in a crowded online scene? Drop a comment and share your thoughts.</p>

            <p>Videos showing off New Vegas sets created for the second season of Fallout have started making the rounds online.</p>

<p>At the end of the first season, we all saw disgraced (at least, in the eyes of many) Vault-Tec executive Hank MacLean in his pinched Brotherhood of Steel Power Armour, fleeing towards the post-apocalyptic locale.</p>
<p>Soon after this episode aired, showrunners Graham Wagner and Geneva Robertson-Dworet <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-tv-showrunners-discuss-season-two-location-and-why-the-series-doesnt-need-to-follow-a-canon-ending">confirmed the next season will head to New Vegas</a>, and said its now-ruined state was designed to show the audience that "things have happened" to the location since the events of New Vegas the game. The duo then added <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-showrunners-confirm-new-vegas-character-involved-with-season-two">New Vegas' enigmatic leader Mr House will be "involved in season two"</a>, although they held back from telling us any more. Oh, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-fallout-set-photo-teases-a-familiar-new-vegas-face-of-jurassic-proportions">Dinky will be around for season two, as well</a>.</p>
<p>Now, we have a pretty decent look at the Fallout show's take on New Vegas, thanks to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@onzo1313/video/7479259030754495787">TikTok user Onzo1313</a>. Onzo1313 has shared several videos showing off the set, including the iconic strip along with - of course - a Lucky 38 casino sign. Lucky 38 is Mr House's citadel from which he reigns over the New Vegas Strip and its various casinos.</p>
<p>One particular video showing off the strip is shaky, but the location itself seems to be in relatively good condition, leading to some speculation this area will feature as part of a flashback sequence.</p>

</span></p><p>Another video, meanwhile, offers a look at New Vegas boards that are showing signs of age and rust, clearly from the 'present'.</p>
<p>There is also a sign for Micheal Angelo's shown off in this video. Michael Angelo's workshop is a location in New Vegas, which is found on the strip.</p>

</span></p><p>Earlier this year, Fallout's Ghoul Walton Goggins provided us all with a little update on the upcoming season, promising that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-will-blow-the-first-out-of-the-water-star-walton-goggins-says">while season one was certainly good, the next one is going to be even better</a>.</p>
<p>"This blows it out of the water, what these writers have done and the artisans that have come together to tell this story," the actor said in February. "It's really gonna be something. I can't wait for people to see it."</p>
<p>New cast members reported to be joining Goggins for Fallout season two include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-reportedly-adds-marvel-actor-kumail-nanjiani-to-its-cast">Kumail Nanjiani as "a high-ranking official within the Brotherhood of Steel"</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-tv-series-second-season-lands-home-alone-star">Macaulay Culkin as "a crazy genius-type character"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Everyone likes to be winner. It’s one of humanity’s best, and possibly worst, traits, but when it comes to giveaways, winning is better than losing. One lucky reader will have the chance to be that winner, taking home a brand new Turtle Beach Stealth 500 Gaming Headset for PS5, PS4, PC and mobile platforms via Bluetooth.</p>

<p>The Turtle Beach Stealth 500 is one of our favourite sub-£100 headsets, earning <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/19/turtle-beach-stealth-500-gaming-headset-review/">8/10 in our review</a> last year. Praising its looks and comfort, we said, ” The first thing you’ll notice about the new Stealth 500 is how sleek and modern it looks, fashioned wholly out of black materials, it is almost as stealthy as its name implies. The build is mostly plastic, with a rigid plastic headband, but it has the added benefit of making this one very light headset. I’ve worn this thing for whole days and never had a moment of weariness, and that’s a huge boon if you live with your headset on.”</p>
<p>It sounds great, feels great, and will be a fantastic addition to any gaming setup where you’re looking to up your audio game. In order to be in with a chance to win, enter via the form below!</p>
