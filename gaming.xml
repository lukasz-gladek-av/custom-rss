            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24158120/los-angeles-chargers-the-sims-schedule-release-meme<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="YfNtNM">The Los Angeles Chargers have chosen to begin their announcement of the NFL schedule in the most incredible way: Putting a bunch of other teams’ fans in a swimming pool and removing the ladder — in <em>The Sims 2</em>, of course. </p>
<p id="ZwQw1V">You may remember the Chargers’ schedule release video from last year, when the social media team <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23071055/chargers-anime-nfl-schedule-release-video-attack-on-titan-one-piece">made the schedule into an anime</a>, complete with references to <em>One Piece</em>, <em>Naruto</em>, and <em>Attack on Titan</em>. Largely, schedule release videos have been extremely boring — it’s literally just the 17-game schedule for the upcoming season, put into video format. NFL teams <em>are</em> trying to inject pop culture into the mix, like when the Detroit Lions put their <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/5/8/21252109/detroit-lions-2020-nfl-schedule-announcement-animal-crossing-new-horizons">schedule in <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a>, and schedule release season is turning into a meme war. The Chargers are one team that routinely excels, and the <em>Sims 2</em> video makes this year no different.</p>
<div id="1ZPyod">
<blockquote>
<div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>should we REALLY make our schedule release video in the sims?</p><p>yes          yes          yesyes<br>yesyes    yes      yes         yes<br>yes  yes  yes     yes           yes<br>yes    yesyes     yes           yes<br>yes      yesye      yes        yes<br>yes          yes           yesyes <a href="https://t.co/MXzfAPyhe8">pic.twitter.com/MXzfAPyhe8</a></p></div>— Los Angeles Chargers (@chargers) <a href="https://twitter.com/chargers/status/1790895458581467314?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2024</a>
</blockquote>


</div>
<p id="1uAObl">There are so many incredible Easter eggs throughout the whole video. It’s got Taylor Swift and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce; New York Jets quarterback and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/19/nyregion/aaron-rodgers-jets-podcasts.html">famed conspiracy theorist</a> Aaron Rodgers recoiling from a cellphone tower; Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker in the kitchen <a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/chiefs-player-harrison-butker-wants-women-to-stay-in-the-kitchen">following a misogynistic, homophobic commencement speech</a>; and Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nflonfox/video/7225036534603517230?">George Pickens watching himself getting drafted</a> (also featuring the box of stolen <a href="https://www.fox10phoenix.com/sports/shipment-jaromir-jagr-bobbleheads-stolen-postponing">Pittsburgh Penguins Jaromir Jágr bobbleheads</a>). That’s literally not even the half of it, so you’re going to <a href="https://twitter.com/ChargersMuse/status/1790914073196155163">want to watch and analyze for yourself</a>.</p>
<p id="fhMLXm">It’s the clear frontrunner for release videos this year, but several other NFL teams had fun referencing pop culture. The Atlanta Falcons turned their schedule release video into <a href="https://twitter.com/AtlantaFalcons/status/1790895094356177373"><em>ATL Streets Vol. ’24</em></a>, a play on <em>NFL Street</em> from 2004. The <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaguars/status/1790896080793616492">Jacksonville Jaguars</a> went with a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24157229/x-men-97-spider-man-animated-series-finale">reference to <em>X-Men ’97</em></a>, while the Seattle Seahawks <a href="https://twitter.com/Seahawks/status/1790912454031233535">did a fun comic book style announcement</a>.</p>
<p id="R26VEg">But has anyone lived up to the Chargers social media team’s schedule release legacy? My guess is no.</p>

<p>Following a rather rough year from Xbox, many of us eagerly await their redemption arc. Will Xbox turn things around and pump out exceptional games on its consoles and PC? Only time will tell, but the first glimpse of that happening is at the Xbox Showcase date coming soon!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-xbox-showcase-take-place">When Does the Xbox Showcase Take Place?</h2>



<p>The official Xbox Games Showcase begins on June 9, during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-summer-game-fest-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer Game Fest</a>, and will kick off at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET / 6 PM BST. Like last year’s showcase, Xbox intends to show off additional upcoming titles, like with the Starfield Direct, in a follow-up showcase. They’re not telling anyone what title we’ll see, but they did state it was “the next installment of a beloved franchise.”</p>



<p>Personally, I hope they’re alluding to State of Decay 3. Three years ago, we saw the first teaser trailer, with the woman hunting a zombified deer in the snowy woods. More than likely, however, they’re talking about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-the-new-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty Black Ops 6</a>, which, as rumor has it, we’ll see more of at this summer’s showcase.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-games-will-we-see-at-the-xbox-showcase">What Games Will We See at the Xbox Showcase?</h2>



<p>Last year, during the Xbox Games Showcase, we saw titles such as Avowed, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hi-fi-rush-available-ps5-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II, and Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty. But this year, we’ll likely see:</p>



<ul>
<li>Starfield: Shattered Space</li>



<li>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</li>



<li>Avowed</li>
</ul>



<p>We’d love to see more on the upcoming Fable and State of Decay 3. Word on the gaming streets is that Microsoft intends to reveal the next Gears of War during the event.</p>

<p>While we all eagerly await the Xbox Games Showcase, check out what Insider Gaming is up to lately:</p>

Mev, the high priestess of Teer Fradee, sends you on a mission to perform an initiation ritual to become a Doneigad, a sage entrusted with protecting your people and its lands. This is a crucial task, since for several years your island has suffered increasing colonization by foreign powers indifferent to their devastating impact on the natural environment.</p><p><strong>Violence Should Always Be the Last Resort</strong></p><p>To protect your people and succeed in your mission, you have a range of choices according to the situations you encounter, since your decisions will affect how your <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,469 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> unfolds.

        <p>However you will sometimes need to use force, and confrontations are an integral part of your adventure.

            <p>We have details of the first speakers and contributors to next month's GI Sprint.</p>
<p>GI Sprint is a series of videos, podcasts and articles all about ways we can make video games cheaper, faster and better. It will run from June 17th – July 5th,</p>
<p>The series will cover topics such as AI, cloud, team synergy, hybrid and remote working, distributed development, failing fast and much more.</p>
<p>The event will begin with a video podcast and interview with <strong>Shawn Layden, current strategic advisor to Tencent</strong> and former Chairman of PlayStation's studio business, and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment's US arm. Layden has been talking about the growing unsustainability of game development for over half a decade, and will share his views on the situation and identify areas where games studios can make time savings.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <strong>TeamSync's Graham McAllister</strong> will share early insight from his research into team synergy, including the importance of getting things right at the concept stage, in order to deliver games faster.</p>
<p><strong>Ant Workshop's Tony Gowland, Free Lives' Dominique Gawlowski,  Play 3arabi's Samer Abbas </strong>and indie development <strong>legend Rami Ismail </strong>will form part of a panel discussing the art of 'failing fast'.</p>
<p>In terms of AI, <strong>Sahar Asdai, Director of AI Labs at King</strong>, will share the impact AI testing has had on the Candy Crush series. Meanwhile, a wider AI panel featuring <strong>Didimo's Sean Cooper</strong>, <strong>AI and Games' Tommy Thompson</strong> and more to be announced, will also take place.</p>
<p>All sessions will also be released as GamesIndustry.biz articles, and collected together in a special GI Sprint white paper, which will be released in July (and free to download for all).</p>
<p>More speakers and contributors will be announced in the coming weeks including a series of sponsored sessions.

            <p>More than 190 million people in the US played video games for at least one hour a week in 2023, according to new data from the Entertainment Software Association.</p>
<p>The ESA's 2024 Essential Facts About the Video Game Industry report was conducted in October 2023 by YouGov, including data from 5,000 respondents. .</p>
<p>It found that the average American player is 36 years old, and the average adult player has been playing games for almost two decades.</p>
<p>The ESA found that 53% of respondents identified as male and 46% identified as female. By comparison, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/esa-48-percent-of-video-game-players-are-female-and-29-percent-identify-as-people-of-color">2022's gender breakdown</a> saw 52% of those surveyed identify as male and 48% of players identify as female.</p>
<p>38% of game players were people of colour, which has increased by about a third from data collected in 2022.</p>
<p>More than half of adults 18 and older (56%) said they played games regularly, but it was the generation aged between five and ten that had the highest percentage of gamers at 79%.</p>
<p>The report also included retrospective facts to mark the ESA's 30th anniversary, including the growth of industry sales in the past 25 years.  In 2002, the industry reported $11.7 billion in consumer spending, while in 2023 this totaled $57.2 billion.</p>
<p>"Video games have been a fixture in American life and culture for generations," said Stanley Pierre-Louis, president and CEO of the ESA. "Players of all ages, backgrounds and abilities are embracing the positivity that video games bring to their lives."</p>
<p>"While the games we play – and how we play them – evolves over time, what remains consistent is how video games enhance our lives in ways that inspire us and bring us closer together."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/16/you-can-play-all-of-assassins-creed-shadows-offline-but-you-need-a-connection-to<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>You will need an internet connection to install <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, but after that, the entire experience can be played offline, Ubisoft has announced. The company did so after word online spread that Shadows requires a mandatory online connection to play the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the reveal of Shadows yesterday, which showcased the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/15/assassins-creed-shadows-reveal-trailer-confirms-dual-samurai-and-shinobi">dual samurai and shinobi protagonists</a> we'll be controlling in 16th-century feudal Japan, people noticed wording in preorder listings and elsewhere that seemingly pointed to the game requiring an always-online connection. This frustrated fans of the series, especially given Shadows, like its recent predecessors, is a single-player game. However, that's not the case and Ubisoft released a statement today to clear the air.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nszrx939ZVA" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>"Hey everyone, we wanted to share some of the early information on the upcoming launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows, following some questions we've noticed in the community," the <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1791095143799414951">statement</a> reads. "<strong>Assassin's Creed Shadows will not require a mandatory connection at all times</strong>.<strong> An online connection will be needed to install the game, but you will be able to play the entire journey offline, and explore Japan without any online connection.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are super excited to bring Assassin's Creed to Feudal Japan on November 15 when the game releases, and we cannot wait to show you more along the way."&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you can see, it's clear Shadows is a game you can play offline, but only after connecting to the internet once to actually install the RPG.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S,&nbsp;Amazon Luna, PC (via the Ubisoft Store and Epic Games Store), and Mac (with Apple silicon via the Mac App Store) on November 15.</p>

<p>For more, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/15/assassins-creed-shadows-reveal-trailer-confirms-dual-samurai-and-shinobi">check out what we learned yesterday during the Shadows reveal</a>, and then read&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/12/13/ranking-the-entire-assassin-s-creed-series.aspx"><em>Game Informer's&nbsp;</em>ranking of the entire Assassin's Creed series</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="281" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-motorsport-known-issues-launch-turn-10-bugs-fixes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Motorsport</a></em> has been making some serious strides forward as of late, believe it or not. Between <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-motorsports-car-progression-rework-is-now-out-and-its-a-huge-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improved progression mechanics</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-motorsport-update-8-adds-improved-vinyl-editor-better-ai-updated-safety-ratings-and-heaps-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI</a>, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-motorsport-promises-massive-improvements-2024-key-areas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">general content</a>, Turn 10 has been putting in work to make things better, and fixing car models is now on the docket, too, believe it or not.</p> <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="409" data-injectable="true">For those who are not in the know, and not the biggest deal in the grand scheme of things, some of the <em>Forza</em> games’ legacy vehicle models are <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/forza/comments/1cs35hw/theyre_going_to_remodel_cars/l44exib/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rather inaccurate</a> when compared to their real-world counterparts. <em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, too, is way better in this regard than either of the contemporary <em>Forza</em> titles, and fans have been asking for Turn 10 and Playground Games to fix things up for quite a while now. </p>
 <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="297" data-injectable="false">Now, out of the blue, Turn 10 confirmed it <em>is</em> working on updating its vehicle model library, with almost a dozen classics already on the docket for a fix. The downside? These updates aren’t coming anytime soon, and they won’t be implemented into the current <em>Forza Motorsport</em>, either.<br></p> <figure data-current-count="597" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <h2 id="h-turn-10-confirms-that-legacy-forza-car-models-will-be-fixed-in-future-games" data-injectable="false">Turn 10 confirms that legacy Forza car models will be fixed… in future games</h2> <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">Turn 10’s plans for <em>Forza Motorsport</em> have been to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGIT4ABa_Ak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make it a long-lasting live-service game</a>, and though the game is now substantially better than it was on day one, it seems it still won’t be getting <em>all</em> of the team’s planned tech and content upgrades after all. So far, Turn 10 has confirmed that the future <em>Forza</em> games will receive updated and accurized representations of the following vehicles:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="9" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false"> <li>BMW M3 E30 (1992)</li> <li>Dodge Viper GTS ACR (1999)</li> <li>Ferrari 575M Maranello (2002)</li> <li>Ford Focus RS (2003)</li> <li>Mazda RX-7 FD3S (1997)</li> <li>Mitsubishi Lancer EVO VI MR (1999)</li> <li>Nissan Silvia Spec-R S15 (2000)</li> <li>Nissan Skyline GT-R R32 V-Spec (1993)</li> <li>Toyota Sprinter Trueno Apex AE86 (1985)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="618" data-injectable="true">Kudos to Redditor red_fuel for <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/forza/comments/1cs35hw/theyre_going_to_remodel_cars/l42kec6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their list</a>! It is, of course, disappointing to hear that the current live-service <em>Forza Motorsport</em> isn’t likely to receive up-to-date models of these cars, but Turn 10’s reasoning is understandable in its own right.</p>
 <p data-characters="404" data-current-count="404" data-injectable="true">Notably, the team’s comment explains how finding a museum-quality car they need to scan is non-trivial by default, and that’s without taking into account all the licensing and technical issues that come part and parcel with the job. Heck, even the inevitable <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> might not be privy to some of these updates, depending on how hard it is to source some of the faulty vehicle models.</p>
 <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="308" data-injectable="false">That’s not to say that <em>Forza Motorsport</em> hasn’t already made improvements in this area, either. Some car models, such as the legendary Impreza 22B, have been updated to better reflect their real-world inspirations, and this is bound to have thrilled fellow car aficionados when they discovered it:</p> <figure data-current-count="608" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="495" data-current-count="495" data-injectable="false">I have bemoaned <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-forza-community-maintains-a-massive-car-manufacturer-color-spreadsheet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Forza</em>‘s car paint shader</a> before, so it stands to reason that I’m fairly nitpicky when it comes to real-world car representation as well. Certainly, the news that Turn 10’s hard work updating all the problematic models isn’t likely to be reflected in <em>Forza Motorsport</em> is disappointing, but I myself am happy to hear that the franchise’s roster of car models <em>will</em> inevitably be improved and iterated upon. For the time being, that’s good enough!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/every-hades-2-hot-spring-companion-and-how-to-get-them/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=every-hades-2-hot-spring-companion-and-how-to-get-them<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="208" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">You can’t spend eternity just hacking away at <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hades-2-is-a-magical-massive-early-access-worth-getting-into-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades 2</a></em>; sometimes, you will need to relax a little bit as well. Thankfully, the hot spring is there for you and a companion to enjoy when things get tense.</p> <p data-characters="414" data-current-count="414" data-injectable="true">The best thing about bringing someone to the hot springs is that you can have a conversation with them you would not otherwise witness, and get some additional lore about each character, as well as further developing your relationship with them. Given that the strength of the writing and character building is always a core part of Supergiant Games’ work, you can bet this will be quite rewarding over time.</p>
 <h2 id="h-which-characters-can-you-bring-to-the-hot-tub-in-hades-2" data-injectable="false">Which characters can you bring to the hot tub in Hades 2?</h2> <p data-characters="615" data-current-count="615" data-injectable="true"><strong>So far, Dora, Eris, Hecate, Odysseus, Nemesis, and Moros</strong> can all be brought to the hot springs with you in <em>Hades 2</em>. All of the characters need to be somewhat friendly with you before they will just dive in, however. This means you will need to bring them gifts to improve their affection for you. The most prominent gift for many of these characters is simple Nectar, and for most of them the characters, you can just keep bringing them Nectar to unlock the required level of affection to get them in the tub. You can purchase Nectar from the Wretched Broker, or as a reward for clearing areas on your dungeon runs.</p>
 <figure data-found-rows="6" data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th>Character</th><th>Gifts</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Dora</td><td>1 Nectar</td></tr><tr><td>Eris</td><td>3 Nectar</td></tr><tr><td>Hecate</td><td>2 Nectar</td></tr><tr><td>Moros</td><td>2 Nectar</td></tr><tr><td>Nemesis</td><td>3 Nectar (you need to go fishing with her first)</td></tr><tr><td>Odysseus</td><td>1 Nectar</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="469" data-current-count="469" data-injectable="true">There is one more thing that you will need to convince people to get into the springs with you, Bath Salts. To get the Bath Salts, you need to unlock the springs (more on that later), which will get you a single dose of the useful resource. To get more, you can purchase them from the Wretched Broker, who will sell you the Bath Saltes for 50 Bones. You can also find them while out and about on your runs, but you will need the Silver Spade to be able to dig them up. </p>
 <p data-characters="82" data-current-count="82" data-injectable="false">This might seem a little complicated, but you will need to do the following steps:</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="242" data-injectable="false"> <li>Purchase the Night’s Craftwork incantation at the Cauldron early in the game. This will cost a single Moly, a plant you can find early in the game.</li> <li>Go to the main area and use 1 Ashes to buy the Cresent Pick.</li> <li>Equip the Cresent Pick and do runs to find the Silver nodes. You need 10 Silver in total.</li> <li>Use your 10 silver to craft the Silver Spade tool, then use that to find the Bath Salts.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="592" data-current-count="834" data-injectable="true">As you may have guessed, the expectation is that you will get to this later in the game, so don’t worry about it all too soon. There is also a very useful way to check how far along you are with your relationship with someone. Play through and fight Hecate three times, and this will give you access to the Book of Shadows. You can then upgrade the book of Shadows using the Empath’s Intuition spell that you can learn at the Cauldron near Hecate. Once that is done, the character pages in the book will display the next level of affection for each character, and what they need. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">How to unlock the hot springs</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="453" data-current-count="753" data-injectable="false">If you have yet to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-unlock-the-hot-springs-in-hades-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unlock the hot springs</a>, it is not that hard to do. First, you will need to do a few runs of the game. After passing enough nights, a recipe will appear at the Cauldron near Hecate called <strong>Rite of Vapor-Cleansing</strong>. To properly make this spell you will need 2 Moly, 2 Lotus, and 2 Nightshade, which can be collected doing various runs through Erebus and Oceanus. The exception to this is Nightshade, which <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hades-2-plant-guide-every-seed-and-where-to-get-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">must be grown at the Crossroads</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/google-ai-search-god-no-why<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Google’s AI search has arrived, uninvited, to my <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/14/24155321/google-search-ai-results-page-gemini-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">browser</a>, and I cannot make it leave. It isn’t just that it serves me crap whenever I enter a question into my search bar, but that I have to <em>wait</em> for all the crap I don't want in the first place.</p><p>Let me tell you a story from my day: I was paying invoices, and I wanted to doublecheck that the number of episodes of our podcast, <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath Hours</a>, squared with what our producers had billed for. I typed “Aftermath hours spotify” into my browser window, which–depending when I’ve last cleared my history–either autofills the URL for the podcast on Spotify or takes me to Google search results, where our Spotify page is the top result. But <em>now</em>, when I get Google, I have to wait through a nearly three-second pause before AI information about the podcast appears at the top of the page, followed by a link to Spotify and other results. While I appreciate that, <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-internet-is-full-of-ai-dogshit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in this instance</a>, the AI-generated information about the podcast is correct, this information is not what I’m looking for, and I have to wait three seconds for it to show up just so I can ignore it.</p><figure></figure><p>These three seconds are wrecking me. I’m not one of those lifehacking types who wants to optimize every bit of their day, but that three second wait is <em>just</em> enough friction that I notice it every time. It’s a small annoyance in the moment, but over the course of a day’s queries–any writer or editor can tell you that the number of weird searches you do adds up–that friction starts to build into a drag. I feel like I’m losing chunks of my one and only life waiting for bullshit I didn’t ask for and don’t want to load onto my screen so I can scroll past it. That's something I already deal with when visiting the ad-laden websites Google search brings up; I don’t need a preview! It makes the <a href="https://aftermath.site/google-seo-results-broken-media-private-equity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already unpleasant experience</a> of Google search even worse than it already is.</p><p>Before some stray AI evangelist leaps into the comments to <a href="https://aftermath.site/humane-ai-marques-brownlee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promise the tech will get better</a>, I want to be clear that even if it were instantaneous, I <em>still</em> wouldn’t want it. I didn’t ask for results from the plagiarism machine! My Aftermath colleagues aren’t getting it, so I assume it’s just rolling out to more people this week on the back of Google’s I/O conference.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>I should, apparently, <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-search-web-filter-ai-overview/?ref=daily-stories-newsletter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">be able to get around all this</a> by selecting “web” results from the “more” dropdown, but I’m not seeing that option yet–and I assume I’d still have to wait for the AI results to load first. All the instructions for how to disable AI search presume I opted into it, which I very much <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-starts-testing-ai-overviews-from-sge-in-main-google-search-interface-438680" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did not</a>. <em>Plus</em>, Googling “how do I turn AI search off” still gives me AI results; while its answers square with what actual websites tell me, it’s a real <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARJ8cAGm6JE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em></a> vibe.&nbsp;</p><p>In lieu of being able to turn it off, I’ve been trying to race the AI results, clicking “search” and then scrolling as fast as I can down the page before the AI text appears. While this adds some excitement to my day, it also adds more stress and time crunch to a life that’s already <a href="https://aftermath.site/starting-a-website-has-taught-me-too-much-about-myself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full of it</a>. I don’t want this! I don’t need this. Life is too short.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-sales-two-million<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hooded Horse and developer Slavic Magic have announced that&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>sales have reached another major milestone less than three weeks after the game's release.</p>
<p>According to a press release,&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>has crossed two million sales since launching on April 26th, which means it's sold another million copies since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-sales-player-count">hitting its first million on April 29th</a>.</p>
<p>The game's success is no big surprise given that it was one of the most wishlisted titles on Steam leading up to its release, not to mention its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-price-player-count">impressive player count on launch day</a>, but Slavic Magic and Hooded Horse's achievement is commendable nonetheless.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/manor-lords-sales-milestone-armies.jpg?itok=oYpgF2IV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/manor-lords-sales-milestone-armies.jpg?itok=f7yR6bRt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>has proven a runaway hit for developer Slavic Magic and publisher Hooded Horse.</figcaption></figure><p>Hooded Horse CEO Tim Bender says the company "had some pretty optimistic expectations" for&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords</em>, as well as some less realistic "wild hopes", but that the two million figure has "exceeded even those".</p>
<p>Slavic Magic, meanwhile, hasn't commented on the sales milestone, instead <a href="https://twitter.com/LordsManor/status/1791065617002328457" rel="noopener" target="_blank">taking to X (formerly Twitter) earlier today</a>&nbsp;to express admiration for a&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>VR mod. Better hope he <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-mods-discussion-banned-on-official-discord">doesn't take that discussion to the game's Discord</a>, eh?</p>
<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>is, it's a city-builder with RTS and grand strategy elements (but <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-manor-lords-roadmap-yet">very much not a&nbsp;<em>StarCraft&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Total War&nbsp;</em>competitor</a>) developed by tiny studio Slavic Magic.</p>
<p>Despite the title's plural, you play as a single manor lord, growing your medieval settlement by managing resources, overseeing production chains, and even fighting battles when the need arises.</p>

  <p id="6lZvmm">Dearest Reader,</p>
<p id="UBiz7h">Another season (of Netflix’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22993130/bridgerton-season-2-ending-breakdown"><em>Bridgerton</em></a>) is upon us, and once again, it is filled to the brim with romance and scandal. As your ever-watchful Lady Polydown, it is my duty to assess all the comings and goings of the Ton, and let my gentle readers know who is worth keeping an eye on — after all, there are so very many members, but not all of them are as compelling as others! </p>
<p id="oizT5Q">This season, all eyes turn to Miss Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan). After two seasons of watching her pine for her best friend Mr. Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton), it’s high time this wallflower takes matters into her own hands! </p>
<p id="mOuYG1">But is Mr. Colin worthy of Miss Penelope’s affections? This is a conundrum that has puzzled me season after season. Miss Penelope has been nothing but a loyal, devoted, and supportive friend to him. Whilst away from her company, Mr. Colin has changed a great deal, but is his newfound sturdiness and swagger enough to mend the wounds on Miss Penelope’s heart? </p>

<p id="7vimGq">Mr. Colin’s affections, at least, <em>do </em>change this season, after Miss Penelope enlists his help to attract a suitor. Her brief flirtation with the reclusive naturalist Lord Debling (Sam Phillips) is actually most compelling — though it is clear that even if they would make a lovely match on paper, her heart may still be stuck on an old chapter. But this author wishes there were a <em>bit</em> more proof of Mr. Colin’s feelings, beyond a couple of heated dreams. </p>
<p id="5jJBsD">As for Miss Penelope’s side venture as the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22995119/bridgerton-lady-whistledown-spoiler"><em>other</em> gossipmonger</a>… let’s just say it has not been forgotten. It lingers, especially because it utterly destroyed her relationship with one Miss Eloise Bridgerton. And this season, Miss Eloise (Claudia Jessie) is in the company of Miss Cressida Cowper (Jessica Madsen), the past few seasons’ continual villain. Yet, if there’s a glimmer to be found, it’s this facet, a development that yields an actually meaningful friendship, giving Miss Cowper’s character depth and maturity. What a surprise to find myself rooting for this previously unlikeable debutante! Even when she’s plotting against Miss Penelope, I am sympathetic, now that we know more about why Miss Cowper is the way she is. And the friendship she shares with Miss Eloise is particularly evocative, as three seasons in they are both shunned by the current marriageable market. </p>

<p id="7PTpWv">But the love story that has captured the heart of this author isn’t the one at the center of the season. No, it is the one between shy Francesca Bridgerton (Hannah Dodd) and the stoic Jonathan Stirling, the Earl of Kilmartin (Victor Alli)<strong>.</strong> Miss Francesca would simply like to be left alone this season, and the only one who understands that is Lord Kilmartin. Compared to the big flashy courtships of her siblings, Miss Francesa’s is incredibly subdued and quiet — and yet, it is a different sort of romance, one we’ve yet to see in previous seasons, and one that has completely stolen my heart. The Queen may not approve, but this author is utterly charmed! </p>
<p id="iv4has">Ah, the Viscount Anthony Bridgerton (Jonathan Bailey) and his new bride Kate Bridgerton, nee Sharma (Simone Ashley) have returned from their honeymoon — and they are here to kiss and look very beautiful. Do they add much to the fraught pageantry of this current season? Not particularly, but they are so very darling and in love (and also, they do not take up <em>too</em> much time away from the main action). I acknowledge that I am being completely and shamelessly catered to, yet I do not care, as it fills my heart with joy to see this happy couple once again. </p>

<p id="3MuxB7">Meanwhile, Mr. Benedict Bridgerton (Luke Thompson) has once again found himself cavorting around town and getting caught up with yet another woman introduced just this season. The one thing Mr. Benedict had going for him was his love of art and painting, but after finding out that his brother paid for his admission into the Royal Academy of Art, Mr. Benedict made quite the ruckus, and consequently abandoned his artistic pursuits. And yet, without his proclivity for the paintbrush, where does that leave Mr. Benedict? A boring bachelor, that is what. Now, all he does this season is sneak around with his sexually bold lover, without even really interacting with his siblings or doing much else of interest. </p>
<p id="ynSguB">What has most befuddled me most, dear readers, is the constant fixation on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22991651/bridgerton-season-1-recap-season-2">Mr. Will Mordich</a> (Martins Imhangbe) and his family. If that name does not ring a bell, don’t feel guilty; I certainly would not have remembered his name, were he not the owner of what was once a popular club. But thanks to a distant relative’s perplexing will, which leaves a lordship to Mr. Mordich’s eldest child, the Mordich family is thrust into high society. A noble effort, but one that still singles them out from the rest of the Ton’s players. Yes, Mr. Mordich is good friends with the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22193552/bridgerton-review-shondaland-netflix">Duke of Hastings</a>, but the Duke has been off with his lovely Daphne for two seasons now. Too often, Mr. Mordich and his family feel too minuscule when isolated against the spectacle of the rest of the season. What is the point? I do not know, but at least it is charming to see the child lord learning about silverware.</p>

<p id="7BbHqx">As for elsewhere on the Ton, well, they all get some sort of minor plotline. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/28/22203598/bridgerton-characters-essay-marriage">Dowager Viscountess Violet Bridgerton</a> (Ruth Gemmell) finds herself smitten with her dear friend Lady Danbury’s brother (which I, personally, am in favor of, considering we learned in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23709730/queen-charlotte-bridgerton-review"><em>Queen Charlotte</em></a> that Lady Danbury once had an affair with Lady Violet’s father back in the day). The Featherington sisters, meanwhile, are racing to produce a male heir with their husbands — a most amusing plot to see these clueless young couples be romantic together (what matches made in heaven!). And of course, the queen is determined to oust Lady Whistledown, though that game has been at a bit of a stalemate for a while now. </p>
<p id="x1juSg">I am torn, dear readers. On one hand, I came to this season expecting some delicious romance and I have most surely gotten that! Not just between Miss Penelope and Mr. Colin, but also between Miss Francesca and her surprisingly charming suitor. And other relationships continue to intrigue me, like Miss Eloise and Miss Cowper’s unexpected friendship. Yet, there are so many superfluous people to keep track of this season, to the point where I am wondering why their actions are even worth paying attention to. That is, alas, the <em>Bridgerton</em> dilemma: for every interesting sibling and their romantic partner, there are dozens of dull stories twisting in and out of their lives (some with looser connective threads than others). </p>
<p id="FfCmjZ">But even when the sea is calm, the tides of courtship may yet turn. After all, the season is still young. There is plenty of time for those less enlightening individuals to become a little bit more interesting (and for Mr. Benedict to remember he has a passion for something other than bedding rich widows). We shall see what the second half of the season holds for us. Till then, this lighthouse keeper waits atop her tower, a watchful eye cast across the Ton. </p>
<p id="VxhDFB">Yours Truly,</p>
<p id="eHts7I"><em>Lady Polydown</em></p>
<p id="eT7A4w"><small>The first half of Bridgerton season 3 is out on Netflix now. The second half (also four episodes) arrives on June 16. </small></p>

<h2 id="h-when-does-summer-game-fest-start">When Does Summer Game Fest Start?</h2>



<p>With the season in full swing, it’s time to start thinking about Summer Game Fest. The massive gaming showcase spans a few days and begins on June 7.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-board-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Star Wars has invaded every inch of our culture, including Star Wars toys, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-star-wars-lego-sets-in-2022">Star Wars LEGO sets</a>, and even the tabletop. It may come as a surprise, but the slate of board and roleplaying games based on this popular intellectual property includes several absolutely killer options. </p><p>The diversity here is strong. There are smaller, less complex options, as well as sprawling games with mounds of miniatures. Each of these titles offers a compelling experience that captures aspects of this beloved film series. All of these are currently available and can be picked up and played right now.</p><h2>TL;DR: The Best Star Wars Board Games</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/PgY0A" target="_blank">Star Wars: Shatterpoint</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/jPgbv" target="_blank">Star Wars: Unlimited</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/x3bJY" target="_blank">Star Wars: Jabba's Palace - A Love Letter Game</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/5pXlV" target="_blank">Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/5pXlV" target="_blank">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/5LxAY" target="_blank">Star Wars Villainous: Power of the Dark Side</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/w4kJK" target="_blank">Star Wars: Outer Rim</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/e15v5" target="_blank">Star Wars: X-Wing (2nd Edition)</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/XbX8x" target="_blank">Star Wars: Armada</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/y5Vm0" target="_blank">Star Wars: Imperial Assault</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/jnJlv" target="_blank">Star Wars: Rebellion</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/nLm28" target="_blank">Star Wars: Destiny</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/2vK6e" target="_blank">Star Wars: Legion</a></li></ul><p>Short on time? Click the links above to check out each game on the list. Read on for details about each one.</p><h2>Star Wars: Shatterpoint</h2><div id="183081"><p><h3>Star Wars Shatterpoint - Core Set</h3></p></div><p>Shatterpoint is the newest Star Wars tabletop design. This comes from Atomic Mass Games, the studio that took over X-Wing and Legion, and which conceived the exceptional Marvel Crisis Protocol miniatures game. They are fully behind this new release and have already released many additional miniatures with shiny new content.  </p><p>Following in the footsteps of Crisis Protocol, Shatterpoint focuses on a small number of units with players fielding squads from the Clone Wars era. Aesthetically, it’s a more vibrant and focused experience in comparison to Legion. The larger-sized 40mm miniatures are impressive and offer a striking presentation. Gameplay is dynamic and swift with several unique flourishes. It is rather detailed, however, and offers plenty of tactical fat to chew on. This comes at the cost of complexity, which can occasionally bog down play. For those looking to engage in this exciting new title, you will find a rather sophisticated game full of modern touches. Check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-shatterpoint-board-game-review">Star Wars: Shatterpoint review</a> for more detail.</p><h2>Star Wars: Unlimited</h2><div id="196833"><p><h3>Star Wars: Unlimited</h3></p></div><p>Following the success of 2023’s Disney Lorcana, the trading game format has found new life. Disney wants to keep the cash flowing, and that’s arriving courtesy of Fantasy Flight Games Star Wars: Unlimited. This one has just hit the market and is generating a great deal of buzz. With a little focus, you can hear the millions of wallets crying out in terror.</p><p>Gameplay is relatively straightforward and leans into concepts common to the TCG format. You spend resources to put new equipment, characters, and vehicles into play. One novel concept is alternating actions, following a pattern common to miniatures skirmish games. This establishes a unique cadence to play that offers some distinction from its peers. Veering away from Decipher’s old CCG, they’ve opted for new illustrations as opposed to stills from the films. This helps to bolster the game’s personality and enhance its attraction. We were able to get our hands on an early copy of the two starter decks, and you can <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-the-death-star-star-wars-unlimited-has-incredible-power-and-a-notable-flaw">read our preview</a> for additional thoughts. </p><h2><strong>Star Wars: Jabba’s Palace - A Love Letter Game</strong></h2><div id="196834"><p><h3>Star Wars Jabba's Palace A Love Letter Game</h3></p></div><p>Love Letter is the popular card game that made serious waves in 2012. It’s seen a large amount of spinoffs since, including Star Wars: Jabba’s Palace. This functions much like the other variants, taking the core framework of Love Letter and adding a twist to freshen up the experience.</p><p>Players choose between two cards to play each turn. Each has a different effect and includes iconic characters from Return of the Jedi. For instance, Boba Fett allows you to take a card from another player, while Salacious Crumb lets you look at their hand. The goal is to outlast your opponents by using a degree of intuition and bluffing. This particular edition adds a new Agenda mechanism which changes scoring each round. It’s a solid changeup that adds some variety and tactical nuance to play. This is a simple game, one that is appropriate for a wide age range. Better yet, it’s incredibly cheap. </p><h2>Star Wars: The Deck-Building Game</h2><div id="177415"><p><h3>Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game</h3></p></div><p>If you and a friend or family member want to duke it out in a galaxy far, far away, Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game is an excellent choice. Rather than making you buy booster packs to assemble a deck, this standalone game comes with all the cards you need to pit the Reble Alliance against the Empire. It's a great pick for newcomers to deckbuilding games, but it has enough depth and strategy for diehard fans. Check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-the-deckbuilding-game-review">Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game review</a> for more info.</p><h2>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</h2><div id="179755"><p><h3>Star Wars: The Clone Wars Board Game</h3></p></div><p>If you've played Pandemic (and not just by living through one!), you know the basics for how this game works. Set during the Clone Wars era of Star Wars, this board game pits the Jedi against Count Dooku and the Sith Lord's forces. It comes with four scenarios to play through, giving it lots of replay value. </p><h2>Star Wars: Armada</h2><div id="165959"><p><h3>Star Wars: Armada</h3></p></div><p>One thought everyone had when they saw how fantastic the X-Wing miniatures looked was to wonder what a Star Destroyer would look like. In that thought, Armada was born. It has the same great pre-painted ships, but the action has moved from tactical dogfights to epic fleet combat.</p><p>Along with the change in scale, the tone and feel of the game has also changed. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">Two players</a> still pick a roster of ships and upgrades. But Armada is a more stately, strategic affair compared to the frantic dice-offs and cartoon action of its predecessor. What it loses in intimacy, it gains in depth.</p><p>Armada has another advantage: although individual ships are expensive, you need fewer of them. And there are fewer to choose from than X-Wing. So although the rules are more complex, the game as a whole is easier to get your head around.</p><h2>Star Wars Villainous: Power of The Dark Side</h2><div id="165965"><p><h3>Star Wars Villainous: Power of the Dark Side</h3></p></div><p>Following on from 2018’s very successful <a href="https://zdcs.link/A5oB0" target="_blank">Disney Villanous</a>, this amped-up version lets you pilot some of the most famous villains from the Star Wars franchise to succeed in their evil plots. You’ll need to shepherd resources and cards wisely as you pursue your character’s unique objective, such as Darth Vader turning Luke to the dark side. But beware: other characters can draw from your fate deck and play pesky heroes and deleterious events onto your board, setting your plans awry unless you can deal with them. With new resources and the potential to move into deep space, this is a more complex and challenging game than the original, but it pays off with crunchier strategy and more engaging theme. </p><h2>Star Wars: Outer Rim</h2><div id="165957"><p><h3>Star Wars: Outer Rim</h3></p></div><p>Star Wars games tend to focus on the epic struggle or the details of one battle. Outer Rim fills the wide gap between with a strategic story of the lives of the scum and villains who ply their trade on the galaxy's edge. Except since they're your scum and villains, it's up to you how villainous you want them to be.</p><p>As you fly missions and smuggle cargo from system to system, your choices will shape your character. The cleverly linked mission cards give each game a cohesive but unique narrative. You'll upgrade your skills and ship along the way. But whether you choose to be a heroic rogue or a sky bounty hunter is up to you. Why not both?</p><p>Of course, this being a board game there are numbers to juggle, dice to roll and resources to manage. It'll take both luck shrewd wits to be the galaxies greatest rascal. Much like real life, really. Also check out our rundown of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">best strategy board games</a>.</p><h2>Star Wars X-Wing Second Edition</h2><div id="165958"><p><h3>Star Wars X-Wing Second Edition</h3></p></div><p>The success of this tactical space fighting game has spawned imitations across the hobby. But X-Wing has two things its mimics do not. First, it's Star Wars. Second, the figures are pre-painted to a high standard, so you can have amazing-looking games for zero effort. And if you collected Star Wars toys as a kid, the nostalgia appeal is impossible to ignore.</p><p>The game became a victim of its own popularity, bloated with confusing expansions. But a second edition has cleaned things up and added a bunch of cool rules tweaks. Now, as well as the squad building and hidden movement tactics of the original, you can deploy force powers to aid your cause. Existing players can get upgrade kits with new dials and cards for their collection.</p><p>And the core game remains fantastic fun, a fast-paced snapshot of movie action. There are ship lines not only for Rebels and the Empire, but ones from the prequels and newer films, alongside iconic rogues in Scum and Villainy. Also check out the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">best war board games</a>.</p><h2>Star Wars: Imperial Assault</h2><div id="165960"><p><h3>Star Wars: Imperial Assault</h3></p></div><p>Spaceship combat in Star Wars is spectacular, but it's not where the real heart of the films is. That's in the unfolding story, the Jedi powers, the blaster battles. It's in Han and Leia, Luke and his father. If that's where you are with the movies, Imperial Assault is your game.</p><p>Borrowing heavily from the mechanics of dungeon-crawling game <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/descent-legends-of-the-dark-review">Descent</a>, this is a grid combat game. You set up a map of interlocking tiles and play out a battle between Imperial and Rebel forces using plastic models of film characters. Turn by turn you need to position your models and use their abilities to best effect in order to win an edge over the opposition.</p><p>That's only half the story. This is two games using similar mechanics. One is a battle game where you pick your models and fight it out. The other is an ongoing adventure where one player controls the Imperial forces and the others Rebel heroes. Over the course of many sessions you'll see your own Star Wars saga unfold. Whichever way you prefer to play there are a vast number of expansions to extend your game.</p><h2>Star Wars: Rebellion</h2><div id="158890"><p><h3>Star Wars: Rebellion</h3></p></div><p>If controlling Star Destroyers or AT-AT's isn't big enough for you, how about a Death Star? In fact, how about several Death Stars? That's what's waiting for you in this grand board game, which lets you replay the entire rebellion on your dinner table.</p><p>Of course, as befits the movies, the Rebel player can't hope to hold a holo-candle to the might of the Imperial navy. But they don't have to: they have to fight a clandestine war of insurgency and politics, swaying planets to join them while poking thorns in the Imperial side. The Emperor and his minions, meanwhile, merely need to destroy the Rebel base to win. Except they have to find out where it's hidden first.</p><p>Rebellion takes a long time to play, but it's engrossing, strategic and surprisingly characterful. Players do get to control a lot of popular film heroes and villains, albeit relegated to a single card.</p><h2>Star Wars: Destiny</h2><div id="165961"><p><h3>Star Wars: Destiny</h3></p></div><p>In a move as bold as Obi-Wan confronting Grievous, Destiny resurrects the collectible card game. You begin with a fixed starter set, either Rey or Kylo Ren, and expand it with blind boosters. From this collection you build decks that span across space and time, featuring the likes of Count Dooku pairing up with General Hux.</p><p>The unique hook is that Destiny isn't only about playing cards - you’ll be tossing dice around, too. Each character in your deck brings custom dice to the fight, and rolling them partly dictates what you can do with your turn. While this might sound a strategic no-no, it keeps the game varied, fast and exciting, much like the battles it seeks to re-create.</p><p>Plus, the variety of the dice themselves help build tactical options. Dice that are more reliable are also less flexible, so it's up to you how you build your force.</p><h2>Star Wars: Legion</h2><div id="165963"><p><h3>Star Wars: Legion</h3></p></div><p>Legion is the ground-based equivalent to X-Wing, a miniatures title with troops and tanks instead of spaceships. The miniatures don't come painted or assembled for this. But don't let that put you off. Publisher Fantasy Flight has learned well from other popular miniatures games and put out a doozy.</p><p>At heart, there's the measuring and moving, estimating and dice rolling you'd expect from a game of this type. Two clever tweaks to the formula catapult the game to the next level. First is the activation system in which you have to balance moving what you want against when you want to move it: you won't get both. Second is the card-based scenario creation which puts a tactical twist on making each game unique.</p><p>There are sculpts of all your favorite characters and vehicles from the movies to expand your collection. The fact they make up a varied strategic challenge to build an effective army is just a bonus.</p><h2>Star Wars Board Game FAQs</h2><h2>What is a miniatures game, and how do the various Star Wars ones differ?</h2><p>Miniatures games share a lot of DNA with board games which, confusingly, often have miniatures as playing pieces. The difference is twofold. Firstly, miniatures games have much higher quality figures and for many players, painting and converting them is an additional hobby in its own right. Second, miniatures games are generally played on an open table with scenery of your choice, on which you move pieces by measuring distances with a tool or tape measure, rather than a fixed board with spaces.</p><p>There are currently four different Star Wars miniatures games, a reflection of the franchise's popularity and visual appeal. The easiest one to get into is space dogfighting game X-Wing, which comes with fantastic pre-painted starfighters, like the iconic titular ship and TIE fighter. It has the simplest rules of the four, you don't have to do any modelling at all, the starter set is fun to play with by itself, and you don't even really need any scenery. Next up is Armada, which represents fleet level action with pre-painted scale models of huge capital ships like the Star Destroyer. Although it has a smaller range of models they're also more expensive and you'll need more than just the starter box to properly appreciate what it offers. Some of the expansion content comes with miniscule starfighter wings, and they won't look great next to your painted models unless you take the plunge and paint them up yourself.</p><p>The ground combat games, Star Wars: Shatterpoint and Star Wars: Legion are very different beasts, as both come with unpainted models and the expectation is very much that you'll paint them up yourself.  You'll also need a collection of scenery although both starter boxes come with some for you to play with. Shatterpoint uses bigger models for smaller-scale action, skirmishes between famous characters from the Star Wars franchises. It's the most complex of all four games but rewards you with movie-like narrative action. Legion depicts bigger battles and is slightly more anonymous in the sense that most of your forces will be stormtroopers or rebel soldiers, with the occasional better-known character as a leader. But while its easier to learn, you'll also have a lot more painting to do to get those larger forces tabletop ready!</p><p>For more, check out our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-90s-board-games">best '90s board games</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-classic-board-games">best classic board games</a>.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/forever-entertainment-on-making-what-was-old-new-again<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>The publisher talks about how and why remakes such as Front Mission 2 are a part of its business model</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Remaking games is not easy. You have to consider how retro titles will play on modern consoles and for today's audiences. You also have to work on the finer details, such as the clarity of dialogue, balancing gameplay, and quality-of-life changes. The list goes on.</p>
<p>However, when remakes become a part of your business model, you have it figured out. Forever Entertainment has proven itself in this field with the remakes of Panzer Dragoon, The House of The Dead, Front Mission 1st, and Front Mission 2. In 2018, it announced that it is also developing the Panzer Dragoon 2: Zwei remake.</p>
<p>Communications and marketing manager Monika Ginter tells <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> that the firm's focus on retro titles spans from genuine interest from the team.</p>
<blockquote>"We are currently working on both announced and unannounced titles. Remakes are one of the pillars of our operations"</blockquote>
<p>She says, "We are fans of old games — they had a big impact on our lives, and we wanted a modern-day player to be able to experience the classics of our childhood, too. We think this is still a niche in the market that will gain more and more interest over time. Every year, we try to release an increasing number of remakes, and we are currently working on both announced and unannounced titles. Remakes are one of the pillars of our operations."</p>
<p>For clarity, Ginter explains the distinction between remake and remaster titles for consumers.</p>
<p>"Often, people confuse a remaster with a remake, but the latter involves starting from scratch and demands a considerable amount of work. While our remake versions may appear similar to the originals in terms of mechanics, we invest significant effort by closely analyzing the original to build our games entirely from the ground up," she explains.</p>
<p>Ginter continues, "We firmly believe that gaming classics deserve more than just a 'straight port.' The popularity of our past remakes indicates a growing support for this niche among gamers, and we are dedicated to delivering new releases that not only revive the classics but elevate them to new heights.</p>
<p>"One of the most important aspects for us when creating remakes is finding the balance between the old and the new. It is crucial to preserve the spirit of the original while incorporating improvements that the modern-day player expects."</p>
<p>Ginter says past releases paved the way for the firm to focus further on its remake output. To this point, Forever approached Square Enix with the proposal of remaking the first three Front Mission titles. She says that their past successful remake releases helped with those negotiations.</p>
<blockquote>"We have many fans of turn-based strategy games...it's always better to work on what you love"</blockquote>
<p>"As a publisher and developer, we are always on the lookout for new opportunities. Remakes presented an interesting challenge and, in a way, a realization of our own ambitions — after all, who wouldn't want to create their own version of games played in their youth?" she explains.</p>
<p>"Additionally, within [Forever Entertainment], we have many fans of turn-based strategy games, and we operate on the principle that it's always better to work on what you love."</p>
<p>Forever released Front Mission 2 Remake on additional platforms last month. It was released on the Nintendo Switch last year. The strategy game was originally launched in 1997 for the PlayStation 1 in Japan by Square Enix. The title had not received an English or Western release before its re-release.</p>

<p>Front Mission games feature multiple characters and large political plots, making them text-heavy RPGs. When remaking the second game, Forever also localized it in multiple languages and balance gameplay. Ginter explains that the company relied on its previous work and experience to take on the task.</p>
<p>"We take an individual approach to each game," she explains. "Recognizing the historical significance and RPG elements of the Front Mission series, we prioritized providing support for multiple languages. This ensures a comfortable gaming experience and broadens the audience. While we have previously localized several RPGs into different languages, such as Rise Eterna, Front Mission represents our most extensive localization project to date, undertaken entirely from scratch."</p>
<p>Regarding the project scope, Ginter says that English script translations for Front Mission 1 and Front Mission 2 totaled nearly 140,000 words. Localizing each title involved ensuring the narrative, dialogue, and text conveyed the essence of their original scripts.</p>
<p>"While working on remakes, we are in constant contact with IP owners; this ensures the balance between introducing quality-of-life changes and preserving the essential elements of the original game. Our aim is to make the game accessible to newcomers to the series while retaining the depth and detail that are iconic to the Front Mission series."</p>
<p>Ginter explains that Forever received guidance from Square Enix during the development process. However, it also consulted various Japanese-language sources, including the original game guides, to ensure the strategy RPGs were consistent with the franchise's lore. While working on these remakes, the publisher was also aware that it had to meet expectations.</p>
<p>She explains, "Developing a game that satisfies the nostalgia of long-time fans while also captivating a new audience, essentially breathing a second life into the series, is no easy feat. With each new remake, we strive for continuous improvement, and it seems we are succeeding, thanks in part to the valuable feedback from our players."</p>
<blockquote>"Developing a game that satisfies the nostalgia of long-time fans while also captivating a new audience, essentially breathing a second life into the series, is no easy feat"</blockquote>
<p>Regarding the quality of life and gameplay features, Ginter says that Forever is receptive to balancing games based on user feedback. In one case, a bug existed within one of the last stages in Front Mission 2. A cutscene would not trigger the mission's end, and the bug was eventually patched after it was brought to the company's attention.</p>
<p>Ginter explains, "We always consider what players want in terms of quality-of-life improvements while maintaining a balance between introducing new features and keeping the essential elements of the series intact. Our commitment doesn't end at the game's release — we continuously listen to player feedback and roll out updates that address issues and add new features.</p>
<blockquote>"We consider the Nintendo Switch as the ideal platform for various classic remakes"</blockquote>
<p>"In The House of The Dead: Remake, we introduced new game modes like the Horde mode, and there's now a gallery with achievements, unlockable weapons, and a model viewer featuring all enemies. These updates reflect our dedication to enhancing the gaming experience based on the valuable feedback we receive from players."</p>
<p>Regarding the target audience for remakes, Ginter says that the Switch serves as the go-to console for Forever's releases.</p>
<p>"Until now, our remakes have focused on games from Japan, and Japanese gamers have shown great excitement for our updated versions of classics. In terms of platforms, we consider the Nintendo Switch as the ideal platform for various classic remakes. We appreciate the accessibility of the Nintendo Switch. With a diverse user base, our games can reach a broad audience, including those who may not have encountered classics like Front Mission or Panzer Dragoon before."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/1997s-fightnjoke-gets-re-release-with-online-multiplayer-and-rollback-netcode/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=1997s-fightnjoke-gets-re-release-with-online-multiplayer-and-rollback-netcode<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="288" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Mental Drink has today <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1328400/FightNJokes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a new version</a> of 1997’s MS-DOS title <em>Fight’n’Joke</em>, which doesn’t have any relation with 2017’s <em>Fight’n Rage</em> (that I know of). This re-release is pretty lavish, featuring rollback netcode and online multiplayer. That’s swinging for the fences.</p> <p data-characters="505" data-current-count="505" data-injectable="true">If you hadn’t heard of <em>Fight’n’Joke</em>, neither had I. It’s hard to overstate the massive impact that 1991’s <em>Street Fighter II</em> had on the game industry, so the ‘90s were packed to the rafters with fighting games looking to get in on that sweet, sweet success. This also resulted in a few parody games like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/weekly-kusoge-clayfighter-sculptors-cut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clay Fighter</a></em> and <em>Brutal: Paws of Fury</em>. DOS wasn’t exactly the most happening place for fighting games, however. If you wanted to be taken seriously, you generally needed an arcade release.</p>
 <p data-characters="512" data-current-count="512" data-injectable="true">What really caught my attention with this <em>Fight’n’Joke </em>re-release was the sincerity behind it. About five people worked on the original release, but despite that, it looks pretty good for a late DOS title and it features most of what you’d expect from a fighting game. Sure, it’s two-button (plus a charge button), but so were a lot of the NeoGeo Pocket fighting games like <em>SNK vs. Capcom: The Match of the Millennium</em>. I’m not trying to say it’s great, it just punches above its weight class.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Fight'N'Jokes - Steam Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Ew7GTHGH4k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="654" data-injectable="true">There are 10 characters plus four that are unlockable and 11 stages. You can re-map the controls, so it works easily with an arcade stick. The name alone sets it up like it’s supposed to be funny, but it’s mostly just cartoonish like a newspaper comic strip. The press release actually describes it as “semi-humorous,” which would be about right.</p>
 <p data-characters="536" data-current-count="536" data-injectable="true">Mental Drink still features the same brothers who were behind Nasty Brothers Software, the creators of <em>Fight’n’Joke</em>. The re-release ports the game to a new engine that runs natively on modern operating systems. Along with online multiplayer, that’s not an easy job. It really speaks to how much affection they have for the little title. It was previously ported to Switch and Xbox One, but that version didn’t have online multiplayer. They’re planning to patch the console versions to bring them to parity with the PC version.</p>
 <p data-characters="176" data-current-count="176" data-injectable="false"><em>Fight’n’Joke</em> is available now on PC. Although it’s listed as Early Access, the core game is complete. Mental Drink is just looking for feedback on the online performance.</p>

            <p>Fans of odd games with multiple endings and themes of identity and oppression, rejoice! Or, maybe, not rejoice. Time will tell. In the latest issue of Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu, Yosuke Saito, the series producer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier/">Nier</a>, teased that he might be working on something new with Yoko Taro and Keiichi Okabe, the director and composer for the Nier series, respectively.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/05/yosuke-saito-working-on-new-project-with-yoko-taro-and-keiichi-okabe">Gematsu</a> and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/nier-series-director-says-hes-doing-something-with-the-key-creatives-it-might-be-nier-it-might-not-be-nier/">PCGamer</a>, Saito said, “I’ve been talking about wanting to do something with Yoko and Okabe for some time now. I’ll have something a bit more put-together to say in the not-too-distant future, so please stay tuned. It might be NieR, it might not be NieR. (Laughs.) That’s about all I can say for now.” Thanks for the clarity, Saito.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Saito is at GPTRACK50 now, a new-ish studio under NetEase working on something new (last year <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2023/10/gptrack50-led-by-former-capcom-producer-hiroyuki-kobayashi-developing-new-3d-action-rpg">Gematsu reported</a> it's a 3D action RPG). It seems unlikely that rights holders Square Enix will release the Nier series - the most recent being 2017's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier-automata/">Nier: Automata</a>, an action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> about the many ways robots can die - and Taro has <a href="https://x.com/yokotaro/status/1175865227948089344">said in the past</a> that any questions about Nier should be addressed to Squeenix. So my first instict would be to say that Saito is being a coy little flirt and they aren't really working on Nier. Earlier today, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E4%BD%95%E3%81%8B%E6%96%B0%E3%81%97%E3%81%84%E3%81%93%E3%81%A8">Taro re-Xeeted</a> the interview with the comment, "Something new...", so the needle is currently pointing at Who Knows? </p>
<p>Nier: Automata was a huge success and remains beloved, so any potential sequel news will be gratefully recieved by its many fans. Yoko Taro, meanwhile, remains one of my most favourite goofs to be allowed to be in charge of making huge games. I still think fondly of his promo for pre-ordering Nier: Automota to get a t-shirt, in which he rolls around on the floor saying, "Nier: Automata t-shirt!" and, "Shit Square Enix!", and which was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhDL3Q86ofY">somehow released on official Squeenix channels</a>. He's currently a director on the Voice Of Cards RPG series, though Katharine was sadly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/voice-of-cards-the-isle-dragon-roars-review">not so keen on the first one</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-guns-we-might-see/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>As one of the leading FPS franchises on the market, everyone eagerly awaits the release date for Call of Duty Black Ops 6. But in the meantime, let’s explore what possible Black Ops 6 guns we might see in multiplayer. It’s always fun to plan a loadout ahead of time, right?!</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-guns-we-might-get">Black Ops 6 Guns We Might Get</h2>



<p>It’s important to note that nothing is 100% confirmed in Black Ops 6 yet. We’ll see a reveal soon enough, with details likely to come at the Xbox Games Showcase in June, however. For now, this is pure speculation based on the types and availability of weapons found during the Gulf War, which we know is the setting for the next Call of Duty game!</p>



<p>In no specific order, here are a few of the guns in Black Ops 6 we might see:</p>



<ul>
<li>AS VAL</li>



<li>VSS Vintorez</li>



<li>MP5</li>



<li>USP-45</li>



<li>Beretta M9</li>



<li>Makarov</li>



<li>M4</li>



<li>AR-10</li>



<li>M16A2</li>



<li>AK-74</li>



<li>SVD</li>



<li>KSP-58</li>



<li>M240</li>



<li>Mossberg 500</li>



<li>USAS-12</li>



<li>L85A1</li>



<li>AT4</li>



<li>M47 Dragon</li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, word around town is that Black Ops 6 is an open-world game with vehicles to help you traverse the environment. While not directly guns, we’re likely to see various tanks, like the M1A1 Abrams, and mounted-machine guns on the back of a pick-up truck, as usual with the setting.</p>







<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-zombies-guns">Black Ops 6 Zombies Guns</h2>



<p>Alongside the potentially massive selection of weapons in Black Ops 6 multiplayer mode, there’s also the Zombies game mode to consider. This year’s entry will supposedly include the return of two iconic Wonder Weapons, namely the <strong>Raygun </strong>and <strong>Jetgun</strong>!</p>



<p>Like many of you, I coveted the Raygun in World at War. But I didn’t have a chance to mess around with the Jetgun. I took a lengthy break from Call of Duty before its time, which was during Black Ops 2. I’m excited to get my hands on both this year, though!</p>

A turn-based RPG from the height of Squaresoft's dominance in the 1990s, it combined sci-fi and fantasy elements and a whole lot of mental illness troubles with giant mechs wailing on each other. It was pretty cool, and now you can bring a little part of that into your life with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BV5PYHPB?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Square Enix's model kit of the Siebzehn</a>, one of the titular "Gears" of Xenogears.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deep-rock-galactic-season-5-digs-deeper-in-june.872679/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deep-rock-galactic-season-5-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ghost Ship Games has announced the&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic&nbsp;</em>Season 5 release date, and it's just a few weeks away.</p>
<p>Per an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/548430/view/5993806139359858959" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement on Steam</a>, Season 5, otherwise known as Digging Deeper, will arrive on June 13th across all platforms, bringing with it a new mission type and more.</p>
<p>Said release date was actually technically revealed on Tuesday in the form of a series of numbers hidden in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/548430/view/4194617370630456481" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a teaser image</a>, but the aforementioned post has made the release date explicit, so you don't have to guess at what those numbers might mean.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deep-rock-galactic-season-5-release-date-teaser.jpg?itok=mlaa1RDM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deep-rock-galactic-season-5-release-date-teaser.jpg?itok=exud53kL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Can you spot the 06, 13, and 24 hidden in this image?</figcaption></figure><p>Back in late April, Ghost Ship revealed tons of information regarding exactly what's coming to Deep Rock Galactic in Season 5.</p>
<p>A new mission type, Deep Scan, is coming, tasking you and your crew with locating Morkite Seeds deep within Hoxxes and extracting with them before you get overwhelmed.</p>
<p>You can also look forward to a mysterious new Season Event involving a "peculiar new mineral formation" known only as a Core Stone, although Ghost Ship is remaining relatively tight-lipped as to what these formations are.</p>
<p>New enemies and Overclocks will also be available as part of&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic&nbsp;</em>Season 5, so you'll have plenty to look forward to when the season arrives.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deep-rock-galactic-season-5-core-stone.jpg?itok=xZF2rR4W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deep-rock-galactic-season-5-core-stone.jpg?itok=5X4B6qfj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is a Core Stone. What does it do? You'll have to wait to find out.</figcaption></figure><p>Remember, too, that you can now <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deep-rock-galactic-season-reactivation">access the content</a> from previous&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic&nbsp;</em>Seasons if you've missed out, so if you don't feel like starting Season 5 straight away, you won't have to.</p>
<p><em>Deep Rock Galactic&nbsp;</em>is a co-op shooter in which groups of dwarves delve deep into the planet of Hoxxes to mine it for minerals, complete objectives, and defend themselves against the hordes of insectoid enemies that await them.</p>
<p>The game features procedurally-generated maps, tons of loot to collect, and destructible environments, and it's also regularly being updated with new content.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/548430/Deep_Rock_Galactic/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/deep-rock-galactic/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/deep-rock-galactic/9NHFVWX1V7QJ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and it's also available on Game Pass. Ghost Ship says it'll share more about Season 5 and what you can expect from it soon, so stay tuned.</p>

  <p id="B562Ak">When the revised 5th edition of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/dnd-dungeons-dragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> becomes available on Sept. 17, the world will finally get a taste of the seminal role-playing game’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23730399/dnd-dungeons-dragons-revised-core-rulebook-preview-players-handbook-dmg">upgraded mechanics</a>. But D&amp;D’s most dedicated fans will likely have a head start. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24067481/dnd-dungeons-dragons-onednd-delay-2024-rules-refresh-players-handbook-dmg-release-date-price"><em>Player’s Handbook </em>(2024)</a>, including a version with a special alternate art cover, hits brick-and-mortar shelves first on Sept. 3.</p>

<p id="SWwzU0">Illustrated by <a href="https://www.wyliebeckert.com/">Wylie Beckert</a>, the alt art cover of the <em>Player’s Handbook </em>(2024)<em> </em>features a party comprised of D&amp;D’s four iconic classes — the fighter, the wizard, the cleric, and the rogue — all gathered around a friendly gold dragon, sharing tea. This gentle scene stands in stark contrast to the mainline <em>Player’s Handbook </em>(2024), which<em> </em>will have a bright, bold cover by <a href="https://twitter.com/jacobsontyler/status/1790443483280584774">Tyler Jacobsen</a> with similar characters posed in the moments before striking a blow.</p>

<p id="vFoX24">“We liked the idea of making the alt cover something that has a sweeter, calmer version of that,” said Wizards’ head of art, Josh Herman, in a video interview with Polygon. “Something that’s not so aggressive, [with] combat [and] fighting right away. That’s certainly a [...] huge pillar of D&amp;D, but sometimes a lot of what D&amp;D is, is just storytelling.” </p>

<p id="KB0lfH">“I kind of wanted a coffee table book,” Herman continued, “but a book where I would sit and relax in that sort of <a href="https://denmark.dk/people-and-culture/hygge">hygge</a> way, where you can relax and just cozy up and read something.”</p>

<p id="HTwf8U">Fans will likely recognize Beckert’s style from the alternate art cover of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/11/16/21569738/dungeons-dragons-tashas-cauldron-of-everything-review"><em>Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything</em></a>, which was released in 2020. The artist, who works in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C3nSSOqrWf7/?hl=en">ink and watercolors as well as with oils and powdered graphite</a>, was Herman’s first choice for the project. He praised both the softness of her textures as well as the motion in her composition. You can see it first in the momentum of the smoke over Tasha’s cauldron, and in the movement of her arms. </p>
<p id="i5uETu">On the <em>Player’s Handbook </em>(2024), Beckert’s prowess and style are expressed through the sinewy curves of the dragon that surrounds the party, almost protectively, before terminating in a cheeky ampersand symbol with the end of its tail. A light source, centered on the dragon’s magical breath, also calls back subtly to the very first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player%27s_Handbook"><em>Player’s Handbook</em></a>, with art by David Trampier that featured a fire-lit golden idol with giant red gems for eyes.</p>
<p id="enctMP">“I think what that old cover does so well,” Herman said, “is it shows people on an adventure. It shows people doing a thing in the middle of an adventure. This is the contrast of that. This is almost your downtime [between adventures]. This is relaxing. We’re at camp, and I’m recovering my spell slots. I’m just relaxing and chilling.”</p>

</p>
<p id="pCU34N">Beckert’s art is only one piece of the final cover treatment. The alternate art on each of the three core rulebooks, including the <em>Player’s Handbook </em>(2024), <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide </em>(2024), and <em>Monster Manual </em>(2025),<em> </em>will also include a special gold filigree border designed by <a href="https://www.smeyerartist.com/">Simen Meyer</a>, a sign painter who created the alternate art covers for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22315969/dungeons-dragons-candlekeep-mysteries-review"><em>Candlekeep Mysteries</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23608660/dnd-dungeons-dragons-keys-golden-vault-best-heists"><em>Keys from the Golden Vault</em></a>. That, along with the 50th-anniversary logo on the back, should make these books stand out in any collection.</p>
<p id="IW8avx">“I genuinely love the idea that a local game store is the first place you can get your hands on something,” Herman said. “And I especially love it that you can do it with the alt cover, too.”</p>
<p id="Nb3KPe">The <em>Player’s Handbook </em>(2024) will be available for pre-order beginning June 18 before arriving at local game shops on Sept. 3. Fans should expect <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide </em>(2024) a bit later on in November, with <em>Monster Manual (2025) </em>arriving in February next year. </p>

<p>LEGO and PlayStation are developing a new game named ‘LEGO Horizon Adventures’.</p>



<p>Last week, trademark finder <a href="https://twitter.com/Kurakasis/status/1789233776456872005" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kurakasis tweeted</a> that Sony and Lego were soon to announce a collaboration of a well-known IP. At the time, Kurakasis revealed the game, but as what seems to be obligatory from insiders these days, I <a href="https://twitter.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1789324181210796309" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vaguely tweeted</a> that the project was ‘on the horizon’.</p>



<p>Speaking with sources, it was said that the game is essentially “Horizon Forbidden West but Lego” and that the game will have “realistic graphics” – whatever that means for a LEGO game.</p>



<p>While the exact details of the game are unclear, I got wind of an advertisement trailer for the game which was completed last month, which suggests that an announcement is on its way (although admittingly could be delayed). But combining this information with Kuraksis’ <a href="https://twitter.com/Kurakasis/status/1791073620069929442" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest tweet</a>, who finds the majority of his information via trademark filings, it suggests that the trademark has recently been registered (brownie points to anyone who finds it), backing up that an announcement could be soon.</p>



<p>Exact details on when the game will be announced are unclear, but recent rumors of a PlayStation Showcase in the coming weeks align nicely with what is happening with this game (trademarks, ad trailers, etc.). </p>



<p>What do you think of a LEGO Horizon Adventures game? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

But it now seems clear Activison has decided on Black Ops 6, which makes sense given Call of Duty 2024 is the sixth main Black Ops game, but that does also mean we’re skipping Black Ops 5 (2020's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war">Black Ops Cold War</a> looks set to be considered Black Ops 5 in the run).</p><p>Reports from last year indicated <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fresh-call-of-duty-2024-details-confirmed-alongside-gulf-war-setting-in-new-report">Black Ops 6 will take place during the Gulf War</a>, additionally touching on the global political fallout after the Cold War.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/owlchemy-vision-pro-is-biggest-step-towards-vr-mainstream-adoption<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>We talk to the exec team about virtual reality's latest developments, and why hype cycles are making the journey to mainstream seem longer than it is</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Rumour has it that the Vision Pro is finally getting ready to get shipped outside of the US. Three months after its American launch, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-13/apple-set-to-sell-vision-pro-headset-internationally-for-first-time">Bloomberg</a> reported that Apple's VR headset could be shipping in several territories worldwide as early as next month, off the back of the firm's Worldwide Developers Conference.</p>
<p>It's unclear how many headsets Apple has shifted since retail availability in the US but the high $3,500 price point has made the Vision Pro somewhat of a niche within a niche product. Global availability could heighten the demand though.</p>
<p>And that's good news for the developers who are supporting the Vision Pro, including Owlchemy Labs. The studio announced back in February that it was porting VR hits Job Simulator and Vacation Simulator to Apple's headset, and CEO Andrew Eiche says that the strategy has always been for the studio's games to be on as many platforms as possible, regardless of how big the platforms are.</p>
<p>"Owlchemy has always been a multi-platform studio even back to the days when we were doing mobile games," he tells <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>. "And so it's less about a niche within a niche and more about the future. I think a lot of what Vision Pro represents, and a lot of what people care about, is they're hearing that this headset has reinvigorated the popularity of XR. I gave a webinar with Unity [about Vision Pro] and it was the most popular webinar they had ever done.</p>
<p>"And so, for us, this particular one is less about 'Oh, we need to be on the most popular headset.' It's more about what is good for the ecosystem. Our games are staples of VR and we love for the people who are just jumping into VR to play our games."</p>
<p>We ask Eiche whether he sees the Vision Pro as a viable platform for the mainstream, or whether he believes that's not the goal here.</p>
<blockquote>"This is less about 'we need to be on the most popular headset', [and] more about what is good for the ecosystem"<cite>Andrew Eiche</cite></blockquote>
<p>"No," he answers. "I see it as one of the biggest steps towards mainstream adoption. I think there's still a lot of things that we have to figure out to get there. But as far as friction [goes], which is one of the biggest things that we fight in XR... It's one of the lowest friction devices. You put it on, there's no room setup, it's not yelling at you to draw circles or whatever, it just runs the apps. There's no caveats to it.</p>
<p>"And I think that, thinking strategically, that's really important to have a headset that you could just put on, it auto adjusts the lenses, it logs you in, it does everything."</p>
<p>The Vision Pro works with hand tracking, so not having to use controllers is also a strong selling point, he says, adding: "I think it represents the biggest step towards changing VR from a specific use case to a general computing use case."</p>
<p>Sandra Marshall, the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/jobs-roundup-january-2024-hutch-appoints-peter-hansen-chambers-as-co-ceo#:~:text=Sandra%20Marshall%20%7C%20COO%2C%20Owlchemy%20Labs">newly appointed COO of Owlchemy</a>, is in agreement that reducing friction as much as possible is the key, and that Vision Pro is a good example of that.</p>
<p>"It's in an ecosystem or a platform that people are used to, so if you already have the phone or the watch or whatnot, it's an extension of that, from a UI perspective, to get in and get it set up," she points out.</p>

<p>It feels like every new headset is expected to become <em>the</em> VR headset that will reach mainstream adoption. Back in 2013, <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> contributing editor Rob Fahey was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/can-the-vr-dream-go-mainstream">pondering whether or not the 'VR dream' could go mainstream</a>. And a decade later, it feels like the same questions are still unanswered, with the very same Rob Fahey arguing in 2023 that VR <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/vr-isnt-ready-for-a-must-play-experience-opinion">still isn't ready to play host to the cultural phenomenon that a 'must-play' experience would provide</a>.</p>
<p>We ask the Owlchemy team what they think is missing, and how much longer the journey is going to take.</p>
<p>"I think the thing is that we were spoiled with smartphones," Eiche says. "And we forgot that smartphones had to go through Blackberry, they had to go through Palm… We had to go through all this stuff, and what we remember is Apple showed up and released this magical square that thinks and does everything for you. And you forget that Apple also made the Newton, which was a handheld device way back when, and famously was not successful.</p>
<p>"And I think a lot of what you get with enthusiasm is this kind of short look at things, but what has to happen first is the friction has to go down and we're still not there."</p>
<blockquote>"We need the usefulness of it to rise and there will be an inflection point [when] the device becomes useful enough that the friction is worth it"<cite>Andrew Eiche</cite></blockquote>
<p>Even the best VR headsets feel heavy after a while, or get hot, he points out. And loving VR still sometimes feels like you have to justify yourself because people don't quite get the point.</p>
<p>"We need the usefulness of it to rise and there will be an inflection point," Eiche continues. "And it's going to be the inflection point of when the device becomes useful enough that the friction is worth it.</p>
<p>"For many of us it's there, but it's not there for the mainstream yet. But we're starting to see chipping away at that broader problem. So, I think, as developers and enthusiasts, you always want your eye on mainstream adoption but we need to be less worried about 'Are we there yet?' and more worried about 'Are we on a path to get there?'</p>
<p>"Sometimes technology appears and it's super useful, and you understand. Like Chat GPT shows up one day and everyone just f***ing gets it. But what you forget is that AI started in the '70s, and the first neural network proposal that [eventually] became Chat GPT, that started then, and we're just so used to not watching technology evolve, because it happens behind [the scenes] and then it gets productised and sent out as this great thing... And I think VR is one of the few cases where we've been so openly involved in watching every single step that we're like, 'But I love it, it should be here now!' And it's like… just wait!"</p>

<p>We mention some of the misconceptions VR has to fight, which are not dissimilar to some stigma associated with 2D-screen games at their debut; like the idea that VR is inherently isolating, as opposed to something that can be enjoyed as a group in the same room. (I'll personally always recommend to whoever says that to spend an evening with some friends and Beat Saber. Or Home Improvisation.)</p>
<p>Owlchemy product director Matthew Hemby comments: "Some of that is just also... it takes time. I remember getting my first iPhone and feeling like an absolute a**hole anytime I'd take it out in public. And so to Andrew's point about the tipping point of utility and friction... Some of this is also just us getting comfortable interfacing regularly with new technology around other people."</p>
<p>Marshall argues that people feeling like they're playing together when they're not physically in the same space is something a 2D screen can't give you.</p>
<p>"And I think having more multiplayer games will enable people that have these shared experiences together in a way that you can't get on other platforms," she adds. "The introduction of more mixed reality, as a way to see the environment around you as you have others with you, also contributes to that."</p>
<p>Owlchemy has been working on a multiplayer project that uses hand-tracking, which was announced at Gamescom 2022. So it certainly hopes to continue contributing to the march to mainstream adoption.</p>
<blockquote>"We need to be less worried about 'Are we there yet?' and more worried about 'Are we on a path to get there?'"<cite>Andrew Eiche</cite></blockquote>
<p>The mention of Chat GPT earlier in the conversation leads us to discuss the ebbs and flows of hype cycles, which is currently all about AI but was about VR still not that long ago. And Eiche sees the trend going the same way it did for VR: "You just crash against the wall."</p>
<p>He continues: "Remember, VR was called the empathy machine, it was going to solve all of our problems… We're just at the top of the hype curve here, and a lot of that gets driven by where people want to invest, and very fancy demos. And my opinion [about AI] has always been that I'm very positive on it, but I'm positive on a very boring version of it.</p>
<p>"The ultimate end state of it is not that everybody suddenly has a [machine] over their shoulder just chatting with them all day. The ultimate end state is that you're going to buy an AI as a service package to integrate into your enterprise deployment and some companies are going to offer you that… It's very, very boring. But it's extremely useful.</p>
<p>"But right now, we're in the weird stage where people are over-applying. So, it's a buzzword the way that VR was. And it's funny because the group of people who chase the buzzwords, you always see them; they were in VR, they left VR for crypto, crypto was trash, they went to AI, it turns out AI is actually really hard to make, now Vision's [here] so they're back, and we see them again... And it's this cyclical group, and you're never gonna fix that, you just need to wait for the next buzzword. And then the people who are going to actually build it will stay and they'll work really hard."</p>

The project became a record-breaker after amassing over 3.2 million wishlists on Steam (a platform record) and topped 1 million sales within 24 hours of its early access debut.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hooded Horse co-founder and CEO Tim Bender said the title has exceeded the company's wildest expectations. "It's been wonderful to see so many players give </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Manor Lords</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> a try," said Bender. "We had some pretty optimistic expectations and even some wild hopes, but reaching two million copies on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Manor Lords</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> so quickly has exceeded even those."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hooded-horse-co-founder-says-publishers-should-ditch-horrible-recoup-clauses-to-help-devs">recent interview with Game Developer</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Bender explained Hooded Horse began to suspect </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Manor Lords</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> might do well after a Steam Next Fest demo generated around 500,000 wishlists during the event. Another 800,000 wishlists arrived in the two weeks prior to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Manor Lords'</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> early access launch thanks to an upswing in press and influencer coverage, but still Bender refused to get carried away.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As much as I'd like to say 'I saw it coming.' Anybody would have to be absolutely arrogant to expect that. It gained a higher launch peak [player count] than </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Total War: Warhammer III</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. If I expected that I would have been insane. I was hoping for half of that," he added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As of May 11, which is when we spoke with Bender, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Manor Lords</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had a lifetime wishlist conversion rate of 26 percent. Bender clarified that percentage was different on launch day because more players have wishlisted the title since, but it's a metric that's indicative of the title's colossal success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The great thing is, you'd think because we launched with little over 3 million wishlists, that would mean we now have less than 3 million wishlists. But the wishlists have been increasing with the sales, so we still have over 3 million," added Bender. "It has basically built wishlists back up as quickly as it's converted them, so it's going to have a long future."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Bender, fostering longevity is about encouraging players to hop aboard when the time is right–even if that means waiting for future discounts or the full launch. "I did the thing in business school they tell you not to do, but I told players more discounts are coming," he said. "But we don't mind [customers] waiting. We don't want them to experience regret."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can hear more from Bender, including his thoughts on the use of "fundamentally stupid" recoup clauses in publishing deals, by checking out </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hooded-horse-co-founder-says-publishers-should-ditch-horrible-recoup-clauses-to-help-devs">another excerpt from our interview</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

<p data-characters="332" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-is-the-next-monopoly-go-partner-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Monopoly GO’s</em> latest Partners event</a>, Robo Partners, is here for the next five days. During this event, you’ll pair up with up to three other players and collect points to build a robot. As you reach certain milestones, you’ll receive rewards, ranging from a few hundred dice to a Wild Sticker and exclusive token. </p> <h2 id="h-all-monopoly-go-robo-partners-event-rewards-and-milestones" data-injectable="false">All <em>Monopoly GO</em> Robo Partners event rewards and milestones</h2> <p data-characters="393" data-current-count="393" data-injectable="false">From now until May 21, <em>Monopoly GO’s</em> Robo Partners event allows you to win five milestone rewards with each partner and a final grand prize after completing all four robots. While the first tier gives you 200 dice per partner, they scale quickly, with the last milestone providing over 400 dice and a four-star sticker pack. Below is a complete list of every Robo Partners event reward. </p> <figure data-found-rows="6" data-current-count="933" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Event Milestone</th><th data-align="center">Points Needed</th><th data-align="center">Rewards</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">2,500</td><td data-align="center">200 Dice</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">2</td><td data-align="center">8,500</td><td data-align="center">Cash</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">3</td><td data-align="center">21,500</td><td data-align="center">Cash<br>200-300 Dice<br>Cash Boost</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">4</td><td data-align="center">48,000</td><td data-align="center">300-500 Dice<br>Three-Star Sticker Pack<br>High Roller</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">5</td><td data-align="center">80,000</td><td data-align="center">Cash<br>400-600 Dice<br>Four-Star Sticker Pack<br>15 minutes of Cash Boost</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Grand Prize</td><td data-align="center">320,000<br>(All four spots complete)</td><td data-align="center">5,000 Dice<br>Robo Penguin token<br>Wild Sticker</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="258" data-injectable="false">Since you can receive each prize up to four times, you can get a minimum of 9,400 dice, eight sticker packs, and one Wild Sticker if you complete the entire event, making participating worthwhile if you have friends or family that actively play&nbsp;<em>Monopoly GO.</em></p> <h2 id="h-how-to-find-partners-for-the-robo-partners-event" data-injectable="false">How to find partners for the Robo Partners event</h2> <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true">Finding partners during<em> Monopoly GO’s</em> Robo Partners event requires heading into the event’s menu, picking one of your empty spots, and inviting someone to join. If someone has already asked you, you’ll find options to accept or decline their offer. Otherwise, you’ll find your list of friends here, whom you can invite and await their response.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="586" data-injectable="true">Alternatively, you can invite random players to join through this menu. However, there is a chance they won’t participate at all, so be careful with who you ask to join you in the event. You also can’t remove partners once they accept your invite, so your choices are final.</p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-score-points-during-the-robo-partners-event" data-injectable="false">How to score points during the Robo Partners event</h2> <p data-characters="461" data-current-count="461" data-injectable="true">Scoring points during Robo Partners requires collecting event tokens and spinning your Partner spot points wheel. As you gain tokens, you can select one of your Partner event robots to find your and your partner’s current points alongside a points wheel. You’ll gain a random number of points by spinning this wheel, contributing to your milestone progression. You can also change your multiplier to earn more points&nbsp;by&nbsp;using more tokens per spin.</p>
 <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false">To gain more tokens for the Robo Partners points wheel, you must participate in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/monopoly-go-all-safari-sprint-tournament-rewards-and-milestones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tournaments and banner events</a>, finish your daily quick wins, and redeem shop gifts. Over time, you’ll gain hundreds, potentially thousands, of tokens to use during the Partners event, allowing you to claim its milestone and snowball your progress.</p>

<p>Despite a notice on the PlayStation Store that said an internet connection would also be required to play the game, Ubisoft has confirmed <em>this</em> is not true, and the entire game can be played offline. </p><p>Nowadays, Ubisoft requires an online connection to install its recent games.

It looks like PS2 game Star Wars: The Clone Wars will join PS Plus next month.
</p>
<p>
As spotted by PlayStation Store price tracker <a href="https://psdeals.net/us-store/game/2774293/star-wars-the-clone-wars">PS Deals</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/05/ps2-emulated-star-wars-the-clone-wars-listed-on-playstation-store">Gematsu</a>), the game will release on 11th June and will likely be part of the next wave of classics available to Premium subscribers.

</p>
<p>
This version of the game will include new modern features, including up-rendering, rewind and quick save functions, and custom video filters.

<p>
Reads the store listing description: "This title has been converted from the PlayStation 2 version to the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 consoles and provides newly added features. Consequently, there may be times where the title plays differently from the PlayStation 2 version, or where some features may cause the title to not function properly. This version does not support the PlayStation 2 console's peripherals, therefore some functionality may not be available."
</p>
<p>
It will also feature offline multiplayer for two players.
</p>
<p>
Star Wars: The Clone Wars released on PS2 in Europe in 2003, alongside similar releases on GameCube and Xbox.
</p>
<p>
Developed by Pandemic Studios and published by LucasArts, it's set during the prequel era and has players controlling both vehicles and popular heroes for its single-player campaign. Multiplayer included four player splitscreen, plus an online mode for the Xbox version.
</p>

Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-headlines-playstation-plus-premium-and-extra-games-for-may">Sony revealed the next wave of games hitting the PS Plus subscription next week</a>, including Red Dead Redemption 2.

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-is-pulling-its-own-blockbuster-game-from-ps-plus">Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition will leave the service on 21st May</a>, leading to speculation a PS5 version could be on the way.
