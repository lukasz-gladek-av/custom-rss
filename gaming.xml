<p>Nintendo's biggest release of the month (the <em>year</em>?) arrives tomorrow, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> finally Morph Ball rolling onto Switch 1 and 2. But with the new hardware still comparatively fresh on store shelves and the holiday season right around the corner, you might be wondering which system is <em>the</em> place to play Samus's latest adventure on.</p>
<p>Here to shed some light on how each version holds up is the above comparison video from the sublime Mr. Alex Olney. As you'll see, the footage shows a direct comparison between the Switch 1 and 2 releases, and the latter's beefed-up specs are immediately obvious.</p>
<p>The side-by-side gameplay showcases Samus in a whole range of environments, demonstrating how the game holds up whatever you throw at it. While fps is no issue for the older console, there's something about the 4K resolution bump on Switch 2 that really sings when put in direct comparison.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn't to say that the Switch 1 version provides a 'bad' experience in any way. We had the following to say about the S1 release in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/metroid-prime-4-beyond">our 8/10 review</a>: "It plays very well at a very solid 60fps in both docked and handheld, but after getting used to seeing Viewros in stunning 4K (or an internal resolution approaching it), it’s surprising how much the art direction seems to have been built with this in mind".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>IO Interactive is quickly approaching the launch date for what has been described as the peanut butter and chocolate of video games: IO Interactive behind a new James Bond game. 007 First Light will <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-march-2026-james-bond/">arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on March 27, 2026</a>, and leading up to that launch, IO Interactive has kicked off a new series of videos on the game's YouTube channel called Beyond the Light, going behind the scenes of the game's development.</p>



<p>The first episode of the series includes reactions and insights from the developers regarding gameplay, with IO Interactive's gameplay director on 007 First Light, Andreas Krogh, and senior level designer Thomas Pulluello featured in the episode.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Beyond the Light Episode 1 - Gameplay Dev Reacts &amp; Insights #earnthenumber" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rL2hzHtdW38?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>A little over a week ago, as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-xbox-partner-preview-thursday/">Xbox's Partner Preview event</a>, IO Interactive confirmed that 007 First Light will <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-007-first-light-trailer-shows-off-bonds-stylish-wheels/">feature Bond with his iconic silver Aston Martin Valhalla</a>, decked out to the nines with spy gear, courtesy of Q. </p>



<p>Now with the release of this first Beyond the Light series, it's clear that the studio is ramping up towards the launch of its first brand-new major release since 2021, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hitman-3-steady-hand-trigger/">when Hitman 3 first launched</a>. As far as what comes after 007 First Light, just yesterday, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hitman-devleoper-confirms-new-game-is-coming-007-only-external-ip-studio-would-work-on/">the studio confirmed that it does have another new game in the works</a>.</p>



<p>Not an external IP, but a new internal property it's working on. This is another new title in addition <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-confirms-long-rumored-online-fantasy-rpg/">to the fantasy role-playing game</a> that the studio is working on, for which we don't yet have a title. There will also be more Hitman coming, which means that, including 007 First Light, the studio currently has three projects in the works.</p>



<p>Hopefully, by this time next year, we'll start to hear more about what the studio is working on, since by that point it'll have First Light out the door and can start looking towards what's next.</p>

Granted, there isn’t much to actually do, since it’s mostly about what you’ve already listened to. You can’t go back in time and listen to a more obscure song than your friends, or retroactively listen to more horror audiobooks.

              <p>McDonald’s released its new holiday meal, and there’s some good (and tasty) news for fans of the fast-food chain’s French fries. Thanks to the Grinch, McShaker fries are finally going to be available in the United States</p> <p>On December 2, <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-stories/article/the-grinch-meal-coming-to-mcdonalds.html">McDonald’s new limited-time-only Grinch Meal became available around the country</a>. The Christmas-themed meal, which comes with a pair of limited-time festive holiday socks, is packaged in special bags featuring the Grinch and contains a medium drink, 10 McNuggets or a Big Mac, and some Dill Pickle “Grinch Salt” McShaker Fries. It’s that last item that has some fast-food lovers excited.</p> <p><a href="https://mcdonalds.fandom.com/wiki/Shake_Shake_Fries">McShaker Fries appear to be a US version of Shake Shake Fries,</a> a concept that has been around for many, many years in places like Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Taiwan. The fries have also popped up for limited runs in Canada, the United Kingdom, as well as India. Shake Shake Fries come packaged with a seasoning packet and a bag. You dump the fries and seasoning into the bag, close the top, and, well, as the name implies, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Hj_6TvmsEwI">shake it a few times</a> to cover the fries in tasty dust. The concept has never made its way to the United States until now.</p>

 <p>Early reactions to the Grinch’s dill pickle McShaker Fries are pretty positive, with people hoping McDonald’s keeps the concept around past Christmas and maybe even expands on it with some of the flavors found in other parts of the world. Personally, I’m not a pickle guy at all, so these fries sound awful, but I’m excited to see Shake Shake Fries brought over to the US, even if it is part of a Grinch-themed bundle.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as you are already here and reading about limited-time fast-food meals, <a href="https://news.bk.com/blog-posts/burger-king-r-invites-guests-to-dive-into-a-sea-of-flavor-with-all-new-spongebob-tm-movie-menu">Burger King announced a new <em>SpongeBob</em> movie menu</a>. This menu includes a slice of pie and a real Krabby Patty. It also comes in some delightful-looking SpongeBob-themed packaging that will no doubt be sold for $50 or more on eBay by the end of this week.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-switch-2-comparison-graphics-2000650153</link>

              <p>If you’ve ever worn glasses, then you know this feeling well: Pop on your lenses and, bam, the world is in HD. That’s not a bad way to describe the difference between <i>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</i> running on the original Switch vs. the new Switch 2.</p> <p>Having shipped on both consoles, <i>Metroid Prime 4</i> is a <i>prime</i> opportunity to get a sense of the clear technical differences between Nintendo’s newest console and its last-gen hardware. Sure, we know the Switch 2 is powerful, flexing its GPU muscles with <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> and some <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-port-gameplay-comparison-ps5-xbox-fps-ubisoft-2000649204">excellent ports of demanding open-world Ubisoft games</a>. But <i>Metroid</i> is a first-party exclusive, so it’s a great opportunity to see the differences when <i>just</i> Nintendo’s hardware is the target.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-port-gameplay-comparison-ps5-xbox-fps-ubisoft-2000649204">Ubisoft’s Becoming The King Of Switch 2 Ports</a></p> <p>The result? The Switch 2 damn sure renders a pretty picture for our gal Samus’ latest adventure. That said, the OG Switch, while it has a softer image, still looks and runs well enough. The load times though…yeesh. <a href="https://youtu.be/mMc1oik78Vc">This comparison video</a> from ElAnalistaDeBits shows the differences in motion:</p>

  <h2>Switch 2 has a crisper image, and performance mode looks slick</h2> <p>Switch 2 on both quality and performance modes shows a clear advantage when it comes to a higher resolution and clearer images. The performance mode is a touch softer, but you’re trading a bit of fidelity for 120 frames per second. And if you don’t think a framerate that high is worth it, as a former skeptic of anything higher than 60 FPS being worthwhile, I must tell you that you’re wrong.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000650159" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650159"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650159">© Screenshot: Nintendo / ElAnalistaDeBits / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Switch 1 ain’t nothin’ to sneeze at…but you’re gonna wanna grab a coffee while it loads</h2> <p>If you’re like me and all you have laying around is an original Switch, <i>Metroid Prime 4</i> doesn’t look too terrible. And it runs at 60 FPS, which is swell. But perhaps the worst part of running the game on a classic Switch is you’ll be waiting a long time for it to load. The comparison video above shows a loading sequence that only takes the Switch 2 a mere 24 seconds, while the OG console loads in at over a minute and four seconds. Reminds me of playing <i>The Witcher 3</i> on PS4 (still had a great time! But man did I do a lotta waiting).</p>

 <h2>If you’re looking for an excuse to upgrade, <i>Metroid</i> might just be it</h2> <p>Sometimes ya gotta make due with the hardware you have. But if you’ve got some cash burning a hole in your pocket and you’re ready to step into Nintendo’s next generation, and you love <i>Metroid</i>, it seems like the Switch 2 version might make the upgrade worth it. As <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/metroid-prime-4-beyond"><i>Nintendo Life</i> puts it in their review of <i>Beyond</i></a>, once you see the “next-gen” version in motion, it’s hard to go back:</p> <blockquote><p>Playing this on Switch 1 when docked feels fine enough, but that crispness, that pop, that ludicrously intricate, high-contrast detail, it’s just a bit fuzzy and pixelly by comparison. I personally feel it’s almost the direct antithesis to <i>Pokémon Legends Z-A</i>, which actually felt as though the art style was more cohesive on the weaker platform. Textures have taken an understandable hit, and models that are further away can look quite smeary, but overall the game still looks good. I just can’t help but compare it unfavourably to Switch 2.</p></blockquote> <p>Again, given that the original console runs the game at 60 frames per second, I’d wager the experience of playing the game will still feel good enough, even if it’s a little soft compared to what the latest hardware can deliver. But what are upgrades for if we’re not getting prettier pixels? If you do snag&nbsp;<em>Metroid</em> for the OG Switch and end up acquiring a Switch 2 down the line, you can also upgrade the Switch 1 version to the prettier Switch 2 version for an extra 10 bucks.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Winter Offensive Update Details Revealed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-winter-offensive-update-details-revealed/</link>
            <guid>1371904</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 developers have revealed new details for the Winter Offensive update ahead of its arrival. </p>



<p>Developers of Battlefield 6 have been hard at work figuring out all the issues players have been facing in the title. The developers recently addressed their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-in-game-audio-issues-addressed-by-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in-game audio issues</a>, stating that they should be fixed with the next update. Now, the intel on the next major update has dropped.</p>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-winter-offensive-update-drops-on-december-9">Battlefield 6 Winter Offensive Update Drops on December 9</h2>



<h3 id="h-audio-improvements">Audio Improvements </h3>



<p>A new post on the BattlefieldComms account on <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1996248184381641171" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) dives deeper into Battlefield 6’s Winter Offensive Update. The first thing confirmed is the previously mentioned audio issues, which will be fixed. The devs are prioritizing important combat and vehicle sounds and performing a comprehensive pass on footsteps to improve clarity, distance definition, and positional awareness across the game. At the same time, they are working on performance and memory issues that could cause sounds not to play as intended. </p>



<h3 id="h-mode-adjustments">Mode Adjustments</h3>



<p>Next up is mode adjustments, both Rush and Breakthrough are getting significant updates after Battlefield 6 Winter Offensive arrives, focusing on improving attacker flow, reducing defender oversaturation, and tightening clarity around objectives. Breakthrough will see capture volumes and vehicle availability updated across several maps, and these changes have been guided by “feedback and internal data to help bring win rates closer together for both teams.”</p>



<p>Rush, on the other hand, will see adjustments to M-COM locations on the Manhattan Bridge and Liberation Peak to give attackers more reliable access and to smooth out the flow between sectors. Moreover, both modes will see multiple capture zones reshaped or clarified to help players understand where to contest or defend. Vehicle spawns have also been adjusted to reduce bottlenecks and remove frustration points. </p>



<p>Moreover, the developers have also made a range of quality-of-life improvements across UI clarity, minimap behavior, controller aiming responsiveness, and more. They will also be looking into the recent performance issues reported by players. </p>



<h3 id="h-combat-system">Combat System</h3>



<p>Some significant changes will be made to the combat system with Battlefield 6’s Winter Offensive update. Starting with hit registration and netcode, the new update will improve how bullet trajectories are aligned in fast-paced situations, including when shots are fired while transitioning into a zoom. The improvements will also correct inconsistencies that could affect hit registration and readability. </p>



<p>They have also made updates to handle high-density combat scenarios more reliably, ensuring bullets register more consistently when multiple players are fighting in close proximity. The issue where clients could briefly display specific pieces of geometry as intact even though they have been destroyed has been fixed. </p>



<p>Next, we come to soldier visibility: the upcoming Battlefield 6 Winter Offensive update has refined how visibility effects activate at close range, so that soldiers stand out more clearly in darker or low-contrast areas. Prone animations have been updated to include more subtle movement, improving the player’s visibility. They are also looking at improvements to lighting and exposure, especially in indoor-to-outdoor transitions and how characters read against complex environments.</p>



<p>Last but not least is weapon adjustments, and the new BF6 update will bring a wide range of improvements to weapon handling, including fixes towards first-shot accuracy, attachment behavior, and tuning across various recoil patterns and weapon categories. The new changes intend to deliver more predictable, consistent weapon performance in active combat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new Gacha system is set to arrive in Marvel Rivals, giving players the opportunity to pick up a range of fresh rewards at a reduced cost—provided luck is on your side.</p>



<p>For those unfamiliar, a Gacha system is a mechanic where players spend in-game currency to receive a random item from a predetermined pool. It’s a gamble, essentially: you might hit the jackpot, or you might walk away with something far less exciting. In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/envy-is-the-third-major-team-pulling-out-of-marvel-rivals-esports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a>, this new system appears to center  around a brand-new Psylocke skin, which seems to be the headline reward in the draw.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-gacha-system-revealed-for-marvel-rivals">New Gacha System Revealed For Marvel Rivals</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Better hope you pop the right balloon! Credit to NetEase.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Marvel Rivals is rolling out its first-ever Gacha bundle as part of Phase 2 of its First Anniversary Live Event, introducing a new way for players to chase cosmetics. This time, fans can spend in-game Units for a shot at unlocking a full set of new Psylocke cosmetics, but how much they’ll ultimately pay depends entirely on luck.</p>



<p>The system works on an escalating cost model: each pull increases in price. The first attempt is 100 Units, followed by 200, until all balloons in the Gacha are popped. The key twist, however, is that if a player hits the anniversary Psylocke skin early, every remaining reward is granted automatically. That means the entire bundle could cost as little as 100 Units—or, if fortune doesn’t cooperate, the full 2,400.</p>







<p>It marks a noticeable shift from Marvel Rivals’ usual cosmetic distribution methods. Traditionally, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus-players-can-grab-free-marvel-rivals-winter-soldier-cosmetics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skins and bundles</a> could be purchased directly from the store or earned through Season Pass progression. This new Gacha system offers a potentially cheaper but inherently riskier alternative, likely appealing to players who enjoy the thrill of chance. For others, the predictability of buying a skin outright may still be preferable.</p>



<p>Still, the ceiling is reassuringly familiar. With 2,400 Units matching standard store pricing for a full skin bundle, players can’t overspend—and there’s always the tempting prospect of paying far less than usual.</p>

            <guid>1371898</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The highly-acclaimed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> just added yet another accolade to its name — as it's now the biggest new third-party game launch on Xbox Game Pass in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/03/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-pass-biggest-launch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> the news today after examining data from every day one Xbox Game Pass launch this year, and ranking every third-party game by the number of unique users during its first 30 days of availability.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a hugely impressive achievement for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, the debut game from French studio Sandfall Interactive, for several different reasons. Firstly, because the game arrived just two days after Bethesda's The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered (which itself also launched via Game Pass). And secondly, because we already know that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sells-33-million-in-33-days-not-bad-for-a-game-some-thought-was-going-to-get-crushed-by-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">Clair Obscur went on to sell very well too</a> (5 million copies in five months) — something its launch via Game Pass does not appear to have dented.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"From being there to announce our game back in Summer 2024, to coming to the studio for the Developer_Direct video in January, Xbox helped us get the word out there and reach a lot of players," Sandfall creative director Guillaume Broche said in a statement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox Game Pass let "a lot of people try our game when maybe they might not have before," Broche continued. "The turn-based RPG genre has a lot of fans but sometimes it might put people who prefer more real-time action games off, but Game Pass lowered that barrier of entry. They could just try it and see how it feels. So a lot of curious players could start the game, explore Lumière and the early game, and realize there's a lot to enjoy here, even if they weren’t expecting it at first."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Review - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what was Clair Obscur's Xbox Game Pass competition? It's been a long year, so it's worth reminding ourselves of everything the turn-based RPG has beaten to become this year's biggest third-party Xbox Game Pass release. (And remember, this is separate to Microsoft's own first-party output, which will include Avowed and South by Midnight, as well as Bethesda games such as The Outer Worlds 2, and Activision fare like Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other third-party games that arrived day one via Microsoft's subscription service notably included the highly-anticipated Hollow Knight: Silksong, as well as the post-apocalyptic survival game Atomfall. The highly-acclaimed indie puzzle favorite Blue Prince also arrived this year, as did Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, Ball X Pit, and PowerWash Simulator 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Congratulations, then, to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 — something we may well be hearing a few more times this month, considering its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-collects-12-the-game-awards-nominations-the-most-in-the-awards-history">record-breaking number of nominations at The Game Awards</a>.

It will launch on December 18. <span id="more-1010963"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via Summitsphere:</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>The Demon Corp</strong> – This band of bastards has been rehearsing each day for the Big Tournament, and now it’s their time to shine. That’s right, FOUR new (smaller-scale!) boss fights against each member of the Demon Corp. Claim your Prize Star by defeating each of them and be granted early access into their big show!</li><li><strong>The Big Tournament: The Boss Rush</strong> – Danton has been laboring over day and night and has at last fulfilled his contract to bring the Big Tournament to life! Earn your Battle Pass and prepare to face <em>ANTONBLAST</em>‘s most grueling challenge: Face against the game’s nine major boss fights without facing a knock-out and claim your title of Tournament Champion! There is a big cash prize in it for the winner, too.</li><li><strong>The Lime Trials</strong> – The mysterious Lime Trials make their appearance. Defeat the big baddie of each wing of Brulo’s Casino, and you will be granted access to a new kind of timed challenge: Collect all Limes in the room before time runs out to recover the Souvenir Lime! And, if you feel like showing off after already collecting the Souvenir Lime, claim cash prizes especially if you beat your best time!</li><li><strong>New Game Modes</strong> – As promised to our supporters, our Hard Mode and Stage Rush Mode will finally make their appearance. In Hard Mode, face the challenges of <em>ANTONBLAST</em> with little extra help and stricter, harder stages and bosses. Satan’s troops are a little more prepared this time! In Stage Rush, blast through the twelve stages and eight bosses of the <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,741 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">Adventure</a> campaign as fast as you can! Hard Mode will automatically unlock for any players who have already cleared the first stage in game; Stage Rush will automatically unlock for any players who have defeated the Final Boss. But, could there be more…?</li><li><strong>Danton</strong> – Now that Danton’s work around the Casino is mostly finished, you will find him perusing the area. Feel free to talk to him, he’s really happy about it!</li><li><strong>New Soundtrack and Sound Work</strong> – Our updated <em>ANTONBLAST</em> soundtrack will be wholly replacing the existing tracks in the game. Furthermore, we have extensively touched up our sound design and have totally rebalanced and adjusted the soundscape of the game to prevent audio clipping and other nasty artifacts. The result is the game won’t be as ear-piercingly loud, meaning you can get a much cleaner view (hearing?) of what is actually going on at any given moment in the game and don’t need to turn the audio down so low. It is a much more pleasing experience on everyone’s ears. We have also shifted some sounds around, but you’ll have to play the game to hear the difference!</li><li><strong>New Trinkets</strong> – Brulo’s Shop has been restocked with various new items, such as the Virtual Visor, Game Brick and Pet Paint (harmless, non-toxic). <a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> Anton and Annie’s Adventure under… a different light.</li><li><strong>New Spray Cans</strong> – Sixteen new Spray Cans have been added, bringing the total to 110. Most will be hidden, strewn around Brulo’s Casino and Peanut Park, so be sure to be look around carefully!</li><li><strong>New Achievements</strong> – Four new achievements for you to figure out and, well, achieve! Discover the secrets of Peanut Park and engage with the new stages and boss fights and (re-)claim your Perfect title on <em>ANTONBLAST</em>!</li><li><strong>New Language Support</strong> – That’s right, you will be able to experience the glorious text and interface of <em>ANTONBLAST</em> in a total of eight languages: English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Latin-American Spanish and Brazillian Portuguese. We hope our more international Blasters appreciate and enjoy the work our community localizers have put into the game!</li><li><strong>Lots of Bug Fixes</strong> – I mean, I hope you’re not surprised about it! The team has put TREMENDOUS work into polishing up <em>ANTONBLAST</em> into being the best game ever. We hope it reached that standard now!</li><li><strong>And More!</strong> – There is a lot more that you will see that we have not talked about here. It will all be made clear… in THE END.</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>ANTONBLAST</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > Switch [18,041 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> and <a title="Platforms > PC [24,926 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1887400/ANTONBLAST/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, and is <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/antonblast-coming-to-ps5-ps4-in-2026">coming to PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4</a> in 2026.</p><!-- AD: content -->

While accepting his wins, the game's leading boss Ryozo Tsujimoto shared his conviction that Monster Hunter is still popular among players and he doesn't see any need for the franchise to stop.</p><p>"Of course, we don’t intend to stop the series here," Tsujimoto told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/of-course-were-not-going-to-stop-here-monster-hunter-developers-talk-about-the-future-of-the-series-at-playstation-awards" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>.

However, Monster Hunter's dismal $47.9 million worldwide box office has seemingly killed any prospect of a sequel.</p><p> Tsujimoto didn't offer any specific updates regarding new Monster Hunter titles, but he reiterated that Monster Hunter Wilds will still be getting updates.</p><p>"Monster Hunter has the characteristics of a title that gets regular updates, but player opinions were very helpful during the update process," wrote Tsujimoto. "And in order to make Monster Hunter Wilds better, the fans’ voices gave us power. There are still updates left to come, so we will continue to do our best."</p><p>During an earnings call for investors in April, Capcom claimed that Monster Hunter Wild's sharp fall-off in sales be address after the first month may have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5s-high-price-is-impacting-monster-hunter-wilds-sales-capcom-exec-says/1100-6534430/" data-ref-id="1100-6534430">due to the high price of a PS5</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Skyblivion Is Officially Delayed to 2026; It Will Be a ‘Living Project’ with Features Like Spellcrafting Possibly Coming Post-Launch]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-officially-delayed-2026-will-be-living-project-features-coming-post-launch/</link>
            <guid>1371868</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It was January 2023 when the Skyblivion team originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-total-conversion-mod-officially-set-for-2025-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> its targeted 2025 launch window. Throughout the past couple of years, the modders have <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-now-on-its-final-stretch-release-still-planned-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stuck to their schedule</a>, maintaining that they would be able to bring the ambitious total conversion project to fruition by the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Today, though, Project Lead Rebelzize <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC6W0htYBOc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared a video update</a> to confirm that won't happen, as there are simply too many things left to do. The complete fan-made recreation of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in the engine of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim will, therefore, be released at some point in 2026.</p>



<p>The good news is that the game is in a great state, and many aspects are complete or nearly complete. The world map, for example, was troublesome to implement but is now 100% finished, including all unique regions, realms, and the Oblivion Deadlands. Skyblivion fans can now get a glimpse of it through an interactive satellite-style map, <a href="https://skyblivion.com/map/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now live on the project's website</a>.</p>



<p>All quest dungeons are also complete, rebuilt with new layouts, bespoke boss encounters, and unique quest rewards; only a handful of random dungeons remain unfinished. Most interiors, such as houses, shops, castles, stables, chapels, and inns, are ready. However, many Imperial City interiors are blocked until the city's 3D asset set is finalized, with the expectation to complete all locations by the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Indeed, the Skyblivion team outlines the Imperial City as the single largest remaining content challenge. Quest implementation is progressing somewhat smoothly, but is still partially blocked by the remaining work needed in the Imperial City. The goal is to finish quests by Q1 2026, leaving time for playtesting and iteration before launch. Once the Imperial City, navmesh, quests, and core systems like alchemy, spells, perks, and crafting (which should be feature complete by the end of 2025) are wrapped and polished, the modders believe the project will finally be ready for its targeted 2026 release. All other major cities, like Anvil, Bravil, Bruma, Cheydinhal, Chorrol, Leyawiin, Skingrad, and the ruined Kvatch, have been implemented.</p>



<p>The User Interface (UI) is still under development. The team has moved toward a more Skyrim-like interface, with function and consistency taking precedence over aesthetics, although a custom reskin may be implemented later. Core UI work is expected to be done by the first quarter of 2026.</p>

<p>The Skyblivion team is even developing a large final fight cinematic between Akatosh and Mehrunes Dagon, handled by professional animators, but production is bottlenecked by manpower in rendering, set dressing, VFX, and destruction simulation. Rebelzize calls out for volunteer specialists in those areas to apply so the cinematic can reach the desired quality. If you have such expertise and are willing to help, contact the team <a href="https://skyblivion.com/volunteer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">through this form</a>.</p>



<p>Not all features will be included in version 1.0. For example, underwater combat has been cut due to major conflicts with animation mods, although it may be reintroduced at a later date. Indeed, Rebelzize described this as a living project, which will continue to be refined with bug fixes, but also expanded with the original Oblivion DLC (Shivering Isles, Knights of the Nine), and with additional features like spell crafting, dynamic dungeons, grave-robbing, more creature variety, followers, weapons, armor sets, and more. </p>



<p>Overall, it's sad news for those who still wished to play Skyblivion during the Holidays. However, even professional games are always prone to delays, let alone volunteer projects like this one. Moreover, Bethesda <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did release the official Oblivion Remastered earlier this year</a>, so those who really want to explore a modern version of the classic roleplaying game already have a way to do so.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders was Reportedly the Best-Selling Game on Steam For November 2025, Over 7.7M Copies Sold Overall]]></title>

			<p>A new report from <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/novembers-best-selling-steam-games">Alinea Analytics</a> has ARC Raiders listed as the number-one best-selling game on Steam for November 2025 by copies sold, and has now reached 7.7 million copies sold across all platforms. It's the latest sign of how Embrak Studios' third-person extraction shooter continues to be one of the biggest games of the year.</p>



<p>This comes after Alinea Analytics reported that ARC Raiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-reportedly-closing-in-on-7m-copies-sold/">had sold nearly 750K copies in the week of November 16-22</a>, and that it had sold at least half of all its copies sold on Steam, with the other half coming from PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles.</p>



<p>It's far and away a bigger game than Embark Studios' free-to-play title, The Finals, particularly on Steam, where ARC Raiders is surpassing <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2073850/charts/">The Finals' peak concurrent player count</a> as <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/">part of its daily player numbers</a>. Its continued success is also interesting to follow <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-ceo-claims-we-should-assume-every-game-company-now-using-ai-game-devs-say-no/">as the conversation around generative AI in game development builds and evolves</a>.</p>

<p>That said, we're still in what you'd call 'the early days' for a multiplayer game. It's up to Embark to keep this momentum going now, and we'll know by next year if ARC Raiders has truly carved itself a piece of the multiplayer shooter pie, depending on where it stands at the one-year mark.</p>



<p>Elsewhere on the Steam charts, November was dominated by indie games. RV There Yet? reportedly came second behind ARC Raiders for copies sold in November 2025, with 1.9 million. Peak followed it with 1.4 million copies sold, which was then followed by Dispatch at 1.1 million, and rounding out the top five was <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-duckov-enjoys-spec-quackular-launch-with-1-million-units-sold-in-five-days/">Escape from Duckov, the Escape from Tarkov parody</a>.</p>

<p>While it's still to be determined if ARC Raiders will maintain its current spot as the multiplayer game to beat, Embark Studios can enjoy the game receiving its commercial flowers, especially since it doesn't look like it'll get its critical ones this year.</p>



<p>It missed out on Game of the Year nominations for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">Golden Joysticks</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">The Game Awards</a>, and in the latter it only carries one nomination for best multiplayer game. The conversation around 2025's best game is engulfed by the likes of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Hollow Knight Silksong and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. We'll know which game comes out on top in just a few days from the time of this writing, with The Game Awards kicking off on December 11, 2025.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[An unsettling indie game about horses keeps getting banned from stores]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/837278/horses-banned-steam-epic-games-store</link>
            <guid>1371862</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Horses</em>, a first-person narrative horror game, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/santaragione.com/post/3m6zgqun5us2f">was banned from the Epic Games Store</a> just hours before it was set to launch on December 2nd. Then, a day after launch, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-the-upsetting-horror-game-previously-banned-on-steam-gets-last-minute-ban-from-epic-games-store-too">the Humble store banned it as well</a>. The decision shocked the developers at Santa Ragione, makers of the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/reviews/saturnalia-review/">critically respected <em>Saturnalia</em></a>, as these storefronts were the homes they’d found for their game two years before it was preemptively banned from Steam.</p><p>Valve and Epic say <em>Horses</em> violates their sexual content policies. Humble hasn’t yet said why it banned the game after hosting it for several hours post-launch. However, Santa Ragione claims neither Epic nor Valve has clearly explained what exactly in the game is objectionable, and that these decisions have put the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-extremely-frustrating-and-also-fcked-up-one-of-the-worlds-best-indie-studios-is-facing-shock-closure-following-confounding-steam-ban">in peril of shutting down</a>. The back-and-forth has catapulted <em>Horses</em> from a little-known prestige indie title to the next battleground in the fight between game storefronts, indie developers, content policies, and creative expression.</p><p>Though all the action kicked off late last month, <em>Horses</em>’ story officially began two years ago. In <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/index.html">a lengthy FAQ</a>, the developers explained that in 2023, <em>Horses</em> was rejected during Steam’s review process without explanation. “Steam’s policy grants broad discretion to refuse titles without providing detailed explanations. In our case, they simply stated they could not legally distribute <em>Horses</em> without clarifying why,” the FAQ reads.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unsettling-horror-game-horses-banned-from-steam-leaving-studio-with-high-risk-of-closure">In an interview with <em>IGN</em></a>, Pietro Righi Riva, one half of the team at Santa Ragione, said that the ban might have been caused by a scene involving a man and his daughter visiting a ranch where the titular “horses” are humans wearing horse masks. The daughter wants to ride one of the horses, which the player facilitates. “What followed was an interactive dialogue sequence where the player is leading, by a lead as if they were a horse, a naked adult woman with a young girl on her shoulders,” Riva said.</p><p>He said that scene was part of a rough demo sent to Steam to satisfy the platform’s request for a playable build so <em>Horses</em> could get a “Coming Soon” page. Riva said that, ultimately, the character was changed in the final build. “We have since changed the character in the scene to be a twenty-something woman, both to avoid the juxtaposition and more importantly because the dialogue delivered in that scene, which deals with the societal structure in the world of <em>Horses</em>, works much better when delivered by an older character.”</p><div><p>“Our requests for review and appeal were denied over and over.”</p></div><p>The studio stresses that Steam never explicitly explained why <em>Horses</em> was banned nor responded to any of Santa Regione’s follow-up appeals and communications. “For two years we asked for clarifications and a path to compliance, but we were directed to Steam’s general guidelines and our requests for review and appeal were denied over and over,” the FAQ reads.</p><div><p>In November, after Santa Ragione <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/santaragione.com/post/3m6ht5yj3ss23">shared <em>Horses</em>’ release date</a> and the reason why it wouldn’t be sold on Steam, Valve finally responded. A <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-it-is-scary-humiliating-and-patronising-santa-ragione-facing-closure-after-horses-barred-from-steam">statement to <em>gamedeveloper.com</em> read</a>:</p></div><p>“After our team played through the build and reviewed the content, we gave the developer feedback about why we couldn’t ship the game on Steam, consistent with <a href="https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/tmWlCn5YzpcKpL21nF9fACJhfDX?domain=partner.steamgames.com">our onboarding rules and guidelines</a>. A short while later the developer asked us to reconsider the review, and our internal content review team discussed that extensively and communicated to the developer our final decision that we were not going to ship the game on Steam.”</p><p>The studio says the Steam ban put the company in financial peril, as it “completely erased our ability to find an external supporting publisher or partner to fund the rest of the game as no one in the industry considers an indie game that cannot be released on Steam to be viable.” Though the developers were able to continue work on <em>Horses</em> through investments from friends, unless the game’s a hit, they say the studio will shut down.</p><p>In the two years since <em>Horses</em>’ ban from Steam, Santa Ragione found several new homes for the game, including Itch.io, GOG, Humble, and the Epic Games Store. <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1994406374273318952?s=20">In a post on X</a>, DRM-free storefront GOG said, “We’re proud to give Horses a home on GOG, giving players another way to enjoy the game. We’ve always believed that players should be able to choose the experiences that speak to them.” Humble, however, banned the game shortly after its launch there and has not responded to a request for comment.</p><p>None of those stores has near the market share of Steam, but among them, Epic’s has the most name recognition — making its last-minute ban a major blow.</p><p>As with Steam, Epic didn’t explain what in <em>Horses </em>triggered the ban, only referring to the policy on inappropriate and hateful / abusive content and the fact that games rated AO, or Adults Only, could not be distributed on EGS. (<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-games-store/requirements-guidelines/content-ratings/content-guidelines">Unless it’s an NFT / blockchain game, of course.</a>)</p><p>“We immediately appealed their decision through all suggested channels,” the developers’ FAQ reads, adding that when <em>Horses </em>was submitted to the ESRB for rating, it received an Mature rating (ages 17 and up), which is, as of this writing, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/horses-004d87">still prominently displayed on the game’s EGS page</a>. Epic did not respond to a request to clarify the age rating discrepancy or the timing of the ban, referring instead to the statements Santa Ragione shared in its FAQ.</p><p>Santa Ragione is very clear about the kind of content <em>Horses </em>contains. The lengthy content warning <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/index.html">on the game’s website</a> lists “physical violence, psychological abuse, gory imagery (mutilation, blood), depictions of slavery, physical and psychological torture, domestic abuse, sexual assault, suicide, and misogyny.” It also makes sense that, out of an abundance of caution, Steam would ban the version of the game it saw with the father-and-daughter scene.</p><p>“The scene is not sexual in any way, but it is possible that the juxtaposition is what triggered the flag,” Riva told <em>IGN</em>. But what makes less sense is the platform’s refusal to reevaluate the game or at least explain its reasoning. “We believe Steam intentionally keeps its policy opaque so it does not have to stand by clear rules and can adjust decisions to whatever best serves the platform at a given moment,” reads the FAQ.</p><p>According to Santa Ragione, Epic’s ban is even more confusing. It said EGS had a more complete version of the game for two months, “with the final achievements-ready build being approved for release 18 days prior to launch.” Epic’s decision to ban<em> Horses</em> reads like decision-makers getting scared in light of all the attention on the game.</p><p>In spite of all this, <em>Horses</em> still is available, and the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-review">smattering</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horses-review">reviews</a> have been mostly positive. But with large storefronts having significant power over games and studios, the reception may not be enough to keep Santa Ragione alive. The studio says that the combination of the Steam ban and the money it owes investors “puts us in a completely unsustainable financial situation unless the game somehow recoups its development costs.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/837278/horses-banned-steam-epic-games-store]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/wd-5tb-my-passport-falls-to-0-02-per-gb-as-amazon-goes-no-margin-on-storage-deals-post-cyber-monday-2000649736</link>
            <guid>1371853</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’ve been banging the drum for deals on reliable, large-capacity portable HDDs for a long time now. Honestly, going without one is really like doing a high-wire act without a net, because having only the one copy of your most sensitive and essential files that lives on your laptop or desktop leaves you one mishap away from losing them forever.</p>
<p>Cyber Week’s one of the best opportunities to get protection for your irreplaceable data, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6185/">one of the best deals still on the board is this one at Amazon on the 5TB version of the WD My Passport external hard drive, which is just $121</a>. That’s a 16% drop from the regular $145, and it’s a stellar price for an external drive with this sort of capacity and reliability from a trusted brand like Western Digital — in fact, it’s the world’s first 5TB 2.5-inch portable hard drive. Be sure to click the black model of this palm-sized drive — inexplicably, the blue and red ones are still running at full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6185/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ransomware Protection</h2>
<p>External HDDs tend to be fairly static devices, aside from shrinking in physical size and growing in capacity. Beyond that, the features have remained mostly the same. Except now, WD has added software to the My Passport HDD that includes robust protection against the ever-growing and constantly evolving threat of ransomware.</p>
<p>A virus or malware can get into not only your laptop or desktop but also into its peripheral devices, including your portable hard drive. Once there it can install ransomware, which locks you out of your files until you pay a ransom to the hacker. The Acronis True Image for Western Digital software preloaded on the My Passport HDD not only helps you schedule automatic backups, it helps protect your entire system from ransomware, and also allows you to password-protect and give your files 256-bit AES encryption.</p>



<h2>Smaller and Faster</h2>
<p>The WD My Passport HDD comes preformatted for Windows, but can easily be reformatted for use with Macs without losing any of its protective features. WD’s given it a slimming-down from its previous models too – this streamlined version of the My Passport is just 3.21 by 4.33 inches, and exceedingly slim, so you can fit up to 5TB of your most essential files in your pocket to take with you anywhere, and its footprint at your desktop or work station is virtually nil.</p>
<p>It connects via USB-A 3.0, but it’s also compatible with USB-A 2.0 devices, and the 5Gbps data transfer speed allows you to move files to or from your PC or Mac laptop or desktop computers quickly and easily. It can be set up for automatic backups, and is also drag-and-drop ready from the time you connect it.</p>
<p>Those digital photos and videos on your computer need protection in the form of a large-capacity, fast, ultra-reliable backup drive that fits in your pocket and comes with advanced protection. So do your financial records and other sensitive personal information. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6185/">The WD My Passport 5TB portable external hard drive — the world’s first 5TB 2.5-inch drive — checks all those boxes, and it’s a great Cyber Week find at just $121 at Amazon.</a></p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Back in October, three weeks out from its release date, Yacht Club Games' first completely new game since the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shovel-knight">Shovel Knight</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a>, was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mina-the-hollower-catches-a-delay-nebulously-beyond-its-previously-seasonally-appropriate-release-date">indefinitely delayed</a>. It still doesn't have a release date, and now in a new report and interview with the studio, it's sounding like the success of Mina is a "make-or-break" moment for Yacht Club Games.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-02/creator-of-hit-game-shovel-knight-is-at-make-or-break-moment">Bloomberg</a>, noting how pivotal it is that Mina does well, studio head Sean Velasco explained that "If we sold 500,000 copies, then we would be golden. If we sold even 200,000, that would be really, really great. If we sold, like, 100,000, that’s not so good." Right now the big thing Yacht Club Games want to avoid is having a repeat of working on Shovel Knight, which in 2014 saw the founder working for months without paychecks.
</p>
<p>
Velsaco did say that "If Mina flops, we'll still be around," so it's not complete doom and gloom, but did note that they would certainly "need more money." Money is kind of the big, obvious issue in the games industry at the moment. Even very notable names like Ron Gilbert are struggling to get funding, with his unnamed Zelda and Diablo inspired RPG having been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/that-zelda-ish-diablo-ish-rpg-monkey-island-designer-ron-gilbert-was-working-on-has-unfortunately-been-canned">canned due to publisher disinterest</a>.
</p>
<p>
The indie scene isn't quite what it was like in 2014 when Shovel Knight first launched. These days it's all <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-are-there-so-many-bloody-roguelikes-or-roguelites-and-what-really-makes-a-game-roguish">roguelikes out the wazoo</a>, very replayable genres that keep people invested for lengthy periods of time, and safer bets than retro throwbacks like Mina the Hollower. Not to mention just how many games come out on Steam every day now. It's a rough time to get someone to tune in in this attention economy.
</p><p>
This report also lined up another potential casualty in this whole affair: that 3D Shovel Knight game that has thus far only been teased. Yacht Club Games had been split into two teams, one for Mina the Hollower, the other this new Shovel Knight. But by 2024 the studio laid off some employees, pausing development on the 3D take on Shovel Knight to focus on Mina. It does sound like at least the studio founders are looking at the game again, but for now, things are a little uncertain for Yacht Club Games.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a>, the massive mod remake of Oblivion in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>'s engine, won't be making its previously announced 2025 release goal, the team behind it have confirmed. Instead, the mod'll be coming out at some point in 2026, giving the team behind it extra time to overcome the final few hurdles and get it polished up.</p>
<p>This news comes a few months after ex-Skyblivion level and world designer Dee Keyes called the 2025 release goal the mod's team set in 2023 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/Kyle%20'Rebelzize'%20Rebel">"pointless and unachievable"</a>. Keyes also accused Skyblivion project lead Kyle 'Rebelzize' Rebel and implementation lead Heavy Burns of rushing the project out the door and mismanaging communication within the team, subsequently sharing more of his perspective on the project in a <a href="https://lynn.gamer-network.net/content/rockpapershotgun/content-article/edit/news/2384155?tab=overview">video interview with RPS sister site Eurogamer</a>. In a response to Keyes' original claims, Heavy Burns asserted that "many of the statements in his post are either misrepresented or just untrue".</p>

<p>That brings us to now and the above video, in which project lead Rebel announces the delay and offers some info on the mod's current state. "Despite the game being in the best state it's ever been, we still have some last challenges to overcome that are going to require a little bit more time," the modder said. "This is something we have known for a while, but we did not want to announce a delay without also sharing our current plans and ambitions for the release of the project.</p><p>So, how's it doing? Well, first of all the creation of its world map is "100% finished", with the team having just released an <a href="https://skyblivion.com/map/">interactive satellite version</a> on their website, so you can scroll around and see what their version of Cyrodiil looks like. Most of the dungeons are done, as are most of the building interiors, though the latter's with the exception of the Imperial City, with that being the last bit of the province which the modders need to pull together. </p>
<p>Their current aim's to have it done by the end of 2025, so quests can be finalised and remaining bits of navmeshing done early in 2026. Navmeshing, for the uninitiated, is the setting up of frameworks which allow NPCs to roam around places without bumping into everything. The modders also have playtesting of mechanics planned for early next year.</p>
<p>"As we move closer to the release date, the goal will be to spend as much time as possible polishing, balancing, and fixing our game for you guys to finally play," Rebel added. "There's no real deadline for this, as I expect we will be working on this until the day of release." Once the mod is out of the door, the lead also mentioned plans to add in some features which haven't made it into the current version, including spellcrafting, dynamic dungeons, and grave robbing. Underwater combat's had to be cut for now, but the modders also hope to potentially add that in down the line.</p>
<p>Hopefully the extra time makes delivering Skyblivion a bit more comfortable for the group, given Keyes' accusations. I'll still be interested in giving it a go whenever it emerges from the Imperial sewers, given the in-depth approach the modders look to have taken in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivion-project-lead-says-release-date-reveals-finally-getting-closer-as-oblivion-remake-mod-shows-off-revamped-intro">reimagining The Elder Scrolls 4</a> with a lot more tweaks and additions than Bethesda's Oblivion Remastered.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I waited over a decade for Raichu to get a Mega Evolution, so I sympathize with anyone who has a beloved Pokémon they’re hoping might get one in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> upcoming </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC. Now that my favorite electric rat has not just one, but </span><i><span>two </span></i><span>Mega Evolutions, the title for “most oppressed Pokémon fan waiting for a Mega Evolution” now goes to the Flygon stans, and they’re really going through it.</span></p> <p><span>Flygon was first introduced in </span><i><span>Pokémon Ruby </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Sapphire</span></i><span>, and the dragon/ground-type beast has been a fan favorite ever since. It’s easy to see why. The insectoid dragon oozes cool while also being kinda cute in that uniquely </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> kind of way. He is very </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJk3wrvL6To"><span>“friend-shaped”</span></a><span> and also a powerhouse in battle, giving him all the makings of a generation of fans’ favorite critter.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Flygon was famously one of the Pokémon originally slated to get a Mega Evolution in the 3DS era when the mechanic was introduced, only for the idea to later get </span><a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2015/04/mega-flygon-excluded-from-xyoras-because-of-artists-block"><span>scrapped because Game Freak couldn’t nail down the design</span></a><span>. With </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>bringing back Mega Evolution and introducing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-lucario-z-2000649602"><span>new forms for old monsters</span></a><span>, Flygon fans have been crossing all their fingers hoping that the long-lost Mega might finally make its grand debut.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But every time Game Freak announces a new Mega Evolution that isn’t for Flygon, the light continues to dwindle from their eyes.</span></p>     <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="pt" dir="ltr">Flygon vendo Lucario ganhar a segunda mega: <a href="https://t.co/I6Emz5f7hw">pic.twitter.com/I6Emz5f7hw</a></p> <p>— Vida de Treinador (@VidaDeTreinador) <a href="https://twitter.com/VidaDeTreinador/status/1995871382920724580?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="pt" dir="ltr">Mega flygon está oficialmente MORTO<br>Não vai ter nem na DLC <a href="https://t.co/ENLLqkB9km">pic.twitter.com/ENLLqkB9km</a></p> <p>— rayquaza, pokemon até namorar #Chronoverso (@azarco91) <a href="https://twitter.com/azarco91/status/1977865459157356882?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>What makes this even more painful is that there was a brief flicker of hope in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><span>first trailer for the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span>, which showed a portal filled with Mega Stones, one of which appeared to have Flygon’s color scheme, but thus far, no Mega has materialized in the DLC’s promotion.</span></p>   <p><span>Unfortunately, with each new reveal seemingly confirming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-evolutions-2000641670"><span>previous leaks</span></a><span> that don’t include Mega Flygon, it seems like the dream is well and truly dead. Unless Game Freak brings back Mega Evolutions in another decade? Maybe the third time will be the charm. I don’t know if Flygon fans can handle another big setback</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Toshiba 50″ Smart Fire TV Goes Into Clearance Mode at 51% Off, Amazon’s Deeper Post–Black Friday Discount Move]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/toshiba-50-smart-fire-tv-51-off-clearance-black-friday-2000649749</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Entertainment upgrades don’t have to blow your budget; if you know where to look. The biggest shopping events of the year – aka Cyber Monday and Black Friday – are officially behind us, but not all deals have expired. We’re still spotting plenty of great discounts across a range of categories, so whether you missed grabbing a new TV or a tech gadget, there’s still a chance to save.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3815/">Right now, Amazon is offering an unbelievable 51% discount on the 50-inch Toshiba Class C350 Series LED 4K smart Fire TV</a>. It typically sits at $350, but this discount brings its price down to just $170. The offer is open to all shoppers, meaning both Prime and non-Prime members can snap it up. Even better, there are no delivery charges to worry about, so you’re saving a bit on that front, too. There’s a catch, though. The discount is selling out fast, so there’s not a lot of time left to save. Lingering deals such as this one are hardly around for a couple of days before getting back to their original price. If you’ve been looking to bag a smart screen for less, now is the time to act.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3815/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Brilliant Visuals</h2>
<p>The 50-inch size isn’t massive, but also not too small. It’s ideal for bedrooms, smaller living areas, and anyone who is not a fan of screens taking up an entire wall. Toshiba packs it with its revolutionary REGZA Engine ZR, which uses precise analyzing technology. The Super Contrast Booster maximizes the depth of picture color, keeping it as accurate as possible. This is paired with the brand’s exceptional AI upscaling technology, which, instead of replicating every pixel, detects the colors of neighboring pixels. It then considers the detailed texture of the real sight to decide a color for each pixel. Translation? You’ll enjoy every moment on the screen with the clarity of 4K quality.</p>
<p>Blur is actively reduced during fast-paced sequences with Ultimate Motion. There’s also a Game mode, which supports a whole bunch of gaming features, such as ALLM (Auto Low Latency Mode), VRR (Variable Refresh Rate), and eARC. Combine this mode with Ultimate Motion, and you’ll be able to play your favorite titles in a much smoother manner; great for those upcoming holiday game nights. Visuals are only part of the experience, though. Sound matters just as much, and for that, the TV supports Dolby Atmos for a realistic, room-filling audio. You won’t just get to see your favorite scenes coming to life; you’ll experience them in a realistic way.</p>



<p>Fire TV support brings all your favorite content and streaming platforms to a single place, so you’re never going to be out of stuff to watch. Think Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Disney, Peacock, and more. Most of these require subscriptions, but if you’re not a fan of that, you can always access plenty of free, ad-supported platforms through it just as well.</p>
<p><span>To wrap it up, if you’ve been looking to grab a brand new display without shelling out big bucks, now is a good time to make the move. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3815/">This deal takes a whopping $180 off its retail price, bringing it down to a much more affordable range.</a> Just make sure to grab yours fast, as discounts such as this one don’t last too long.</span></p>

                <p>Sony's popular and longrunning professional baseball series, MLB The Show, is expanding to a new place: mobile. A new version of the game "built from the ground up" for mobile is headed to iOS and Android, with a test coming up soon in the Philippines before a global rollout later.</p><p>The regional test for the Philippines begins today, December 3, but there is no word yet on when the game will be available in more places. This kind of limited, regional rollout is common for mobile games.</p><p><a href="https://theshowmobile.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A FAQ</a> for The Show's mobile version confirms it is a standalone game that will not support cross-play with the console editions. The game is optimized for iPhone 16 or "comparable devices" in the Apple family, along with Samsung Galaxy S25, Sony Xperia V, or "comparable" phones.</p><p>Check out the trailer below to get a first glimpse at how the pro baseball game is being adapted for mobile.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctcq_G3UclA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ctcq_G3UclA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The minimum technical specifications can be seen below, and they note that iPads and tablets are not supported. The game's "soft launch" period will allow people to buy in-game currency, Stubs, and unspent Stubs will carry forward to the full release.</p><p>However, unopened purchased packs and player items will not carry over, but will instead be converted into a currency that players can use in the game's "Loyalty Shop" at launch. Additionally, "most progress and content" that players unlock in the game during the soft launch will be wiped.</p><p>For years, MLB The Show was exclusive to Sony's PlayStation family of consoles. But that changed in 2021 when MLB The Show 21 was released on Xbox, in addition to PlayStation. The following year's game, MLB The Show 22, came to Switch in addition to the other console platforms.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mlb-the-show-26-announced-with-first-details/1100-6536016/" data-ref-id="1100-6536016">MLB The Show 26 is the newest entry in the series</a> and it's coming in 2026, presumably timed to release around the start of the next MLB season.</p><h2><strong>MLB The Show minimum technical specs for mobile</strong></h2><p><strong>iOS</strong></p><ul><li>Minimum Processor: A13</li><li>Minimum RAM: 3GB, Recommended RAM 4 GB</li><li>Minimum Operating System: iOS 26</li><li>Supported Devices:  <ul><li>iPhone SE 2nd Gen and 3rd Gen</li><li>iPhone 11 and above (iPhone 17 Pro Max)</li></ul></li><li>No iPads</li></ul><p><strong>Android</strong></p><ul><li>Minimum Processor: MediaTek Dimensity 9200 (Mali G715)</li><li>Minimum RAM: 4 GB, Recommended RAM 8 GB</li><li>Minimum Operating System: Android 12 Snow Cone (SDK 31)</li><li>No Tablets</li></ul>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> has agreed to halt all promotion and public testing of Light of Motiram - the post-apocalyptic open-world survival game Sony previously accused of being a "slavish clone" of PlayStation's Horizon series in a lawsuit - as the two companies battle it out in court.
</p>
<p>
Light of Motiram, developed by Tencent's Polaris Quest studio, emerged at the end of last year, and its accompanying images - featuring mechanised animal-like creatures and very Aloy like key character art - immediately <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-open-world-survival-game-looks-like-a-blatant-horizon-rip-off-with-added-palworld-elements">drew comparisons with Horizon</a>. And Sony agreed, mounting legal action against Tencent, who it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sues-tencent-over-slavish-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">accused of copyright and trademark infringement</a>.
</p>
<p>
Since then, we've had a bit of back-and-forth - Tencent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-responds-to-sony-lawsuit-against-slavish-horizon-clone-stating-its-claims-of-originality-are-startling">accused Sony</a> of seeking an "impermissible monopoly on genre conventions", a claim Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-fires-back-at-tencents-nonsense-defence-for-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">called "nonsense"</a> - and Tencent even went as far as to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-quietly-updates-slavish-horizon-clone-light-of-motirams-steam-page">quietly update Light of Motiram's Steam page</a> to tone down the more "egregious" Horizon similarities. But the lawsuit rumbles on.

<p>
Sony wants the court to block Light of Motiram from sale when its legal hearing gets underway next year, but in the interim Tencent has agreed to keep the game out of the spotlight. As <a href="https://thegamepost.com/tencent-promote-light-of-motiram-run-public-tests-sony-horizon-lawsuit-2026-hearing/">reported by TheGamePost</a>, Tencent this week submitted a new California court filing agreeing there will be "no new promotion or public testing of Light of Motiram" while Sony's injunction request is being argued. This is part of a deal in which Sony will give Tencent more time to respond to its injunction motion.
</p><p>
"SIE requested, and the Tencent Entities agreed, that (a) the extended briefing schedule and later requested hearing date will not be used to argue that SIE delayed in seeking a preliminary injunction," the filing reads, "(b) there will be no new promotion or public testing of Light of Motiram during the pendency of the Motion for Preliminary Injunction, (c) the Light of Motiram release will not be moved up to before Q4 2027, and (d) the Tencent Entities will not seek expedited discovery in connection with the Motion for Preliminary injunction".
</p>
<p>
TheGamePost notes Sony and Tencent have jointly requested the court hearings - covering both Sony's injunction request and Tencent's motion to dismiss the lawsuit - be moved to the same day in January next year.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has received both netcode and hit registration improvements ahead of the Winter Offensive update, which is set to go live on the 9th December.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1996248184381641171?s=20">Announced in a Battlefield Comms post</a>, the developers have stated that work continues to enhance both components of online play. This is especially noteworthy as issues surrounding both online netcode and hit registration have been points of frustration for some players since launch.</p>
<p>"We are continuing to build on our work to make hit registration feel consistent, reliable, and predictable during every engagement," the post states. "With this update, we have improved how bullet trajectories are aligned in fast-paced situations, including cases where shots were fired while transitioning into a zoom. These improvements correct inconsistencies that could affect hit registration and the readability of where your shots were landing. We have also made updates to better handle high-density combat scenarios to ensure bullets register more reliably when multiple players are fighting in close proximity."</p>

</figure>
<p>In addition, the new Battlefield 6 update has included additional gameplay adjustments to better the overall experience of getting into a firefight. The post elaborates: "In parallel, we have tightened the clarity of damage feedback so that health UI changes and damage cues feel more immediate and easier to understand during combat. While this is separate from Netcode itself, improving how damage is presented plays a key role in making hit registration feel responsive and intuitive.
</p><p>"Lastly, we have resolved an issue where clients could briefly display certain pieces of geometry as intact even though they had already been destroyed on the server. Fixing this eliminates cases where incoming damage could appear to pass through walls."</p>
<p>Other improvements include a general tweak to soldier visibility. There have also been adjustments to various weapons including changes to weapon-handling, first shot accuracy and more. Certain game modes include Rush and Breakthrough have also been altered to improve the attacker flow, aiming to stop oversaturation when it comes to defending objectives.</p>
<p>Finally, the post pledges further improvements to "clarity, responsiveness, and fairness in combat". So it seems as though this continued string of gameplay shifts from EA and Battlefield Studios won't be stopping anytime soon.</p>
<p>This update comes shortly after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-was-cheater-free-in-roughly-98-of-games-after-launch">EA revealed that close to 98 percent of games post-launch were cheater free</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-flounders-battlefield-6-free-for-a-week">a week-long free-to-play offering that allowed folks to try the military FPS out without breaking the bank</a>.</p>

<p>Various other quality-of-life features and improvements have been introduced as part of this update as well, including the ability to restart races or skip to the next race in the pause menu for the VS Race mode (in single-player, of course), as well as altered course layouts for various tracks between major courses.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Mario Kart World</em>, it's the latest game in the <em>Mario Kart </em>series, as well as the main launch title for the Nintendo Switch 2, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c11b67d9-d8b1-4556-871d-041c5101dcf0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">arrived back in June</a>.</p><p>Unlike its predecessors, the game takes an open-world approach, allowing you to explore the areas between its courses and hunt for optional challenges to complete.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which reveals exactly how much of EA the Saudi Public Investment Fund will own after the recent acquisition goes through, and it turns out it's not an insignificant percentage.</p><p>According to a filing seen by the Wall Street Journal (via <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/saudi-arabia-will-own-93-4-percent-of-ea-after-buyout" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Game Developer</a>), the Saudi PIF will own 93.4% of EA following the buyout, with fellow purchasers Silver Lake and Affinity Partners scoring 5.5% and 1.1% of the publisher respectively.</p><p>In case you need a reminder, it was announced back in September that EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-could-go-private-powered-by-saudi-and-private-equity-money" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">would go private</a> thanks to a buyout from the three aforementioned companies, who acquired the storied publisher for an eye-watering $55 billion (although that's still not the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-buys-activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-staying-as-ceo" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ca03cb11-0e22-42e4-bb57-2d2f082d977b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">most expensive gaming acquisition in history</a>, of course).</p><figure role="group">

<p>After the acquisition was announced, EA was quick to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-creative-control-sale-saudi-arabia-silverlake-affinity-partners?utm_campaign=email-post&amp;r=2ov77y&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">assuage fears</a> that the new buyers would affect its creative direction, with the publisher claiming that it will "maintain creative control" after the purchase and that its "track record of creative freedom and player-first values will remain intact".</p><p>However, concerns remain around the involvement of the Saudi PIF in EA's business, especially given that its chair, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2024/11/20/man-who-bought-world/rights-abuses-linked-saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">presided over</a> a number of <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/projects/saudi-arabia-kingdom-of-repression/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">human rights abuses</a> in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Still, EA isn't the only pie in which the Saudi PIF has its proverbial fingers. Others include <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/niantic-scopely-sale-games" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e6689aac-8eaa-48c0-8d94-17b0503eec20" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Niantic</a>, the developer behind <em>Pokemon Go</em>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-pif-becomes-nintendos-largest-outside-shareholder" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="50e39fd5-7ec3-478c-beba-17ca57c82457" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Nintendo</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-arabia-pif-adds-stakes-in-capcom-nexon" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="46a762d4-47ce-48d7-bfd7-7975e6c98413" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Capcom</a>, and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-pif-buys-1-billion-stake-in-embracer-group" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ab671b09-1a39-4525-9aa9-265f9efd8734" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Embracer Group</a>, to name but a few.</p><p>There don't appear to have been any major changes in creative direction among those companies since the PIF invested in them, but since the fund has a majority stake in EA, things could well be a little different in this case.</p><figure role="group">

<p>EA will, however, likely be hoping that the new investment can boost its financial performance a little, especially given the underperformance of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0c1c6926-0cf4-46ae-b617-dfc9e08b91de" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">some of the studio's biggest titles</a> recently.
