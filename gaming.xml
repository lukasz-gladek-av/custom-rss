            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-pro-plus-1tb-microsd-memory-card-with-adapter-is-now-15-cheaper-than-black-friday-pricing.1288731/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If there is one thing that anybody with one or several tech devices will never say no to, it’s more storage. Think about it: Everything from your smartphone and tablet to your laptop, digital camera, handheld gaming console — even your drone if you’re an enthusiast (like us) — they’re all just as good as their amount of memory allows them to be. That’s why this limited-time deal at Amazon is so universally appealing: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3897/">Save 35% off the price of the Samsung PRO Plus microSD 1TB memory card and adapter and boost your storage for just $75.</a></p>
<p>Samsung’s title as the World’s #1 Flash Memory Brand has been going strong for 22 years now, going all the way back to when 8GB thumb drives were&nbsp;<em>the</em> giant-capacity devices to have. This Samsung PRO Plus microSD card is 125 times bigger than that in capacity, and comes in a much smaller package. Times have changed for sure, but Samsung’s reign as the top flash memory brand is still in effect, which makes this Amazon deal even sweeter.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3897/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Blazing Speed</h2>
<p>Throw it back to 2003 again for just a moment and recall what it was like to move huge files onto a portable storage device. You’d drag and drop, and then go make yourself something to eat while periodically checking in on that bar graph window to see how much longer you had to wait. The Samsung PRO Plus microSD card reads data at 180 MB/s and sequentially writes it at 130 MB/s, so make that sandwich to go, because you won’t be waiting long.</p>
<p>As for storage size, just how big is a terabyte? Enough for 47 hours of 4K video, or nearly 160 hours of full-HD video, or 437,298 4K photos, or 654,480 HD photos. Chances are, you may never actually fill this $75 storage beast, but if you do, those read-write speeds will come in incredibly handy. And you can fill, empty, and refill the PRO Plus microSD card over and over again, because despite it’s amazingly minuscule size, it’s built to last. Samsung made it to withstand water, extreme temperatures, magnets, x-rays, and drops, which is why so many photo and video pros swear by them for live outdoor shoots.</p>



<h2>Universal Appeal</h2>
<p>You can take the Samsung PRO Plus microSD out into the wild in a digital camera, GoPro or other action camera, or drone, but it’s certainly just as much at home in your home. Smartphones and tablets, laptops, home security systems, and handheld gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch (not the Switch 2) all benefit from the extra storage of the 1TB microSD card. The format is nearly universal.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve established how far an extra terabyte of memory in a near-universal format goes and in how many devices, this Amazon limited-time deal taking 35% off the price of the 1TB model of the Samsung PRO Plus microSD card looks even better. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3897/">The Samsung 1TB PRO Plus microSD card is just $75 right now at Amazon, down from its regular price of $115.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/mindseye-hitman-io-interactive-roadmap-update-metacritic-2000623129</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hitman-maker-distances-itself-from-disastrous-mindseye-launch.1288728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>MindsEye</em> is one of the worst-reviewed games of the year, and IO Interactive published it. In fact, it was the <em>Hitman</em> maker’s first outside publishing deal ever. How did things go so wrong? The studio’s CEO was finally asked to weigh in on the topic and he makes it sound like he doesn’t know either.</p> <p>“The initial talks we had with those guys were to support them,” Hakan Abrak, who’s been in charge of IO for nearly a decade, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/that-was-definitely-tough-right-ceo-of-mindseye-publisher-ioi-responds-to-disastrous-launch">told <em>IGN</em></a> recently. “We thought they had some great ideas and a great world in the background that they were building, and hopefully they’ll get the opportunity to show more of that in the future. And we just wanted to help them distribute the game.”</p> <p><em>MindsEye</em> had a sound pitch. Developer Build A Rocket Boy, led by ex-<em>Grand Theft Auto</em> producer Leslie Benzies, was making a user-generated-content-based metaverse called Everything, but pivoted to getting a smaller, single-player shooter out the door first. Following an ex-black ops guy with a brain implant that’s turning his world upside down, <em>MindsEye</em> sounded like an old-school action-adventure campaign with some modern AAA gloss.</p>

 <p>What it ended up being instead <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-review-bad-ps5-update-boring-open-world-pc-gta-1851785108">was a confusing and boring mess</a>. It’s one of the lowest-rated games of 2025 on Metacritic and has only 2,000 user reviews on Steam, around 70 percent of which are negative. As far as first-time publishing experiences go, it probably couldn’t have been any worse.</p> <p>“Well, that was definitely tough, right?” Abrak told I<em>GN</em>. “It was a tough reception. It wasn’t what they hoped for, and also what we didn’t hope for at IOI Partners. They’re working hard on turning that around to regain the trust of the gamers out there, and they have tons of potential and content they’re working on. So hopefully they’ll succeed with that in the future.”</p>

 <p>While Build A Rocket Boy has made promises, it’s also been <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-layoffs-refunds-steam-reviews-gta-everywhere-1851784902">undergoing post-launch layoffs</a> and playing <a href="https://kotaku.com/leslie-benzies-ex-gta-producer-mindseye-fail-saboteurs-1851785617">weird blame games</a>. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-devs-uk-workforce-of-around-300-receive-at-risk-emails-as-former-gta-lead-leslie-benzies-finally-addresses-staff"><em>IGN</em> reported</a> that Benzies took the opportunity on a rare video call with staff in July to accuse internal and outside actors of trying to sabotage <em>MindsEye</em>. The studio announced an updated roadmap later that month that includes more fixes to the game and its <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEyeGame/comments/1m8ykoy/july_update_from_the_studio/">upcoming <em>Hitman</em> crossover mission</a>.</p> <p>Worth noting is that at no point does Abrak talk about the partnership like it’s still ongoing. He talks about “we” at IO Interactive and “those guys” and “them” at Build A Rocket Boy. Even with the upcoming content you get the distinct feeling the <em>Hitman</em> team is ready to wash its hands of the entire thing and focus exclusively on its <a href="http://i/">upcoming 007 <em>James Bond</em> game</a> moving forward.</p> <p>Does IO plan to publish any other outside games after this? Abrak said, “That remains to be seen.”</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-new-protagonist-completely-changed-dlc-plans/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksong%E2%80%99s-new-protagonist-completely-changed-dlc-plans.1288722/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong’s DLC plans were tossed out thanks to the new protagonist, Hornet. </p>



<p>Team Cherry’s new game, which was finally released today, has been in development for 7 long years. The game started out as a DLC, but it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-hollow-knight-silksong-took-so-long-to-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grew larger than planned</a>, with the devs adding multiple towns, a deep quest system, and a world much bigger than the original games. Now, the developers have revealed one of the major factors that contributed to the game’s lengthy development. </p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-s-hornet-changed-everything-for-the-developers">Hollow Knight: Silksong’s Hornet Changed Everything for the Developers</h2>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/platformer/team-cherry-had-to-go-back-to-the-drawing-board-for-hollow-knight-silksong-for-one-simple-reason-hornet-being-taller-changes-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Team Cherry’s leads, Ari Gibson and William Pellen, explained how Hornet led to changes in Hollow Knight: Silksong’s DLC plans. Pellen explained that “Hornet being taller changes everything,” and the devs couldn’t do justice to the new playable character through just a DLC. </p>



<p>In Hollow Knight: Silksong, Hornet is able to travel much faster, jump higher, mantle or clamber onto ledges, and is generally more acrobatic than the previous protagonist. Hence, “the caves around her have to expand to accommodate her height.” Moreover, Hornet’s fighting is faster, and her competence led to a change in enemy design as well. “The core of the world is mainly a reflection” of this character and her nature “is echoed in the way the world is set up.”</p>



<p>If Hornet were straight placed in Hollow Knight’s world, she would be easily able to maneuver through the “would-be hazards,” and the extended attack range changes things as well. Silksong, on the other hand, brings “greater focus on aggression, decisive action, and proactive decision making.”</p>



<p>Gibson also elaborated that Hornet is half-bug, which not only makes the character more physical, but the world as well. Which means players will see “less glowy orb things, and magic bursts of light, and many more blades and traps.”</p>



<p>In other news, Hollow Knight: Silksong developers are offering <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-devs-offer-free-switch-2-upgrades-for-switch-1-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free Switch 2 upgrades</a> to Switch 1 players. Also, the game releases today. Here are the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-cherry-confirms-hollow-knight-silksong-price-release-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price details and release times</a>. What are your thoughts on Hornet changing Hollow Knight: Silksong’s DLC plans? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

Mooshies apparently has a very fun sense of humor, because a closer look at Cease &amp; Desist reveals lines that would never appear in an actual legal document from Nintendo: "Low key that mod do be sick though," and "Your mod too tough. Your Game &amp; Watch too different."</p><p>Mooshies was also behind the recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-smash-bros-melee-mod-inserts-a-2024-gaming-darling/1100-6534246/" data-ref-id="1100-6534246">Jimbo the clown from Balatro mod</a>, which put that character's skin over Mr. Game &amp; Watch. That mod was initially paywalled behind Mooshies' Patreon account, before it was subsequently released for free. It's unclear if Mooshies actually received any legal notification from Nintendo before releasing the new Cease &amp; Desist mod. Mooshies jokes that the Cease &amp; Desist skin is available for "10 morbillion dollars"--a direct yet humorous retaliation to the backlash the modder faced for locking the Jimbo the Clown from Balatro skin behind a paywall. He has <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/hello-paywall-137359387?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=join_link" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">since clarified</a> that "all mods will be free" but Patreon backers will receive early access to them.</p><p>Earlier this year, former Nintendo employees Krysta Yang and Kit Ellis suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-these-ex-nintendo-employees-think-super-smash-bros-melee-hd-will-never-happen/1100-6512664/" data-ref-id="1100-6512664">the publisher will never make Super Smash Bros.

            <p>Daily <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> News, a YouTube channel and Discord server that has been posting constant updates on Team Cherry's action adventure game Hollow Knight: Silksong, has said farewell after 1694 days of uploads.</p>
<p>The final video, which premiered as Hollow Knight: Silksong became available for sale and titled The End, the video featured a stop-motion skit sending the channel off with a face reveal of the host Araraura. It's peak early internet energy.</p>
<p>Over almost 1700 days, Daily Silksong news accrued 234,000 YouTube subscribers and a Discord community of thousands of dedicated fans, lurkers, and posters. The live premiere of the final Silksong news video had over 15,000 live viewers, with longtime watchers saying their farewells at the cusp of the game's release.</p>

<p>Daily Silksong News was a running gag that transformed into something larger than its original intent. The vast majority of the channel's uploads are brief, with host Araraura announcing there was no news. However, on the occasion when there was news, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkjebOOXbX4&amp;ab_channel=DailySilksongNews">both Araraura and the channel's community would erupt with energy</a>.</p><p>Speaking to Eurogamer, Araraura expanded on his feelings now that the journey was over: "It feels unreal in a way, I got so used to Silksong just being 'a game that's not out' now that it's about to be it almost feels like I'm about to experience something that was out of my reach for so long".</p>
<p>As for how he'll be celebrating the release of Silksong, Daily Silksong News host Araraua will hang around with his friends and community members until the game goes live: "[I'm] probably gonna watch the DSN finale with my friends and stay on VC until the very last minute before it comes out after that I'm gonna go full blackout mode and enjoy Silksong on my own. No commentary or streaming, just at my own pace".</p>

<p>The info was shared in a new update to the game's <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/octopathtraveler0/">Japanese website</a> (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/octopathtraveler0/">Nintendo Everything</a>), in which the dev posted an info table containing everything you need to know about the game on all platforms.</p>
<p>Fortunately, things are looking rather good for those with the latest Nintendo hardware. The Switch 2 version of the game will run at up to <strong>60fps</strong>, with a <strong>1920x1080</strong> resolution. The Switch 1, on the other hand, keeps things slightly lower and will play at up to <strong>30fps / 1280x720p</strong>. The site doesn't currently specify any handheld/docked discrepancies, so we might have to wait until release to see the differences in action.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jgrtsw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Another interesting addition to the performance table is the row that specifies how each version will fare in the game's town builder mode. The Switch 2 will allow up to 400 buildings to be placed in one area, while the Switch 1 edition will only allow up to 250.</p>
<p>For those wondering, this puts the Switch 2 version on the same level as the Octopath Traveler 0 PS4 release. The PS5 and Xbox Series X will muster up to 120fps at 3840x2160, with the opportunity to customise town with up to 500 buildings, while the Series S boasts 120fps at the slightly lower 1920x1080p with the same 500-buildings option.</p>
<p>It's always nice to get an idea of these numbers early, and the boosted frame rate and resolution should make the Switch 2 version play like a dream if the former runs smoothly — heck, look at how wonderful the first two games appeared on Switch 1.</p>
<p>Octopath Traveler 0 will launch on Switch 1 and 2 on <strong>4th December</strong>. Square Enix has announced that there are <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/octopath-0-is-a-game-key-card-on-switch-2-and-square-enix-has-no-plans-for-a-switch-1-upgrade-option">no plans for an upgrade path</a> between the two, and the S2's physical will arrive as a Game-Key Card (because of course it will).</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/geforce-now-gets-rtx-blackwell-update-next-week-unveils-busy-september-release-schedule.1288674/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This GeForce NOW Thursday, NVIDIA brings the highly anticipated news regarding the launch date of the RTX Blackwell update: the cloud servers will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-now-blackwell-rtx-5080-pc-like-latency-image-quality-install-to-play-new-games-same-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upgraded to GeForce RTX 5080-class hardware</a> (and improved CPU as well) on Wednesday, September 10. </p>



<p>The rollout will be gradual as usual, so do not be alarmed if your nearest server isn't up to snuff yet. As noted <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-shows-off-significant-level-up-of-the-geforce-now-experience-at-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in our Gamescom 2025 preview</a>, there's a lot more than the GPU and CPU upgrade, though. Features like Cinematic Quality Streaming, Rivermax hardware packet pacing, L4S (Low Latency, Low Loss and Scalable Throughput), improved racing wheel devices support, and Steam's Install-to-Play are leveling up the experience in all regards: visuals, latency, hardware compatibility, and expanded games support.</p>



<p>On that note, GeForce NOW users can look forward to a very busy September featuring practically all the most anticipated PC game releases, starting this week with METAL EDEN, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Cataclismo, Hell is Us, and Cronos: The New Dawn.</p>



<p>Hell is Us and Cronos: The New Dawn support up to NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, so from next week, Ultimate subscribers who live near an RTX Blackwell-upgraded server will get to enable that. You can find our Hell is Us review <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hell-is-us-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and our Cronos: The New Dawn review <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, if you're interested in our take on these titles.</p>



<p>NVIDIA also shared the full list of GeForce NOW games scheduled to be added to the cloud platform throughout the rest of September:</p>



<ul>
<li>Firefighting Simulator: Ignite (New release on Steam, Sept. 9)</li>



<li>Borderlands 4 (New release on Steam and Epic Games Store, Sept. 11)</li>



<li>Fata Deum - The God Sim (New release on Steam, Sept. 15)</li>



<li>Dying Light: The Beast (New release on Steam, Sept. 19)</li>



<li>Jump Space (New release on Steam, Sept. 19)</li>



<li>Warborne Above Ashes (New release on Steam, Sept. 19)</li>



<li>Endless Legend 2 (New release on Steam, Sept. 22)</li>



<li>Baby Steps (New release on Steam, Sept. 23)</li>



<li>Aztecs: The Last Sun (New release on Steam, Sept. 23)</li>



<li>Lost Rift (New release on Steam, Sept. 25)</li>



<li>Cloverpit (New release on Steam, Sept. 26)</li>



<li>Predecessor (Steam)</li>
</ul>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-xbox-game-pass/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-dying-light-the-beast-coming-to-xbox-game-pass.1288665/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Xbox Game Pass is one of the pillars of subscription-based gaming services. With Dying Light: The Beast looking to cause an explosive ruckus, it would be apocalyptic if The Beast jumped over the odd rooftop to get onto Game Pass.</p>



<p>Dying Light is looking to unleash the animal in all of us with The Beast. The game is a sequel to Dying Light 2, and brings back long-time hero <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/techland-explains-kyle-crane-thirst-dying-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kyle Crane</a>. Techland has worked on the third full game, to the extent of delaying the horror title. The Beast resumes the series’ on-brand cocktail of parkour and dishing out pain.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> arrives during a busy September 2025. But if you’ve only got eyes for The Beast, you should know its Xbox Game Pass status in case you can save a penny or two.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-dying-light-the-beast-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Dying Light: The Beast On Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>There’ll be hell to pay for this. Credit to Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Neither Techland nor Microsoft has said Dying Light: The Beast is coming to Xbox Game Pass as either a day-one launch or as a freebie at some point in the future.</strong></p>



<p>It’s very telling if you approach a game’s release date and there’s nothing about <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Pass</a>. In 99% of cases, this means the game won’t be a day-one launch title. Xbox has had some third-party winners in 2025, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> and even the Soulslike <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a>.</p>



<p>However, unless you’re an Xbox Game Studios title, there’s a good chance you’re paying full whack for the game—as is the case with Dying Light: The Beast. It’s not had a Game Pass logo slapped onto any of its trailers, and the Xbox store listing doesn’t bat even the slightest eyelid at the prospect.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-dying-light-the-beast-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Dying Light: The Beast Come To Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>I’d say the chances of Dying Light: The Beast coming to Xbox Game Pass are pretty slim right now, given the franchise’s lack of history with the service.</strong></p>



<p>When you’ve enquired about enough games and their Xbox Game Pass chances, you learn a thing or two. I don’t think a Dying Light game has ever been on Xbox Game Pass. I can’t find the history of this, but Microsoft does have a habit of removing games after a while.</p>



<p>As of writing, you can’t find Dying Light or Dying Light 2 on Xbox Game Pass. That could be a big indicator of the game’s future on Game Pass. It’s not like these are niche indie titles after all. There have been rumors of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/game-pass-killed-by-first-party-development-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Pass being unsustainable due to first-party development costs</a>.</p>



<p>It’s one of those: If The Beast is announced for Game Pass, you’ll hear it from us first. On the other hand, I suggest keeping your expectations in check on this one.</p>

The forum, in particular, is a great way to engage with fellow Dying Light (and gaming in general) fans!</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) - Official Release Date Reveal | Trailer 2</p>
      </div>
<p>Before this, Ubisoft referred to Skull &amp; Bones as a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-ceo-defends-skull-and-bones-70-price-despite-its-live-service-leanings-calls-it-quadruple-a/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"AAAA" game</a>, a comment that led to many memes and jokes.</p><p>Lowrie commented on GTA 6 against the backdrop of Devolver considering whether or not it would delay some of its games to get out of the way of GTA 6 when it was planned for a 2025 release. He said GTA 6 was "blinding" when it came to the calendar. It remains to be seen if Devolver will delay any games due to GTA 6.</p><p>In a cheeky social media post, the company said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/devolver-re-commits-to-releasing-a-game-on-the-same-day-as-gta-6-after-delay/1100-6531291/" data-ref-id="1100-6531291">would, in fact, launch a game on the same day as GTA 6.</a> Devolver recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-latest-silksong-induced-game-delay-doesnt-hide-its-reasoning-in-new-trailer/1100-6534273/" data-ref-id="1100-6534273">delayed Baby Steps due to Silksong</a>, and while some have questioned that decision, Lowrie said he didn't want to gamble with people's livelihoods.</p><p>"You can't AB test reality," he said. "Maybe Baby Steps would've just been fine September 8, it could have been. But am I willing to risk this team's livelihood and the future of the game they've worked on for five years to see if they both work out? I'm not. And I also want to listen to what they want, and what they want is to have their own spotlight and I couldn't agree more."</p><p>Going back to GTA 6, Adam Lieb, the CEO of marketing platform Gamesight, told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-hollow-knight-silksong-is-this-years-gta-6-and-whether-a-juggernaut-stomping-on-your-release-date-really-matters" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that GTA 6 has had an outsized effect on calendars and planning for video game companies.</p><p>"I would say that GTA for the last year and a half has been a part of almost every conversation around launch dates I have heard," Lieb said.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-05-09/-grand-theft-auto-vi-delay-is-impacting-every-game-company" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg reported</a> that when GTA 6 was delayed to 2026, some studios with games set for Fall 2025--the previous launch window for GTA 6--embraced the news, with others scrambling to make decisions for their own 2026 games.</p><p>GTA 6 is expected to perform exceptionally upon release, with one firm predicting it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">sell 40 million copies and drive $3 billion in revenue in the first year alone</a>. The game has gigantic shoes to fill, as GTA 5 has sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4814">more than 215 million copies.</a></p>

            <p>Last year, Camouflaj and Oculus Studios released a Batman-flavoured VR release in the form of Arkham Shadows, and it looks like the teams are taking another bite of the apple.</p>
<p>During a recent interview with <a href="https://www.culturecombine.com/post/exclusive-interview-mark-rolston-talks-aliens-shawshank-and-spider-man-3-at-fan-expo-chicago-2025?ref=uploadvr.com">Culture Combine</a>, which was spotted by <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/batman-arkham-shadow-sequel-voice-actor-confirms/">UploadVR</a>, Commissioner Gordon's actor confirmed a sequel is in the works.</p>
<p>Actor Mark Rolston was chatting about his career, and the difference between approaching games such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a> and Spider-Man 2.</p>
<p>"In the Blade Runner game, I was a voiceover, but for Spider-Man, I do complete motion capture, voice, and everything," the actor told the publication, before slipping this little nugget of information into the conversation:</p>
<p>"Same thing with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/batman-arkham-shadow">Batman Arkham Shadow</a> VR game. We're about to start another one of those. I play Commissioner Gordon."</p>
<p>So, there you have it!</p>
<p>Our Ian rather enjoyed Batman Arkham Shadow in its release last year. "Batman Arkham Shadow can feel rough around the edges at times, but it's still a more than worthy entry to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-games-order">Arkham series</a>, and an essential Quest 3 experience," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Eurogamer's four star Batman Arkham Shadow review</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/i-played-more-crimson-desert-and-im-still-blown-away</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-played-more-crimson-desert-and-i%E2%80%99m-still-blown-away.1288626/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back at Summer Game Fest in June,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/crimson-desert-preview-jaw-droppingly-detailed-gameplay-depth" rel="nofollow">I played some <em>Crimson Desert</em></a> and my mind was blown with just how dense its systems were. At PAX West, I had the chance to play a near identical demo on a new build but with a different focus and learned so much more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Check out my previous preview linked above for information on the combat, as that is the same as what I experienced here. Suffice to say, it is complicated, dense, interconnected, and surprising.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>For The Sake of Immersion&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Interestingly, I was told they had four different people demoing the game at Summer Game Fest, each of them focusing on different aspects of the game to see how various previews would be written. Plus, they knew they would see some of us again at PAX West and other events, so they wanted to show us what wasn’t shown before.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So where I had been hyper focused on combat before, I now got to see a lot more of the little details in the world and focus on immersion in <em>Crimson Desert.</em> Like with the combat, how you interact with the world was given the same attention to detail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The best way I can convey that is by just giving you a bunch of examples of what I saw and was shown.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First, one thing the team wanted to boast about was that they have the largest mocap studio in Asia, and they put it to use on every animation in the game. From the idle stuff in the background to the insane wrestling moves in combat, everything started in the mocap studio.</p>



<p>That has led to a lot of deliberate movements that really sell what you see on screen. Two soldiers reacting excitedly to seeing your character, Kliff, a famous mercenary, comes across as genuine and real. Kneeling down to repair a wheel on a cart, kicking it on just looks right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is one of those things that sounds so boring to write out and talk about, but it’s one of those subtle things that you don’t notice but can have a big effect. There’s a big difference between clicking a button and suddenly the cart is repaired to seeing it put back together. In the latter, it feels like a real world and not a video game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That is the world the<em> Crimson Desert</em> team has put a lot of work into making. We spent a decent amount of time talking about that immersion and the small, seemingly insignificant details that all add up to sell the world to players.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Things like voices muffling and echoing when wearing a helmet that covers a character's face. That the skybox rotates during the day to change as the time of day changes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In one funny example, I was told that in another demo someone wanted to see if they could pick up the chickens that are running around. You sure can, and they learned the white chickens were picked up and held by their feet while you the lucky brown chickens are cradled in Kliff's arms. Something not even the demoer knew you could do.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>You Can Change the World Around You</h2>

<p>The most interesting thing I saw was in how ways you interact with the world logically affect the properties of certain things. For example, I caught a large wooden gate on fire and while it was still catching fire, I tried to smash through it with a big hit. The gate was too strong and withstood the attack.</p>

<p>It was explained to me that inanimate objects have a sort of damage threshold that needs to be hit first before any damage can be done to them, sort of like in <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After some time, the gate burned up completely and looked very different, all black and charred. I then tried to smash through the gate again with a big attack, and this time I broke on through.</p>

<p>The fire had not just changed what the gate looked like visually, it had weakened the material just like what would happen in real life.</p>



<p>It’s that sort of logical detail that is littered throughout<em> Crimson Deser</em>t that I think it will delight people for a long time. A lot of moments of “I can’t believe the game can do that” will happen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s so much granular detail that has been given a ton of attention and so many systems that all work together in a logical and intuitive way that the possibilities to do cool stuff are everywhere.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Being surprised by what is there is a big part of what they are going for with<em> Crimson Desert.</em>&nbsp;I saw that born out in this demo and my previous hands-on, as not only am I surprised at what the game could do so were the developers showing it off.</p>

<p>Part of keeping that surprise a big part of the game comes down to player choice. You have a ton of options in combat, how to move around the world, and just how to interact with all of the objects in it. I haven't seen much on the story or player choices that come into play there, but I can't wait to hear more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[IO Interactive Might Be Done with Third-Party Publishing After MindsEye]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-mindseye-third-party-publishing</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/io-interactive-might-be-done-with-third-party-publishing-after-mindseye.1288623/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>publisher IO Interactive has suggested that the game's disastrous launch may have made the studio think twice about taking on third-party publishing contracts in the future.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/that-was-definitely-tough-right-ceo-of-mindseye-publisher-ioi-responds-to-disastrous-launch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">to IGN</a>, IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak said that while his studio will continue to publish its own games, whether or not the IOI Partners label publishes any more third-party games "remains to be seen".</p>

<p>Just in case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>, which is the debut project from the "multinational" studio Build a Rocket Boy, was IO Interactive's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-publishing-ex-rockstar-thriller" rel="nofollow">first external publishing effort</a>, and it's safe to say the game's launch didn't exactly go as either studio had hoped it would.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mindseye-io-interactive-publishing-shooting.jpg?itok=JY2N_wf- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mindseye-io-interactive-publishing-shooting.jpg?itok=t0Om158X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>IO Interactive may think twice about third-party publishing after&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>was released earlier this year to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-launch-messy" rel="nofollow">roundly negative reception</a>, with its messy launch encountering widely-reported technical issues, leading to developer Build a Rocket Boy severing a planned sponsorship with streamer CohhCarnage, as well as PlayStation issuing rare refunds to players.</p>

<p>The launch of the game went so poorly that Build a Rocket Boy announced later that month that it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-build-a-rocket-boy-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">lay off over 100 employees</a>, which, according to an IGN report, constituted around a third of the studio's headcount at the time.</p>

<p>IO Interactive CEO Abrak described&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>'s launch as "definitely tough"; he said the release "wasn't what [Build a Rocket Boy] hoped for, and also what we didn't hope for at IOI Partners".</p>

<p>Despite that, Abrak says that Build a Rocket Boy is "working hard on turning that around to regain the trust" of disgruntled players, and that&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>has "tons of potential and content" in the pipeline. We'll have to wait and see if any of that comes to fruition.</p>




<p>IO Interactive's third-party publishing efforts may be on hold for the moment, but the studio is powering ahead with publishing its own releases, the next of which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/007-first-light-release-date" rel="nofollow">March's&nbsp;<em>007 First Light</em></a>. Here's hoping that launch goes better than&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>'s.</p>

              <p>Would you swap out your car’s motor for a nitro-burning drag engine if you could do it yourself and do it for pennies on the dollar? Of course you would, but unfortunately, unless you’re an automotive expert with a killer garage and a death wish, you can’t. But you can do the PC desktop equivalent of that kind of massive power upgrade — it’s easy, and while <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3896/">Amazon’s selling the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor for just $259 during a limited-time deal, it’s peanuts compared to the price of buying a whole new desktop rig.</a></p>
<p>This is a terrific deal for anyone looking to transform a blah PC desktop into a raging speed demon, but it’s especially great if you’re a gamer looking to upgrade a rig or are thinking about building your own from scratch. With 8 performance cores and 12 efficient cores, and that awesome max clock speed of 5.5GHz, the Intel Core Ultra 7 is begging to be the engine for high-end lag-free PC gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3896/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>More Than Speed</h2>
<p>The Intel Core Ultra 7 processor is compatible with Intel 800 Series Chipset-based motherboards, and supports PCIe 5.0 and 4.0, along with DDR5. It’s clearly a speed demon, with more than enough horsepower to blast your way through the most rugged action games and shooters, but those performance and efficient cores also let your PC run cooler, which means less power consumption and less chance of sustaining overheating-related damage.</p>
<p>There’s a significant brain upgrade with the Intel Core Ultra 7 too, in addition to all that brawn. Intel’s Ultra processor-based AI is the key to better streaming and gaming than ever before, with an NPU that takes on tasks like background removal and auto-framing and applies AI to them to create the smoothest gaming and streaming experience yet.</p>



<h2>Optimization Across the Board</h2>
<p>The Core Ultra 7 processor features Intel’s Application Optimization tech, a customizable way to devote more of the processor’s incredible power to the games and applications you want to give a max boost to. The user interface lets you see which games are optimized, and to turn it on or off for individual games as you see fit. Combined with Ultra processor-based AI, this is future-proofed gaming guaranteed, with the absolute maximum speed and performance always at the ready.</p>
<p>Buying an all-new PC desktop with this much power is an expensive proposition indeed, and now thanks to this limited-time deal at Amazon, it’s one you can skip entirely. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3896/">With the price of the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor slashed by 36%, all the way down to $259</a>, the smart choice is to perform a little DIY brain surgery on your existing PC, or build one around this monster processor.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/007-first-light-used-daniel-craig%E2%80%99s-likeness-for-first-demo.1288617/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>007 First Light developers have just confirmed that they used Daniel Craig’s head on Agent 47 to pitch the game.</p>



<p>007 First Light received its first gameplay yesterday at the exclusive State of Play event, along with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a>. Since then, players have begun forming impressions about the game, and the developers have also come forward to say it isn’t a “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-devs-insist-it-isnt-a-hitman-reskin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reskin</a>” of Hitman. Now, new details have been revealed about how Daniel Craig’s likeness was used when pitching 007 First Light. </p>



<h2 id="h-007-first-light-was-pitched-with-daniel-craig-s-head-on-agent-47">007 First Light Was Pitched with Daniel Craig’s Head on Agent 47</h2>



<p>IOI CEO, Hakan Abrak, confirmed during an interview with <a href="https://in.ign.com/project-007/240656/news/hitman-dev-io-interactive-put-daniel-craigs-head-on-agent-47-when-pitching-for-james-bond-game-007-f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that Daniel Craig’s head was placed on Agent 47 and put into World of Assassination when they demoed 007 First Light. Abrak reveals, “We actually did put Daniel Craig in there”, and they modeled his head and placed it instead of Agent 47. This was done for demo purposes only, to provide “an impression of what these living, breathing spaces mean in an IO game.”</p>



<p>Abrak adds that players who are familiar with a level called “Sapienza with the virus in the caves underneath the compound”, should know that some things were shown off there and “it was well received” The CEO explained that they were trying to convey that this is a “360 experience”, which is not just shooting and cutscenes, but also explores the “Bond Fantasy” in social spaces where the character needs to use his “charms and bluff” instead of his fists.</p>



<p>Abrak revealed that this was the first time they had worked on something other than original worlds and characters, and it was essential for them to put their “creative fingerprints” on it. They weren’t interested in “a gamification of a movie or maybe where it’s about technical prowess only, like pushing the pixels on Pierce Brosnan, for example, or just taking some bespoke scenes from a movie and realizing them in gaming.”</p>



<p>Instead, the developers want to create a “game for gamers” which brings players “a genuine Bond experience” where Bond is yet to become the world’s most famous spy and is still learning the ropes of the trade. </p>



<p>In other news, 007 First Light’s collector’s edition will&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-collectors-edition-will-set-you-back-300/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set players back $300</a>. Additionally, nsider Gaming received an exclusive&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-preview-hitman-as-james-bond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom Preview</a>&nbsp;for 007 First Light and “couldn’t stop seeing Hitman with a James Bond skin.” What are your thoughts on IOI using Daniel Craig’s likeness to pitch 007 First Light? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/round-up-pour-one-out-for-these-6-brave-games-launching-on-silksong-day</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/round-up-pour-one-out-for-these-6-brave-games-launching-on-silksong-day.1288605/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Other Games - Silksong Day" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/085fd316af72f/other-games-silksong-day.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>For many of you, today – <strong>4th September, 2025</strong> – will forever be known for one reason: the day that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> finally launched on Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>But of course, while Silksong will undoubtedly soak up a <em>heck</em> of a lot of attention, the day doesn't just belong to one game. In fact, there are quite a few titles launching on the Switch eShop, and we'd like to highlight a few that we think deserve a bit of attention.</p>
<p>Yes, the brave souls behind these games have decided, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/demonschool-gets-last-minute-delay-to-avoid-silksong">unlike others</a>, not to delay their intended release in order to avoid clashing with Silksong. That warrants the doffing of one's hat, if you ask us. We're not going to cover everything launching today, because frankly the Switch is still being bombarded with some rather questionable games, but there are definitely a few that are worth looking into.</p>
<p>So if you're <em>really</em> not keen on checking out Silksong, then perhaps one of the following might be more up your alley...</p>
<nav><ul><li><span title="On This Page"></span></li></ul>
</nav>
<h2 id="adventure-of-samsara"><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/adventure_of_samsara">Adventure of Samsara</a></h2>
<p>Atari's latest is a classic metroidvania that pays homage to the original <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/atari2600/adventure">Adventure</a> from the Atari 2600. Developed by Ilex Games, its heavy, slow-paced movement and combat are almost the exact opposite to Silksong's more free-flowing gameplay. Still, we thought it was decent and awarded it a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/adventure-of-samsara">7/10</a> in our recent review.</p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:186856 @ 1756991281 -->
<h2 id="camper-van-make-it-home"><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/camper_van_make_it_home">Camper Van: Make it Home</a></h2>
<p>One of our favourite games in recent weeks was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_bookshop">Tiny Bookshop</a>, which we described as the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/tiny-bookshop">"epitome of cosy"</a>. Camper Van: Make It Home looks to provide the same kind of vibes, albeit with a lot more focus on meticulously decorating and rearranging the interior and exterior of your camper van. It looks lovely, and a fine way to escape from the drab reality of life.</p>


<h2 id="dark-deity-2"><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dark_deity_2">Dark Deity 2</a></h2>
<p>Developer Sword &amp; Axe made a point of sticking to its guns and launching Dark Deity 2 alongside Silksong, and we commend such bravery. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dark_deity">The first game</a> was a lovely spin on <strong>Fire Emblem</strong>'s gameplay, and the sequel looks to take this even further. If you're into retro-inspired tactical RPGs, then this might be worth checking out.</p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:187061 @ 1756994462 -->
<h2 id="fling-to-the-finish"><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fling_to_the_finish">Fling to the Finish</a></h2>
<p>This one admittedly wasn't on our radar, but upon viewing the recent console trailer, it actually looks like a whale of a time. It's one of those multiplayer games where you have to work alongside a partner to reach the end of the level. The twist here is that you're literally tied together with an elastic band, and so you need to fling your partner up walls and across gaps to succeed. It's got local and online support with cross-platform compatibility.</p>

<h2 id="splatterbot"><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/splatterbot">Splatterbot</a></h2>
<p>Do you like <strong>Splatoon</strong>? Of course you do, for goodness' sake. Well, Splatterbot is remarkably similar in that you face off against up to three local competitors to make the most mess in each stage. So each player (or team) is designated a certain colour, and all you have to do is cover as much of the ground as possible while slamming into your enemies to knock them off-course. It looks awesome!</p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:169277 @ 1756993568 -->
<h2 id="mandragora-whispers-of-the-witch-tree"><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mandragora_whispers_of_the_witch_tree">Mandragora: Whispers of the Witch Tree</a></h2>
<p>Another action RPG to add to the list, Mandragora appeared on other consoles recently and has now joined the fray on the Switch. We're not completely sold on the visuals here, but the artistic design is solid and the gameplay looks like it could potentially scratch that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a> itch.</p>

<hr>
<p>So that's yer lot! Reckon we've missed anything here? Then let us know with a comment down in the usual place. And no, we're not including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> here; that one's big enough on its own thanks to Ubisoft and Disney. We'll have a review for you soon though, don't worry about that!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals Season 4 Brings Daredevil and More Next Week]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-season-4</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-season-4-brings-daredevil-and-more-next-week.1288599/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has revealed the start date for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Season 4, as well as the two heroes that will be joining the hero shooter's roster during this season.</p>

<p>The game's fourth season, which (naturally) follows on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-season-3" rel="nofollow">its third back in July</a>, will begin on September 12th. As usual, it's bringing two new heroes with it, one of which may be a little more obscure than the other.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals</em>' first new hero for Season 4 is none other than Matt Murdock, also known as Daredevil, who's sporting a characteristically flamboyant new design in keeping with many of the game's other characters. We don't know what role Daredevil will play in the game yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-season-4-daredevil-angela.jpg?itok=Y44658sb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-season-4-daredevil-angela.jpg?itok=bbgKeXvI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Daredevil and Angela will be joining&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' roster this season.</figcaption></figure><p>The second new hero (although she's actually the first to join&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' roster for this season) is Angela, who began life as an Image Comics character appearing in the&nbsp;<em>Spawn&nbsp;</em>series before debuting in Marvel's&nbsp;<em>Age of Ultron&nbsp;</em>run in 2013.</p>

<p>Angela is a Vanguard (that's&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' tank class) whose Ichors can transform into various weapons, including a shield, so she can either block damage or open up "opportunities for her team", according to NetEase. She can also take to the skies to search for new angles of attack.</p>

<p>Of course, the new&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>season will also bring with it a range of new game modes, changes to various game mechanics, and a brand new Team-Up attack as well, so make sure you check out the patch notes when they're released.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can watch this rather wonderfully-animated trailer for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Season 4, which depicts an epic clash between Angela and Daredevil.</p>




<p>The Season 4 trailer also confirmed a PS4 release for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, which will presumably arrive alongside the fourth season next week. Whether or not the console can handle some of NetEase's game's busier moments remains to be seen.</p>

<p>For now, however, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvel-rivals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marvel-rivals/9n8pmw7qmd3d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <p>After rapidly declaring that they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-into-the-unjust-update-has-caused-an-uptick-in-crashes-and-arrowhead-are-working-to-isolate-fixes">looking into action</a> the other day, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developers Arrowhead have released a hotfix aiming to rectify some of the crashing that's affected players diving Into the Unjust.</p>
<p>Unlike the giant worms I've still seen hide nor mandible of, it didn't take the studio long to address reports of an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arrowhead-will-target-helldivers-2s-crippling-tech-issues-now-xbox-release-is-sorted-but-would-rather-not-do-a-performance-only-update">uptick in technical issues</a> for the shooter following the update's arrival on Tuesday. Here's hoping that these fixes'll help keep thing a bit more stable.</p>

<p>The notes for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516346126609155527?l=english">hotfix 01.004.001</a>, which has arrived just after the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516345493302804917?l=english">Dust Devils warbond</a>, are pretty short, so I'll aim to ward off my worst tendencies and keep it brief.</p>
<p>Fixes for crashes related to particle effects, post-reinforcement hellpodding, "if the target of a seeking missile gets deleted before impact", aborting missions while driving, or just fighting the automatons in general. All check. Issues with the update's new caves becoming "darker than intended" when on lower graphics settings and an opposing problem with hellpads emitting excessively bright light. Dealt with.
</p><p>The warp pack "getting stuck suspended in the air or crashing". Sorted. Erratic extraction shuttle landings. Rendered a lot safer. Also, the speargun's reload time's been dialled down and the Dust Devils gear's solo silo stratagem's immediately had its cooldown quickened by half a minute.</p>
<p>One fix that isn't in there is for freezing issues <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/553850/discussions/1/591780546280097257/">some PC players have reported running into</a> since late August, with machines apparently becoming unresponsive to the point a manual button-press shutdown required. However, over on the game's <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1218153537914273802/1411297235425169409">Discord</a>, a player support agent with the handle Bvits has at least said they've "alerted the team that this is happening to some players, they're looking into it".</p>

              <p>It seems reports of the death of Amazon Prime’s <em>Tomb Raider</em> series may have been greatly exaggerated. The UK’s execrable <em>Daily Mail</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-tomb-raider-phoebe-waller-bridge-sophie-turner-1851775643">reported earlier this year</a> that “sources” had said the project, scripted by Phoebe Waller-Bridge (<em>Killing Eve</em>,&nbsp;<em>Fleabag</em>), was dead. However, it’s now being reported elsewhere that the show is still in development, and that&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones</em>‘ Sophie Turner is confirmed to be in the lead role.</p> <p>We already knew Turner was intended to play Lara Craft in this latest attempt to convert&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em> from games to screens, with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-prime-tomb-raider-tv-lara-croft-sophie-turner-1851685114">rumors first appearing in October 2024</a>, then <a href="https://kotaku.com/sophie-turner-amazon-tomb-raider-1851699063">seeming more substantial in November</a>. Six months later the errant report that the whole project had derailed appeared, and things have been quiet since. But now both&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/sophie-turner-lara-croft-amazon-tomb-raider-series-2-1236360099/"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series-filming-2026-sophie-turner-1236506192/"><em>Variety</em> are reporting</a> that not only are things still progressing, but that filming is due to start soon-ish. The official date, according to <em>Variety</em>, is January 19, 2026 for shooting to begin, with Sophie Turner officially confirmed by Amazon MGM as appearing in the lead role.</p> <p>Phoebe Waller-Bridge is still in place as writer and executive producer, but is now joined by Chad Hodge (<em>Wayward Pines</em>,&nbsp;<em>Good Behavior</em>) as co-showrunner. The latter seems likely to be due to the obvious stalling in development since the show was announced in 2023. Waller-Bridge became a massively hot property after the breakout success of dark comedy <em>Fleabag</em>, and then the international hit&nbsp;<em>Killing Eve</em>. Signing a colossal eight-figure deal with Amazon to develop shows, the writer has since exited Donald Glover’s revival of <em>Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith </em>due to creative differences, and after <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/phoebe-waller-bridge-renews-amazon-overall-deal-1235310198/">renewing the contract in 2023</a>, is said to have been working on a yet-to-appear version of Claudia Lux’s <em>Sign Here</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>. With the new announcement, it seems that finally&nbsp;<em>something</em> is going into production.</p>

 <p>Phoebe Waller-Bridge released a statement saying, “I’m so excited to announce the formidable Sophie Turner as our Lara alongside this phenomenal creative team,” the latter also including Jonathan Van Tulleken (<em>Shogun</em>) as a director. She added, “It’s not very often you get to make a show of this scale with a character you grew up loving. Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave and hilarious as she is.”</p> <p>Sophie Turner also released a comment. “I am thrilled beyond measure to be playing Lara Croft,” the&nbsp;<em>Joan</em> actor said. “She’s such an iconic character, who means so much to so many—and I am giving everything I’ve got.”</p>

 <p>Turner is the third person to attempt to portray Croft on screens, following Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander in previous movie outings. “They’re massive shoes to fill,” Turner says of the previous actors, “but with Phoebe at the helm, we (and Lara) are all in very safe hands.”</p> <p>There does seem more reason to be optimistic about this new version of&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>. Turner is a solid choice for the super-posh lead, already having the clipped English tones of previous voice actors for the games, like Judith Gibbons and Keeley Hawes, and Waller-Bridge is demonstrably one of the most capable television writers of the generation, with her ability to combine weighty drama with genuine laughs. Letting Lara have a sense of humor is something grimly forgotten in the last three games, and it’ll be lovely to see that return. Clearly, with filming not starting until next year, and likely a very lengthy post-production for SFX, the show is still a very long way off. Holiday 2026 seems optimistic at this point, so we’ve a heck of a wait to find out how it will all work out.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-early-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-dying-light-the-beast-have-early-access.1288584/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Whenever a game is delayed, the desire to play it as soon as possible intensifies. Dying Light: The Beast fans have had to experience this pain, which is why early access would be a terrific boon to lessen the wait.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> was delayed by 4 weeks. If it was the game you were most looking forward to in 2025, I can imagine you’ve been in your own zombie-like state throughout August and the early parts of September. Techland seems confident in The Beast’s revised release date. I can tell you that Insider Gaming’s recent hands-on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-preview-evolution-beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preview</a> should give you cause for excitement.</p>



<p>It’s hit and miss if single-player games have early access—which is where Dying Light: The Beast comes into the undead equation.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-dying-light-the-beast-with-early-access">Can You Play Dying Light: The Beast With Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A hop, a skip, and a thump. Credit to Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As of writing, there is no Dying Light: The Beast early access, meaning the first real opportunity to play the game is via its September 19 release date.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://dyinglightgame.com/the-beast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dying Light: The Beast</a> <em>does </em>have a special deluxe edition. But it doesn’t feature 24, 48, or even 7-day early access. It includes special cosmetic skins, the game’s official soundtrack, and other handy in-game items. But there’s definitely no early access to get you to part ways with more money.</p>



<p>In fairness, the deluxe edition is only a handful of dollars more than the standard edition. If it did offer early access, I expect there’d be a greater discrepancy in price. As an old-school gamer, I’m happy when games don’t offer this, as it’s better when everyone can jump in together on the same day, avoid spoilers, and get a chance to experience the hilarious and bizarre antics in unison.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-a-dying-light-the-beast-demo">Is There A Dying Light: The Beast Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>There’s not even a Dying Light: The Beast demo for you to get a small taster of what’s to come.</strong></p>



<p>Techland is adamant about the game’s content. The only way you play Dying Light: The Beast is on release day. If you need snippets of gameplay and details on the game and its development, though, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@InsiderGamingTrailers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming Trailers</a> YouTube page has a ton of Dyihng Light: The Beast content to watch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>007 First Light developers have clarified that it isn’t a reskin of Hitman and is different in many aspects. </p>



<p>007 First Light received an exclusive State of Play event yesterday, which featured 30 minutes of gameplay along with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date announcement</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-deluxe-edition-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order details</a>. Since then, a new interview has emerged in which the developers have clarified that the James Bond game is distinct from Hitman. </p>



<h2 id="h-007-first-light-s-driving-was-a-huge-challenge">007 First Light’s Driving Was A “Huge Challenge”</h2>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/007-first-light-is-not-a-reskin-of-hitman-io-interactive-says-again-and-the-team-brought-in-amazing-fresh-talent-including-devs-with-specific-driving-expertise-to-help-build-car-missions/">GamesRadar+</a>, senior licensing producer Theuns Smit explained how Hitman and 007 First Light are two different games. Smit first talked about how they have a very talented team that has expanded significantly since the game was announced. They were able to bring in fresh talent, which, along with the existing staff, became “a really big growth moment” for the studio. </p>



<p>The new developers were able to bring in “fresh eyes, fresh expertise, all of that” while also relying on IO Interactive’s strengths and their 25 years of massive experience. However, Smit explains that it is about the game and experience first, stating, “If you’re looking at Hitman, it’s the way it is for a particular reason, because that’s the gameplay experience we want to give. For Bond, it’s not exactly that. It’s not a reskin of that.”</p>



<p>Smit then spoke about driving, describing it as “absolutely a huge challenge,” and they had to bring on developers with driving expertise, which included “people that had experience coding, setting up, tweaking, balancing.” He added that it is “a balancing act of making a vehicle feel both exciting, credible, and dangerous at the same time as being approachable and fun for a wide audience.” Finding this balance was difficult and a “new adventure” for them, but they feel they have “landed in an amazing space.” </p>
