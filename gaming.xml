			<p>Having a good headset is an increasingly important part of modern gaming, whether it’s helping you communicate with your teammates, immersing you in the audio design of your game, or helping to create a buffer between your gaming and the rest of your household. The range and breadth of options can be dizzying, though, especially if you want to get the best value for money. Cheaper options will do a job but can be unreliable, uncomfortable, or lacking in features, whilst the big hitters can cost almost as much as the consoles themselves! This makes the mid-range perhaps the most competitive area to shop in, and it is here that the SoundMagic P58BT ANC is placed. Available for around £70 – £80 from the usual online stores, this wireless headset has become my daily go-to for music and media, whilst also proving to be a solid option for gaming.</p>
<p>The P58BT are well packaged and come with a carry pouch and a USB-C cable for charging. The carry pouch does feel a little cheap though and is a little disappointing compared to the solid hard cases that other headsets provide – even ones at lower price points. It will keep your headphones free from crumbs and fluff in your bag but offers no impact protection whatsoever – obviously, this is only an issue if you plan to take them out and about. The packaging is pretty massive too and I was surprised how light the actual headset was once I opened it up. This is a good thing in my opinion, as I find some headphones uncomfortably heavy for wearing around and about, although I can appreciate the benefits of more sturdy ones for gaming purposes.</p>



<p>In terms of performance, I have been using the P58BT for a few weeks now and have had very few issues – aside from the couple of times that I forgot to charge them up and had to plug in a 3.5mm cable. The fact that you can do this is a real positive though as this isn’t a universally available feature. Being able to use such a cable also means that you can use the P58BT with Sony and Microsoft consoles for audio, but the microphone isn’t compatible for voice chat this way. It works fine for voice calls on phone and through Bluetooth on PC, and while it does benefit from CVC noise reduction, the end result isn’t as clear as a wired alternative. Audio quality is good with the 40mm dynamic driver unit offering a decent range and effective soundstage for positional audio when gaming.</p>
<p>The main connection is with Bluetooth 5.3, and this works as reliably as you’d hope. There is the option to connect to multiple devices simultaneously which is a welcome feature, so you can stay connected to both your PC/Switch and your phone if you want to. The active noise cancellation is solid enough and works well at cutting out the sound of your family in the background or the roar of traffic when sat on the bus. There is also an ambient sound mode which probably won’t be used whilst gaming, but is useful when out and about to keep you aware of your surroundings. Finally, there is an ultra-low latency gaming mode to help ensure a smooth experience in games.</p>


<p>In addition to being lightweight, the P58BT ANC are sturdily designed and comfortable to wear, with silicone earmuffs and headband, making them water and sweat-proof and promising more durability than the cheap faux–leather that is often used. The earmuffs have a decent amount of swivel to fit your head snugly and prevent sound leaking. The battery life is excellent too, with up to 60 hours depending on whether you are using ANC or not.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best feature of all, though, is the set of minimalist, but intuitive controls. There is a tactile button for power on and off which also switches between the ANC profiles, while a double press turning gaming mode on and off and a triple press to activate pairing. For general use, however, it is the touch control pad on the left earcup that is super easy to use. Volume controls just need a quick swipe up and down with track selection being mapped to left and right. Where touch controls can be a bit flaky on other headphones – even premium models like Sony’s earlier 1000XM series – it’s nice and reliable here, always registering my swipes as intended.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		The SoundMagic P58BT ANC Headset is a good mid-range option for PC and mobile gaming, but is best suited as a general purpose Bluetooth headphones. Mic quality is not as good as competitors with physical booms but is good enough in a pinch. They’ve become my daily drivers for use with Switch and phone, but I’ve reverted to a wired set working through my DAC on PC.	</p></div>

Nintendo finally showed off the device (and what seems to be a new <em>Mario Kart</em>) in a sleek new trailer, and though we’ll seemingly have to wait until early April to get much in the way of concrete details, there’s plenty to pore over and speculate about here. </p><p>Also, the development of acclaimed Steam shooter <em>Fortune’s Run </em>is on hold as the developer revealed she has to serve time in prison. Meanwhile, Elon Musk and YouTuber Asmongold have clashed after Asmongold was among those calling out Elon’s lack of prowess at <em>Path of Exile 2 </em>after the billionaire claimed to be one of the top-ranked players in the world.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/poppy-playtime">Poppy Playtime</a> developer Mob Entertainment is suing Google for failing to remove "scam" apps from the Google Play store.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/google-pirated-poppy.pdf">legal papers</a> filed on Wednesday (thanks, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/poppy-playtime-sues-google-for-failing-to-remove-copyright-infringing-scam-apps-250116/">TorrentFreak</a>), Poppy Playtime's creators accuse Daigo Game 2020 Inc. of releasing "scam" apps intentionally advertised with names like Poppy Playtime: Chapter 3 and Poppy Playtime: Chapter 4 well before the instalments had been officially released for mobile devices.</p>

</div><figcaption>Nintendo Switch 2 and Mario Kart 9 have been revealed - but questions remain.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyPgPcxLlIk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>As well as blatantly using Poppy Playtime's name, promotional art also clearly uses Poppy Playtime's characters and screenshots from the authentic game's second chapter.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, Mob contacted Google numerous times over several months, but each time an erroneous app is removed, it simply pops back up again a day or two later.</p>
<p>The apps reportedly don't even download a copycat or derivative game, either.</p>
<p>"Mob Entertainment's trademarks and copyrighted material to trick consumers into spending up to $95 for a game prior to its release on Google Play. Instead, it asks users to pay $30 to $95 for the 'Guide wuggy playtime mod'," the complaint added.</p><p>"Google receives a direct financial benefit from the infringement by the users at least because users with devices containing the application are given an offer to purchase the Guide wuggy playtime mod for up to $95. If they make the purchase, Google then receives 15-30 percent of the proceeds."</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the scam game is still available to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PoPPyPlaytimeKing.BuggyChapterPlaytimeMOPckapter3&amp;hl=en">view</a>, and install, on the Google Play store. Unless players know, explicitly, who publishes the game, there's absolutely no way of telling them apart, particularly as it doesn't list a user score or link to user reviews.</p>
<p>Whilst the real game is a premium product and listed as having 10K+ downloads, the fake app has been downloaded over a million times.</p>

</figure>
<p>"Google forfeited the benefits of the DMCA's safe harbour provision for its infringement of Mob Entertainment's copyrighted works contained in the unauthorised 'Poppy Playtime: Chapter 3' and 'Poppy Playtime Chapter 4' applications," the court filing said.</p>
<p>"The unauthorised Poppy Playtime applications have tarnished Mob Entertainment’s Poppy Playtime [copyright] mark by associating it with poor quality applications that are nothing but bait-and-switch scams.</p>
<p>"Google's illegal, unfair, and fraudulent business acts and practices have caused Mob Entertainment to spend copious amounts of resources, including its employees' time, in a fruitless effort to attempt to get Google to remove applications committing copyright infringement, trademark infringement, fraud, and other unlawful and unfair business acts and practices."</p><p>Mob Entertainment seeks "actual damages in an amount to be determined in excess of $75,000", all of Daigo and Google's profits from the scam apps, court costs, and $150,000 in damages per work infringed. It is also hoping for an injunction to prevent Google and Daigo violating its trademark in the future.</p>
<p>This is the latest in a line of game developers who have called out digital game stores for not promptly dealing with intentionally misleading or copyright-infringing games.</p>
<p>Just last month, the creative director of indie hit Unpacking, Wren Brier, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unpacking-developer-calls-out-nintendo-after-reporting-cheap-fakes-on-its-eshop">called out Nintendo due to the prominence of copycat games on its Switch eShop</a>, and days later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-black-myth-wukong-copycat-games-are-popping-up-on-nintendo-eshop">fans spotted Black Myth: Wukong imitations, too</a>. The 2D platformer's gameplay and presentation are markedly different, but its promotional art and title could easily be confused with that of Game Science's blockbuster.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This card has nearly tripled in value from the back end of 2024, with sold listings from December going for as low as £25. Most recent sales are going for between £60 to £80, and I don't see that price getting any cheaper as 2025 progresses.</p><p id="pokemon-tcg-sword-shield-12-silve"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokemon TCG: Sword &amp; Shield 12 Silve">Pokemon TCG: Sword &amp; Shield 12 Silver Tempest Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="fd330157-bb0b-4b85-8799-f783a6c351cf" id="214259"><div id="214259" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Sword &amp; Shield—Silver Tempest Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">8 booster packs of Silver Tempest, Alolan Vulpix sleeves, dice, damage counters, and a cool box to store your bulk are a solid deal for £39.99.

            <p>Nintendo believes that "the best direction" for Switch 2 is to ensure players are "able to play their already purchased Nintendo Switch software on the successor".</p>
<p>In the absence of any other studio coming forward to confirm they were developing games for Switch 2, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/my-kids-first-meeting-with-nintendo?open=false#%C2%A7item-some-switch-notes-a-day-after-the-big-announcement">Game File</a> asked Nintendo to expand on what third-party developers it was working with. The reply didn't really address the question at hand, but did provide a little insight into Nintendo's view of backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>"Nintendo Switch is played by many consumers, and we decided that the best direction to take would be for consumers to be able to play their already purchased Nintendo Switch software on the successor to Nintendo Switch," the company said.</p>
<p>"As a result of that thinking, Nintendo Switch 2 plays Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games, as well as both physical and digital Nintendo Switch games.</p>
<p>"Certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2. Details will be shared on the Nintendo website at a later date."</p>
<p>It's still not yet clear what "may not be fully compatible" means or what games won't make the cut. But the statement does, at least, intimate that Nintendo is acutely cognisant of the importance of backwards compatibility for players moving between Switch and Switch 2. Whilst Switch was not backwards compatible with Wii or Wii U, Wii U <em>was</em> backwards compatible with Wii games, just as the Nintendo 3DS was also able to run DS cartridges.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Here's everything we know so far about Nintendo Switch 2</a>.

It’s brash, maximalist, and often, you’ll feel like you don’t actually understand what’s happening. Somehow, that chaos gels into something that actually makes sense — and, at times, is even calming.</p><p><em>Antonblast</em> just launched in 2024, but it looks like a long-lost side-scrolling platformer from the 16-bit era of the SNES or Sega Genesis. That’s not just due to the fantastic pixel art. There are fun touches like delightfully ’90s-era character designs and Mode 7-like effects, such as your character splatting against the screen when you die, that really make it feel like a missing classic of the era.</p><p>Summitsphere, <em>Antonblast</em>’s developer, describes the game as a “fast-paced explosive action platformer,” and that’s a good way to summarize how it actually feels to play. It’s sort of what would happen if you put <em>Wario</em>, <em>Sonic,</em> <em>Donkey Kong Country</em>, <em>Crash Bandicoot</em>, <em>The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show</em>, and <em>Rocko’s Modern Life</em> into a blender.</p><div><figcaption><em>Yes, there is grinding.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Summitsphere</cite></p></div><p>As Anton or Annie, you’ll charge through various enemies and obstacles in your path, sometimes turning into a literal tornado of chaos, to retrieve Spirits (as in drinks) from a villainous Satan, who has stolen and scattered them throughout 12 different levels.</p><p>The levels usually have some kind of gimmick or theme that is explored with an almost Nintendo-like degree of precision. One level frequently turns your character into a pinball. Another features sections where you transform into a bouncing, explosive bomb. One of my favorites was a maze-like bathhouse that, compared to the rest of the game, was eerily quiet. And at the end of nearly every level, you’ll activate a switch that starts a timer and begins a frantic and thrilling run back to the entrance.</p><p>For the most part, <em>Antonblast</em> encourages you to build momentum, like a classic <em>Sonic</em> game. It’s easy to get into a flow state of surging forward, even when things can feel out of control because of how fast you’re going or the amount of stuff onscreen. As I got better at the game, I actually started to feel more chill when things got out of hand. The game was usually leading me in the right direction, and I learned to just accept that things were happening as they should.</p><div><figcaption><em>The boss fights are pretty wild.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Summitsphere</cite></p></div><p>Occasionally, the game would have some tough platforming or annoyingly placed checkpoints that could take me out of the flow state — also like <em>Sonic</em>. Some of the bosses, which were often epic, screen-filling spectacles, could be frustratingly difficult. Fortunately, though, reloads are quick, which makes those frustrations a bit easier to deal with. The final level and boss are particularly challenging, but if you do get that far, trust me when I tell you that the payoff for seeing them through is worth it.</p><p>Like the ’90s-era cartoons that are its obvious inspirations, <em>Antonblast</em> can be a little loud and immature. There’s literally a button you can press just to have your character scream. But like the best of those shows, its creators clearly had fun making an over-the-top world, and they made it damn fun to play — even when I didn’t know what was going on.</p><p><small>Antonblast<em> is available now on Nintendo Switch and Steam.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Rainbow Six Siege is one of the most popular multiplayer games in the world, boasting a community made up of millions of players. The ‘online portion’ of the game is thriving and continues to improve with time, but <strong>does Rainbow Six Siege have a campaign</strong>? Is there anything for solo players to do in Rainbow Six Siege?</p>



<p>As something of a live service game, Rainbow Six Siege is kept updated by Ubisoft, getting regular updates that keep the game alive and expanding. That’s all well and good, but what is there for people playing the game on their own? Is there a campaign in Rainbow Six Siege?</p>



<p>Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-does-rainbow-six-siege-have-a-story-mode">Does Rainbow Six Siege Have a Story Mode?</h2>



<p>There is no campaign in Rainbow Six Siege – and there never has been. It was a development decision made early on by Ubisoft, with the team opting to create a multiplayer-exclusive game that was devoid of a story mode. It was seen as a strange move by some, but it ultimately paid off, making Rainbow Six Siege one of the best multiplayer games ever.</p>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege doesn’t have a campaign, but it has plenty of missions to soak up. There’s also a spin-off title named Rainbow Six Extraction – that has a story to follow, but it’s leagues away from Rainbow Six Siege when it comes to a side-by-side comparison. </p>



<p>Many will argue that Rainbow Six Siege doesn’t <b>need</b> a campaign – it’s all about the multiplayer, and that’s what matters most.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-rainbow-six-siege-solo">Can You Play Rainbow Six Siege Solo?</h2>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege has a series of offline missions called ‘Situations’ that you can explore without any other player helping you out. In the solo play portion of the game, you can access various zones with any Operator in the game, picking your loadout and taking on a series of missions based on the game’s multiplayer map pool.</p>



<p>It’s a great way to learn the game’s ropes, mechanics, and maps – but it’s not a replacement for multiplayer. That’s where Rainbow Six Siege truly shines.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Does Rainbow Six Siege Have Cross Progression? (Answered)]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/does-rainbow-six-siege-have-cross-progression/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-rainbow-six-siege-have-cross-progression-answered.1085895/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/does-rainbow-six-siege-have-cross-progression/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Rainbow Six Siege keeps going from strength to strength as Ubisoft, the game’s developer, keeps pumping it full of meaningful content updates. With a broad esports ecosystem, millions of players, and a solid multiplayer platform, Rainbow Six Siege is one of the most valuable games in the business. It’s a seamless enough game, but <strong>does Rainbow Six Siege have cross progression</strong>?</p>



<p>For many modern multiplayer games, cross progression mechanics are pivotal to delivering a successful game. Many players are cross-platform gamers these days, which means they’ll likely play the same game on different platforms – PC, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, and Mobile. This is one of the most electrifying multiplayer titles in the industry, but does Rainbow Six Siege have cross progression mechanics?</p>



<p>Let’s answer that question.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-does-rainbow-six-have-cross-progression-features">Does Rainbow Six Have Cross Progression Features?</h2>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege has seamless cross progression between every platform it exists on, ensuring players can recover their progress and keep up the fight no matter what platform they’re playing on. It’s done through the linking of a player’s Ubisoft account, which serves as the ‘middle man mechanic’ between these platforms. </p>



<p>There is a caveat though – certain statistics are shared on a limited basis. Three types of progress are only shared between Xbox and PlayStation or PC and Amazon Luna: Current Rank, Rank History, and Skill MMR. That means you’ll have a different skill rating on PlayStation compared to PC.</p>



<p>Aside from those elements, almost everything is available in Rainbow Six Siege on a cross progression basis. This is a feature that has existed since November 2022, and since then, it has been tried, tested, and approved by the community.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-rainbow-six-siege-have-crossplay">Does Rainbow Six Siege Have Crossplay?</h2>



<p>As of 2024, Rainbow Six Siege has a fully seamless ecosystem, allowing players on any platform to play with anyone else. That means that if you’re a PC gamer, you can connect with your friends playing Rainbow Six Siege on PlayStation 5, and vice-versa.</p>



<h2 id="h-faqs">FAQs</h2>



<h3 id="h-how-to-unlock-cross-progression-on-rainbow-six-siege">How to unlock cross-progression on Rainbow Six Siege</h3>



<p>To access cross-progression mechanics, you’ll need to be logged into the same Ubisoft account on the two (or more) platforms.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘TikTok Will Be Forced to Go Dark’: Statement Issued Ahead of US TikTok Ban]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/us-tiktok-ban-statement-issued/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98tiktok-will-be-forced-to-go-dark%E2%80%99-statement-issued-ahead-of-us-tiktok-ban.1085889/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/us-tiktok-ban-statement-issued/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>ByteDance’s US representatives have issued a statement on social media ahead of the application’s impending shutdown on January 19. In the final days before the US TikTok ban, it has been stated that the only thing that can save the app now is the word of the Biden Administration, the very team that brought about TikTok’s imminent doom in 2024.</p>



<p>The US TikTok ban will impact 170 million users nationwide, including tens of thousands of gaming content creators who use the application to supplement their creation-based income streams.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-begin-the-countdown">Begin the Countdown</h2>



<p>Tomorrow, TikTok will be banned in the United States unless President Biden (and his team) issue a statement to ‘assure non-enforcement’. That’s not likely to happen.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/TikTokPolicy/status/1880424906820608180" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent post</a> on social media, the TikTok team wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The statements issued today by both the Biden White House and the Department of Justice have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok’s availability to over 170 million Americans. </p>



<p>Unless the Biden Administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It hasn’t yet been revealed exactly how TikTok will be banned in the country, but it’s widely assumed that storefronts like Google Play and the iOS App Store will block downloads of the application. It’s also believed that geoblocking measures will be put in place to stop people in the United States from accessing TikTok via a browser.</p>



<p>The move comes amid a desire from the United States government to distance itself from Chinese companies. In recent days, the Pentagon placed Tencent on a ‘blacklist’, marking it as an organisation that requires heightened attention from security services. ByteDance, which is headquartered in Beijing, is the parent company over the top of TikTok.</p>

On top of that, Nippon Ichi have made the categorically correct choice to let your save carry over into the main game. So, what I’m saying is, go and play the start of this game. I don’t think you’ll be disappointed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero - Demo Trailer (Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Steam)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cPnqBMRkNow?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero is the sequel to the iconic original, Phantom Brave. Set in Ivoire, a area punctuated by diverse islands. You play Marona, an incredibly cheerful girl, especially considering she can talk to the souls of dead people. Where it comes in handy is that she can interact with Ash, a dead Chroma, or bounty hunter, who used to work with Marona’s parents. He’s now her protector, and together they set out to solve the islands’ problems, via the medium of strategy RPG action. It’s the perfect arrangement.</p>

<p>What’s particularly cool about Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero is the way it retains the character of the original game, while updating the visuals in a Chibi 3D art style. It’s certainly a great-looking game, with beautiful hi-res character artwork and chunky 3D visuals. Marona finds herself separated from Ash, and instead has to team up with Apricot, the ghost of a pirate ship captain’s daughter. I think you’ll be happily swept up in its ghost-ship centric tale when it launches for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PC and Nintendo Switch on January 30th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-dynamic-cloud-shadows-thanks-to-new-mod/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>That Unreal Engine 5.5 recreation of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim we <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-unreal-engine-5-5-remaster-lumen-nanite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered</a> yesterday certainly looks cool, but it's not really practical. It's not optimized, for one thing, and it's also not really playable, being more of a proof-of-concept or a demo than anything else.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there are plenty of options for anyone actually interested in playing the game with modernized graphics. The Community Shaders graphics enhancement suite recently made big advancements, such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-true-pbr-with-community-shaders-1-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduction of Physically Based Rendering (PBR)</a>, and its development continues at an impressive pace.</p>
<p>The newest feature released yesterday is called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/139185" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloud Shadows</a>. As you might easily guess, it adds dynamic cloud shadows to Skyrim. According to author ProfJack (the same who released Terrain Shadows), who worked on Cloud Shadows with main Community Shaders author doodlum, it's a custom technique where cloud shadows are aligned to the sun and use the game's built-in cloud system. The clouds are rendered from the player's perspective, with the texture itself rendered as a side effect of the cubemap reflection rendering. Because of this, there are no additional draw calls that the GPU has to deal with.</p>
<p>Cloud shadows are also used for volumetric lighting, so the sun's rays can be obscured. When clouds cover the ground, the player is shrouded in darkness. When the sun does pop between the clouds, though, the result can be striking, says ProfJack.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The Cloud Shadows CS feature is compatible with all weather mods, but it won't work perfectly with weather systems that 'fake' overcast clouds using the sky color. When it comes to Skyrim compatibility, this will work on all versions of the game: Special Edition, Anniversary Edition, and even on Skyrim VR. Based on what the author said, there shouldn't be any major performance drawbacks, which are always worth considering when adding a mod to the VR version.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/jagex-ceo-addresses-recent-runescape-scandal/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Earlier this week, I reported <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/runescape-membership-charge-tiers-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the changes</a> that Jagex is proposing for RuneScape’s paid membership model. In a series of images shared on social media, it was revealed that a survey had been conducted by Jagex, and in that survey, players were asked to rate a series of proposed membership packages, some of which were audacious.</p>



<p>In a new post published on the RuneScape platform, Jagex’s CEO, Mod Pips, has laid bare the reasons why these changes have to happen. It’s a transparent move from the firm that players have welcomed with open arms, but it’s still not perfect.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-was-a-major-misjudgement">‘It Was a Major Misjudgement’</h2>



<p>In the post on the RuneScape blog, Mod Pips opened by explaining:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This was clumsy and inconsiderate, to say the least. We failed to think this through from your perspective as players. We got caught up in research mode and rushing a project with a research partner.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The ‘exploratory survey’ set the community ablaze, with some of the proposed membership tiers paywalling elements like better account security and enhanced player support. In some cases, users could pay for a RuneScape membership and still have to see ads in the game.</p>



<p>Pips went deeper:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It was a major misjudgement to include features that suggested we would consider degrading the game experience or impacting gameplay. Even the mere suggestion of ideas like in-game ads, shorter AFK timers, or making improved player support an additional cost undermined your trust in us.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Going forward, the Jagex team has pledged:</p>



<ul>
<li>To not include in-game advertisements in any regular paid membership</li>



<li>To ensure that any subscription ‘provides access to the full suite of core game content’</li>



<li>To not make plugins or features on the official client ‘paid options’</li>



<li>To not paywall player support</li>
</ul>



<p>The blog post was ended with a final statement from Mod Pips:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This kind of transparency and collaboration is at the heart of what makes our games so special. The game is shaped by its community, and your voices remain central to every decision we make. While we recognise that mistakes were made here, the fact that we’ve received such strong and clear feedback reinforces how deeply you care about this game.</p>



<p>Old School RuneScape thrives because of its community, and working closely with you keeps us moving forward, even when the discussions are difficult.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While the post has satisfied the community somewhat, it’s clear the road ahead is yet to be fully traversed and that changes <strong>are coming</strong>, whether players like it or not.</p>



<p>Do you think the statement from Mod Pips is a good one or has Jagex forever ruined your interpretation of RuneScape? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>In a long-awaited update from Treyarch, it has been revealed that when season two arrives in Black Ops 6, it’ll come hand-in-hand with a feature <strong>many </strong>have been asking for. With the season two update, console players will finally be able to switch off crossplay mechanics, locking them into matchmaking against <strong>only </strong>other console players and <strong>not </strong>PC users.</p>



<p>This is a step to prevent console players from running into cheaters, which are <strong>always </strong>more commonplace on PC platforms. The feature is in testing now and will go live ‘during’ season two.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-finally">Finally.</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1880381003270848925" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post</a> on social media and on the Call of Duty blog, Treyarch revealed the impending update:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In Season 02, we are enabling the ability to disable crossplay for console players who to compete only against other console players.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This will be deployed for both Warzone and Black Ops 6 Ranked Play, but it <strong>won’t </strong>roll out for general multiplayer playlists, which has been met with disappointment from fans on social media. Treyarch insisted it will ‘be closely monitoring’ and will consider ‘further changes to prioritise the integrity of the ecosystem’ going forward.</p>



<p>Since Ranked Play dropped in Black Ops 6, it has been a shambles of a scene. Even a cursory glance across social media will uncover countless pro players and content creators stressing their frustration about cheaters dominating Ranked Play.</p>



<p>It’s the same thing year after year, but in Black Ops 6, it just seems <strong>worse</strong> than ever before, for some reason.</p>



<p>It’s a similar story in Warzone.</p>



<p>Treyarch also highlighted that ‘Vote to Forfeit’ is coming midway through season two, allowing players to end matches without losing SR or facing any game suspensions. Later, disconnect protection will be added in the form of an ability to rejoin matches when you’ve dropped out.</p>



<p>Do you think this change is a W from Treyarch, or would you rather see it rolled out to cover all multiplayer playlists? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is - assuming it doesn't get delayed for a third time - almost upon us, and in the run-up to its March release, Ubisoft is continuing its series of deep dives highlighting some of the ways this latest series entry will be breaking from tradition. And this time around, it's the turn of exploration, which is promising to be a little more player-driven and a little less like an explosion in a map marker factory.
</p>
<p>
In its <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4GKS1MvpHS3f7ebKWfxHmt/assassins-creed-shadows-deep-dive-into-exploration">latest blog post</a>, Ubisoft says Assassin's Creed Shadows makes "major changes and additions" to exploration in order to "foster a unique sense of discovery" as players roam the world. The aim, it explains, is to move away from an overabundance of 'hand-holding' map icons and markers toward an open world where information is "key [and] a form of reward". As such, rather than be immediately showered with points of interest, players will need to discover and earn information - either directly, through their spies, or via NPCs on their travels.
</p>
<p>
The world map, for instance, will initially only show region names and vague illustrative hints at potential key locations, with more details being revealed as players explore regions, sub-regions, and local landmarks. Notably, players will eventually earn scouts that can be sent ahead to reveal more precise location for quest objectives.
</p>

<figcaption>Synchronisation in Assassin's Creed Shadows.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp0v_S61cAY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
One of Assassin's Creed's most iconic exploration features is also getting an overhaul, with viewpoints - AKA synchronisation points - now behaving a little differently. In Shadows, synchronisation no longer uncovers a clutter of map icons over a large area, instead revealing nearby key points of interest that can be manually tagged and added to the compass. Ubisoft says the goal is to give players a "more intentional and active way to find their next adventure."
</p><p>
In a similar fashion, the classic companion eagle has now been jettisoned, and players will instead need to find a good vantage point to observe the surrounding area and plan their approach, manually searching out and tagging valuable items, enemies, and so on.
</p>
<p>
Also new are safe houses - known as "kakurega" - that players can acquire. These provide "safe" fast travel points (discovered viewpoints also unlock fast travel, but these are frequently in dangerous enemy zones), as well as other useful functions. Players can, for instance, refill rations, tools, and ammunition; access their gear stash; manage and accept contracts; replenish scouts, and manage allies that can be summoned for help.

</p>
<figcaption>And here's a look at Shadows' objective board.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faWrGLgBBAc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Elsewhere in Ubisoft's update, there's mention of Assassin's Creed Shadows' Objective Board - a version of the visual quest log previously seen in Mirage, which expands to show new targets and objectives as more characters and challenges are encountered. Or rather, it reveals clues pointing to the location of new opportunities, which players must piece together for more specific directions - unless they want their scouts to do the hard work for them.
</p><p>
Ubisoft also highlights Shadows' Pathfinder tool, which - given the inclusion of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-adding-the-ability-to-go-prone-has-prompted-a-rethink-of-the-series-usual-controls">more unclimbable scenery</a> this time around - is intended to help players avoid false shortcuts that would increase their travel time. When a quest is tracked and its location is revealed (or when players manually place a marker on the map), Pathfinder can be deployed while on horseback to draw a white line overlay on the ground showing the shortest route to a player's destination.
</p>
<p>
A few more exploration details can be found in <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4GKS1MvpHS3f7ebKWfxHmt/assassins-creed-shadows-deep-dive-into-exploration">Ubisoft's latest blog post</a> - and if that's left you sufficiently intrigued, Assassin's Creed Shadows is now due to launch for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC on 20th March. Ubisoft recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">delayed the game's release yet again</a> (it was previously scheduled for 14th February) as it explores potential sales options.

One of the most eye-catching jewels in this trash crown: Elon Musk, the world’s richest man who you’d assume has something better to do, is <a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-is-elon-musk-beefing-with-a-twitch-streamer-2000551256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beefing with Twitch streamer Asmongold</a> over apparent evidence that Musk – despite his high-level characters in games like <em>Diablo IV</em> and <em>Path of Exile</em> – <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/elon-musk-cheating-gaming-diablo-iv-1235234041/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cheats at video games</a>. Why does he insist on doing this? What is he trying to prove? On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we talk about that.</p><p>We begin the episode by breaking down <a href="https://aftermath.site/but-i-like-to-slide-the-joy-con" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo’s long-awaited reveal of the Switch 2</a> – although we use the term “reveal” loosely. After months of speculation, we now know… what it will look like. And it looks like a Nintendo Switch! Some people, Chris included, are disappointed by this. Nintendo used to swing for the fences with its hardware ideas, but now it’s navigating a world of its own creation – one filled with Steam Decks and Asus Rog Allies. Can Nintendo’s Apple-like iteration strategy keep it at the head of the handheld pack, or is it already ceding ground simply by conforming?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we discuss <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/17/tech/tiktok-getting-banned-trump-biden/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the impending TikTok ban</a>, which thanks to interventions from both outgoing president Joe Biden and incoming president Donald Trump, we don’t think is actually going to happen, but which has produced the funniest possible outcome in a bunch of people migrating to <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/01/tiktok-ban-rednote-chinese-social-media-app-good-alternative.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a comparable Chinese app</a>. After that, we turn Luke’s brain to mush by discussing Elon Musk’s gamer beef with Asmongold, but he endures it like a champ. Finally, we wrap up by designing our own Switch 2 (it’s got a foldable screen; it’s sick).&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can buy TikTok and replace all the videos with blogs.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> The funniest thing about all of it is, on some level it’s just “Lie until you make it,” but also if you say you’re good at something and then you’re really, really clearly not good at something, everyone is gonna say “Well, what else do you suck at?” There’s the degree to which [Musk] and Trump’s friendship makes a lot of sense, because they both love lying about stuff and fucking over labor. They love doing that shit – like Trump lying about his <a href="https://golf.com/lifestyle/celebrities/how-why-president-trump-cheats-golf-playing-tiger-woods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">golf game</a>, hypothetically. The difference is, we’re not watching him play. He’s not livestreaming sucking ass at golf, although I’d love to see that. He just tells people he’s good at something, and you know he’s lying about it in some capacity.</p><p>The need for there to be proof [in Musk’s case] is somehow more damning and insecure. Just lie and don’t worry about it.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Trump is lying for others; Elon is lying for himself in that he’s also trying to convince himself he’s great even though he’s probably had his video game characters boosted. He’s still trying to contort his mind into believing “No, but I am good at this, though! I’m just this natural expert.” All these guys – but especially Elon – are trying to reify this idea of the genius, the person who’s just inherently superior to everyone. Same reason Elon Musk is like “I’ve gotta have a million kids; I’ve got to pass on my genius genes.” He needs to believe, for his own sake, that it’s possible for him to jump into the deep end of anything and excel immediately.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>The thing about all those guys who are like “My beautiful genes” is, your kids fucking hate you, man. At least <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/elon-musk-transgender-daughter-vivian-wilson-interview-rcna163665" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one</a> really fucking hates you [in Musk’s case]. You just created an opposition to your legacy. Your kid doesn’t have to like you. Having a child doesn’t mean your legacy is going to be continued, except in some freak weird genetic way. And that’s all they care about: “Oh, my genes are beautiful.”</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> And they’re not, but that’s another story.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> No, he’s got a weird head.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> He’s built like a Cybertruck.</p><p>But the full circle element of this is that his comebacks to Asmongold about Asmongold’s career have also been wrong. He’s trying to allege that Asmongold is lying to the world. Elon Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1879798348993237046" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> “Asmon behaves like a maverick 'independent' but&nbsp; in reality has to ask his boss for permission before he can do anything. He is not his own man." And as evidence of this, Elon linked DMs between the two of them, wherein Asmongold was talking about creating content, and he said “I’m going to see if my editor might want to make a second account for it even.”</p><p>So Elon is taking this to mean that Asmongold’s editor is his boss. That’s not true. Almost every Twitch streamer has YouTube editors who cut up their streams and make videos out of them for YouTube, because the streamers themselves do not have time to do that. They’re streaming all day long. [Streamers] pay these people. They employ these people [typically on a contractual basis]. Effectively, Asmongold is <em>their </em>boss.&nbsp;</p><p>But Elon once again doesn’t know how shit works and is making these audacious claims with no understanding. It’s so demonstrative of his entire little process, his whole cycle.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> This is messy in the same way <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/4536394-twitter-files-journalist-matt-taibbi-musk-disappointing-free-speech/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Matt Taibbi thing</a> was messy. You thought you were gonna be best friends with this guy, and it turns out he’s a messy bitch who loves leaking his DMs – and loves stabbing you in the back the second you become mildly annoying to him, in a way that makes you both look like shit.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>But the other thing is, content creators do this too. You’ll often have creators who become BFFs for a little bit, then drama occurs, then they leak DMs everywhere, and then they both make more content out of it. That gets them viewership. That’s why Asmongold is also down to engage with this. I’m sure he’s not heartbroken – far from it. I bet he’s ecstatic. He’s like “Man, I’m gonna dine out on this for weeks.”</p><p>I think we’d want the outcome of all of this to be gamers at least – if not the world – seeing that Elon is a fraud, because he is and always has been and the faster we all realize that, the better off we are. But the way this unfolds in the world of content creation is that someone is revealed to be a fraud, but they still maintain a fanbase, and then three weeks later the status quo resets, and people are like “Oh yeah, he’s over there doing his thing. I’ll check in on him later, and I’m sure he’ll be doing something different, and it’ll be fun to watch.”</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It’s not really gonna change anything meaningfully. He’s fucking loaded.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> He’s the shadow president.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> He’s in the weird, fake little playpen all the billionaires are working at for free, so whatever.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Chat says, “Elon, just make fun of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/testjd/asmongold_used_a_dead_rat_as_an_alarm_clock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the rat clock</a>.”</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It’s right there!</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-executive-producer-job-description"><h3>A Video Game’s Executive Producer Is Just Trying To Make It All Work</h3></a><p>'Management is making stuff with other people, it's a creative problem'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-trump"><h3>What Games Journalism Can Do Now</h3></a><p>Readers, and fellow journalists, are going to need what games journalists know in the face of the upcoming administration</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/luke-plunkett-aftermath-game-of-the-year-2024"><h3>Luke’s Favourite Video Games Of 2024</h3></a><p>From archaeologists to Barnsworth, it was a good year</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Assassin's Creed games usually include a large open world, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/" data-ref-id="1100-6523576">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is no exception. While there are familiar elements to the travel and exploration abilities in this game, Shadows is also going to allow its two leading characters, Naoe and Yasuke, to take some time to appreciate the beauty of nature by creating art.</p><p>Ubisoft unveiled this feature during an <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/4GKS1MvpHS3f7ebKWfxHmt/assassins-creed-shadows-exploration-gameplay-overview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extended explanation</a> about how the game's exploration mechanics will work. Letting Naoe or Yasuke create art may not give them an edge in battle, but it's an activity that they find rewarding.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H1SNkcEU9Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8H1SNkcEU9Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Yasuke and Naoe will also have their own character-specific activities that they can do outside of quests and missions. For example, Yasuke can find experts who can teach him more about how to use his Kata, which gives his character special attack movies. On the other hand, Naoe's Kuji-kiri meditation will open up more of her backstory.</p><p>Ubisoft has placed a great deal of importance on scouts in this game, as the recruits can help Naoe and Yasuke find places of importance in the game's world without having to transverse every step on their own. Scouts can also raid enemy strongholds one-at-a-time, and so subtly that their marks may not realize what's happening until it's too late. With the resources from scout raids, Naoe or Yasuke can customize their safe houses. Additionally, scouts can help the players cancel provisional alerts if either character has been caught breaking the law.</p><p>Viewpoints are also making a return in Shadows, with some modifications. Player characters can now spot and discover distant locations by getting on a high building and using the 360-degree observe function, which will mark special locations on your map.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp0v_S61cAY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Zp0v_S61cAY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As before, viewpoints will open up fast-travel points as well. However, not every fast travel point is safe to go to. Some of them are in enemy-controlled land, and you'll have a major fight on your hands if the enemies discover that your characters have dropped by unannounced.</p><p>If players need a clearer idea about where they are going, the pathfinder feature can be used on horseback. It's not unlike the tools used in Grand Theft Auto games to keep your characters on the right track to their intended destination.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OXycOtXBNQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0OXycOtXBNQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A recent rumor suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-assassins-creed-games-may-come-to-switch-2-report/1100-6528782/" data-ref-id="1100-6528782">Assassin's Creed Shadows will come to Switch 2</a>, but it remains unconfirmed for now. Assassin's Creed Shadows was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20/1100-6528717/" data-ref-id="1100-6528717">also recently delayed again</a>.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> maker HoYoverse has agreed to pay $20m to settle a complaint - filed by the US Department of Justice on behalf of the Federal Trade Commission - accusing it of violating children's privacy laws and deceiving users over the true cost of obtaining rare loot box prizes.
</p>
<p>
As per the FTC's <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/genshin-impact-game-developer-will-be-banned-selling-lootboxes-teens-under-16-without-parental">announcement</a>, the complaint accused Singapore-based Cognosphere - which does business under the name HoYoverse - of actively marketing Genshin Impact to children and of collecting their personal information in violation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA). The FTC claimed HoYoverse was aware children under 13 were using its service, but continued to collect their personal information - and share it with third-parties - without obtaining parental consent or complying with other COPPA requirements.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, the filing claimed HoYoverse deceived players regarding the odds of - and true cost of - winning particularly sought-after "five-star" loot box prizes. The complaint argued Genshin Impact's loot box system - said to require players to "exchange real dollars for bundles of virtual currency that then have to be re-exchanged multiple times to open loot boxes" - is "complicated", "challenging", and "confusing", particularly for children and teens.

<p>
Furthermore, the filing claimed Genshin Impact's purchasing process "misleads consumers about the amount of money [they] spend on loot boxes on an ongoing basis, and the amount of money [they] would likely need to spend to obtain certain prizes". HoYoverse's event banners and influencer campaigns were also alleged to give players the impression they would have better odds of obtaining five-star prizes than was the case in reality.
</p><p>
In response, HoYoverse has agreed to pay $20m to settle the complaint - meaning it neither admits or denies the allegations - and will make changes to prevent children under 16 from purchasing lootboxes without a parent's express consent. The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/Cognosphere-Attachment3-3.pdf">proposed settlement</a> - which must be approved by a federal judge - also prohibits HoYoverse from selling loot boxes using virtual currency without providing an option to purchase them with real money, and requires it to disclose loot box odds and exchange rates for multi-tiered virtual currency.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, HoYoverse is required to delete any personal information previously collected from children under 13 without parental consent, and to comply with COPPA going forward.

If you like reading by the pool or relaxing in the bath, the Colorsoft ereader is waterproof and carries an IPX8 water resistance rating, which means it can be fully submerged in water at a depth of 6.5 feet for up to 60 minutes.</p><p>The biggest reason to pick up the Colorsoft is if you’re interested in making the jump to digital comic books and graphic novels. Its color display is leagues better for the format than black and white ereaders like the standard Kindle--and at $230, it’s easier to recommend.</p></div>                      </div><p>As mentioned, you can save even more with an eligible trade-in item. You'll automatically save an additional 20%, even if you send Amazon a cheap device like a Fire Stick. The 20% is calculated from the sale price, so in this case, <strong>you'll save an extra $46 simply for trading in any eligible device</strong>. At the moment, that means the Colorsoft's price drops to $184.</p><p>The $184 price doesn't account for the value of the device you choose to send to Amazon. A Fire Stick is only worth a few bucks, but higher-end devices can be worth significantly more. The Kindle Scribe 16GB model, for example, is worth $85.</p><div title="[Various] Kindle Scribe Deal" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2480" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] Kindle Scribe Deal" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Like-New-Amazon-digital-notebook-Paperwhite/dp/B09W8KQ782?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Like-New-Amazon-digital-notebook-Paperwhite\/dp\/B09W8KQ782?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Like-New-Amazon-digital-notebook-Paperwhite/dp/B09W8KQ782?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Like-New Kindle Scribe</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Like-New-Amazon-digital-notebook-Paperwhite/dp/B09W8KQ782?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Like-New-Amazon-digital-notebook-Paperwhite\/dp\/B09W8KQ782?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Like-New-Amazon-digital-notebook-Paperwhite/dp/B09W8KQ782?tag=gamespot-promos-20">16GB - $234 (was $310) | 32GB - $260 (was $325)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Speaking of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Like-New-Amazon-digital-notebook-Paperwhite/dp/B09W8KQ782?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Scribe</a>, the hybrid ereader and note-taking e-ink tablet is also on sale right now.
