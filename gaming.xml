			<p>A big Warcraft III: Reforged update could be coming in the future, judging from some recent findings.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/something-might-be-happening-with-warcraft-3-reforged.1010307/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA forums</a>, <a href="https://blizztrack.com/view/w3d?type=versions">Blizztrack</a>, a website that tracks updates for all Blizzard games, shows that the game's internal Public Test Realm was updated yesterday to version 2.0.0 following a series of minor updates, suggesting that something big may be brewing, as every major version of any Blizzard game usually indicates a significant update. With the series' 30th anniversary being this year, it wouldn't be surprising to see a major overhaul of a game that was among the most controversial releases of the past few years.</p>
<p>Despite its issues, Chris still found Warcraft III: Reforged to be a valuable reconstruction of one of the most important RTS games ever released. You can learn more about the game by reading his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warcraft-iii-reforged-review/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Warcraft III: Reforged isn't the game that was promised, but is still a valuable reconstruction of one of the most influential titles in the history of video games. This release is, sadly, riddled with bugs as well as marred by the terrible decisions of Blizzard, particularly that of the false advertising that persists now even after launch. However, despite this, there's little doubting that Warcraft III: Reforged has a compelling story that, even eighteen years on, remains one of the most engaging in the genre. The gameplay holds strong to this day and with the tweaks and upgrades, this is an undeniable diamond in the rough.</em></p>
<div>
<p>Warcraft III: Reforged is now available on PC via Battle.net.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-planet-crafter-planet-humble-dlc-update-released-to-address-feedback.1011099/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-crafter-planet-humble-dlc-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Miju Games has released a brand new update for&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Planet Humble&nbsp;</em>DLC, and the update is intended to address "most of the things" suggested by players as improvements.</p>
<p><em>Planet Humble&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-crafter-planet-humble-dlc-release-date">released earlier this month</a>, and in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1284190/view/4506506224312960119" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a Steam post</a>, Miju says it's "humbled" by the volume of feedback received from players, and that it "succeeded" in some areas when it comes to player expectations of the DLC but "didn't" in others.</p>
<p>According to the post, Miju will "continue to refine" both of the planets available as part of&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter&nbsp;</em>and its DLC, and following that, more free updates will be released. There's a possibility of more DLC, but for now, Miju is choosing to focus on the base game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-planet-crafter-planet-humble-dlc-update-ice-planet.jpg?itok=QKNVa-sJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-planet-crafter-planet-humble-dlc-update-ice-planet.jpg?itok=tFd3qlkO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Planet Humble&nbsp;</em>has made some&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter&nbsp;</em>players happy, but there are plenty of suggestions for improvement.</figcaption></figure><p>So, what's actually changed as part of this update? First up, Miju has added 23 new "Starform Crates", which operate similarly to Golden Crates; they contain "high quality flower seeds" and "a newly-added Starform effigy".</p>
<p>You'll also find a new crashed ship to explore somewhere on Humble, as well as a new hidden bunker to discover, so if you're an exploration fiend, this is the update for you.</p>
<p>Damage has been removed in "big fog areas", and lots of texture and collision problems have also been fixed, so you should have a smoother experience with&nbsp;<em>Planet Humble&nbsp;</em>after this update is applied.</p>
<p>Several more resource nodes have been added, and a few more minor issues have been addressed as well. Hopefully, if you weren't entirely happy with&nbsp;<em>Planet Humble</em>, this update should go a long way towards remedying that.</p>

<p>If you haven't played&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter</em>, it's an open-world survival-crafting game in which you must terraform a planet in order to make it a livable environment for humanity.</p>
<p>To that end, you'll need to gather resources, construct the base itself, and then fill it with "oxygen, warmth, and pressure" in order to create a viable atmosphere. Despite the high stakes, Miju describes&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter&nbsp;</em>as "a chill experience", so it shouldn't be too stressful for you (and your friends, if you play in co-op).</p>
<p><em>The Planet Crafter&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1284190/The_Planet_Crafter/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, as is its&nbsp;<em>Planet Humble&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3142540/The_Planet_Crafter__Planet_Humble/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DLC</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/halo-battle-royale-cancelled-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/halo-battle-royale-could-have-been-a-%E2%80%9Cgame-changer%E2%80%9D-says-former-dev.1011087/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/halo-battle-royale-cancelled-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A former developer at Certain Affinity has said that Halo’s now-canceled Battle Royale mode could have been a “game change for the franchise.”</p>



<p>The news came via the LinkedIn profile (as spotted by <a href="https://xboxera.com/2024/10/16/halo-battle-royale-would-have-been-a-game-changer-for-the-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">XboxEra</a>) of Mike Clopper, the Studio Design Director at Raven Software, who was previously a Game Director at Certain Affinity.</p>



<p>“MP Halo Infinite – I led a large team of designers working on a canceled Battle Royale mode for Halo. I believe this product could have been a game changer for the franchise. We loved playing it and working on it was a fantastic experience in spite of its cancelation,” his LinkedIn Profile reads.</p>



<p>It’s anyone’s guess why the Battle Royale mode for Halo Infinite was cancelled, but rumours surrounding the project have been going on for the past couple of years. The Battle Royale’s codename was Project Tatanka,&nbsp;and unfortunately, it’s likely never to see the light of day.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, Halo announced a massive rebrand, including changing the name of 343 Industries to Halo Studios and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-moves-to-unreal-engine-5-with-multiple-games-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moving the Halo franchise to Unreal Engine 5</a>.</p>



<p>“If you really break Halo down, there have been two very distinct chapters. Chapter 1 – Bungie. Chapter 2 – 343 Industries,” studio head Pierre Hintze said. “Now, I think we have an audience which is hungry for more. So we’re not just going to try improve the efficiency of development, but change the recipe of&nbsp;how&nbsp;we make Halo games. So, we start a new chapter today.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[MPL Becomes First Esports Series With ONE BILLION Hours Watched]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/mpl-esports-series-one-billion-hours/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mpl-becomes-first-esports-series-with-one-billion-hours-watched.1011081/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/mpl-esports-series-one-billion-hours/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a monumental milestone, the Mobile Legends: Bang Bang Professional League has become the first esports series in history to reach a whopping <strong>one billion hours watched</strong>. This data comes from Esports Charts, which highlighted that records counting these figures stretch back to 2016.</p>



<p>This means that the MPL has beaten the League of Legends World Championship, the LCK, the Valorant Champions Tour, and The International to this sweet record – but they’re not too far behind. It’s expected that League Worlds will hit the one billion mark before the current tournament is up.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-immense-numbers">Immense Numbers</h2>



<p>In the <a href="https://escharts.com/news/top-esports-events-series-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report published by Esports Charts</a>, we get a look at some solid comparisons that highlight just how immense this achievement is for the MPL.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To contextualise ML:BB’s achievement in the mobile gaming industry,<strong>&nbsp;the MPL has received about quadruple the viewership of the PUBG Mobile Pro League</strong>, which has a similar total Airtime to the MPL. It also recorded more than triple the watch time of Twitch Rivals, which not only has over 600 tournaments but appeals to the large, loyal audiences of famous internet personalities.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The success of ML:BB is a testament to the power of mobile gaming. We recently published a report outlining the growth of mobile esports viewership in the last few months – and it’s a figure that continues to grow.</p>



<p>Despite the game’s success, it’s hampered slightly by the lack of a profile outside of the Asian markets. It’s extremely popular in Indonesia and the Philippines, plus it’s building a following in LATAM and MENA, but it hasn’t hit with the EU and NA audiences or pro players yet.</p>



<p>Moonton Games continues to work on that, though. The MPL has been around since 2017, and it continues to expand today.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/full-nvidia-rtx-50-series-graphics-cards-release-date-rumors-continue-to-circulate/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Rumors are continuing to circulate surrounding the release date of the upcoming Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 series graphics cards.</p>



<p>Nvidia appears set to announce a complete lineup of new RTX 50 Series GPUs in Q1 2025. According to the latest rumors, not only will the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 launch in January, but four more cards will debut in early 2025 as well. </p>



<p>According to the Chinese forum Board Channels (h/t <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/rumors-suggest-nvidia-could-launch-rtx-5070-in-february-rtx-5060-series-already-in-march" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoCardz</a>), Nvidia will also launch the RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti in February 2025. Those will be followed up by the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti in March.</p>



<p>It’s also mentioned that there is no current plan for a Super models in the near future.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The latest news reveals that the release dates for the NVIDIA RTX50 series are mostly confirmed. This time, the various models of the RTX50 series may be launched rather quickly, with a near-monthly release schedule. Based on the information available, the estimated release timeline is as follows:</p>



<p>The tentative release dates for the RTX50 series have been set. At CES in January 2025, NVIDIA will launch the RTX5090D and 5080 series. In February, the RTX5070TI and 5070 series will be released, followed by the RTX5060TI and 5060 series in March. This means the entire lineup will be released within Q1 of 2025. As of now, there are no plans for any SUPER models.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Rumors have been running about the pending launch of Nvidia’s next generation of graphics cards. From <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-to-launch-three-rtx-50-series-graphics-cards-at-ces-2025-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their core counts and memory</a> details to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-50-series-leaks-reveal-memory-and-power-totals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how much power</a> they’ll consume, everything has been trickling out in recent months. However, this is the first time any mention of Ti variants has happened.</p>



<p>Please keep in mind that none of these rumors have been confirmed so take the information with a grain of salt for now. Nvidia “does not comment on rumor and speculation”.</p>



<p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang will give his keynote presentation at CES 2025 on January 6. The new graphics cards are expected to be revealed during the event where an official release date for the Nvidia RTX 50 Series should be announced.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-final-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Two hours isn't enough time to see all the branching stories, admire all the beautiful graphics, and discover all the secrets within the world of STALKER 2. But it is enough to be left impressed. When I wasn't taking stock of my paltry ammunition levels and hunger gauge, I was looking out at beautiful fields of red poppy flowers. When I wasn’t getting distracted by an interesting side quest I was doing my best to lure the mutants into an anomaly trap. And while it was over just when it felt like it was getting extra good, it had still left its impression. The impression that the team at GSC Game World has created something special with STALKER 2.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</h3></div></output><p>I will preface all this by admitting that I am not a STALKER exper meaning I have not played the 2009 hits. But I probably should be, because I am a huge fan of games that offer us various options for dealing with a story scenario – especially those where one seemingly small decision can have effects that ripple through the rest of your playthrough. That’s what this series (which began with 2007’s Shadow of Chernobyl and was built on in Call of Pripyat in 2009) is best known for, and it’s what stuck with me the most from my handful of hours with STALKER 2. I kept thinking about the decisions I had made and wondering if I had made a mistake by choosing a violent, guns-blazing approach and wondering if I should have tried a stealthy or even fully peaceful one, but STALKER 2 takes it several steps further. There are times you’ll have NPCs abruptly end a quest without rewarding you because you’ve looted the body of their dead friend, for example. Have that happen a couple of times and it’ll give you pause even when you’re doing the kind of routine task that you normally wouldn’t even think about. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You’ll have NPCs abruptly end a quest without rewarding you because you’ve looted the body of their dead friend.</p></div><p>Our demo began with an Enter the Zone trailer cinematic before we were unleashed into a small field area covered by the darkness of night where we were hunting for anomalies. These are dangerous areas that have been disturbed in the irradiated area and can reveal powerful artifacts with special attributes on them. And on the graphics front, for both PC and Xbox, these areas look stunning on both platforms. </p><p>This introductory sequence has us meet Skif. We still don’t know much about Skif, but we did learn that he seems to be well-versed with the new technology of STALKER 2, such as the Gilka-1 detector that you can flip open and use to search for artifacts as it beeps louder and louder when approaching the correct area. STALKER 2 artifacts are basically small objects that give you benefits like a faster stamina recharge. While attempting to plant and charge a separate larger Topaz Scanner at three such anomaly locations, I’ll yadda-yadda-yadda over some spoilers here but after a dramatic moment, we wind up in the open-world section of STALKER 2 where our journey really begins – with a main quest that we quickly find which sent us on a search for an individual named Squint.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But before discovering the Squint questline I was surprised by just how much could happen in the open world. One example was an encounter with some unsavory folks trying to attack a character bunkered down in their home. Once I took them out by sneaking around behind them and making quick work of them with a sidearm shot to the noggin I was introduced to a new NPC character. No matter who you meet in STALKER 2, the character models express emotion, and the somber mood is on full display as you sit around campfires on a brief break. This particular new character sent me on a quest to check on his friend, and a chain of other small quests unlocked because I opted to help this one individual who I could have simply walked past had I been mainlining the story missions. I found it interesting because it was an early example of how one small side-quest could begin branching out into a larger, and more involved story beat that I could have easily missed.</p><p>Not only are there human enemies to worry about which will usually have your standard arsenal, but there are also the larger more unpredictable Flesh Mutants, and Bloodsuckers who are extra deadly and can make short work of you if you’re not careful. As well as fields of poppy flowers to navigate (the latter of which sounds quite nice but will put you to sleep forever if you wander too far off the main pathways). Not only does this keep combat and the wastelands of the exclusion zone interesting, but it also offers moments of awe as you look out at the beautiful red sea of poppy flowers knowing you'll need to go in there and carefully navigate it to complete your objective.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>When I finally did find Squint, I was given two options: Confront him with violence and head back to base, or help him survive and be sent on a completely different story branch with him. At first, I took the violent approach, but when I realized it felt a bit anticlimactic to end the journey with a gunfight, so I loaded up a save just before the encounter and went the other way. I couldn’t help but remember the hundreds of hours I played Fallout 3 or Fallout New Vegas – some of my favorite games ever – and experienced that same lingering doubt as to whether or not I made the right decision in a given situation. It may not be special, and a lot of games have used this before, but I hadn’t realized how much I missed this level of nuance. While games like Cyberpunk offered interesting beats to explore, a lot of the stories wound up at the same place. I’m left hopeful that the branching paths can result in some wildly different results in STALKER 2’s case.</p><p>This brief session with STALKER 2, which seemed to start us at the very beginning of the game reminded me just how great a branching style of storytelling can be from a gameplay perspective. Specifically when it’s interwoven as it has been here with STALKER 2. I can’t wait to see what else is in store for the full experience and am able to discover just how far things can unravel.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I couldn’t help but remember the hundreds of hours I played Fallout 3 or Fallout New Vegas – some of my favorite games ever – and experienced that same lingering doubt as to whether or not I made the right decision in a given situation.</p></div><p>Beyond the branches of storytelling you can explore, and the pretty graphics, I also found it really refreshing to be challenged with managing resources like ammunition and food to ensure survival. If you don’t eat enough you’ll fatigue easier and that means worse aim or less stamina with which to run away from a conflict. If you run out of bullets your knife probably won’t cut it in many situations, but you can try to instead use the environment to your advantage by luring opponents into an anomaly or simply convincing them to let you “help” them from a better vantage point. This kind of resource management lends nicely to the overall feeling this oppressive world is trying to convey and it reminds you that every fight should be considered a calculated risk. Do I unload with my AK ammo, or do I try to use a bit of stealth here? Can I get away with using a pistol or do I need to get extra aggressive with an assault rifle for the bigger enemies? Do I tackle this during the night when I can use darkness to my advantage, or would I rather use the sunlight to my advantage for clearer sight? The fact that the designers at GSC Gameworld have struck a balance with how much they give you, at least early on, with the scenarios you’re put in feels like it’s in a great spot right now. Hopefully, that sticks for the rest of STALKER 2 and you don’t become overpowered by the end of the campaign, because this feeling of desperation is what it’s all about.</p><p>I’m left with an eagerness to get back into the world and see what other trouble Skif gets into. Even though November 20 is now less than two months away, STALKER 2 can’t come soon enough.

But obviously James Bond is a different IP. It's a huge IP. It's not our IP. It's actually the first IP that is not our original IP from ground up," Abrak says. </p><p>"But what's exciting about that project is that we actually got to do an original story. So it's not a gamification of a movie. It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future. And equally important and exciting, it's a new Bond. It's a Bond we built from ground up for gamers. It's extremely exciting with all the tradition and all the history there is there together to work on this together with the family of creating a young Bond for gamers; a Bond that the gamers can call their own and grow with."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future</p></div><p>IO Interactive has become famous for stealth games thanks to its work with the Hitman series, which is notable for its open-ended design and wry sense of humor (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/17/sean-bean-will-die-once-more-in-hitman-2">you get to assassinate Sean Bean!</a>). The owners of the James Bond IP were apparently <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/james-bond-owner-didnt-want-another-video-game-until-hitman-developer-pitched-project-007">leery of another game based on 007</a> given the franchise's mixed track record outside of Goldeneye, but IO Interactive was able to convince them otherwise. At the moment, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-franchise-on-hiatus-as-io-interactive-focuses-on-james-bond-game">Hitman franchise is on hiatus</a> while the studio focuses on other projects, but IO Interactive did release a compilation of the Hitman trilogy called <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">World of Assassination</a> in 2023.</p><h2>The James Bond franchise remains "extremely powerful"</h2><p>Since IO Interactive announced that it was working on a Bond game back in 2020, MGM has released No Time to Die, which was a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/no-time-to-die-review">generally well-received sendoff to Daniel Craig</a>. Craig's departure means that the Bond franchise is currently between Bonds, but Abrak says that the license is still very powerful.</p><p>"When we look at the movies, it's one of the top three IPs out there, it's extremely powerful also because it's been, what, almost 15 years since the last game. So it's been a long time. It definitely is something that is not overexposed in gaming. We actually see that as a strength that we can do something very special and hopefully... There's a lot of people out there who think about GoldenEye as the classic. And I love that game as well myself," Abrak says. </p><p>"I don't want to speak too big about it, but I just hope we'll do a thing that will define James Bond in gaming for years to come. And that is not only one game, but that we create a universe for gamers to own for many years to come that we can grow with that next to the Bond on the movies."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Abrak praised the producers of the films for being able to "reinvent Bond throughout the years and keep that IP relevant" and said that IO Interactive have "big, big shoes to fill." Like the legendary secret agent himself, a Project 007 reveal remains frustratingly elusive, but Abrak says that IO Interactive will share more in "due time."</p><p>"I don't have an update today, but believe me, it's itching here as well to be talking about it soon. So we are following our plans. The production's going amazingly well and we will soon be talking more about it. I know it was a little teaser, not a lot of information, but there's a lot of cool stuff coming up," Abrak says. "We are also very excited and when we are ready with that, we'll be opening up."</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat. Have a tip?

It was previously available only to those who hadn’t subscribed to Game Pass before.</p><p>Microsoft is clearly hoping to capitalize on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-wave-2-october-2024-lineup-headlined-by-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">the release of Black Ops 6 straight into Game Pass as a day-one title</a>, and it seems likely that hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people would have used the $1 offer to blast through the campaign and perhaps dip into Multiplayer and Zombies had it been available. IGN has asked Microsoft for comment.</p><p>The Game Pass tiers that include the release of Black Ops 6 are the $19.99 a month Game Pass Ultimate, or, if you’re on PC, the $11.99 a month PC Game Pass. The $14.99 a month Xbox Game Pass Standard tier does not include day-one releases, and so won’t include Black Ops 6.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p>Black Ops 6 is the first Call of Duty game to launch day-one on Game Pass. It comes a year after Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which has also seen the likes of Diablo 4 and Modern Warfare 3 hit the subscription service, and will see StarCraft: Remastered and StarCraft 2: Campaign Collection arrive in November.</p><p>Black Ops 6’s launch straight into Game Pass is a big gamble for Microsoft. It hopes the power of Call of Duty will boost subscriber numbers and revenue (itself bolstered by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-price-hikes-were-inevitable-analysts-say"><u>the recent Game Pass price rise and restructure</u></a>), but it comes with the risk of losing sales of the full-price game.</p><p>While Xbox executives have insisted sales can be boosted by a game’s presence on Game Pass, some publishers remain unconvinced. Former Activision boss Bobby Kotick, for example, was always against putting Call of Duty into subscription services. Unlike Microsoft, console rival Sony does not release its new exclusives straight into its subscription service.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-on-potentially-bringing-call-of-duty-and-other-activision-blizzard-games-to-game-pass"><u>an interview with IGN</u></a> last year, Xbox boss Phil Spencer was asked how he’d handle his and Kotick’s different ideologies after the deal to buy Activision Blizzard closed.

                <p>The developers of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl/" data-ref-id="5000-82469">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> originally thought the game would not possibly run on Xbox Series S due to the console's technical limitations relative to Series X. However, GSC Game World spent time optimizing for the system and unlocked new "streaming" technology to help get the game running on Series S. Now, the studio believes not only will Stalker 2 offer a good experience on Series S, but the company maintains any studio can get their game running on Series S with enough time and resources.</p><p>"At first, we thought bringing Stalker 2 to the Xbox Series S might be impossible. We have such a big game with so many mechanics, a huge amount of things," the studio told <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/stalker-2-interview-xbox-game-pass-xbox-series-x-s-dlc-expansions" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>. "It felt like this must be impossible to do. But then we start optimizing, adding new features for streaming information. Unreal Engine has a lot of features for this, but for our game, we really had to squeeze up every megabyte from every piece of system content we could, and now we did it."</p><p>The developer went on to say it's now "possible for any game to reach the Xbox Series S' memory limits." However, the studio admitted that not every team has the time or the resources to optimize for Series S, however.</p><p>Stalker 2 for Series S runs at a locked 30fps, compared to a goal of 60fps on Series X. It could drop to 55fps during intense sequences, and GSC said it's continuing to optimize to help improve this. For the Series S version of Stalker 2, GSC said it's possible for the game to reach 60fps, but it's not as consistent. "But we're looking to get a performance mode for Xbox Series S, to get it to 60fps. We think it's possible," the developer said.</p><p>Quite a few game developers from across the industry have commented on the Series S console's relative lack of power and how developers needing to support this system might be doing themselves a disservice. For Baldur's Gate 3, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-in-development-for-xbox-but-theres-a-series-s-snag/1100-6511819/" data-ref-id="1100-6511819">issues with the Series S edition held the game's release back.</a></p><p>Stalker 2, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/documentary-shows-stalker-2-is-an-element-of-resistance-amid-russian-invasion-of-ukraine/1100-6526873/" data-ref-id="1100-6526873">developed by GSC in the middle of the Ukraine war with Russia</a>, launches this November and will be available on Game Pass at launch.

More amusing changes that caught our eyes include a fix for Wyll saying hello to you with a negative greeting, even if you're besties, and a fix for a potential crash that could occur "when going full disco on the DualSense lightbar". Funky!
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-next-week-on-pc-bringing-modding-support-and-more-evil-endings">Baldur's Gate 3 has had official mod support on PC</a> since August, but owners of the game's console and Mac versions have been able to join in the fun as of the beginning of October. An <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-says-baldurs-gate-3-console-mods-smashing-records-just-a-week-after-release">impressive 1.7m mods were downloaded over the first 24 hours of their release on consoles</a>, Larian has said. Meanwhile, over on PC, a frankly astonishing 22m mods have been downloaded since August.</p>
<p>
Find the full Baldur's Gate 3 Hotfix #28 patch notes below:
</p>
<p><strong>Modding</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On PS5, the 'Continue' button will now work the same as the 'Load Game' screen in that it won't allow you to start a game if there are any mod issues.</li>
<li>On console, when loading a savegame that has unresolved mod issues, the Mod Verification Window will no longer keep asking you to re-download or uninstall mods when the action has already been taken.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue with mod dependencies not being loaded in the correct order after enabling/disabling some mods.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mod Manager</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the animated downloading bar not appearing in the Mod Verification Window after you click 'Download'.</li>
<li>Fixed the horizontal scrollbar on the Mod Details page not being vertically centred between the arrows that flank it.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug preventing you from opening the Mod Manager on PC when using a controller.</li>
<li>Fixed the button prompts in the Mod Details page not updating correctly when using a controller.</li>
<li>Fixed the filter tags in the Mod Manager not appearing in localised languages and made sure that the English string is shown as a backup in case there's an issue with fetching the translation.</li>
<li>The mod browser scrollbar now resets to the top when you navigate to a previous or next page.</li>
<li>On PS5, the Mod Manager now correctly reports the amount of remaining memory after uninstalling a mod.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could occur when changing pages in the Mod Manager.</li>

<ul>
<li>Improved loading times for players with many mods installed.</li>
<li>You can no longer add items to your wares even if they cannot become wares (e.g. pact weapons) by selecting them along with another item that can become a ware. This prevents a trade exploit where you could sell your wares and the bound items would not leave your inventory. Any more of these up your sleeves?</li>
<li>Fixed Honour Mode features, like Legendary Actions, carrying over to non-Honour-Mode games if you'd previously loaded an Honour Mode save.</li>
<li>On PS5, fixed the DualSense lightbar updating colours every single frame of the game when a new user logs in with a new controller.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/startup-tales-wants-to-let-you-build-your-own-games-with-generative-ai-starting-next-month/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There's a new generative AI startup in town called <a href="https://tales.world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tales</a>, and its goal is to empower gamers and creators to essentially make whatever they want with mere text prompts. According to the press release, the technology is based on a Large World Model (LWM) called Sia. This LWM is allegedly capable of generating all the components of a video game, from environments, 3D models, and gameplay to NPC (non-player character) behavior - along with detailed metadata.</p>
<p>This Large World Model trains on gameplay data, video content, 3D assets, descriptive metadata and feedback over time. It's how the LWM understands how games are structured, thereby improving its ability to understand complex game elements and mechanics. With it, Tales can output fully functional games using 3D engines, spatial reasoning algorithms, and NPC behavior systems.</p>
<p>Following a simple text prompt such as "make a first-person shooter in space", the LWM can generate the requested game, which is instantly playable and can be subsequently customized. While conceived primarily for games, the technology could also be utilized to create virtual reality worlds, interactive experiences, and immersive educational tools.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Tales plans to involve the community in the training process of its LWM. They are launching a rewards-based incentive system where users can submit anything from gameplay footage to in-game assets and extensive environment descriptions. Tales also clarifies that it will be a 'fully transparent dataset,' tracked and documented to ensure provenance and preserve privacy.</p>

<p>Head of Product Jason Krupat says:</p>
<p><em>Tales truly feels like something out of a sci-fi film, and we can’t wait to make it a reality. The gaming industry is in desperate need of a revolution, and putting the power to create in the hands of gamers could be the start of a new era of entertainment that extends far beyond games. A lack of resources should never get in the way of a creative spark, and empowering creators in this way means so much to us.</em></p>
<p>While there are many possible applications of generative AI to gaming, there are several downsides and limitations to such an ambitious project as this one. To start with, there are the legal implications—the trailer already shows 'copies' of Horizon Zero Dawn, Death Stranding, Ghost of Tsushima, Detroit: Become Human, and The Last of Us, to name a few. How long will it be until Sony or others come knocking at Tales' door?</p>
<p>Moreover, while the games generated could look similar to an actual game on a surface level, they will inevitably be much more shallow in terms of gameplay mechanics and features, not to mention storylines or missions. Tales said the games would be 'customizable,' but to what extent? We don't know yet. Anyway, Tales promises to launch its generative Ai technology in early access next month, so we'll learn soon enough.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/plants-vs-zombies/plants-vs-zombies-3/news/soft-launch-announcement-15-oct?isLocalized=true" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement post on its website</a>, EA says that starting from October 15th (which is yesterday), in-app purchases won't be available anymore, and the game will also no longer be available to download, although you'll still be able to play it if you have it installed.</p>
<p>From November 15th,&nbsp;<em>Plants vs. Zombies 3</em>'s servers will go down, and you'll no longer be able to play the game across Android or iOS. That counts for all territories, too.</p>

<p>However, in the name of making the game "truly special", EA says it intends to put a "major overhaul" into effect, although it doesn't go into detail regarding exactly what that overhaul might entail.</p>
<p>EA thanks players for its "enthusiasm and feedback", which, given the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantsVSZombies/comments/1aljvmm/pvz_3_review/">volume</a> of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidGaming/comments/199hdmu/plants_vs_zombies_3_is_atrocious/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">negative</a> responses to&nbsp;<em>Plants vs. Zombies 3</em>'s aforementioned soft launch from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantsVSZombies/comments/19abigc/i_am_thoroughly_disappointed_with_pvz3_and_it/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">disgruntled players</a>, is certainly one way to put it.</p>
<p>Reading between the lines, that's probably the reason for this decision, although of course, EA and PopCap aren't going to admit that the game hasn't connected with people. Well, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantsVSZombies/comments/19aqd00/pvz3_soft_launch_an_update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">not again</a>, anyway.</p>

<p>They have, however, confirmed that your coin balances will be saved "as long as you've connected your account through Google Play, Apple ID, or your EA account". Game progress, however, will be reset when the game does eventually relaunch.</p>

        <p>Asmongold slapped down for racist tirade</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Twitch have temporarily banned an account run by streamer Asmongold, otherwise known as Zack Hoyt, after he expressed genocidal sentiments about Israel's killing of Palestinian people in Gaza. <a href="https://x.com/Slasher/status/1846268530880118852">According to the eSports journalist Rod Breslau</a>, he's been sent to the naughty step for a grand total of two weeks, which I'm sure will be a huge inconvenience and will really teach him the error of his ways. Assuming Breslau's sources are accurate, it's a great demonstration of Twitch's tolerance for streamers with big audiences, the kind of slap on the wrist you'd expect from a platform that recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-reinstates-donald-trumps-account-following-permanent-ban-in-2021">reinstated Donald Trump's account</a> after banning him in 2021 for the charge of inciting an insurrection.</p>
<p><em>Content warning for hate speech in the paragraphs ahead.</em></p>
<p>You will almost certainly know the context, but in case you don't: in October 2023, several Palestinian armed groups led by Hamas, who govern the Gaza strip, broke through the border into Israel and carried out a massacre, killing over a thousand people including civilians and children. Israel's government and military have responded by mounting a year-long invasion of Gaza that has killed over 42,000 Palestinians and reduced the region to ruin. </p>
<p>All this builds on decades of Israeli containment of and intervention within Gaza, which a United Nations special rapporteur has <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/03/israels-55-year-occupation-palestinian-territory-apartheid-un-human-rights">argued is a form of apartheid</a>. The UN have repeatedly <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y5zy1vvmlo">condemned Israel's killing of civilians</a>, together with the atrocities carried out by Hamas, who are still <a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/hamas-took-hundreds-of-hostages-from-israel-where-are-they-now/jqe2346zk">holding a number of Israelis hostage</a>. Back in March this year, another UN special rapporteur <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/03/1147976">argued</a> that there are "reasonable grounds" for defining Israel's current operations in Gaza as genocide.</p>
<p>Asmongold appears to agree that Israel's actions are genocide, but he seemingly thinks the Palestinians deserve it, based on his own, sweepingly racist assessments of Islam and of Palestinian culture. </p>
<p>"If you want to consider it genocide as a systematic killing of a group of people, they have genocide built into Sharia law right now," Asmongold said during the stream, as preserved by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/streaming/asmongold-suspended-from-twitch-following-racist-tirade-about-palestinians/">PCGamer</a>. "So no, I'm not going to cry a fucking river when people who have genocide that's baked into their laws are getting genocided. I don't give a fuck. They're terrible people. It's not even a question. It's crazy that people don't see it that way. They'd be doing the same thing.</p><p>"These people are not your allies," he went on. "They're not the same as us. They come from an inferior culture that is horrible. It kills people for their identity, and it is directly antithetical to everything Western values stand for, and it is an inferior culture in all ways. It is that simple. No, I don't feel bad for them, I don't feel sorry for them, I don't care."</p>
<p>All of this is a clear infringement of Twitch's ban on hate speech. Here's an excerpt from their <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Community-Guidelines">community guidelines</a>: "Twitch does not permit behaviour that is motivated by hatred, prejudice or intolerance, including behaviour that promotes or encourages discrimination, denigration, harassment, or violence based on the following protected characteristics: race, ethnicity, colour, caste, national origin, immigration status, religion, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, serious medical condition, and veteran status."</p>
<p>Naturally, a number of people have lodged complaints about Asmongold's tirade. And of course, he has now apologised. "Looking back on it, I was way too much of an asshole about the Palestine thing," he wrote on <a href="https://x.com/Asmongold/status/1845982422275367189">Xitter</a>, adding "my bad" and "of course no one deserves to have their life destroyed even if they do things or have views I find regressive". In conclusion, "you guys deserve more than me saying stupid shit like that, I'll do better".</p>
<p>Twitch's ban only applies to Asmongold's secondary "Zackrawrr" account, but it also means he can't stream via his primary account either. However, he's still free to publish videos on Youtube, where he has about 4.85 million combined subscribers. Asmongold himself has <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/twitch-leak-reveals-the-sites-highest-paid-streamers/">reportedly earned many millions from Twitch</a>, more than enough on paper to ride out any temporary suspension of service.</p><p>All this is of broader relevance because Twitch, a streaming service that focuses on video games, is absolutely huge. It's one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-visited_websites">the most visited websites in the world</a>. As such, it's a prominent internet "town square" where the most-subscribed streamers can potentially shape the views of millions of people - as the management themselves acknowledged back in 2021, when they shut down Trump's account to avoid any further incitement to violence.</p>
<p>As Asmongold's colleague TipsOutBaby <a href="https://x.com/TipsOut/status/1846302400988303489">has discussed on Twitter</a>, referencing his own experience as a Muslim and child of Syrian immigrants, Asmongold's comments reflect long-established patterns of "calculated dehumanization" that create the conditions for bloodshed, consisting of the same language that is "used to justify wanton violence, genocide, and the destruction of our universal brotherhood". You'd think all that would warrant more than two weeks in the wilds. We asked Twitch for comment about all this yesterday - they haven't responded.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But  it would almost certainly have brought in <em>vast</em> numbers of new customers who’d want to keep playing the live-service multiplayer game after the first fortnight, and would either then buy it outright, or maintain a full-price subscription. Let alone the droves who’d just forget to cancel, which—and sorry to break your sweet, naive heart—is the main reason you put have to put your credit card details in for any of these super-cheap/free short-term offers.</p><p>It’s yet another kick in the ribs to the already down-and-bleeding Game Pass, that has fallen from celebratory “Netflix for games” champion to a confusing mess of mind-boggling tiers and structures.</p><p>Some might even go so far as to wonder if it’s actually a <em>good</em> thing to let massive corporations buy each other for the GDP of small nations until all competition is removed from the market.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As announced during PlayStation’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-new-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Play event</a> in September, Astro Bot will release new content on October 17, which includes a speedrun level and some new bots.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new Astro Bot speedrun level, Building Speed, will test players’ platforming skills and allow them to compete on an online leaderboard with their PlayStation friends. In Building Speed, players will have Barkster, the Bulldog Booster, on their back, which helps them zip around the sky city. You will encounter obstacles like cranes, find crates to smash, and encounter a flying car with your stranded crew on this level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Team Asobi will release new Astro Bot levels every week from October 17 to November 14, starting with Building Speed. Each new level will be available every Thursday at 6:00 AM PT, 2:00 PM BST and 10:00 PM JST. Check out the complete list of upcoming Astrobot speedrun levels and their dates below.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>October 17: Building Speed &nbsp;</li>



<li>October 24: Let it Slide&nbsp;</li>



<li>October 31: Spring-loaded Run&nbsp;</li>



<li>November 7: Helium Heights&nbsp;</li>



<li>November 14: Rising Heat</li>
</ul>



<p>Moreover, along with the Astro Bot speedrun levels, a pair of Special Bots will also arrive each week. 2 Special bots will be released with each level, allowing players to gather another 10. Of these 10, Eve from Stellar Blade and Helldivers have been revealed; players should keep an eye out for the next ones.&nbsp;</p>

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 follows the characters Gustave, Maelle, and their fellow Expeditioners as they embark upon a desperate quest to break a cycle of violence, and they'll be brought to life by Charlie Cox (Daredevil), Ben Starr (Final Fantasy 16), Jennifer English (Baldur's Gate 3), and Venom 2 director Andy Serkis.

Growing up in the city of Lumière, Gustave is described as being hellbent on defeating the Paintress so that the residents of his beloved city will have a future free of her terror. In contrast, English's character Maelle is a shy loner eager to escape the city, and she's the youngest member of the expeditionary force. Starr's character Verso is a dangerous stranger tracking the team's every move, while Serkis plays the role of Renoir, a man relentlessly driven to save his family and ready to make the ultimate sacrifice.</p>

      </div>
<p>Other notable names in the game's cast include Kirsty Rider (Sandman) as Lune and Shala Nyx (The Old Guard) as Sciel. "Developing the characters was a multi-part process, which included charting a detailed history of Lumière and each character’s family history and thinking through how prior generations responded to the Paintress," lead writer and voice producer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen explained in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/16/introducing-the-cast-of-clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog post</a>. "These factors all played a role in who each character is and what they are trying to overcome."</p><p>The new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 trailer also had a glimpse of several new gameplay features in the action-RPG, like traversal elements, new locations, and a quick look at the Golgra and The Tisseur enemies that will test the reflexes of players when they encounter them.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/this-unreal-engine-5-rpg-looks-stunning-gamescom-2024/2300-6465005/">First revealed during the June Xbox Games Showcase</a>, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is scheduled to launch in 2025 for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5. The game has a striking art direction inspired by the Belle Époque art period of 20th-Century France, and its gameplay mixes real-time actions like dodges, parries, and counters with traditional turn-based combat.</p>

                <p>A developer at Halo Infinite support studio Certain Affinity has listed a "canceled battle royale mode" for the game on their <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-clopper-9300811/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">LinkedIn resume</a>. This person said they were in charge of a "large team of designers" making this unannounced mode that "could have been a game-changer for the franchise."</p><p>The developer, Mike Clopper, said, "We loved playing it and working on it was a fantastic experience in spite of its cancellation."</p><p>Clopper now works at Call of Duty studio Raven Software as studio design director, having joined the team just this month ahead of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/" data-ref-id="1100-6523361">Black Ops 6</a>'s launch on October 25.</p><p>A battle royale mode for Halo Infinite had been rumored for years. It was reportedly in the works under the codename Project Tatanka before being rebranded to Project Ekhert in 2023 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rumored-halo-battle-royale-project-seemingly-canceled/1100-6520335/" data-ref-id="1100-6520335">later canceled</a>. A <a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/1841149602625356083" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report from Rebs Gaming</a> said the game was tied into the Halo Infinite narrative and was playtested on a weekly basis. The report said the game took place on a sprawling map featuring unique biomes. It was ultimately canceled, the report said, in part due to a shift toward working on the next Halo projects instead.</p><p>Halo Infinite never got an official battle royale mode like what was reportedly in the works, but the game did introduce a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinites-battle-royale-like-last-spartan-standing-mode-revealed/1100-6502683/" data-ref-id="1100-6502683">battle-royale-like mode called Last Spartan Standing in 2022.</a></p><p dir="ltr">With games like Fortnite, Apex Legends, PUBG, Call of Duty: Warzone, and others dominating the headlines and sparking conversations about battle royale, it was only logical that attention would eventually turn to Halo. In July 2018, Halo franchise writer Jeff Easterling poured cold water on the idea of Halo Infinite featuring a battle royale mode by <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22I%27ll+tell+you+right+now%2C+the+only+BR+we%27re+interested+in+is+Battle+Rifle.%22&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS940US940&amp;oq=%22I%27ll+tell+you+right+now%2C+the+only+BR+we%27re+interested+in+is+Battle+Rifle.%22&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saying</a>, "I'll tell you right now, the only BR we're interested in is Battle Rifle."</p><p dir="ltr">In April 2019, noted Microsoft insider Brad Sams <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1l2OLHse1M"><ins>reported</ins></a> that 343 was <em>considering </em>the possibility of adding a battle royale mode to Halo Infinite in some form. Sams reported that Halo Infinite's take on battle royale would offer something different compared to Fortnite and Apex, but we never learned any specifics.</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spencer-halo-infinite-is-not-a-make-or-break-moment-for-the-series-doesnt-need-battle-royale/1100-6493415/" data-ref-id="1100-6493415">said in an interview</a> that Halo Infinite never <em>needed </em>a battle royale mode in the first place.</p><p dir="ltr">"With a lot of the innovations and evolutions that have happened in FPS multiplayer over the years, there was something very pure about coming back to a Halo arena experience and how clean it was and how tight the gameplay loop was," he said. "Right now on our platform there are not a lot of games that are going back to that tried and true formula and perfecting what they have, and I think that's what the goal of this team is."</p><p dir="ltr">Halo Infinite launched in 2021 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-becomes-biggest-halo-launch-of-all-time/1100-6499962/" data-ref-id="1100-6499962">found quick success out of the gate</a>, but it failed to break through like Microsoft wanted it to. Recently, Microsoft said Halo Infinite represented the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">"last remnant" of how Halo games are made</a>, with the team significantly changing its development processes going forward. Xbox boss Matt Booty said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-launch-was-like-a-runner-tripping-and-falling-at-the-finish-line-xbox-boss-says/1100-6508915/" data-ref-id="1100-6508915">Halo Infinite's launch was like a runner who trips and falls at the finish line.</a></p><p>343 Industries recently changed names to Halo Studios and is now developing multiple new Halo games using Unreal Engine 5.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/it-sure-seems-like-xsolla-wants-to-take-a-bite-out-platform-cuts-from-steam-other-platform-owners<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On a train ride out of Gamescom, I chanced on a pair of junior developers scrutinizing their own lanyards, which sported Xsolla's branding. "Who even IS Xsolla?" one of them asked, as they commented on how they'd seen the branding at all kinds of events over the last year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ever the eavesdropper, I leaned in to answer the question. I'm not just familiar with the firm because we've covered them </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/xsolla-names-cathleen-nilson-as-new-chief-financial-officer">a fair few times</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on Game Developer, but because just a few hours earlier I'd been chatting with a pair of their executives at their trade area booth. I wasn't surprised at their confusion. Most people don't get into game development to multiply conversions or build digital rewards programs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But Xsolla has, and it's done so aggressively across the globe. Its biggest win might be its ability to act as a monetization bridge between major game studios and territories they don't traditionally operate in.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I'd hopped into my conversation with Chief strategy officer Chris Hewish and senior VP of EMEA Chris Meredith intending to ask about those territories—but our conversation took a turn that surprised me. We'd been discussing the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-the-heck-is-happening-with-live-service-games-">struggles of live service games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> when Meredith took a verbal swipe at the "gatekeepers" keeping developers from selling directly to players.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/xsolla-and-savvy-games-set-to-launch-development-academy-in-saudi-arabia" target="_self">Xsolla and Savvy Games set to launch development academy in Saudi Arabia</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That jolted me out of my jet lag—and helped me reframe something the pair had said earlier. They'd spoken repeatedly about the idea of "democratizing the business of gaming," to allow developers to sell digitally to players directly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, it sure sounded like they were saying they'd like to take a chunk out of the platform business.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Xsolla isn't a fan of &quot;the gatekeepers&quot;">Xsolla isn't a fan of "the gatekeepers"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meredith's response to my question about live service games began with a typical analysis of how saturated the market had become, particularly in Europe, one of the territories under "EMEA" he supervises Xsolla's business in.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's an awfully congested market," he said, in reference to the high number of games releasing every year. "We still have the gatekeepers doing what they're doing in that respect as well."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Wait, which gatekeepers was he talking about? Government regulators? The App Store? Steam?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He didn't say. And it sure sounded like he was scrambling to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>not</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> drop any proper nouns as our conversation moved forward. "I mean all of the ones that are still operating in their way in regards to the operation of how they bring their products to market," he said. He pivoted to an explanation of how advertisers are looking to advertise directly to players. "For us, with the relationship with the advertisers bringing their products to market, we are very much aware of trying to put them on the track of the [direct-to-consumer] roadmap, and if you're a small three man developer, that's quite challenging."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He alluded generally to how hard it is for smaller developers to obtain market share when there are so many games with high "brand loyalty," but kept pivoting back to the idea that helping those developers go direct to players (and consequentially, any advertisers on their games go direct to players too), was a big part of Xsolla's plans.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meredith agreed, noting the live service market is still a "very healthy business," saying they are seeing more developers go direct-to-consumer. He also implied that analyses of the video game market may not have access to any data from those companies, warping what the overall state of the video game economy looks like.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's factors like that that made Meredith call the overwhelming layoffs of 2023-2024 a "defensive, reactionary" move by companies, rather than a reflection of the health of the market itself.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Which companies should be standing at the gate?">Which companies should be standing at the gate?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All this talk of "democratization" and helping devs sell directly to players through their own websites or marketplaces is pretty ambitious talk. But it's not happening in isolation. Epic Games' legal assaults on Apple's iOS App Store and the Google Play Store, as well as its aggressive attempts to compete with Steam paint a picture of corporations frustrated by how platform holders shape the markets they control.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Xsolla's pitch isn't exactly "down with the App Store/Play Store/Steam," but it sure sounds like "devs should be allowed to sell to players without anyone else taking a cut."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Well, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>almost</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> anybody. I'm sure Xsolla itself would love to have just the teeniest nibble of the transactions that cross its platforms, and pick up a bit of the revenue previously bound for the "gatekeepers" described by Hewish.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>, the developer of Hitman, has announced it is taking on publishing duties for MindsEye, the big-budget action adventure in the works from former Rockstar exec Leslie Benzies. 
</p>
<p>
The development of MindsEye, at Benzies' own Build A Rocket Boy studio, has been shrouded in secrecy ever since it was announced as a component of Everywhere - the company's attempt at a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> or Roblox game creation platform. 
</p>
<p>
Today's announcement curiously makes no reference to Everywhere, other than a line at the very bottom of IO's press release which states "MindsEye is an Everywhere world", suggesting some connection between the two remains. Everywhere's website suggests the platform remains beta. Eurogamer has contacted Build A Rocket Boy for an update.

<p>
For now, at least, it looks like MindsEye is being pushed centre stage. It is described by IO as a "highly anticipated cinematic AAA, story-driven action-adventure thriller" created by Benzies, who held a key role at GTA maker Rockstar before his fractious departure in 2016.
</p>
<p>
"From day one, Build A Rocket Boy Studios has been focused on creating the next generation of compelling gaming and quality entertainment experiences," Benzies said in a statement today.
</p>
<p>
"We can't wait to share our first AAA premium game and ever-evolving universe, MindsEye, with the world. There is no finer partner than IO Interactive to publish our first title, with their strong understanding of community culture, premium action-adventure games, and a best-in-class publishing team, we really look forward to partnering with them on our new blockbuster journey."
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-producers-not-crypto-project-everywhere-is-part-episodic-blockbuster-part-roblox-rival">Eurogamer visited Build A Rocket Boy's flagship Edinburgh studio early last year</a>, when Everywhere was being seen as the studio's major focus. A game-creation platform built using Unreal Engine, it looked ambitious, if well funded by money from investor NetEase. 
</p>
<p>
Benzies' description today of MindsEye being an ever-evolving universe may refer to what he discussed with me previously of the game being episodic, with different chapters adding further forms of gameplay. (The connection to Everywhere, here, was that the game's assets and gameplay would then become available to players to create their own experiences using these parts.)
</p>
<p>
Build A Rocket Boy was originally founded in 2016 and has a network of studios globally in Edinburgh, Budapest, Montpellier and in China. While there's no mention today of when we'll see MindsEye arrive, a launch in 2025 would see the studio finally release its first project after nine years. (The launch would also align with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, amusingly.)
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/layoffs-hit-gta-producers-everywhere-studio">the studio confirmed it had suffered job losses globally</a>, a month after completing a fresh $110m funding round.

            <p>Andy Serkis, Ben Starr, Jennifer English and more will star in forthcoming turn-based RPG Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, as revealed in a brand new trailer.</p>
<p>While Starr (Clive in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a>) and English (Shadowheart in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>) were known to be voicing characters, the rest of the cast was until now unknown. Serkis is, of course, best known for playing Gollum in the Lord of the Rings films and is no stranger to video games following his work at Ninja Theory.</p>
<p>English will be joined by other Baldur's Gate 3 cast mates Devora Wilde and Tracy Wiles, while the likes of Charlie Cox (Stardust), Kirsty Rider (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a>), Shala Nyx (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty</a>), and Rich Keeble (Good Omens) will all feature.</p>

<p>Alongside the cast reveal, the new trailer (above) shows off more gameplay and its surreal world. Further details have also been provided in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/16/introducing-the-cast-of-clair-obscur-expedition-33/">PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>
<p>Cox, English and Rider will play Gustave, Maelle, and Lune respectively, characters seen in previous trailers.</p>
<p>Serkis will play Renoir, a "forceful and passionate man" who "knows that victory demands sacrifice"; while Starr will play the "dangerous stranger" Verso. It's unknown exactly what roles these characters will play in the story.</p>
<p>While Eurogamer is yet to go hands-on with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, I was very impressed with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-fresh-take-on-rpg-traditions-could-revitalise-the-genre">hands-off preview prior to Gamescom</a>, thanks to its inspiration from classic RPGs from the Final Fantasy and Persona series.</p>
<p>The game has also been praised for its action-focused turn-based combat. "I was expecting turn-based fans to stand up and say 'oh this looks cool', but I wasn't expecting this community to be that excited actually," creative director Guillaume Broche told me. "It's like we awakened a sleeping dragon."</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is set for release in Spring next year across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam, Epic), and will be available on Game Pass day one.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/insensitive-assassins-creed-shadows-figurine-controversy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>has found itself in yet more trouble, this time over a collector's figurine depicting protagonists Yasuke and Naoe alongside a one-legged Torii gate.</p>
<p>As reported <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-figure-removed-from-sale-over-insensitive-design" rel="noopener" target="_blank">by IGN</a>, collectible company PureArts <a href="https://x.com/PureArtsLimited/status/1846193318742434183" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said yesterday</a>&nbsp;that it is "reworking the design" of its Qlectors Yasuke &amp; Naoe figurine, which it says had an "insensitive design" that caused "concerns" from which it has subsequently learned.</p>
<p>The figurine in question was <a href="https://x.com/PureArtsLimited/status/1836873014085914794" rel="noopener" target="_blank">originally revealed back in September</a>&nbsp;and depicted the two protagonists of <i>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</i>next to (or atop, in Naoe's case) a Torii gate with one pillar instead of the standard two.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/purearts-assassins-creed-shadows-figurine-offensive.jpg?itok=Zb30fbjO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/purearts-assassins-creed-shadows-figurine-offensive.jpg?itok=Zb0JXuXX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some took exception to this PureArts figurine of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>protagonists Yasuke and Naoe.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with Torii gates, they can be found near Japanese religious shrines, and they traditionally represent the boundary between the human and divine realms.</p>
<p>The one-legged Torii gate, however, has specific significance; as IGN points out, perhaps the most famous one-legged Torii gate in the world <a href="https://www.discover-nagasaki.com/en/sightseeing/117" rel="noopener" target="_blank">can be found at Nagasaki's Sanno shrine</a>, and it stands as a memorial to the devastation caused by the atomic bomb being dropped on the city in 1945.</p>
<p>It's unlikely that Ubisoft or PureArts intended to cause any offense by depicting a one-legged Torii gate in the figurine, but this is just the latest blunder in a series of misfortunes that have surrounded&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date">its announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Almost as soon as the game was revealed, some began to take exception to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-controversy">depiction of protagonist Yasuke</a> (a real-life historical figure) as a samurai, a point about which those taking offense say there is some contention.</p>

<p>This isn't even the first time an ancillary piece of media or art relating to&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>has caused controversy.</p>
<p>Back in July, Ubisoft found itself in trouble when a piece of art in the game's Collector's Edition artbook was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-concept-art-apology">found to use the flag of a Sekigahara re-enactment group</a> without its permission.</p>
<p>Not only that, but&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>was also recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february">delayed to February next year</a>&nbsp;as part of what appears to be a company-wide strategy rethink at Ubisoft, triggered by the underperformance of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>.</p>
<p>This is all against the backdrop of some of Ubisoft's investors&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter">urgently suggesting a change in management</a>, with bosses the Guillemots and Tencent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-bosses-tencent-private-buyout-report">reportedly considering taking the company private</a> in response.</p>

            <p>Back in September, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> publisher Ubisoft put out a 3-days-weekly return to office mandate for their entire staff worldwide - a decision that French Video Game Workers Union (STJV) <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/09/call-for-strike-for-all-french-ubisoft-entities-on-october-15-16-and-17-2024/">said was</a> "made without any tangible justification or any consultation with the workers’ representatives". In response, the STJV called on staff in France to hold a three-day strike beginning yesterday, which the union reports to be underway with the participation of more than 700 workers, via <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/10/15/ubisoft-staff-in-france-strike-over-home-working_6729463_4.html">Le Monde</a>.</p>
<p>"This decision is announced immediately after the failure of the profit-sharing negotiations," STJV wrote at the time. “Exactly like previous salary negociations: management’s proposals were inacceptable, the negotiations’ timetable was appalling, and management was deaf to the proposals of the various Employee representatives."</p>

<p>"After more than five years of working efficiently in the current remote-work context, many of our colleagues have built or rebuilt their lives (family life, housing, parenthood, etc.) and simply cannot return to the previous working conditions," the union wrote. "Our employer knows this perfectly well. The consequence of its decision will be the loss of our colleagues’ jobs, the disorganisation of many game projects, and the drastic increase in psychosocial risks for those who remain."</p><p>The tactic that the STJV refer to here, sometimes called ‘soft layoffs’, is the argument that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/12/why-rto-mandates-are-layoffs-in-disguise-according-to-workplace-experts.html">RTO mandates </a>are a deliberate ploy on the part of an employer to restructure a workforce without firing workers outright - an approach that disproportionately affects clinically vulnerable people and others who can't work in the office without reasonable adjustments. Back in July, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-citizen">Star Citizen</a> developer Cloud Imperium were fined for discrimination after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-citizen-devs-cloud-imperium-fined-for-discriminating-against-autistic-programmer-over-work-from-home-request">dismissing an autistic senior programmer</a>, following his requests to work from home being denied.</p>
<p>"Unions said they had received no response to the grievances aired in February," write Le Monde. "The September message was ‘the straw that broke the camel's back'". Clement Montigny of the STJV union told Agence France-Presse (AFP) the move to in-person working broke promises made to staff and "calls into question the way they organise their lives."</p>
<p>The STJV’s demands include a formal agreement on remote work ("not an arbitrary decision taken several months in advance"), an increase in all salaries "to compensate for the drop in our living standards,” and “actually listening to employees opinion. Management seems indeed to confuse monologue with dialogue."</p>
<p>Speaking to AFB and Le Monde at the strikes, a designer at Ubisoft described the atmosphere as "gloomy", and said staff were disillusioned and feeling as though they weren’t being listened to.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a Bloomberg report suggested that Ubisoft owners Tencent and the Guillemot family <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-buyout-of-ubisoft-report-says">were considering a buyout</a>. Regarding affairs mildly stabtastic, Ubisoft announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> will be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-due-to-ubisoft-finally-listening-to-developers-pushing-for-a-delay-for-some-time-says-report">coming to Steam day one</a>, following delays.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
