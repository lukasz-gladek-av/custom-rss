            <p>A remaster of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>, the grid-based strategy spin-off from the RPG series that easily ranks as one of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-final-fantasy-games-pc">best Final Fantasy games ever made</a>, is reportedly in the works - giving hope of its first official PC release.</p>

<p>Rumours have abounded about a remaster or re-release of Final Fantasy Tactics since at least 2021, when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hopes-for-god-of-war-on-pc-stoked-by-leaked-nvidia-list">a list of games datamined from Nvidia’s GeForce Now streaming service leaked out</a>, including PlayStation exclusives like God of War - which has since come to PC - alongside apparent ports of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy 9</a> and FF Tactics. Nvidia later <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-responds-to-geforce-now-database-leak-says-list-included-speculative-titles/">confirmed the list was real</a>, but described the titles as “speculative” releases rather than confirmation of their existence.</p>
<p>Talk of a Tactics remaster has been kicking around for a while, and recently came back into discussion in the wake of the recent drama around prolific Persona and JRPG leaker Midori, who <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1801044892300267796">revealed themselves</a> to be a previously blacklisted male American leaker who resurfaced under the guise of a Japanese woman (complete with tweets apparently composed deliberately in broken English, ew). Prior to their admittance of being a fraud, Midori had been sharing apparent details about a Final Fantasy Tactics remaster. (Thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-rumoured-final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-is-reportedly-real">Eurogamer</a>.)</p>
<p>Though the truth of the Tactics remaster was called into question following Midori’s fall from grace - the account was also found to have made inaccurate claims about upcoming RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/visions-of-mana">Visions of Mana</a> - Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier jumped in to add some weight to the claims.</p>
<p>“The Final Fantasy Tactics remaster is real and happening,” Schreier <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1de4kcu/comment/l8aa74v/">responded</a> to a thread discussing the credibility of the details on Reddit.</p>

<p>Schreier’s report - brief as it is - contrasts comments made by Tactics director Yasumi Matsuno in December, when he <a href="https://twitter.com/YasumiMatsuno/status/1729771931522470343?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1729771931522470343%7Ctwgr%5E5e6d5af26c884fa458dd8e1c1bab4bacc7ac0b9c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Ffinal-fantasy-tactics-remaster-rumours-squashed-by-director">told a fan on TwiXer</a> that “currently, there are no plans for remastering [Tactics]”.</p>
<p>If a Tactics remake does find its way onto PC, it’ll mark the first time that the 1997 spin-off has been officially available to play away from the original PlayStation. A revamped version of Tactics, subtitled The War of the Lions, featuring full-motion cutscenes, an expanded roster of characters and multiplayer, as well as a 16:9 resolution, was released for the PlayStation Portable in 2007, before later finding its way onto mobile.</p>
<p>The closest that Tactics has come to PC to date is MMO <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy XIV</a>, which used its world of Ivalice (shared with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xii">Final Fantasy 12</a>) and an alternative storyline as inspiration for the Return to Ivalice series of raids.</p>

As the definitive version of 2021’s <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em>, <em>Vengeance </em>is a stellar turn-based adventure that I can easily recommend to RPG fans and monster collecting fanatics alike. For <em>Persona </em>fans who are curious about the series those games spun off from, this is a great place to start.</p><p>Of course, if you’re new to <em>Shin Megami Tensei—</em>or it’s just been a while since you played it—you may have some trouble getting your bearings. After all, the series has a (frankly overexaggerated) reputation for its difficulty. So to help you on your way, here are 10 tips that should help ease you into the opening hours of <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</em>. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="eb31bda6355b3e9a315ef5f17eb29846" data-recommend-id="image://eb31bda6355b3e9a315ef5f17eb29846" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Essence screen in Shin Megami Tensei V." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Essence screen in Shin Megami Tensei V." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="eb31bda6355b3e9a315ef5f17eb29846" data-recommend-id="image://eb31bda6355b3e9a315ef5f17eb29846" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Essence screen in Shin Megami Tensei V." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Essences in <em>Shin Megami Tensei </em>are kind of like TMs from the <em>Pokemon </em>games—they’ll let you improve and embellish your party’s skills. By using them on either your protagonist or your demons in the World of Shadows (which will appear at the Leyline Fount save points once you’ve made enough story progress), you can learn spells that help round out your party’s elemental coverage. You may feel tempted to hold onto your Essences in case you need them later, but I’d strongly advise against this.</p><p><em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em> gives out Essences like candy. You may have difficulty grinding out a specific Essence in some cases, but generally speaking, you’ll only find progressively better Essences as you progress. By the time you’ve spent only a few hours in Da’at, you’ll already find Essences that outclass the ones you started out with. Don’t struggle trying to make your party’s default skill sets work; use what you got to flesh out your kits! </p><p> Remember, Demons can pass on skills whenever you fuse them, including ones they’ve learned via Essences. Additionally, as you advance the main story, you’ll have the option of buying Essences from the Cadaver’s Hollow shop. <em>Vengeance </em>even marks Essences you can purchase with a distinct symbol (pictured above). So if you’re the type who plays <em>Final Fantasy </em>games feeling too afraid to ever use a Megalixir, that should ease your anxiety.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="58fc65f9ca372198c0965bce55d45f7d" data-recommend-id="image://58fc65f9ca372198c0965bce55d45f7d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Battling in Shin Megami Tensei V." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Battling in Shin Megami Tensei V." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="58fc65f9ca372198c0965bce55d45f7d" data-recommend-id="image://58fc65f9ca372198c0965bce55d45f7d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Battling in Shin Megami Tensei V." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Another cool feature of Essences is that you can use them to change your protagonist’s weaknesses and resistances. This does require the “Divine Amalgamation” Miracle, but you’ll fortunately gain access to this early in the game. By selecting “Essence Fusion’’ and then “Affinities,” after selecting your protagonist in the World of Shadows, you can select which monster’s defenses you’d wish the Nahobino to mirror. You’ll want to do this as soon as you find a suitable Essence, as by default, your Protagonist has a dangerous weakness to Mudo.</p><p>For those new to <em>Shin Megami Tensei </em>games, Hama and Mudo (the Light and Darkness elements, respectively) have unique properties. Not only do these elements inflict damage in <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em>, they can instantly KO anyone who is weak to them. Considering that you’ll instantly get a Game Over if your protagonist loses all his health, sticking him with a perpetual Mudo weakness is courting disaster. All it takes is one unlucky battle where the enemies attack first and you’ll immediately lose all your progress without recourse.</p><p>For the early game, <strong>Cait Sith </strong>and <strong>Halphas </strong>are <em>mostly </em>neutral Essences that should keep your protagonist from becoming a liability. <strong>Unicorn </strong>and <strong>Apsaras </strong>are also helpful, as they pack resistances to the <strong>Charm </strong>status effect as well. We’ll get back to why this is important later. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c655d580970038440d0eeba1acaae67f" data-recommend-id="image://c655d580970038440d0eeba1acaae67f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A big save swirl." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A big save swirl." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c655d580970038440d0eeba1acaae67f" data-recommend-id="image://c655d580970038440d0eeba1acaae67f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A big save swirl." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Even if you protect your protagonist from instant-death spells, your party is far from invincible. <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em> doesn’t have random battles, but you never know when a quest or a story beat is going to lead into a boss fight. You can’t predict the future, but you can prepare for it by saving as frequently as you can.</p><p>Fortunately, <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance </em>allows players to save at any time. In fact, there’s a shortcut for it (Left on the D-Pad for controller users, the “4” key for those using a mouse and keyboard). You can save by visiting Leyline Founts too, but you don’t <em>have </em>to use those. Aogami will warn you when boss battles are coming up in the main story, so those are always a good time to save. But whenever you’re approaching side quest objectives, you should record your progress just in case. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2a12dc0c7af7576d3703555a903de432" data-recommend-id="image://2a12dc0c7af7576d3703555a903de432" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="It's a matador." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="It's a matador." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2a12dc0c7af7576d3703555a903de432" data-recommend-id="image://2a12dc0c7af7576d3703555a903de432" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="It's a matador." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Items are incredibly useful in <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em>. They essentially give any human characters access to on-demand healing <em>and </em>a full array of elemental attacks, which can easily turn the tides in battle when you’re in a pinch. While you’ll want to keep at least a few of each item on hand, prioritize grabbing Spyglasses as soon as you access the Cadaver’s Hollow shop.</p><p>Spyglasses are your “Scan” spell. They instantly reveal an enemy’s weaknesses and their moveset, which is invaluable in boss battles. While you <em>can </em>ascertain this information via trial and error, you’ll typically waste turns in battle while running the risk that the enemy might block or reflect your attacks. Spyglasses are so cheap that you don’t have much of an excuse not to use them. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c0fb6c307d2930b5a0a36e5b91acb428" data-recommend-id="image://c0fb6c307d2930b5a0a36e5b91acb428" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sentient apostrophe, Mitama." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sentient apostrophe, Mitama." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c0fb6c307d2930b5a0a36e5b91acb428" data-recommend-id="image://c0fb6c307d2930b5a0a36e5b91acb428" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sentient apostrophe, Mitama." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you’re a fan of the <em>Persona </em>series, you’ve probably fused a Mitama once or twice before. However, in <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em>, Mitama are much more than generic demons. Instead, these are your equivalent to the Metal Slimes in <em>Dragon Quest</em>, or Audino in <em>Pokemon Black &amp; White</em>. Mitamas drop valuable loot when defeated, including consumable items to level up your party and relics you can sell for cash.</p><p>You’ll occasionally see Mitama roaming the overworld. If you have a demon companion, they might dig up a Mitama when they spot points of interest too. The catch is that Mitamas resist all but one element that’s randomized every battle, and if you don’t kill it on turn one, it’ll most likely run away. This is another reason why Spyglasses are so valuable: they all but guarantee a successful encounter with a Mitama.</p><p>When you encounter a Mitama, have the Nahobino use a Spyglass. If it’s weak to an element that your active party can’t use, let the next party member switch out for one who knows the spell you need. Let the remaining party members use “Pass,” which will trigger extra turns that will let you wrap around to the ally whose spell you need. Defeat the Mitama, collect your rewards, and repeat whenever the opportunity arises.</p><p>Alternatively, the Almighty element essentially indicates that an attack is neutral. Enemies aren’t weak to it, but neither do they resist it. So once your party starts to learn some Almighty moves, you can use these during Mitama encounters as well.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="44fb714bde1aded8c3f22f95615347fc" data-recommend-id="image://44fb714bde1aded8c3f22f95615347fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Caspar the friendly ghost wears a fox hat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Caspar the friendly ghost wears a fox hat." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="44fb714bde1aded8c3f22f95615347fc" data-recommend-id="image://44fb714bde1aded8c3f22f95615347fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Caspar the friendly ghost wears a fox hat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Shin Megami Tensei V </em>doesn’t necessarily have many “best spells,” since an attack that dominates one boss battle could be useless in the next. However, buff and debuff skills are almost always worth having on your team. Even a strong boss monster can feel like a common enemy encounter after you lower its attack, defenses, and accuracy.</p><p>Granted, you don’t want to go too overboard on support skills. Meticulously casting Tarujaka eight times to boost your party’s offenses isn’t necessarily great turn economy. But considering the sheer number of monsters you can keep in your party at any time, you’d do well to diversify your buff and debuffs just as much as your elemental coverage.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="19b81ae01c413654d3499c68cba03709" data-recommend-id="image://19b81ae01c413654d3499c68cba03709" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The extraordinarily detailed stat screen for Kikuri-Hime." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The extraordinarily detailed stat screen for Kikuri-Hime." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="19b81ae01c413654d3499c68cba03709" data-recommend-id="image://19b81ae01c413654d3499c68cba03709" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The extraordinarily detailed stat screen for Kikuri-Hime." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Speaking of elemental coverage, don’t make the mistake of only focusing on your offenses without paying attention to your defenses. <em>Shin Megami Tensei V </em>uses the series’ signature “Press Turn” battle system, which rewards your party with extra turns whenever you hit an enemy’s weakness or score a critical hit. However, this <em>also </em>applies to the enemy party. Even if your demon can shrug off taking the extra damage of an attack it’s weak to, it’ll put your entire party at risk of a wipe if an enemy party exploits that weakness to hit you up to six more times in a single turn.</p><p>For this reason, you often don’t want to assign specific niches to each party member that no one else can fill. Instead, spread your support skills and elemental attacks across demons with varying weaknesses to avoid the risk of letting an enemy pin you. Additionally, passive skills like Resist Fire can cover up a demon’s weakness and make it viable in more encounters. If a boss monster is giving you trouble, focus on building demons that best resist its attacks.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3de480ef4c9b6475047c3d5edd89f8f3" data-recommend-id="image://3de480ef4c9b6475047c3d5edd89f8f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A blue-haired lady stares in astonishment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A blue-haired lady stares in astonishment." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3de480ef4c9b6475047c3d5edd89f8f3" data-recommend-id="image://3de480ef4c9b6475047c3d5edd89f8f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A blue-haired lady stares in astonishment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This tip’s a bit more specific than the others.

You’ll encounter a recurring boss early on in <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance </em>whose signature move is a party-wide Charm spell, which can massively debilitate your entire party. If you aren’t prepared to counter status ailments, this enemy in particular can turn into a real pain.</p><p>To handle this, <strong>Apsaras </strong>is one of the lowest level demons you can find who has full immunity to Charm. Additionally, she naturally learns Petra, which cleanses an ally of status ailment. Later, you can also fuse Vouivre, who carries the <strong>Willpower </strong>innate skill. Willpower specifically minimizes the effects of Charm as long as she’s in the party, allowing you to (somewhat) circumvent the entire mechanic.</p><p>Remember, Amrita Soda also cleanses status ailments, and any human character can use items.

It can feel overwhelming at times, especially if you’re just wondering when the next story beat will finally pop up. But to really get the most out of the game, your best option is to simply take your time.</p><p>You’ll inevitably reach points where your party is too under-leveled, either because you’re stuck on a boss or you need to get stronger to recruit new demons. And, sure, you could grind regular encounters to level up, but where’s the fun in that? Taking the time to uncover new corners of the map and complete side quests will naturally take care of that grind for you, plus you’ll earn several key items in the process. You might not need every Magatsuhi skill in the game, but you’ll enjoy having them nonetheless.</p><p>So much of <em>Shin Megami Tensei</em>’s appeal comes from getting lost in its mechanics. Fusing the perfect monsters and uncovering cool new combat synergies can consume hours of your life alone. So relax, take in the sights, and only advance to your next story objective when you feel ready to. And please, for the love of whatever god rules over Da’at, don’t lose an hour of progress because your main character has a Mudo weakness. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

One of Echoes' new activities is available from the start of the Episode, but the second, Enigma Protocol, requires uncovering some secrets on Nessus to access.</p><p dir="ltr">Enigma Protocol sends you back into the Vex Network, that strange, ethereal computer world that players first explored during the Season of the Splicer two years ago. It's a tough, high-level activity for three players that has you constantly running against a timer; if the timer runs out, you have to start the activity over.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a lot to know about Enigma Protocol, starting with how to unlock the mission through the Encoded Log quest. Here are all the details.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_To_Unlock_Enigma_Protocol">How To Unlock Enigma Protocol</a></li><li><a href="#How_Enigma_Protocol_Works_And_How_To_Extend_The_Timer">How Enigma Protocol Works And How To Extend The Timer</a></li><li><a href="#Enigma_Protocol_Encounters">Enigma Protocol Encounters</a><ul><li><a href="#Networked_Grid_1">Networked Grid-1</a></li><li><a href="#Experimental_Grid_1">Experimental Grid-1</a></li><li><a href="#Networked_Grid_2">Networked Grid-2</a></li><li><a href="#Experimental_Grid_2">Experimental Grid-2</a></li><li><a href="#Bridge_1">Bridge-1</a></li><li><a href="#Archival_Grid_1">Archival Grid-1</a></li><li><a href="#Networked_Grid_4">Networked Grid-4</a></li><li><a href="#Experimental_Grid_3">Experimental Grid-3</a></li><li><a href="#Experimental_Grid_4">Experimental Grid-4</a></li><li><a href="#Networked_Grid_3">Networked Grid-3</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_To_Unlock_Enigma_Protocol">How To Unlock Enigma Protocol</h2><p dir="ltr">Though Enigma Protocol is a repeatable activity you'll probably want to run a few times every week throughout Act 1 of Echoes, you don't immediately get access to it. Instead, you'll have to complete some tasks for Failsafe, the Episode's primary vendor. Start by completing the introductory mission to Echoes; it'll load automatically when you log in after completing the campaign for The Final Shape. If for some reason you miss it or come back later, look for the node to start the mission on the Nessus Director screen.</p><p dir="ltr">After the introductory mission and a bout of the new Breach Executable activity, return to Failsafe. She should eventually have a new quest for you, called <strong>Encoded Log</strong>. Grab that and read the description: It'll tell you that some Hidden agents have been picking up on some weirdness on Nessus, specifically in the <strong>Well of Echoes</strong> location.</p><p dir="ltr">You can find the Well of Echoes in the area called The Tangle. Transmat in and ride your sparrow over to the big cylindrical structure on the western end of the area. Head inside and continue delving downward until you reach a teleporter. Through it, the path will continue to take you downward, until you meet a mess of enemies. Leading them is a shielded Minotaur, and you'll see Vex cubes in the air that will need to be destroyed in order to make the Minotaur vulnerable.</p><p dir="ltr">Keep killing enemies and damaging the Minotaur until the room is clear. This will open a way into a hole in the ground, the bottom of which you won't be able to see. Jump down and continue through the underground tunnels until you reach a mission flag for Enigma Protocol.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you've located and activated this flag, Enigma Protocol will be available from the HELM screen on the Director, so you won't need to make this trip again.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_Enigma_Protocol_Works_And_How_To_Extend_The_Timer">How Enigma Protocol Works And How To Extend The Timer</h2><p dir="ltr">Enigma Protocol is a little different from most other Destiny 2 activities. It's not a straight fight where you need to kill a certain number of enemies or gather a certain resource. Instead, it's basically a race through the Vex Network, where what you're actually trying to beat is the clock. The activity is broken up between a few long platforming sections and some objective-based arena fights that are more meant to waylay you.</p><p dir="ltr">Chiefly, though, except for one big boss fight before the end of activity, Enigma Protocol is not about fighting all that much. Most of the time, you're racing to complete an objective or pass through an area, and stopping to shoot all the enemies you see is actually detrimental. There are a few points where you'll be forced to stop for a battle, but these also always have specific requirements that you're trying to complete as quickly as possible.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318952-enigmaprotocolsecuritynode.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318952" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318952-enigmaprotocolsecuritynode.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318952"></a><figcaption>Shoot these golden security nodes to add 30 seconds to your timer. There will be three in each distinct area of Enigma Protocol.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318952-enigmaprotocolsecuritynode.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The most important piece of information to know about Enigma Protocol is how the timer works. When you first enter the activity, you'll have a timer that ticks down from 1 minute. The landscape will turn red when you have less than a minute left on the timer, letting you know just how dire things are getting (it'll be green otherwise). However, you can extend the timer in two ways: First, by <strong>shooting yellow diamond constructs</strong> that are hidden throughout each room of the activity, each of which will give you an additional 30 seconds; and second, by <strong>killing Harpies that appear in the fight arenas, called Archival Timekeepers</strong>. You'll know which Harpies are the Timekeepers by the fact that they spawn inside a white dome that you'll have to break in order to shoot at them. Always try to find and kill the Timekeepers whenever they appear, as they also add 30 seconds to your timer. They tend to show up in the middle of and/or at the end of any arena-based portion of the activity.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318901-enigmaprotocolarchivaltimekeeper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318901" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318901-enigmaprotocolarchivaltimekeeper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318901"></a><figcaption>Watch for a message that notifies you an Archival Timekeeper has spawned, then find its white dome and kill it.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318901-enigmaprotocolarchivaltimekeeper.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you don't <em>have to </em>stop and kill enemies, it's better to try to keep moving. Bring powerful weapons for killing enemies and destroying the nodes that provide you with more time at a decent distance, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-call-god-roll-guide-how-to-get-it-and-god-rolls/1100-6524253/" data-ref-id="1100-6524253">The Call</a> or a machine gun. You'll also want something that can very quickly destroy Detain bubbles if you get caught in one, or kill the drones that create them before they hit you.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a good idea to bring your Power level up as close to 2005 as you can, or to run this event with high-level teammates (who can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-quickly-level-up-your-power-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape-and-how-it-works/1100-6523930/" data-ref-id="1100-6523930">increase your Power level through the new Fireteam Power system</a>). There's no penalty for dying except the wasted time, but the enemies in here can be dangerous, especially if you're not powered up. You'll appreciate the survivability offered by bringing your Power up before trying Enigma Protocol.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Enigma_Protocol_Encounters">Enigma Protocol Encounters</h2><p dir="ltr">When you enter Enigma Protocol, you'll go through the same series of encounters, at least so far. It's possible this could rotate weekly or with each new Act of the Episode, so if that's the case, we'll update this guide as necessary. For now, here's everything we've seen in Enigma Protocol.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Networked_Grid_1">Networked Grid-1</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318897-enigmaprotocol1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318897" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318897-enigmaprotocol1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318897"></a><figcaption>Networked Grid-1 is a straight shot to the portal, so avoid getting caught up fighting enemies if you can.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318897-enigmaprotocol1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When you first enter Enigma Protocol, you'll be dropped into a long linear platforming path called Networked Grid-1. Your goal is to cross this to the far side ahead of you, where a portal waits. You drop right in front of the yellow node that weakens security and adds time to your clock. There are two more of those in this room, usually hidden below your line of sight or around corners, so check around for them as you make your way to the end. When you've destroyed them all, you'll see a notification that says "Zone security cleared!" to let you know there aren't any more nodes to search for.</p><p dir="ltr">As mentioned, you don't have to kill all the enemies in this room; in fact, only shoot the ones that are in your way or particularly hazardous. Watch out for the Minotaur and Harpies near the exit portal, as they can be dangerous.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Experimental_Grid_1">Experimental Grid-1</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318902-enigmaprotocolexperimentalgrid1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318902" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318902-enigmaprotocolexperimentalgrid1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318902"></a><figcaption>Charge the orange balls in these Vex Charging Pools to fill the meter at the top of your screen, then dunk the balls in the waiting receptacles in the center of the arena.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318902-enigmaprotocolexperimentalgrid1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Once you clear the portal of Networked Grid-1, you'll enter your first objective arena. You can't continue from here until you've completed the objective, but killing enemies is secondary; ignore them if you can, or only focus on the ones that are particularly dangerous.</p><p dir="ltr">When you first enter the arena, you'll see an orange ball in a column of light, waiting for you. This is the objective--one of your teammates needs to grab this ball and charge it up to full power, as measured by a meter called Radiolite Circuit Charge, that appears on your screen when you pick it up. You can charge the ball by standing in these wells of light, but note that they'll change position every so often, forcing you to move around. The ball maintains a charge even if a player dies and drops it, so if the ball falls, quickly grab it and keep charging.</p><p dir="ltr">Once the meter is full, dunk the ball in one of the two receptacles in the center of the room. That'll activate a Vex launcher that will send you on to the next area. Note also that there are three more security nodes for increasing your timer in this room. You'll usually get an Archival Timekeeper to spawn here as well, which will give you another 30 seconds if you kill it.</p><p dir="ltr">With your back to the door you entered the room through, the Vex launcher that sends you to the next area will be on the left, close to the entrance. It sends you back in the direction you entered from.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Networked_Grid_2">Networked Grid-2</h3><p dir="ltr">The second Networked Grid portion is another platforming run, but this one is much more involved than before. As usual, there are three security nodes to find along the way. Speed here is important, but take your time and hit your jumps, as a few can be pretty precarious. Falling and dying usually won't penalize you too much, but sometimes you'll respawn much further back than you expect, forcing you to cover the same ground twice, costing you time.</p><p dir="ltr">The path can be twisting, so if you get confused as to where to go, look for pathways that let you go around blind corners or ledges that are above and behind you. You'll pass through two different portals, with the second one to your next objective arena.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Experimental_Grid_2">Experimental Grid-2</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318900-enigmaprotocolexperimentalgrid2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318900" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318900-enigmaprotocolexperimentalgrid2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318900"></a><figcaption>Throw the orange balls at the shielded Harpies to complete this encounter.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318900-enigmaprotocolexperimentalgrid2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This room is more of a fight than the ones before it or after it. Your goal is to destroy the nine shielded Harpies in the center of the room, floating in the air. To do that, you need to kill a batch of Goblins. There will be three batches: The first will spawn in the center of the room, the second on the left, and the third on the right. Be careful, as they're backed up by Harpies and a Minotaur, and can be dangerous in a group.</p><p dir="ltr">When you kill the goblins, they'll drop more of those orange balls. Pick one up and throw it at a shielded Harpy to destroy it. You'll get three balls in each of the three locations, for a total of nine.</p><p dir="ltr">As before, there are three security nodes in this room to destroy, and an Archival Timekeeper will spawn partway through completing the objective, as well. Take out all of them to maximize your time.</p><p dir="ltr">When all the Harpies are dead, a Vex portal will appear in the center of the room, allowing you to press on.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Bridge_1">Bridge-1</h3><p dir="ltr">The next area is part platforming and part sparrow track. Follow the platforming path until you see a ring ahead, floating in the air, with a silver diamond in the middle of it. Shoot the diamond to create the track beneath you. Drop down and you'll hop on your sparrow automatically. As you're riding, try to hit the white spaces on the track to boost your speed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318893-enigmaprotocolsecuritythingbridge1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318893" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318893-enigmaprotocolsecuritythingbridge1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318893"></a><figcaption>Look for the security node right when you land, on your right.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318893-enigmaprotocolsecuritythingbridge1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Two of the three security nodes in this area are in the platforming section. Look for the first to your right just as you enter Bridge-1; the second is behind you just as you land after taking the two Vex launchers. The final security nodes is on the right side of the track where it's separated by a column of architecture.</p><p dir="ltr">Race to the end of the track and you'll get your first breather and your first Enigma Protocol chest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Archival_Grid_1">Archival Grid-1</h3><p dir="ltr">This room lets you chill out for a bit, as the timer is paused while you're here. You'll receive a chest in the center of the room, and you can interact with the white Vex Constructs around the room to gather some data that (kind of) advances the plot of this story and activity. At the far end of the room are your two options: a Vex portal that allows you to continue, with a spot to drop a Rally flag, and a green control node that you can activate to reboot the activity and start from the beginning, if you're not happy with your run. There are a few reasons you might want to do that. First, if you're not happy with your remaining time, you can restart from here with something to show for your efforts and give the whole run another try. You can also farm that first chest for faster rewards than a full run, especially if you're just looking for new rolls on Episode weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">There are also a pair of Triumphs tied to Enigma Protocol that are essential for the Episode seal, including clearing all the security nodes in a single run and completing a full run in less than 18 minutes. If you're trying to achieve either and you're already feeling like this run is blown, the reboot allows you to try again without having to complete a scuffed run.</p><p dir="ltr">Archival Grid-1 is also a good stopping point for players who don't want to commit to the whole run in a similar way that last season's activity, The Coil, let players drop in and out at specific stopping points. You might lose players here as people drop out, so a reboot can be a better approach than trying to continue under circumstances that aren't ideal. All three players will need to vote to reboot in order for that restart to happen.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Networked_Grid_4">Networked Grid-4</h3><p dir="ltr">This is another run. Jump up into the round area at the start. There are a lot of enemies here, so while you don't want to get too bogged down, it might be a good idea to clear some out so you can safely move on. A Vex Hydra waits for you just ahead, and the next hallway is littered with lasers you'll need to jump over. As usual, there are three security nodes along the way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318894-enigmaprotocolsecuritythingnetworkedgrid4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318894" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318894-enigmaprotocolsecuritythingnetworkedgrid4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318894"></a><figcaption>Another security node that's right in front of you when you arrive.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318894-enigmaprotocolsecuritythingnetworkedgrid4.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Experimental_Grid_3">Experimental Grid-3</h3><p dir="ltr">This is another room that's full of enemies but in which you don't really need to fight apart from dropping anything that's particularly bothersome. Instead, your job is to pick up 20 pink Motes of Encrypted Golden Age Data. To get those, you want to look up at the big scaffolding thing in the middle of the room. On it, you'll see pink bulbs like fruit on a tree--much like one of the objectives in Breach Executable. Shooting those bulbs will drop one of the pink nodes, so your primary focus should be on shooting every one you see and picking up the node that drops from it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318903-enigmaprotocolexperimentalgrid3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318903" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318903-enigmaprotocolexperimentalgrid3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318903"></a><figcaption>Shoot these pink bulbs hanging from the Vex architecture. You need to pick up 20 of the pink Motes these drop.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318903-enigmaprotocolexperimentalgrid3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As usual, you've got three more security nodes in this room, mostly scattered around the edges and above your line of sight. It's possible another Archival Timekeeper will spawn here before you leave, so kill it if it does.</p><p dir="ltr">The portal out of Experimental Grid-3 leads to another long platforming section, this one marked by big gaps and narrow pathways. Be careful of enemies waiting for you on the path, particularly where you're going to land when you jump or use a launcher. Look for three more security nodes here as you go.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Experimental_Grid_4">Experimental Grid-4</h3><p dir="ltr">This is the big boss fight of the activity: a huge Vex minotaur boss called Ainigmatos, the Indecipherable Proto-Mind. It can be tough to fight, with lots of smaller enemies damaging you while you try to hurt the boss, who has a lot of health and teleports around the arena. Keep moving and try not to get caught up fighting small enemies or getting blasted by them; weapons like rocket launchers can be pretty effective in doing a lot of damage quickly, as can burst Supers like Golden Gun.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318951-enigmaprotocolexperimentalgrid4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318951" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318951-enigmaprotocolexperimentalgrid4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318951"></a><figcaption>Ainigmatos can be tough to kill quickly, thanks to the fact it moves around a big arena filled with smaller threats.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318951-enigmaprotocolexperimentalgrid4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The trick here is to use the power-ups around the arena to give yourself an edge, in particular the Shield one that increases your damage resistance, and the Super one that gives you a big chunk of Super charge. Note that these don't respawn, so only pick them up when you need them, or you could waste them.</p><p dir="ltr">With a team of three people who are pretty on the ball, Ainigmatos isn't too difficult to take down, but the fight can be time-consuming since he moves around so much. Look for three security nodes here, as well as Archival Timekeepers, who will show up periodically near where you first entered the arena. Kill those to keep your timer up.</p><p dir="ltr">When Ainigmatos goes down, don't drop your guard. You'll notice the timer is still going--you still need to get back to an Archival Grid room to end the activity and get your reward. A portal will appear in the center of the room, so jump through that as quickly as you can for your last challenge.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Networked_Grid_3">Networked Grid-3</h3><p dir="ltr">Not sure why this is numbered the way it is, but regardless, you'll drop onto another sparrow race track to make your way out of the Vex network before you're expelled. All the security nodes in this area are on the track. The first is right next to where you start on the track; the second is on the right side of the column just ahead of where you start; and the third is on top of a column just past a ramp, so hit the speed booster to make sure you get the air to nail it as you go across.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318895-enigmaprotocolsecuritythingnetworkedgrid31.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318895" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318895-enigmaprotocolsecuritythingnetworkedgrid31.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318895"></a><figcaption>Go to the right side of this column to hit the security node.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318895-enigmaprotocolsecuritythingnetworkedgrid31.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Zip to the end of the track to reach the end of the activity, where you'll get another rewards chest and the opportunity to interact with another Vex construct.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318896-enigmaprotocolsecuritythingnetworkedgrid32.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318896" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318896-enigmaprotocolsecuritythingnetworkedgrid32.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318896"></a><figcaption>Hit the speed booster just ahead of this ramp so you can get enough air to hit the security node on the other side of the gap.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318896-enigmaprotocolsecuritythingnetworkedgrid32.jpg"></figure><p>Now that you've bested Enigma Protocol, check out the rest of our Destiny 2 coverage at our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">Final Shape guides hub</a>, and read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">review of The Final Shape</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Assassin's Creed Shadows: Extended 12 Minutes Of Gameplay Walkthrough | Ubisoft Forward</p>
      </div>
<p>Ubisoft has said Infinity--now Animus hub--was created in response to fans who have asked for a "more cohesive approach" to the Assassin's Creed series.</p><p>The specifics remain unknown, but it sounds like Animus hub is similar to Halo: The Master Chief Collection, which is a product that has multiple Halo games within it. Call of Duty does something similar as well, as the latest Call of Duty titles all launch from within an app called Call of Duty HQ.</p><p>Assassin's Creed: Shadows releases this November for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. The game takes players back in time to 16th century Japan and features two playable protagonists.</p>

<p data-characters="236" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The final <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> Live Letter from the Producers before <em>Dawntrail </em>happened today, June 14, and viewers were given a myriad of sneak peaks. From new Tomestones to a glimpse of The Arcadion, here’s everything we learned.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="216" data-current-count="216" data-injectable="false">Right from the jump, viewers were inundated with new information in the form of the official launch trailer for <em>Dawntrail</em>, featuring gameplay footage and story prologue, as well as an introduction to a new character:</p> <figure data-current-count="516" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="FINAL FANTASY XIV: DAWNTRAIL Launch Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7BghYTigv8E?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">After showing the trailer, Yoshi informed us that the team is still on track for early access release on June 28, so we’re not likely to face any delays as we did in the run-up to <em>Endwalker</em>. Some viewers asked if Yoshida will be getting a summer holiday after all of his hard work, but he stated that he’s already working on the story for 8.0, so that’s unlikely to happen.</p> <p data-characters="62" data-current-count="441" data-injectable="true">Beyond that, here’s everything we were told about <em>Dawntrail</em>:</p>
 <h2 id="h-new-content" data-injectable="false"><strong>New Content</strong></h2> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">We were given glimpses into a few new duties, including the first dungeon of <em>Dawntrail </em>and the level 93 Trial which will see us facing off against Valigarmanda. We learned that the boss during this Trial will alter its appearance, and also told of a new addition to the UI. Information regarding upcoming attacks will now be displayed in the middle of the screen.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="168" data-current-count="537" data-injectable="true">Very excitingly, we were also given a brief glimpse into the 8-player raid series The Arcadion, which really is a live tournament complete with audience and commentary:</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Final Fantasy XIV YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="668" data-injectable="true">Hilariously, Yoshi and the team were trying to keep the name of the first tier of The Arcadion a secret, but neglected to remove the duty list from their stream, therefore giving away the name. As such, I think I’m allowed to reveal that the first tier of The Arcadion will be Light Heavyweight. Presumably, the weight class will increase with each tier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="268" data-injectable="false">The first tier of The Arcadion will be added in patch 7.01, which is due to be implemented on July 16. The Savage variant will be added in patch 7.05, due to release on July 30.&nbsp;We’re also getting a new Treasure Dungeon added in 7.05, called Cenote Ja Ja Gural.</p> <h2 id="h-new-tomestones" data-injectable="false"><strong>New Tomestones</strong></h2> <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="542" data-injectable="true">It was revealed that the next iteration of Allagan Tomestones will be called Aesthetics, while the capped version will be called Tomestones of Heliometry and will arrive with patch 7.05. We were also shown some of the gear which will be available in exchange for Heliometry.</p>
 <h2 id="h-new-characters" data-injectable="false"><strong>New characters</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="462" data-injectable="true">After briefly going over already established characters, we were given more information about four new characters we’ll meet in our journey. From left to right:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Zoraal Ja</strong> is the First Promise of Tulliyolal and Commander of the Landsguard. Sibling to Wuk Lumat, he’s considered the foremost candidate in the Rite to Succession, so it’s likely we’ll face off against him at some point.</li> <li><strong>Koana</strong> is another sibling of Wuk Lumat, adopted by Gulool Ja Ja. He wants to drag Tuliyollal into the future using technology and innovation.&nbsp;</li> <li><strong>Bakool Ja Ja</strong> is the only candidate in the Rite of Succession who isn’t part of the family of the current ruler, instead having won his place through Martial Tournament. He is contemptuous of others and considers anyone with one head to be inferior.</li> <li>The <strong>“Enigmatic Maiden”</strong> remains largely a mystery, and we weren’t told much about her other than there are some secrets in her story.&nbsp;</li> </ul> <h2 id="h-new-items" data-injectable="false"><strong>New items</strong></h2> <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="523" data-injectable="true">Towards the end of the Live Letter, Yoshi showed off some of the minions and mounts we can look forward to collecting in <em>Dawntrail</em>. The most exciting reveal was the theme of the next set of Trial mounts, which take the shape of something that players have been wanting for a long time — wings. Actual wings, which attach to your back and make you fly. Glorious.</p>
 <p data-characters="36" data-current-count="36" data-injectable="false">Here’s some of the minions we saw:</p> <figure data-current-count="336" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshots via Final Fantasy XIV YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="302" data-current-count="638" data-injectable="true">At one point, while showing off some new screenshots of Solution 9 featuring cars and motorbikes, Yoshida started to describe a new mount which apparently “transforms”. Sadly, we didn’t get to see this mount in action, but here’s what we did see, including those precious wings:</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshots via Final Fantasy XIV YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="170" data-current-count="470" data-injectable="true">We also saw some of the new gear we can expect to get in a variety of ways, although it’s uncertain how to get most of these items. We saw three different sets of gear:</p>
 <p data-characters="41" data-current-count="41" data-injectable="false">One which will be gained with Heliometry:</p> <figure data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshots via Final Fantasy XIV YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="26" data-current-count="367" data-injectable="false">One which will be crafted:</p> <figure data-current-count="667" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshots via Final Fantasy XIV YouTube</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="38" data-current-count="38" data-injectable="false">And this final set of unknown origins:</p> <figure data-current-count="338" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshots via Final Fantasy XIV YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="212" data-current-count="550" data-injectable="true">Although any updates to housing will be coming&nbsp; much later during the 7.X series, we were shown a new house design, which looks like a fairytale cottage and comes complete with functioning treehouse feature:</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Final Fantasy XIV YouTube</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-new-quests" data-injectable="false"><strong>New quests</strong></h2> <p data-characters="320" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true">There will be five new role quests available for Disciples of War and Magic classes to complete, one for each of the roles and unlocking at level 92. We were told that, at some point in one of the questlines, a Namazu will be making an appearance. Completing all five Role Quests will unlock a further quest to complete.</p>
 <p data-characters="290" data-current-count="290" data-injectable="false">There will also be five new classes for Disciples of the Hand and Land to complete, named “Wachumeqimeqi Deliveries”, though we weren’t told at which level these would unlock. Completing all five will unlock an additional quest. The questlines will be split into the following groups:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="490" data-injectable="true"> <li>Blacksmith/Armorer/Goldsmith</li> <li>Carpenter/Leatherworker/Weaver</li> <li>Alchemist/Culinarian</li> <li>Miner/Botanist</li> <li>Fisher</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">While we weren’t told much about Viper and Pictomancer Job Quests, we were given a glimpse into their content in the form of screenshots.

<p data-characters="317" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Minecraft’s</em> 1.21 update introduced the mace, a melee weapon that gets its uniqueness from damage that directly scales with fall damage. Not only can you use it to eliminate fall damage altogether in some cases, but using enchantments like Breach lets you shred through some of the game’s toughest enemies.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-get-the-breach-enchantment-in-minecraft" data-injectable="false">How to get the Breach Enchantment in Minecraft</h2> <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="432" data-injectable="true">You can find the Breach enchantment in an enchanted book or through an <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-minecraft-enchanting-table-setup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enchanting table.</a> However, since it’s a mace-exclusive enchantment, you’ll have to use your mace in your enchanting table for a chance to find it. You can also randomly find it in enchanting books within underground structures or villager trading, but the odds are low compared to more common enchantments like unbreaking, protection, and sharpness.</p>
 <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="286" data-injectable="false">Just be careful, as you’re not guaranteed to find it right away while enchanting, especially if you have a low-level enchanting table. You’re much more likely to find it with level 30 enchantments, but you can encounter level one and two versions of Breach at lower levels. </p> <figure data-current-count="586" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="452" data-current-count="452" data-injectable="true">Make sure you’re not applying the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-the-density-enchantment-in-minecraft-works/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">density enchantment</a> instead by hovering over your enchant options. It’s impossible to get Breach on a mace that already has smite, bane of arthropods, or density enchantments in vanilla <em>Minecraft</em>, making this a great way to tell whether your next enchantment will have Breach at all. While you can use console commands to apply them all, you won’t be able to use them all together in a regular game. </p>
 <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">In short, if your mace already has one of these three enchantments, you’ll have to create a new mace or remove the enchantments to use Breach. Similarly, if you hover over an enchantment and see density appear, you’ll know you won’t get the Breach enchantment and will have to try again with a new set of enchants.</p> <h2 id="h-how-the-breach-enchantment-works-in-minecraft" data-injectable="false">How the Breach Enchantment works in Minecraft</h2> <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="760" data-injectable="true">Breach is a mace enchantment that reduces armor’s effectiveness, making enemies and other players less tanky. There are four enchantment levels, with the lowest decreasing armor effectiveness by 15 percent and the highest, level four, reducing it by 60 percent. While its power isn’t too noticeable with regular leather armor, having diamond or netherite armor with protection IV is where its strength truly shines. </p>
 <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="403" data-injectable="false">This effect also impacts natural armor that creatures like zombies, shulkers, and even the Wither boss have. If you’re fighting against any of these enemies, you’ll have a much easier time fighting them than with a regular sword, even if it has sharpness or other damage enchantments. However, it won’t make much difference against enemies like spiders or creepers with no armor buffs.</p>

            <p>Look, everyone wants to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> on PC. It’s one of those universally accepted truths, like gravity or pizza being delicious.

<p>As if to keep repeatedly adding insult - or at least mild disappointment - to the injury of every State of Play going by without a Bloodborne PC announcement, the game’s developers and director have confirmed that, yes, of course they <em>also </em>want Bloodborne to release on PC - even if they probably can’t admit that.</p>
<p>The latest confirmation of something everyone already knew came via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/hidetaka-miyazaki-knows-for-a-fact-other-fromsoftware-devs-want-a-bloodborne-pc-port-if-i-say-i-want-one-ill-get-in-trouble-but-its-nothing-im-opposed-to/">chirpy RPS fanzine PC Gamer</a>, who recently spoke with From’s president and Souls mastermind/sadist Hidetaka Miyazaki. PCG followed up on Miyazaki’s recent comments that From don’t even own the rights to the Bloodborne IP - the PlayStation ‘sclusy sits with Sony, unlike the multiplatform Dark Souls games - by asking whether the director would personally like to see it get a PC release. Of course he would!</p>
<p>“I know for a fact these guys want a Bloodborne PC port,” Miyazaki replied, indicating producer Yasuhiro Kitao and interpreter Bobby Simpson. As for Miyazaki himself, however, he can’t officially say a definitive yes (presumably because Sony will summon down a eldritch monstrosity bearing a blood sword inscribed with “IP RIGHTS”), having to settle for a diplomatic admission that he at least wouldn’t stand in the way of Bloodborne coming to PC: “If I say I want one, I'll get in trouble as well. But it's nothing I'm opposed to.”</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Sony/FromSoftware</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Miyazaki continued by saying that he’d unsurprisingly like as many people as possible to enjoy Bloodborne - which releasing it on more than one obsolete console platform would certainly help with.</p>
<p>“Especially as a game that is now coming of age, one of those games of the past that gets lost on older hardware - I think any game like that, it'd be nice to have an opportunity for more players to be able to experience that and relive this relic of the past,” he said.</p>
<p>It’s not like the obsessive hunting for any sign of a Bloodborne PC port ever really stop, but the decade-long anticipation has recently been reheated by cameos from the player character Hunter and Lady Maria - a boss from DLC The Old Hunters - in upcoming PS5 platformer Astro Bot, which sparked the imagination of those awaiting news of PC and PS5 versions. Bad news (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodborne-is-coming-to-pc-rumours-claim">again</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-playstation-fans-are-only-happy-with-pc-releases-taking-place-2-3-years-later-surely-bloodborne-must-be-next-yeah">again</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodborne-on-pc-somehow-looks-even-less-likely-as-director-suggests-we-might-be-waiting-for-ps6-first">again</a>): developers Team Asobi have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-secret-meaning-behind-bloodborne-in-astro-bot-says-creative-director">since told Eurogamer</a> not to read any “secret meaning” into the nod. Back to reading too much into every little detail for the next decade, it is.</p>

If you’ll indulge me –</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Okay.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: If you had to sum up the idea of guiding game music composers – sum it up in two or three points – what would those points be? Knowing that of course it takes years of experience to really get your head around these. What does a composer need to keep in mind when writing video game music?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Hm. That is cool. Two branching points. I think I can do this.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: (laughs)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: (laughs) I’m going to give it a try.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Love it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: The first thing I would say, just compositionally, is that game music reflects the inner monologue of the player.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Hmm.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: We’re in the players head. I think that’s the best way to think about what we do. We are essentially mirroring the journey mentally that players are having, and whether that’s in a very narrative game in which the player is pursuing objectives and interacting with characters and having adventures in that more linear narrative focus – or if it’s more of a puzzle game in which the player is solving more abstract problems and looking at a large playing field in which many simultaneous events are happening all the time and trying to absorb and logically assess the needs of the game and trying to figure it out. Whether it’s that kind of game, or a more narrative game, they have emotional and intellectual frames of reference. A center of focus. And they’re very unique! And I think the music plays the role of a mirror to that focus, to that mental state. I think when music is doing its best job, in terms of that sense of identity, it’s beautifully reflecting the mental cognition of the player. It’s helping the player to think and to solve problems, and it’s helping the player to empathize and to feel the momentum and the emotional arc of the story.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: So I would say that is the one of two things that game music is, that game music does.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Hmm.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: The other thing that game music does, that I think is really important, is that it can emphasize&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gamedesignskills.com/game-design/player-agency/#what-is-player-agency-in-game-design">player agency</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;in a really important way. When it’s structured well, music for games reacts to what players do. It can react in subtle ways that you don’t notice, or it can react in really dramatic ways that have impact, that kind of hit you in the chest.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Yeah!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: And depending on the way in which the music is structured, it can kind of reinforce the idea that players are in control, that they are affecting the world that they are exploring or that they are manipulating.&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3411764.3445540">That is really important to game development, to game design</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Everything about a video game is about giving players a sense of agency – about making players feel powerful. Making their choices feel like they matter. So everything that everybody’s doing in game development is about emphasizing that. The more players feel that their choices affect the game, the more fun they’re having!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Yeah!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Yeah! So that really influences the way games are developed. And with music, if we can communicate that idea on the level and with the language that we have at our disposal, we can almost subconsciously emphasize player agency – player choice –&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HoOu0iNCU">by letting the music morph and react to what the player does</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It makes the emotional texture of the game feel like it cares about the player. Like there is a relationship there that is personal. That the player and the game are exploring this experience together.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: And as a composer, it’s kind of like the composer and the player are having a conversation. Like we’re having a back-and-forth. So I think that’s the other thing that’s really important and pivotal about our role as game composers, and that makes our work as game composers different from composing music for any other form of entertainment, We have that back-and-forth. We have that relationship with the person who is consuming our art. And what&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>they</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;do influences how they experience what&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>we</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;do. So it’s really unique and interesting, and it makes our work a lot of fun.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: It is beautiful, and your work is a lot of fun! I’ll say that for sure! Hopefully, this is a fun question. I imagine you’re updating this book in the years since you’ve written it. You’ve probably updated it a couple of times to reflect, you know, what’s happening in the world of video game music, and video games in general. If you had to rewrite this book in the year of our lord 2024, what are one or two very exciting things that you’d say, “Man, you all need to hear about this! You all need to get that this is happening, and keep this in mind in your future as game composers, or as people who want to make any sort of video game music.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: You know, that is just so interesting!&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://winifredphillips.wpcomstaging.com/">I actually keep a blog that I contribute to on a monthly basis</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It is in concert with my book, so it allows me to continuously update the body of knowledge that I am offering as a part of that book, and to keep it fresh, and constantly add new ideas to it. And I think that’s really helpful, because game development is a technology, and you know how fast technology moves. It’s very difficult to write any book and expect it to be at the cutting edge of a technology by the time a book comes out! That’s part of the reason why when I wrote the book I focused more on core artistic principles rather than any technological guidance, because I knew that the technology was probably going to be out of date as soon as the book was released. That’s just the reality of it – just the way it works. But on the internet I was going to be able to speak to a community from a more immediate point of view, and so that has been special to me.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: And in terms of what I think is one of the more interesting and important contributions to what we’ve essentially been discussing… I think that as much as virtual reality is sort of on unstable ground in terms of the way in which its community is building… I think the impact it has had on the discipline of audio and music creation for games can not be overstated. It is a really fascinating change in terms of what we do. Just in terms of the audio designer and the sound designer, it has moved work into the areas of binaural sound and ambisonics. Now I’m going to back up. I know we don’t want to get too technical here. But the idea here is – when you’re watching a film, everybody is pretty familiar with surround sound. The idea that when you watch a film and the film presents the audio in a way that pinpoints sonic locations for objects as they’re flying around you. Of course surround sound is essentially a hula hoop around you.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Yeah. (Laughs)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Yeah. If you visualize it that way. I mean, if you go into a movie theater, there can be a little bit of up-and-down (in terms of where speakers are placed), but mostly it’s just whipping around you like a hula hoop.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: The difference between surround sound and what virtual reality does is that it takes that hula hoop and spreads it out into a sphere that wraps you completely around, so that sound is pinpointed to exact locations – so that you can experience it in a way that is much more immersive and reflects actual life much more than surround sound ever has. The terms binaural sound and ambisonics – those are just two of the approaches to this kind of sound implementation. And&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://winifredphillips.wpcomstaging.com/2016/03/01/vr-audio-past-present-future/">those two approaches actually were being pursued quite a long time ago in the earlier days of game development</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. But then they sort of went to the wayside. There were certain issues with technology that kind of got in the way, and we ended up with surround sound (which is reflective of what happens in television and film) for quite a long time. And that’s where things stayed. But now we’re moving back into this complete sphere of sound, and it’s because of virtual reality.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: That has essentially forced everybody’s hand – to really get serious about those technologies. You just can’t create an immersive virtual environment without that kind of 3 dimensional sound. And it’s challenged everybody in game audio to think differently about what we do – including game composers. In terms of just the discipline of composition, it’s been really interesting to look at ideas that are related to how music physiologically influences people. And to understand that, in relation to one of the big downsides of virtual reality – which is&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://winifredphillips.wpcomstaging.com/2016/02/22/can-game-music-and-sound-combat-vr-sickness/">visually induced motion sickness</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. A lot of people, when they jump into virtual reality, they put the big goggles on, they start walking around, and suddenly they’re feeling very queasy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: (laughs) Yeah.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: It has to do with how our physical movement and the environment doesn’t seem to match.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Yeah.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Our bodies want to say that the way we’re moving and the way the world is moving around us are congruous – that they agree. When they don’t, as is often the case in virtual reality, it sends our brains for a loop, and they don’t like it. So yeah, it’s tough.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: So one of the things that has been really interesting for me as a game composer is&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://winifredphillips.wpcomstaging.com/2018/07/15/composing-video-game-music-for-virtual-reality-comfort-versus-performance/">taking a look at how music affects us physiologically and how that can counteract visually induced motion sickness</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Hmm! Fabulous!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Things like infrasound! The sound frequencies that can affect us. Some are steadying, and some make visually induced motion sickness worse. It’s a whole discipline, and it’s an interesting thing to think about. It freshens music creation, in terms of the sonic palette that we’re working with. When we think that the music not only has an emotional and intellectual component to the way players are experiencing the game, but it also has a physiological component that can actually affect the way people feel in their bodies, and that can help or hurt their experience of being plunged into a virtual world… that was amazing to me!&nbsp; Just thinking about that. And it really opened my eyes to different ways to think about what music can do. So if I had to point to anything that is recent, and that has really been fascinating and profound as a game composer, I’d say it’s that.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: I love this idea of music in video games actually having a physiological response. Because the flip side of that is taking video game music into the real world through the concert hall. Your music for Assassin’s Creed Liberation has been part of multiple&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gamingaudionews.com/2019/05/24/ubisoft-reveals-full-tracklist-for-assassins-creed-symphony-world-tour/">Assassin’s Creed Symphony</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;tours, which is quite incredible!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: How does it feel for you as the composer to see your music coming alive onstage? Composers are often sitting in our rooms doing our thing, and just cranking out the music, and hoping that people respond to our heart and soul and our tears and our blood and sweat that goes into it! When that goes out to the concert hall in the hands of live musicians completely outside of the game!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Yeah!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Where does that take you?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: It is amazing! You know, I think one of the things that’s so cool about being a game composer – and I think you would probably agree with this – when we create music for a game, we’re essentially creating music for somebody’s experience. It’s different than creating music for a film or a tv show, because that’s a passive experience. People are sitting. They’re watching. The experience that’s being had is somebody else’s. But for a game, it’s your experience that you’re having as a player. And the music belongs to you, because it’s what you heard during a really special and important moment in your life. It’s the reason why we remember music that we heard during milestones of our lives better than everything else! Because we remember music when we’re doing something that matters to us. It’s an immensely powerful mnemonic. It really cements music in our heads, when we’re doing something that is meaningful to us and we hear that music. The music just prints itself on our brains. It’s like nothing else!</span><br></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: So when you go to a concert, and the people who are there are going to hear music together that they feel belongs to them, that was a part of an experience they had and they remember so vividly – the sense of community is unlike anything else.&nbsp; It’s just amazing! The energy in that room, when everybody just erupts, and the roar that kind of builds when the music bursts into a chorus that’s associated with a moment in a game that everyone loves! Or that was really difficult, and created a great sense of triumph when you overcame it! And then that music brings you right back into that moment! It is amazing!</span><br></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: That’s one of the reasons why as a game composer when you go into the concert hall and you hear your music performed in front of that audience, it really is incomparable to any other kind of concert. That audience is hearing and maybe singing along or swaying along to music that they feel like belongs to them in a way that is incomparable to any other form of media. It’s just outstanding to be able to be a part of that! I feel very humbled in a way to watch that happen. Because you are creating an intimate experience with one player as you compose music, you’re thinking of it as an intimate act of creation, but when you think of it in terms of thousands of players across countries, across the world, it is sort of an epic experience as well! The community that is having a relationship with you! And having a moment of their lives in concert with your own creation. There’s nothing like being a game composer for having the privilege of being a part of people’s lives in that way. So, yeah, watching game music concerts, hearing your music performed in a venue like that, there’s nothing like it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: That is beautiful! And so wonderful to hear what a career, what a life in game music so far! And what exciting times ahead! I’m so glad! Thank you Winifred so much for your time and space and just amazing generosity! In sharing your knowledge with the world, but also putting out such extremes of beauty, of action, and whimsy and heart!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/monopoly-gos-tycoon-racers-event-is-an-interesting-yet-brutally-challenging-concept/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=monopoly-gos-tycoon-racers-event-is-an-interesting-yet-brutally-challenging-concept<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="304" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I really enjoy playing through <em>Monopoly GO’s </em>events. While I find Peg-E fun, my true joy comes from Partners events. With <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/monopoly-go-tycoon-racers-guide-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tycoon Racers</a> becoming available worldwide for the first time this week, I was curious how it compares to some of my favorite events and whether I’d have a blast with it.</p> <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="310" data-injectable="false">So far, I’m enjoying Tycoon Racers a lot, but there’s a glaring issue that I’m conflicted on: the difficulty. There are many competitive people out there, and for a group of casual players who rarely have more than a few hundred dice on them at a time, it’s almost intimidating to see. </p> <figure data-current-count="610" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="511" data-current-count="511" data-injectable="true">Unlike Partners events with very clear milestones that can snowball your progress, Tycoon Racers feels like a constant uphill battle, with no guarantee that you’ll get anything out of it. You can also get thousands of dice from a Partners event in one day, with Tycoon Racers rewarding significantly less. It does offer milestone rewards in the form of completing laps around the track, but you’ll often find yourself claiming more flags or taking 100 dice just to get slightly farther in your race.</p>
 <h2 id="h-what-is-tycoon-racers-exactly" data-injectable="false">What is Tycoon Racers, exactly?</h2> <p data-characters="509" data-current-count="509" data-injectable="true">Tycoon Racers works in a multi-stage format where you pick your teammates, collect flags, and match up against three other four-player teams. After around 24 hours, you’ll all start racing around a race track, collecting milestone rewards and points to signal your placement. After another 24 hours, you’ll complete your first race, get your placement medals, and repeat this twice more. You’ll find your final rank once you complete your three races and receive a reward for your placement.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="595" data-current-count="895" data-injectable="true">After you finish your three races, you’ll get a final score that determines your reward. You’ll get 3,500 dice, a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-wild-stickers-in-monopoly-go/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wild Sticker</a>, and the Tycoon Racer token if you’re in first place. The prizes for second place are 1,000 dice and a five-star pack, while third and fourth place are the equivalent of participation ribbons. In an event like this, it’s all or nothing, as the dice you use to obtain points are far beyond what you’ll receive in return, even if you get first. Nonetheless, the Wild Sticker is a decent prize if you get lucky with your teams and opponents.</p>
 <h2 id="h-off-to-a-rocky-start" data-injectable="false">Off to a rocky start</h2> <p data-characters="543" data-current-count="543" data-injectable="true">Immediately, the initial stage of selecting a team was already a little stressful. I have one person I always team up with for every event, but beyond this, we didn’t have an exact game plan for how to navigate this event. All I knew was that I was intrigued, albeit slightly confused. Nonetheless, I partnered up with my usual friend, found someone else to invite, and got a random player to join near the end of the planning phase. All things considered, I was optimistic, as I was mainly excited to try a new event for the first time.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="655" data-injectable="true">With that in mind, I’m enjoying the change of pace. I was looking for something interesting and different, and Tycoon Racers scratches that itch. Getting the top prize is a welcome bonus; above all, I’m looking forward to working with my friends and getting a little competitive, even if I don’t necessarily define myself as competitive.</p>
 <h2 id="h-things-are-getting-a-little-competitive" data-injectable="false">Things are getting a little competitive</h2> <p data-characters="411" data-current-count="411" data-injectable="true">As of now, <em>Monopoly GO’s </em>Tycoon Racers event is still ongoing, and the standings look pretty good. I got lucky and found a five-star sticker that I needed to finish one of my albums during the team phase, so I used the dice to fly through a few Grease and Glory milestones beforehand. We’re in first now, but knowing how most <em>Monopoly GO</em> events progress, I don’t expect this to last very long.</p>
 <p data-characters="678" data-current-count="678" data-injectable="true">After all, competitiveness is what makes events like Tycoon Racers so challenging. In some cases, you’ll match up against a team or two who are so determined to win that they’ll get every event reward possible to collect thousands of flags before soaring through, grabbing lap milestone prizes, and snowballing their success. It’s impressive to see, yet it’s almost discouraging when you’re a group of casual players who just want to have fun. I enjoy the competitiveness to an extent, but I’m slightly disheartened by the game’s habit of having teams skyrocket to quadruple your score in a short time with no hope of making a comeback.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>All things considered, I’m surprised it’s this close. | Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="690" data-current-count="990" data-injectable="true">At the end of it all, though, Tycoon Racers is designed for competition. You collaborate with your team to collect points, but at its core, you compete directly against three other teams to reach the top. Whether you get there depends almost entirely on your determination. Sure, there’s luck involved with your dice popper rolls, but this is only half the battle. Getting into the nitty-gritty of min-maxing your rolls, trading stickers to get more dice, and looking out for rewards links all contribute to your success. Fortunately, if you’re competitive, you may have a blast with this aspect of the event. I’m conflicted over whether it’s worth the ending prize.</p>
 <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="362" data-injectable="false">Is it worth it for 3,500 dice, a Wild Sticker, and a cosmetic token? Honestly, I can’t even tell you for certain. I love cosmetics, so I’ll still try my best during this race to get it. However, if you like to conserve their dice for future events, it may be worth sitting out on this one and waiting until another Partner or Treasures event appears.</p>

            <p>
More details have come to light on the cancelled standalone spin-off for acclaimed RPG Disco Elysium. 
</p>
<p>
Back in February, it was revealed that work on this project, codenamed X7, had been stopped, along with news of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-standalone-expansion-reportedly-cancelled-and-quarter-of-staff-facing-redundancy-at-zaum">layoffs at developer ZA/UM</a>. At this time, it was claimed the spin-off was only "one to two years away from completion".
</p>
<p>
Now, in a report by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/game-development/for-a-while-it-seemed-like-miracles-were-possible-and-with-them-redemption-a-follow-up-to-the-legendary-disco-elysium-might-have-been-ready-to-play-within-the-next-yearzaums-devs-loved-it-management-canceled-it-and-laid-off-the-team/?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow">PC Gamer</a> with current and former employees of ZA/UM Studio, lead writer Dora Klindžić has said this release would have been "110 percent authentic" and the "most hardcore Disco since Disco".
</p>

</div><figcaption>Newscast: For Xbox, could this year finally be the one where it all pays off?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPVhT_7O0iE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
X7 "would have advanced the story, the emotional threads, and gameplay elements all at once to truly evolve the genre of psychological RPG as Disco Elysium started it," Klindžić said. "For a while it seemed like miracles were possible, and with them, redemption."
</p>
<p>
Another developer told the publication the spin-off was about "one of the most most beloved characters" in Disco Elysium. "I feel like it was the best possible shot at a Disco-like game without [Kurvitz], Rostov, and other people that made the original Disco Elysium," they said.
</p>
<p>
Internal response to X7 had been positive when it was shared during a company-wide showcase towards the end of last year. "Everyone was looking forward to its development," a developer on another team at ZA/UM said, adding its "internal announcement lifted a lot of spirits after a rough time of bad press around the studio".
</p>
<p>
They also thought it was "exactly the sort of game [ZA/UM] needs to put out". Several developers believed the spin-off could "reassure fans that ZA/UM is not a husk, that the IP is in safe hands and that the studio is full of talented people with a genuine love for the world of Revachol".
</p>
<p>
While some of those that spoke to PC Gamer said they believed this Disco Elysium spin-off could have launched this year, others felt next year was a more likely target. Klindžić said that had the team been left to get on with developing the title with less interference from management, "it could have perhaps been a three-year development cycle start to finish", with work on X7 initially starting in 2022. 
</p>
<p>
Klindžić had originally left her job as an academic physicist and space mission scientist in the February of that year, in order to work on a Disco Elysium sequel. However, it was an inauspicious start for the project. "Upon my arrival, I was told all the leads were gone and replaced, but this was framed as a good thing, a healthy thing. Four months later the project was shelved overnight. I began raising concerns, as I felt I had just abandoned my entire life and career only to end up in a studio where the people I had come to work with were fired, and the project I was meant to work on shelved with no reason given."
</p>
<p>
Then, that August, studio management approached both Klindžić and Disco Elysium writer Argo Tuulik⁠ about pitching a spin-off. "We were given only around a week to come up with a fully-fledged game pitch, and we worked around the clock to come up with a new story, new characters, new gameplay mechanics, and a new creative direction, including an initial vision for design, art, and audio. We presented the pitch to management, it was a resounding success. It was greenlit and codenamed X7, and its initial production schedule was set for one year."
</p>
<p>
However, even when the project had been given the go ahead, Klindžić said the team was "set up to fail from the start", due to not having been allowed a pre-production period. "Whenever we raised concerns about this and expressed we needed more writers if the deadlines were to be met, we were accused of not wanting to do our jobs," Klindžić said.
</p>
<p>
"Pretty much from the moment the writing team's pitch was approved in August of 2022, the other teams started production," Tuulik added. "We didn't even really know what the story or the characters were gonna be, when art teams were already making first character and environment concepts. I'm sure you can see how this is a big problem, when you're making a narrative-led game. 
</p>
<p>
"Essentially, the writing team had to work double-time from day one to supply other disciplines with work, whilst trying to write the first dialogues and sketch out the rest of the game at the same time. The writing team consisted of myself and Dora at the time." Another developer added: "I don't know if Dora and Argo ever felt in control."
</p>
<p>
As for why X7 was ultimately cancelled, PC Gamer's report does not give a clear reason. However, it is evident that a dark cloud still lies above ZA/UM. 

</p>
<p>"The entire X7 team loved the Elysium world⁠," Klindžić closed. "As fan artists, musicians, iconic voices⁠, we only wanted to keep it going, rather than leave it to wither in some dark decrepit cellar of corporate intellectual property."</p>
<p>Since Disco Elysium’s release in 2019, ZA/UM has mostly been in the headlines due to an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studio-says-lawsuits-from-former-members-have-been-resolved">extremely public legal spat</a> with former key members of the team. In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-dev-reveals-some-team-members-left-involuntarily">2022</a>, ZA/UM founder Martin Luiga claimed Disco Elysium designer Robert Kurvitz, writer Helen Hindpere, and art director Aleksander Rostov had been fired following the company's takeover by Estonian businessmen Ilmar Kompus, and Tõnis Haavel, previously convicted of investment fraud. This started a series of lawsuits and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/report-details-allegations-of-toxic-behaviour-ip-theft-at-disco-elysium-developer">accusations of toxic behaviour</a> at the studio. </p>

  <p id="Tn2NX0">It’s been a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/7/18214008/fallout-76-updates-patch-fix-future">long, hard road</a> for <em>Fallout 76 — </em>but one that has finally led to a triumphant peak. The game’s disastrous launch has been covered a thousand times from every angle; it was an intricate mess of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/1/12/18179873/fallout-76-developer-room-access-armor-paints-kenny-give-me-the-wooby">overlapping problems</a> that made the game difficult to play and extremely clippable for memes. But in 2024, the beleaguered game is stepping into the spotlight and enjoying a wave of positive attention. Bethesda has spent years patching up the ship, adding NPCs, companions, quests, Expeditions, factions, a battle royale mode, and more cryptids than you can shake a stick at.</p>
<p id="wDcJHw">The Fallout show on Amazon Prime <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24131018/fallout-games-steam-player-count-bethesda-tv-show">kickstarted a wave of interest in everything Fallout</a>; Steam charts have shown that every game in the franchise has found a new player base. The games published under Bethesda’s umbrella are <em>Fallout 3</em>, <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>,<em> </em>and <em>Fallout 4. </em>Each of these RPGs is a meaty campaign with enough content — and player-made mods — to sustain its own fandom of players. But <em>Fallout 5</em> is a ways out, and <em>Fallout 4</em> is nearly a decade old. The game best suited to draw in new fans who were hoping for just general Fallout vibes is <em>Fallout 76</em>.</p>

<p id="s7uOAo">“It’s no secret that <em>Fallout 76</em> had some bumps at release,” said creative director Jonathan Rush in an email interview with Polygon. But even in its earliest days, <em>Fallout 76</em> was defined by its enthusiastic community. These were players who loved the game, warts and all, and stuck around. It was largely because of these fans that I was able to eke out enjoyment of <em>Fallout 76, </em>and I’ve returned to the game on and off over the years, sampling from these delights. Early on, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/18/18146133/fallout-76-player-satellitejedi-raid-boss-pvp">the high points came from other players</a>, and uncovering the stories of the dead who came before.</p>
<p id="AXE2WJ">“The characters that initially launched with <em>76</em> were nuclear shadows, whose purpose was to tell the story of what all had happened between [when] the bombs drop and the point where you emerge from Vault 76,” said Rush. “Since Appalachia was initially devoid of human life, we relied on these characters as tools to give our players an understanding of the new world they had emerged into.”</p>
<p id="m7tZgI">But without characters in the world, and dialogue trees, <em>Fallout 76</em> was missing much of the <em>je ne sais quoi</em> that makes a Fallout game. While the community team gathered feedback and part of the team provided smaller-scale updates and bug fixes, a larger group got to work on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e3/2019/6/9/18658769/fallout-76-wastelanders-dlc-human-npcs-year-two-bethesda-e3-2019"><em>Wastelanders</em>, the first expansion that added NPCs</a> and a main quest to the game. “The development for <em>Wastelanders</em> started very soon after launch and was a huge effort which involved all Bethesda Game Studios locations,” said Rush. “On these types of games, it’s difficult to only support one of those – a dedicated group to maintain the integrity of the live service is crucial.”</p>

<p id="kYHg1X">Some of these updates have been much more experimental than others. Looking over the list of updates shows a healthy amount of variety. Nuclear Winter was a battle royale mode, engineered by a fictional in-game super-AI and rich with cosmetic rewards. <em>Steel Dawn</em> was a two-part narrative update that had players fight alongside the Brotherhood of Steel, learning more about the enigmatic order. The Pitt and Atlantic City were host to Expeditions, new maps outside of the main zone of Appalachia. Now, with the most recent <em>Skyline Valley</em> update, Bethesda is expanding the original map to include a weird, dangerous area to explore in the south. The bigger structural updates have been peppered with smaller experiments: killer aliens, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/18/20699410/fallout-76-hotfixes-update-patch-11-meat-week">grilling meat with a super mutant</a> and his brahmin buddy, mothman cults, and new tools for building comfier CAMPs.</p>
<p id="1liWrW">“We’re thankful to our community for giving us all the feedback and criticism they did so we could narrow our focus and fix the most critical issues,” said Rush. “We feel that because of everything we went through with the game and the community, we have a strong and open dialogue with our fans to keep the game updated in the most impactful way for our players.</p>
<p id="dIQCia">“Having an awesome Community team that listens to the feedback and effectively communicates it back to the developers was a tremendous benefit; knocking down the walls between the developers and the players is the key so we can have constructive discourse where both sides feel engaged,” Rush added.</p>
<p id="clDNph">Not every experiment was successful; Nuclear Winter was removed, some events were quietly retired, and some quests are more fondly regarded than others. But combined with greater stability and sense of identity, the new updates have transformed <em>Fallout 76</em> from a clown fiesta to a genuinely compelling game in a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/23939222/no-mans-sky-2023-review"><em>No Man’s Sky</em></a>-esque redemption arc.</p>

<p id="Q01Xlw">When looking back at past updates, Rush considers the most important lesson to be this: “Our players really love to play in our Appalachia. What I mean by this is, I look at Appalachia as the main character for this game, and the story is told by how it changes over time – both on the developer side, and through our players.”</p>
<p id="GU2VOB"><em>Skyline Valley</em>, the latest update, is an example of what expanding on Appalachia can be. While Expeditions require the player to jump on a vertibird and fly off to some distant locale, <em>Skyline Valley</em> changes the map we’ve been exploring since 2018. “Expanding the borders of our map gives us additional opportunities to flesh out the world further through stories, new locations, and the inhabitants within,” Rush explained.</p>
<p id="mwjy6u">There are more updates on the way for <em>Fallout 76</em>, and by this point, the designers have figured out what works for the game. Experiments like the Burrows, or the Pitt, weren’t always perfect — but they proved what worked and what didn’t. Throughout this entire process, <em>Fallout 76</em> has been backed by a brilliantly creative community of players who <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/26/8932043/fallout-76-role-playing-cultist-horror-theater-nerds">build CAMPs</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/26/20885650/fallout-76-vulture-trial-five-0-role-play-event-bethesda">tell cinematic stories</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/30/20891291/fallout-76-doctor-cj-martin-clinic-roleplay-bethesda">work as doctors</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22676053/fallout-76-the-theatre-company-northern-harvester-plays-productions">recreate Shakespeare’s productions</a>, or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/10/22168469/fallout-for-hope-fans-charity-drive-st-jude-childrens-hospital">run charity drives.</a></p>
<p id="BqHahD">I recently loaded into <em>Fallout 76</em> to play with a friend who had just downloaded the game, and we rocked up to an event. Once it concluded, the veterans ran up to my friend and dropped a couple of bags chock-full of goods — a welcoming gesture toward a new player, and a common ritual among longtime veterans.</p>
<p id="8YLITr">“As our game world changes, we would like to open opportunities for our more seasoned veterans,” said Rush. “We have big plans to make the game more challenging and rewarding for our adventurers and builders alike. Powerful gear and new playstyles to conquer enormously nasty encounters, and new systems to encourage our builders to push even further, are all on the table.” <em>Fallout 76</em> has come tremendously far during its life so far, and now that it’s been through such a rocky road, the rest of the journey almost feels like a victory lap. </p>

It’s an open-world multiplayer survival shooter (so many descriptors) set in a post-apocalyptic landscape. <em>Once Human</em> is a PvE game that centers around you and your friends trying to build shelter and gather resources in order to protect yourselves from a horde of gruesome monsters. If you have a group of gaming friends who like survival titles then you should probably try this out.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bfb8860aaf95c2b98204b55fc6e41378" data-recommend-id="image://bfb8860aaf95c2b98204b55fc6e41378" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A player crouches in an industrial hallway" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player crouches in an industrial hallway" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->tinyBuild</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bfb8860aaf95c2b98204b55fc6e41378" data-recommend-id="image://bfb8860aaf95c2b98204b55fc6e41378" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A player crouches in an industrial hallway" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Another multiplayer shooter,<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1456940/Level_Zero_Extraction/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1456940/Level_Zero_Extraction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Level Zero</em></a></span><em> i</em>s an extraction FPS. What appeals to me is its tactical gameplay, which is reminiscent of <em>Rainbow Six</em>,<em> </em>with mechanics like leaning around corners and less health, making combat feel more frantic and dangerous.

It has just celebrated its first visual novel publication: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outbreak The FEDORA Files: What Lydia Knows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. As a producer for the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outbreak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> series for the past seven years, and one of the founding members of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dead Drop Studios</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I have come to have an almost formulaic expectation for our games. Our primary focus since our founding has been action games in the survival horror genre, specifically targeting the retro PS1 style of play. It is a very niche style for a very niche audience, inspired by our own nostalgia of early 90’s horror games. For a three person studio, it is the type of gaming that we love and create the best. All small indies know that time and resources are precious. So how and why did we, as a small studio, end up with a visual novel side series? And was it worth it? Now that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What Lydia Knows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is complete, I wanted to share our process, what our motivations were, and how it’s changed our company’s approach to game development.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Exploring new paths forward"><span>Exploring new paths forward</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The roots of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What Lydia Knows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> come from another project of ours, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outbreak: Shades of Horro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">r, currently in development. Funded via Kickstarter, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shades of Horror</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is our first big jump into cutting edge graphics and a whole new world using </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Unreal Engine 5</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It is also the largest scale game we have ever attempted and resource management has been much trickier than we expected. Up until now, we were typically releasing a title every one to two years. The development time for Shades of Horror was projected to be five years.This presented two major challenges for us. First, with how long the final project would take to come to fruition, we would need to release other games to stay in business. We had also made the switch to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Unreal Engine 5 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">over </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Unity</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which meant we needed the opportunity to experiment with that engine as our work evolved. The second challenge was community engagement. We have a wonderful Discord community of dedicated fans of the series, and we need to keep the flame alive and our people engaged and participating in the narrative. It is extremely hard to do this with five years of no content. We had to introduce them and keep them involved in the goings on of the fictional town of Cypress Ridge until release.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What other avenues could we explore?"><span>What other avenues could we explore?</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our crew started to come up with ideas with what we could do that would not only be informative, but interactive as well. As any Kickstarter guru knows, updates are vital to the success of any long term fulfillment campaign, and as any developer knows, creating things that non-programmers or non-creatives can understand usually isn’t the priority in roughing out technical development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The universe in our games is very important to our players; it’s something that despite not starting out as a lore heavy series, our fans have always commented on enjoying. With </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shades of Horror </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">being a reboot to our in-game universe, I began to think of ways we could expand out the world that wouldn’t traditionally be the focus in a typical survival horror game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We knew whatever format we chose needed to give our players a close relationship with our characters. It would also have to be simple enough for one person to carry the workload. We considered a lot of different ways to approach this before finally settling on the visual novel format. We liked the idea of writing mini-series in the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outbreak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> universe that could run parallel to the full game experience and still allow us to be cinematic.The rest of our team was responsible for the technical build of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shades of Horror</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, so </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What Lydia Knows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was primarily my responsibility both due to the resource shortage as well as the fact the script work and logic for the visual novel experience are closely tied together.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But there was one huge problem – I never made a visual novel before!&nbsp; How would I be able to put this together? Would we be able to put it together in a way that fans who didn’t traditionally enjoy visual novels would want to play?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A breath of fresh air for our players and for our business"><span>A breath of fresh air for our players and for our business</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We were already in the process of testing a new style of game plan when we put our lore building game plan into motion. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Railbreak, Dead Drop Studios</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’ on-rails shooter/ lightgun style game, was well received by our fanbase. We were reasonably sure that the fans would be open to a new style of play, but as shooters by nature tend to be very dynamic and visual novels very static, we definitely were sailing into uncharted waters. When we announced </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Railbreak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and saw the reception both from our core base and on social media, we realized that tackling new genres and ideas not only reached different audiences, it also energized us internally to do something different.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Luckily, it turns out this new approach had plenty of advantages. I was looking to tell a more interactive and character-based horror story, and it was clear this ambition could be better realized as a visual novel. It also helped mix things up. As a small studio, we don’t have the infrastructure to create a reliable sequel over and over, especially as games become more expensive and complicated to make. There’s also the problem that iterative genre titles can excite a core fanbase, but for those who aren’t invested in this type of gameplay, it doesn’t really give newcomers a reason to take a look at our products. Our business model was previously focused around a very specific gameplay style, and now it has evolved to being focused on the story we’re looking to tell and what type of game is most appropriate to tell it. The diversity and experimental nature of projects like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What Lydia Knows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> allows us as a small operation to quickly gather feedback and pivot if something we create either resonates or flops with our players.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Learning something new"><span>Learning something new</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In order to pull off </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What Lydia Knows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I needed to closely study the visual novel genre from a marketing and sales standpoint. I also had to expand my skill base. I am normally the writer and overall narrative designer on our games. This was a unique challenge and an opportunity to get my hands dirty in a different way, as my husband and business partner, Evan, is our studio engineer.&nbsp; He was able to use his knowledge to put together an environment for me to convert my script into an interactive game with tons of branching paths, choices, and endings. But because the coding required a thorough knowledge of the script, I had to do all of the scripting myself. This was equal parts fun and frustrating. I loved learning how to do new things, but learning how to code and write for a new type of game at the same time often threw me for a loop.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The rest of the company tackled the concept of how to provide additional side content and features that would enhance the overall value of the product and content that might retain past fans who were not thrilled at the visual novel style. While I handled the core game, the rest of the team was able to reappropriate the tech work Evan had done and expand on it to create what is now known as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outbreak RPG</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a bonus title offered in the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What Lydia Knows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> package. Alongside other bonuses like a concept art gallery, a music player, and a scene builder, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What Lydia Knows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> evolved into a robust product with a lot to offer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’m extremely proud of what the team has been able to accomplish with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What Lydia Knows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although the change in game style was a risk, fans responded very positively at having a different mode of interaction with characters both new and already beloved. The reception from both our players and from our publishing partners has been better than we could’ve expected so far, which is extremely motivating. We consider this experiment a success. Going forward, we will challenge ourselves to create new experiences and products that enable us to both reach greater audiences and satisfy our existing playerbase.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you find yourself stuck in a creative or financial rut, opening your mind to creating new and different products may just be the way to reignite your passion and your business!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="473" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Destiny 2’s</em> recent <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/is-destiny-2-the-final-shape-the-franchise-renaissance-weve-been-waiting-for-or-just-another-outlier/"><em>Final Shape</em> expansion</a> brings a lot of new weapons to the table that seriously shake up the meta. The Ergo Sum sword for example is an exotic secondary Sword that you can farm to get a god roll on, which is something virtually unheard of before. One such weapon that’s been extremely popular has a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-destiny-2-blast-furnace-god-rolls/">god roll</a> as well, though it can be tough to nail that down. Here’s the god roll for The Call in <em>Destiny 2</em>, including perks and attachments.</p> <h2 id="h-the-best-perks-barrel-and-magazine-for-the-call-in-destiny-2" data-injectable="false">The best perks, barrel, and magazine for The Call in Destiny 2</h2> <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="true">The way The Call is designed implies that this weapon <strong>will become your new primary</strong>, so how we’re building this is to deal with add clear while having some respectable elite damage. Naturally, you’ll want to mainly use your heavy weapon against things like bosses, while your secondary is a wildcard. With those goals in mind, you’ll want to take the following perks and attachments:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Barrel </strong>– Quick Launch</li> <li><strong>Magazine </strong>– Tactical Mag</li> <li><strong>Perk 1</strong> – Lead from Gold</li> <li><strong>Perk 2</strong> – Desperate Measures</li> </ul> <p data-characters="648" data-current-count="808" data-injectable="false">On the barrel side of things, <strong>Quick Launch</strong> helps to compensate for The Call’s rather low projectile speed. The <strong>Tactical Mag</strong>, meanwhile, is a bunch of flat buffs all around that help improve some of the weapon’s drawbacks a bit. As for perks, <strong>Lead from Gold</strong> always pairs well with Special ammo weapons that are meant to be primaries. That extra ammo is a godsend at times. <strong>Desperate Measures</strong> also provides some extra damage, and is especially useful in grenade/melee builds like some of the meta Prismatic builds right now. If you want, One for All is a nice alternative since you’ll be hitting a lot of enemies fast with The Call.</p>

<p data-characters="531" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While many weapons were introduced with <em>Destiny 2’s </em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-players-praise-the-call-for-dragging-them-through-the-toughest-encounters-in-the-final-shape-and-beyond/"><em>The Final Shape </em>expansion</a>, some of the most interesting are the Dealer’s Choice weapons. These weapons are fairly good on their own, but when paired together can increase the rate that your super charges at. I run a build using them myself, and I get my super back alarmingly fast. One such weapon is particularly interesting thanks to its <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-the-ergo-sum-exotic-sword-destiny-2-the-final-shape/">role in your arsenal</a>. Here’s the god roll for the No Hesitation auto rifle in <em>Destiny 2</em>, including attachments and perks.</p> <h2 id="h-the-best-perks-barrel-and-magazine-for-the-no-hesitation-in-destiny-2" data-injectable="false">The best perks, barrel, and magazine for the No Hesitation in Destiny 2</h2> <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false">The No Hesitation is interesting due to its Support Frame perk, which causes hip-fire bullets aimed at teammates to heal them. This heal is incredibly strong, sending a guardian from red health to full in less than a second. Since it’s so strong, we want to take perks that further its role as a healing machine.</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="478" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Barrel </strong>– Fluted Barrel</li> <li><strong>Magazine</strong> – Flared Magwell</li> <li><strong>Perk 1</strong> – Physic</li> <li><strong>Perk 2 </strong>– Circle of Life</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="578" data-current-count="578" data-injectable="false">The combination of Fluted Barrel and Flared Magwell is an iconic pairing for any weapon, providing stability, reload speed, and handling by a significant amount. Physic provides restoration whenever you rapidly heal allies, and you’ll be doing that a lot, making these two a natural pairing. Circle of Life allows for some increased damage after providing healing to your teammate, which helps since you need to deal damage to consistently heal your teammates. Subsistence is a good alternative in the first perk slot if you feel that the restoration is a little overkill.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warzone-players-want-one-major-thing-removed-when-black-ops-6-update-releases.901662/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/warzone-players-want-one-major-thing-removed-when-black-ops-6-update-releases/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=warzone-players-want-one-major-thing-removed-when-black-ops-6-update-releases<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="258" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With <em>Black Ops 6</em> firmly on the horizon, fans of <em>Call of Duty</em>‘s battle royale <em>Warzone</em> are already thinking about what it means for the mode. Many want to see the number of guns slashed, begging Treyarch and Raven to remove <em>MW2</em> and <em>MW3</em> guns permanently. </p> <p data-characters="247" data-current-count="247" data-injectable="false">When <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> was released, many thought that the guns from the previous year’s game would be removed. This wasn’t the case, however, with guns carrying through from the old gun, and all the guns from the new one added in too. </p> <p data-characters="222" data-current-count="469" data-injectable="true">This meant there was well over 100 guns to choose from, which sounds good in theory, but ends up becoming messy, especially when the old guns are so weak compared to the new ones that there’s no point in using them. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>A lot of guns in <em>Warzone</em> right now. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="559" data-injectable="true">In a post on the <em>Warzone</em> subreddit, Deranged1337 wrote that they “Can’t think of anything worse than scrolling through 200 guns and 300 attachments, and that’s not even the fact that they [are] all going to get nerfed into the ground.”</p>
 <p data-characters="222" data-current-count="222" data-injectable="false">This sentiment was echoed by another player, who agreed that “<em>MW2</em> guns and attachments are already bad [and] no option to filter them, adding third game into <em>Warzone</em> will end up just like <em>Vanguard</em> integration.”</p> <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="519" data-injectable="true">“As much as I love some of the <em>MW2</em> and <em>MW3</em> weapons,” wrote silenced_soul, “It’s a hard no. More bloat in this game is bad. Already lags.” Potential-Poetry-542 just feels like they’re “ready for a fresh start” with new weapons and attachments.”</p>
 <p data-characters="263" data-current-count="263" data-injectable="false">I definitely agree with the players above on a personal level, as I already find the inclusion of <em>MW2</em> guns alongside <em>MW3 </em>weapons to be too much. Plus, with <em>Black Ops 6</em> set in the early 90s, it doesn’t make sense for old guns to be alongside modern weapons. </p> <p data-characters="271" data-current-count="534" data-injectable="false">Unfortunately, it looks like all three games will have weapons in <em>Warzone</em>, unless Activision decides to make a significant change. Thankfully, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/do-mw2-mw3-weapons-carry-into-black-ops-6-and-warzone-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>MW2</em> and <em>MW3</em> guns won’t be in <em>BO6</em></a> though, so that’s something to look forward to if you’re not a fan of bloat. </p>

<p><em>Shady Motives&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/84389?tab=description" rel="noopener" target="_blank">adds a brand new quest</a> to&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4</em>, and its lead voice actor is none other than Wes Johnson, who provided the voice for iconic characters like&nbsp;<em>Oblivion</em>'s Lucien Lachance and Sheogorath, as well as&nbsp;<em>Fallout 3</em>'s Fawkes.</p>
<p>The mod was created in just one weekend, with community members coming together as part of Johnson's <a href="https://falloutforhope.com/wes-johnsons-voiceapalooza/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Voiceapalooza charity event</a> in order to vote on what should be included. Once the mod's elements had been decided on, modders then came together for a weekend to create it.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to new gear, including weapons and armor, so you won't walk away from your adventure empty-handed.</p>
<p>The mod is, of course, free to download on PC and Xbox, but if you want, you can <a href="https://donate.tiltify.com/a76d5bcd-6fb8-4b78-9acf-fdd1baf1e657/details" rel="noopener" target="_blank">donate to the Alzheimer's Association</a> from the mod's page, with a default donation of $10 being set up for you (which can be changed) if you choose to do so.</p>
<p>So far, Johnson and the&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>charity team&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>For Hope have <a href="https://tiltify.com/+wes-johnsons-alzheimers-association-fundraiser/wes-johnsonfallout-for-hope-to-end-alzheimers-2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank">raised almost $35,000</a> for the Alzheimer's Association, and earlier this week,&nbsp;the official&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>For Hope X (formerly Twitter) account <a href="https://x.com/FalloutForHope/status/1799532680633012429" rel="noopener" target="_blank">revealed</a> that it has raised more than $100,000 in total for the charity.</p>

<p id="6zlLgd">(You technically pay a visit to this dungeon through one of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23037719/four-belfries-imbued-sword-key-waygates-farum-azula-nokron-eternal-city-chapel-of-anticipation">Three Belfries</a> portals, but that’s to a side area and not full access as outlined in this guide.)</p>
<p id="djORmL">Once you awake after the cutscene with Milena, you will find yourself in Crumbling Farum Azula.</p>

<p id="qwmc5N">At the end of the path, you’ll find a body with a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22950495/smithing-stone-locations-map-west-limgrave-liurnia-crystal-tunnel"><strong>Smithing Stone [8]</strong></a>. There isn’t a straight path to move forward, so jump over the edge on the right side and jump your way to the entrance a little below. On your way, find a <strong>Golden Rune [9]</strong> on the last platform.</p>
<p id="m5L05I">Keep following the only available path through a short corridor and descending some stairs. You eventually arrive in a room with five beastmen.  While most of them won’t pay attention to you, one patrols the area. You can lure it to the path you came from, so you don’t have to face all of them at the same time. </p>

<p id="zlnFGT">Beastmen are the most common enemy type in the region. While there are some variations that cast magic or throw boomerang-like weapons at you, most are capable of fast slashing sequences of attacks that can kill you pretty quickly. On the other hand, they are quite squishy, so the best strategy is to approach them from behind and quickly kill them.</p>
<p id="oor3eb">Once the room is clear, don’t forget to grab the <strong>Old Fang</strong> from a corpse.</p>
<p id="sEFKc2">Proceed to the next room where you find two beastmen and a <strong>Lightningproof Dried Liver</strong> on the right side of the room. Now, before you go ahead in the next corridor, turn left to find the <strong>Crumbling Beast Grave Site of Grace</strong> in Farum Azula where you should rest a bit.</p>

<p id="KgU9wG">Go back to the corridor and down the stairs to arrive at an opening area facing the tornado.  Along the way, you will find a <strong>Smithing Stone [6]</strong>, <strong>Smithing Stone [8]</strong> and a<strong> Dragonwound Grease</strong> at the edge. You need to reach the furthest side of it, but, as soon as you get to the middle of the way, an <strong>Ancient Dragon</strong> lands in front of you.</p>
<p id="IngUj3">This is a tough enemy that not only attacks you with massive limbs but with powerful magic. Since defeating this enemy is not obligatory, you can just run past it toward an entrance on the left side that leads you to a corpse with a <strong>Smithing Stone [8]</strong> and the <strong>Crumbling Beast Grave Depths Site of Grace</strong>.</p>

<p id="tSOgBW">On the other hand, in case you feel like you’re ready to face the dragon — and you’ll end up finding more than one in Farum Azula — here are some tips.</p>
<p id="wug5D8">First, they are strong against elemental damage and considerably resistant against physical damage. Staying below the dragon is the most safe strategy since it helps you avoid most of its attacks. While focusing on the hind legs makes it easier to avoid frontal moves, the ancient dragon has other attacks that can still hit you. Luckily, you can summon your <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23022025/best-summons-spirit-ashes-how-to-upgrade">Spirit Ashes</a> to help you.</p>

<h2 id="VWcbwc"><strong>Crumbling Beast Grave Depths</strong></h2>
<p id="lcuNIp">Leave the room with the site of grace and move forward to the next room to find a <strong>Smithing Stone [7]</strong>, one patrolling beastmen, and another one lying on the ground. Proceed after dealing with the enemies by entering the corridor that will take you to the lower floor or use the window on the left side to access the upper floor by climbing the roof. We advise you to take the latter first.</p>

<h3 id="lhfAl6"><strong>Through the window </strong></h3>
<p id="1IK5Mu">Get on the ledge of the large window and follow it to climb the roof right beside it. From there, access the upper floor. This room has two big openings on the floor that give access to the lower floor. Although you want to go there after grabbing all the loot in this room, beware of them so you don’t fall before you’re prepared.</p>

<p id="vNGptf">There are six beastmen in this room. Watch out for their magic. After killing them, get the <strong>Gravel Stone</strong> on the left side of the room, a <strong>Smithing Stone [6]</strong> near to the edge of one of the openings, and a <strong>Great Grave Glovewort</strong> at the farthest side of the room. </p>
<h3 id="Mga8Fl"><strong>Down the corridor </strong></h3>
<p id="qdytw1">You can get to the lower floor using the short corridor in the room after the site of grace or via the second opening on the upper floor, from where you can jump to a bridge with two beastmen. We suggest starting from the initial room and following the corridor. </p>
<p id="wXIAC3">Once you leave the corridor, you’ll find some stairs that will take you to the lower part. Going right and following the corridors will take you to that bridge you saw from the upper floor, where you’ll have to fight a few beastmen. Going straight and descending the stairs will lead to 14x Lightning Greatbolts and get to the lower area.</p>
<p id="nDHfBe">The lower area is a large chamber with four beastmen, an <strong>Ancient Dragon Prayerbook</strong>, and three exits.</p>
<ul>
<li id="Orq7y6">The northwest exit leads to a body with a <strong>Golden Rune [12].</strong>

<p id="xlg9jd">By following the left route, going south, keep close to the wall to avoid the enemies. Eventually, you get to a small lake with three Lesser Wormfaces, a <strong>Rejuvenating Boluses</strong> in the middle of it, and a gazebo on the farthest side of the area.</p>

<p id="0QGWsn">There are two corridors on the left for you to explore, some stairs to descend, and a skeleton waiting to ambush you. </p>
<h3 id="VAMQJZ"><strong>Focusing on the main objective</strong></h3>
<p id="sEHRzb">In case you just want to progress through this area as quickly as possible, then you should take the first route. It’s a corridor that takes you to a balcony where you can sneak attack another skeleton and find a path on the left. Following it will take you to another platform with a ladder. Climb it, defeat the skeleton at the top of it, and look northeast to find another corridor where there is a <strong>Great Grave Glovewort</strong> But, grabbing the item triggers an ambush and three skeletons come from the ceiling. After defeating them, you should go back, stick to the wall on your left, and jump on the lower platforms.</p>
<p id="EFIcEl">You will get to a corridor where there’s a patrolling skeleton and <strong>3x Gravel Stones</strong> at the end of it. You can now leave the corridor and you will be back to the segment before jumping in the hole. Take a <strong>Somber Smithing Stone [9]</strong> that is near the end of the corridor, and make your way to the <strong>Dragon Temple Site of Grace</strong> right in front of you. </p>

<p id="EZIoqk">When it comes to the path on the right, first you go through a corridor where there is a patrolling Banished Knight. Kill it and get to the next room where you will find two Banished Knights and the <strong>Azula Beastman Ashes</strong>. If you leave the room using the door on the west side, there is a <strong>Somber Smithing Stone [9]</strong> to grab. On the opposite side of the room, you get to the <strong>Dragon Temple Transept Site of Grace</strong>, which is just beside the boss arena.</p>

<h3 id="9OncU1"><strong>Back on track</strong></h3>
<p id="N8Y0YA">From the <strong>Dragon Temple grace,</strong> in the next corridor, there’s a <strong>Smithing Stone [6]</strong> and stairs that take you to a new section from where you start facing Banished Knights. Around Farum Azula, you find three types of these enemies, each with unique abilities: Dual Blades, Lancers, and Sword &amp; Shield. They are pretty tough foes, who can use skills similar to weapons arts, so try to face one at a time. </p>

<p id="2dPtGH">Once you descend the stairs, turn right. There are two paths for you to go here. First, go left, and enter a corridor with another Banished Knight. Up ahead, a second Banished Knight is standing still close to a body with a <strong>Stone Key</strong>. By entering the room next door, prepare to face a third Banished Knight in a short dead-end corridor where you can grab 2x <strong>Dragonwound Grease</strong>.</p>

<p id="LujEhO">With all the loot collected, you should go back and take the stairs in the corridor instead of turning left. At the bottom of the stairs, there is a patrolling Banished Knight and another one in a room to your left. You won’t find items there, so you can simply ignore them and enter the room of the first boss encounter in Crumbling Farum Azula, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23143025/godskin-duo-boss-strategy-apostle-noble-crumbling-farum-azula">Godskin Duo</a>.</p>
<p id="DRmPyY">Defeating them will unlock the <strong>Dragon Temple Altar Site of Grace</strong>.</p>
<hr id="rjLjMy">
<h2 id="RuGy0A"><strong>Dragon Temple Altar</strong></h2>
<p id="IVBxPZ">With the first boss encounter finished you can follow three different paths. On the south side of the room, you’ll find the <strong>Dragon Temple Transept Site of Grace</strong>. The northwest entrance takes you to a room with a Banished Knight and a body with a <strong>Golden Rune [12]</strong>. Explore both places before heading north.</p>
<p id="4IOvKQ">From this exit, you get to what seems to have been a room that now has no ceiling and only a part of the floor where you are at. To keep moving on, you need to access the lower floor. You can jump to the lower level or descend the stairs to your right. In either case, two beastmen await for you there. Defeat them and go to the next room with a dog and a <strong>Golden Rune [11]</strong>. </p>

<p id="Nug915">If you take the stairs at the end of the corridor, you will access the upper part of this building, where there are some beastmen, a pillar on the left side that helps you reach another platform with a beastmen and an <strong>Ancient Dragon Scale Smithing Stone</strong>; and by going straight ahead, to your left, you find a Stonesword Key door.</p>
<p id="lCK93g">In case you have one of these items with you, we advise using it to get to an elevator that takes you to the <strong>Dragon Temple Lift Site of Grace</strong>, which gives you access to a whole new area that you may want to explore before moving on.</p>

<p id="sCqMyU">By going straight up ahead from where you got the Golden Seed, you can walk over two structures to reach the other side. Move on until you get to another sleeping Ancient Dragon. This one is way too tired to fight you if not attacked. Walk around it to find a <strong>Golden Rune [12]</strong> at their back and a walkway to the next platform. Go toward the southeast to find a <strong>Smithing Stone [7]</strong>. To get to the next platform, you need to use the walkway behind the large structure at the southwest of the platform. Once there, you need to jump onto a bridge a little bit lower to move on. </p>

<p id="7Wk6Cg">In this new area, there is an old building where you find the <strong>Ancient Dragon Apostle’s Cookbook [4]</strong>. But be careful! There’s a skeleton just waiting to ambush you on the right side of the building. From the left side of the building, you can jump to grab a <strong>Somber Smithing Stone [8]</strong> from a body on the edge. Below where you are, there is another platform with a <strong>Smithing Stone [8]</strong>. With that, we finish exploring the area from the lift. Teleport back to the Dragon’s Temple Lift grace, use the elevator and descend the stairs we took in the last section. It’s time to follow the corridor</p>

<p id="JjfCdm">Once you leave the short corridor, ahead of you, there is a sequence of debris that you must use to platform your way to the next building. By getting to the second platform, you can get pretty close to the edge to fall to a platform where you find the <strong>Dragoncrest Shield Talisman +2</strong> right below it. This is the most safe strategy since it’s difficult to land in the correct place by jumping.  On the right side, before the last platform, you also find a <strong>Golden Rune [12]</strong>. </p>
<p id="0IObo7">The next building splits into three paths. To the left, there are two beastmen, which you can ignore. Go right, and follow the stairs to the upper floor, where you find a spell-casting beastmen, a dog, and a <strong>Dappled Cured Meat</strong>. Get back to the lower floor and head to the north path that takes you to an arena where you must face a <strong>Crucible Knight</strong>. At the beginning of the battle, they only use their sword and shield to attack you. However, after losing some HP, they will start using a flying attack and breathe fire at you.</p>
<p id="eM8H67">Although beating them is not mandatory, you will have a hard time trying to escape. Whether you defeat it or are capable of running, you want to jump on the platform on the north side of the arena — where you also find a <strong>Smithing Stone [8]</strong> — and make your way to the next site of grace.</p>

<p id="jduv3c">From where you are, it’s possible to see an Ancient Dragon on the south side of the area. Once they see you, the dragon will start casting magic attacks at you. Since exploring the area — which is filled with Warhawkes — is difficult while trying to avoid the dragon’s attacks, the best strategy is to run straight to where they are and right up until the point marked on the map below. After you’ve done that, they will fly away leaving the area a little bit less dangerous to you. </p>

<p id="uHZIQJ">With the dragon out of the way, it’s time to properly explore and collect the loot. First, there is a <strong>Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone</strong> in a gazebo behind where the dragon was. In the middle of the arena, you find a <strong>Golden Rune [12]</strong> and a <strong>Fulgurbloom</strong>. Now, instead of going back using the bridge you came from, go northeast, and jump on the rooftop of a building to reach a higher area. Besides some warhawkes trying to kill you, this area has a <strong>Golden Seed</strong> and a <strong>Smithing Stone [7].</strong></p>

<p id="YfHSeC">The next step is to go southwest to where we ran from the dragon and keep going right. You need to fight a couple of beastmen as you go a little bit further. When you arrive at a collapsed tower that serves as a walkway that you need to traverse to progress, you need to be extremely careful. There is a beastmen on the other side throwing boomerangs at you which can easily make you fall. When it comes to actually crossing over, start on the right side then move to the left.</p>

<p id="3PulME">Go ahead and enter the building. Defeat the three beastmen inside and grab the <strong>Somberstone Miner’s Bell Bearing [5]</strong>. By taking the door on the right side, you get to the stairs that will take you to an elevator and, consequently, to the <strong>Beside the Great Bridge Site of Grace</strong>. We advise doing so to save your progress. However, go back to the previous building in case you want to explore a new area and perform a quick time travel. If not, move on to the Besides the Great Bridge section of this guide.</p>

First, head north and enter the building following the single available path. The door takes you to an outside area with lots of bodies of beastmen on the ground. Among them, there are some alive that are just sleeping. A good way of spotting them is by pressing the targeting command. </p>

While inside you will find a chest with the <strong>Old Lord’s Talisman</strong>, three beastmen will jump at you once you enter the tower.

To reach it, you need to get closer to the edge on the east side and jump to the platform right below you, where there is a beastmen and <strong>5x Lightning Greatbolt</strong>.</p>
<p id="7cCR8H">Inside the tower, you can activate the lever to call the lift. Go to the bottom of the tower and go left to find a chest with the <strong>Drake Knight </strong>armor set. Having explored this whole area, teleport back to the Beside the Great Bridge grace.</p>

<p id="LO71JM">Back to the bridge, on the south side of it, you find the boss arena where you need to face Maliketh, the Black Blade. On the way to the gate, you will find a <strong>Golden Rune [12]</strong> and a <strong>Somber Smithing Stone [7]</strong>. In front of the gate to the arena, there is a Draconic Tree Sentinel. While their move set is similar to the one you fought to enter <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22982996/leyndell-royal-capital-site-of-grace-tips-tricks-hidden-path-strategy-boss-morgott">Leyndell</a>, this one is weaker. You can, however, simply ignore it and enter the arena. On the other hand, once you kill it, they don’t respawn, and drop the <strong>Malformed Dragon </strong>armor set. </p>

While everyone else was glued to the raid race, enjoying the wild 12-player final mission it unlocked, and has been deep in the post-game grind ever since, I’m still barely past the half-way point in the main campaign and, I gotta be honest, it was a slog up to that point. In terms of story and presentation, <em>The Final Shape</em> is everything I’ve hoped for so far, but those early missions had nothing on <em>The Witch Queen</em>. </p><p>Fortunately, literally everyone else I’ve asked has said the back-half of <em>The Final Shape</em> is its strongest, and a genuinely bold display of the game’s ambitions firing on all cylinders. It’s been a while since <em>Destiny 2</em> sucked me in like a live service black hole, but I can’t wait to experience some of that again this weekend. In fact, I’m almost glad I missed out on the initial wave of everyone completing the expansion, because now I can experience the campaign in my own time, without the anxiety of the power grind or keeping up with the rest of the <em>Destiny 2 </em>community zeitgeist. I’ve been spoiled enough to know there’s an<em> Avengers</em>-style showdown coming and I can’t wait. After all, it’s one I’ve waited 10 years for. — Ethan Gach  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6e5e47623ddaebfb79070cde9bd1d494" data-recommend-id="image://6e5e47623ddaebfb79070cde9bd1d494" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sam Lake appears in Alan Wake II: Night Springs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sam Lake appears in Alan Wake II: Night Springs." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Remedy</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6e5e47623ddaebfb79070cde9bd1d494" data-recommend-id="image://6e5e47623ddaebfb79070cde9bd1d494" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sam Lake appears in Alan Wake II: Night Springs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows (Steam Deck YMMV)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Enjoy some more Remedy weirdness</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-review-control-max-payne-1850994952&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-review-control-max-payne-1850994952"><em>Alan Wake II</em></a></span> was my favorite game of last year.

It’s a collection of three non-canon self-contained stories about side characters from the base game. What that means in practice is that developer Remedy is having more fun than ever, as the studio can handwave away any wild things they get up to in the DLC as not part of the canon. There is a story about the Alan-obsessed waitress we see in the base game, a meta-story about actor Shawn Ashmore playing a fictionalized version of himself, and even a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/control-the-kotaku-review-1837569523&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/control-the-kotaku-review-1837569523"><em>Control</em></a></span><em> </em>crossover starring Jesse Faden.

But, for what I believe to be <em>really</em> good reasons, I never played <em>Inquisition.</em> That’s odd to me, given <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> is one of my all-time favorite games. I was, in fact, the very first person in the world outside of BioWare to finish it! I spent 120 hours playing it for its world-exclusive review, and I <em>adored </em>it. I was even one of the few people who didn’t hate the second game on its release. But by the time <em>Inquisition</em> came along, things were different. It came out the year I had a kid, and boy did I no longer have time to play a 700-hour RPG. And when I looked at it, and saw it didn’t even vaguely resemble the first two games, I had no inclination to try to fit it in.</p><p>Working with people at <em>Kotaku</em>, I’ve learned just how loved <em>Inquisition</em> truly is. First the dearly departed Ash Parrish, and now completely besotted Kenneth Shepard, has been enough to make me believe I’m missing out on something, even if the stupid game doesn’t let you zoom out far enough to satisfactorily control battles with its third-person action game delusions. So I’ve installed it on my Xbox, rather than the PC on which I would otherwise play any and all RPGs, in the hope that a controller will convince me to embrace its heresy. I’ve already closed a few green flickering portals, and plan to spend any spare moments I get over the weekend seeing what’s what. I’ll admit, in a sneaky 10 minutes playing this morning before dropping the boy off at school, I found some Elfroot behind a building, and that suckered me in hard. —John Walker  </p><hr><p> And that wraps our picks for this weekend.

<p>Final Fantasy 14’s Dawntrail expansion is scheduled to arrive on July 2, 2024. Ahead of the release, we have just received a brand new launch trailer for the DLC. This trailer gives players a glimpse of the new journey that the Warriors of the Light will be setting sail towards, along with a showcase of some gameplay elements. Check out the launch trailer for Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail below.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="FINAL FANTASY XIV: DAWNTRAIL Launch Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7BghYTigv8E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>The Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail expansion will transport us to the uncharted region of Tural, nestled in the western continent. This is a new setting and a gateway to a thrilling adventure, the birthplace of the fabled ‘legend of the golden city’. As the rite of succession looms, your involvement as a player will be pivotal in shaping the future ruler of the nation of Tuliyollal.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Additionally, players will have new jobs up for grabs, such as Viper and Pictomancer. Vipers are agile, close-ranged combatants that excel in quick, precise strikes. They wield two one-handed blades, allowing them to unleash a flurry of slashes against their enemies. Vipers are particularly effective when enemies are weakened, as they can deliver the final blow. On the other hand, a Pictomancer is a unique character capable of bringing imagination to reality. This character uses a magical brush to cast different colourful spells against the enemies, creating stunning visual effects and powerful attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the FF14 Dawntrail expansion, a treasure trove of new content awaits. Embark on thrilling Raids like Echoes of Vana’diel, The Arcadion, and Futures Rewritten (Ultimate). Traverse through a myriad of new dungeons, engage in field operations, and conquer challenging trials. The horizon of adventure has expanded.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Furthermore, the system has received an all-new graphics update, including many visual improvements, enhanced texture and shadow resolution, and improved material qualities for characters and environments. The Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail expansion introduces a new playable race, the Female Hrothgar. This race, known for their strength and resilience, brings a unique aesthetic to the game. Moreover, you can now create a truly unique character with the new set of customization options introduced with the DLC.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In other news, Final Fantasy 14’s director has denied involvement in the FF9 remake. In the comments, let us know your feelings about Final Fantasy 14’s Dawntrail expansion.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[First Madden 25 Features Revealed By EA Sports]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/madden-25-features-revealed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/first-madden-25-features-revealed-by-ea-sports.901632/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/madden-25-features-revealed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>A day after its originally planned reveal, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA Sports has announced</a> the first set of features coming to Madden 25 when it releases on August 16.</p>



<p>This year’s game will include a number of changes, both big and small, to multiple aspects of the game. From gameplay to presentation to game modes, EA Sports has seemingly touched on a lot of different areas to improve the game for players.</p>



<p>Before getting into what was announced, it should be noted that this isn’t everything coming to Madden 25. The full reveal is currently scheduled for Tuesday, June 18. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-madden-25">What’s New In Madden 25?</h2>



<h3 id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h3>



<p>Moving on to what was announced. Starting with gameplay, EA Sports confirmed it’s new BOOM Tech technology on the field. According to EA, BOOM Tech is “new physics system that calculates player ratings and skill-based timing to deliver 1-on-1 ball carrier impacts for more authentic physical outcomes”. Accompanying that on the field is a new ball-carrier balance system that will allow players to combine jukes, spins, and hesi-steps in “branching animations” as well as new ways to break tackles and recover your balance based on ratings.</p>



<p>Also coming to the on-field action are new and updated playbooks and audibles for more variety of plays. One example used by EA is the “Miami Motion” plays that had been created for wide receiver Tyreek Hill. The last thing announced regarding gameplay is that Madden 25 will feature “more control at every position”. </p>



<p>“From the trenches to the sidelines, core gameplay gets increased control across key areas including innovated passing, catching, blocking, and coverages,” EA said. </p>



<p>Speaking of passing, it appears the passing meter debuting in College Football 25 will be making it’s way to Madden 25 based on the short gameplay clip shown. Another gameplay feature coming to Madden from College Football is the new defensive switch stick control that allows players to flick the right stick to control different players post snap.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Ok, I'm still trying to confirm the legitimacy of all of this, but a couple things I was sent today about Madden 25:</p><p>– 3 broadcast teams in total<br>– Overhauled NFL Draft presentation in franchise<br>– Create-A-Team <br>– More "TV Like" presentation</p><p>Again, I'm not 100% on them, but I'm…</p></div>— Mike Straw of Insider-Gaming.com/TWSN.net (@MikeStrawMedia) <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeStrawMedia/status/1801335720973304054?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 13, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<h3 id="h-presentation">Presentation</h3>



<p>When it comes to the game’s presentation, EA confirmed an Insider Gaming report that there are two more commentary teams coming to the game this year. Mike Tirico and Greg Olsen will make up one of the new teams while Kate Scott and Brock Huard will be the other new team. Brandon Gaudin and Charles Davis are also return to the virtual booth.</p>



<p>Within Franchise Mode, another <a href="https://x.com/MikeStrawMedia/status/1801335720973304054" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming report</a> was confirmed as the NFL Draft will receive an overhaul within the mode. EA also promises more depth and immersion within the mode as whole.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-game-modes">Game Modes</h3>



<p>Create-A-Team is back in the form of Team Builder. Similar to College Football 25, you’ll be able to create your team online with custom logos and create your team, uniforms, helmets, and field. Team Builder teams will also be able to be used in Online Franchise.</p>



<p>Franchise mode, in addition to the NFL Draft presentation, features a number of new updates according to EA. Those improvements, per EA, are:</p>



<ul>
<li>NFL Draft Night in Franchise is more authentic than ever with a rebuilt environment, fresh player fits, iconic moments, a draft prospect board that’s easier to navigate, and real-time draft grades. See inside team war rooms and green rooms as the night progresses, then meet Roger Goodell on a new NFL Draft stage in a fresh fit that suits you.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Manage personalities through dynamic storylines in team meeting rooms, coach’s offices, press conferences, and practice sidelines.</li>



<li>Franchise Central provides simplified league creation tools and delivers more important information at your fingertips, including personal messages and top stories that make your Franchise experience feel more like the NFL in every moment.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Core Depth Improvements featuring team and rookie records, improved team roster AI for free agency and draft selections, new draft stories and generators, refined player progression logic focused on younger and older players, revamped news content focused on important games every week and female models in create a coach for the first time, as well as a fresh Super Bowl celebration experience.</li>



<li>Tuning and progression across multiple Franchise systems has been altered to ensure teams are smarter, reflecting real NFL strategy.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Crossplay in Franchise will launch in Madden NFL 25 after a successful beta via a live service update at holiday last year.</li>
</ul>



<p>Superstar mode will see a new “superstar quest system” that will see your player “prove to the media, coach, and teammates that you have what it takes to reach superstar status.” The mode features “completely revamped” progression curves to help your journey feel more authentic, and you’ll also be able to bring your Road to Glory player from College Football 25 over to Madden 25’s superstar mode.</p>



<p>Madden 25 will be available on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4. Keep in mind that certain gameplay features are only available on current-gen consoles and PC.</p>

                <p>The summer is nearly here, and that means Madden season is upon us once again. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-25/" data-ref-id="5000-629476">Madden NFL 25</a> features Niners halfback Christian McCaffrey <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-cover-star-revealed/1100-6524111/" data-ref-id="1100-6524111">on the cover</a> and improved rushing mechanics befitting of the superstar in the game itself. But this year's game is going to be more than that. We recently spent a day at EA Orlando (formerly Tiburon) to check out Madden 25 in advance of its launch this August and came back with 25 things the Madden community should know before they strap on their shoulder pads for Madden 25.</p><h2>Boom Tech</h2><p dir="ltr">In the third year of EA's "Fieldsense" experiment--that being the team's slow and steady rebuild of Madden's core on-field gameplay and mechanics--it's Boom Tech that's taking center stage. Though Boom Tech is the type of juicy marketable term EA always builds into a game launch, the underlying gameplay changes were apparent in my hands-on time with the game.</p><p dir="ltr">So what is it? Boom Tech is Madden 25's overhauled physics and collision system--basically a more momentum-, size-, and skill-driven system that resolves the ever-present football question: What happens when this guy runs into that guy? Play after play, game after game, Boom Tech is meant to result in more realistic, varied, and thus unpredictable tackle animations.</p><p dir="ltr">The team said it's heard from players that Madden being driven by canned animations is a legacy frustration, and though Boom Tech is not bringing a freeform, ragdoll-like effect, what it does do is break tackles into several split-second animations that can be chained in different ways in different moments, which, if tuned well, should mean both more visual variety as well as a heightened emphasis on players' measurable size and skills.</p><p dir="ltr">In some examples I saw, a ball carrier was run over by a charging defender with the momentum advantage, clipped on the side by the defender who partially whiffed on the hit, and lastly, spun out of the tackle. In each case, the game film was broken down like the Zapruder film to exhibit how numbers are being crunched under the hood, so to speak, and in an instant that doesn't disrupt the game, but rather brings a more authentic experience to the tackling mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">Truth be told, it is a tricky mechanic to explain. I don't envy the person who has to say all this in a single sentence for the back-of-the-box description. I think when you get your hands on Madden 25, you'll feel the difference too.</p><h2>Enhanced rushing attack</h2><p dir="ltr">Along with the enhanced tackling mechanics, there is a greater focus on the running game. Running backs will now have more situational awareness, as seen in the way they "get skinny" as they run through a lane in the trenches. The juke move has been re-tuned so that not everyone can execute it well. It'll be more skill-based in Madden 25 after developers noticed that seemingly even pedestrian RBs could get away with an ankle-breaking juke.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, for players who deserve to have killer skill moves, they'll have more directional control, including moves being performed at angles of 90, 135, or 180 degrees. New hesitation moves will also be unleashed. All of these new skill moves can be chained together in ways that are meant to create a higher skill ceiling for the best Madden players on the sticks.</p><p dir="ltr">Ballcarriers, be they running backs or even defenders who nabbed a turnover, will now protect the ball better, bringing it into their bread basket rather than running with it dangerously out in the open. And because of Boom Tech's buff to defenders, all these new ballcarrier moves are meant as the counter. Now, using moves like these will help you get a defender out of position, creating more missed tackles or, at least, falls forward when the Boom Tech math works out in your favor.</p><h2>Hit stick update</h2><p>The above changes culminate in the new Hit Stick update in Madden 25. Simply put, it will be more skill-based going forward. Hit-Sticking someone on the shoulder as they run by you is going to be less of a blow than centering on their gut as they move vertically down the field, for example. By giving defenders and ballcarriers more fluid control, something as ingrained in Madden as 2004's Hit Stick will suddenly feel different and more controllable. This essentially rewards defenders or ballcarriers for properly lining up or skillfully evading the Hit Stick, respectively.</p><h2>Signature player locomotion</h2><p dir="ltr">Some guys just move differently. The NBA 2K series has expressed this well for years now with player crossovers and jumpshots that mimic their real-life counterparts every step of the way. Madden 25 is finally going to express some of that too, though it's uncertain to what extent.</p><p dir="ltr">Two examples I was shown include cover star Christian McCaffrey's signature stride and Isiah Pacheco's stomp-running, which has jumped off the screen since he started getting playing time with the Chiefs. Hopefully, this year and into the future, we'll see even more players with particular movement styles see themselves more authentically expressed in Madden.</p><h2>Deeper pass protection adjustments</h2><p dir="ltr">Clint Oldenburg is seen as the gameplay boss at Madden, so it's no wonder the former NFL offensive lineman continues to invest in the trenches. In Madden 25, you'll be able to call half-slide line adjustments for the first time, meaning only the left or right side of the line can be told to change their protection, rather than demanding the entire OL moves as one unit.</p><p dir="ltr">A new on-field icon, the Hot Indicator, identifies a player showing blitz, allowing players to try to account for pressure that may be coming at the snap. Of course, the defense can disguise these things by showing blitz, but ultimately backing off, or by showing blitz with a player but bringing the heat with a different player.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4319286-gtahx6tq.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319286" data-ratio="0.56252545824847" data-width="2455" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4319286-gtahx6tq.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319286"></a><figcaption>The offensive line will have more nuanced ways to adjust the play pre-snap in Madden 25.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4319286-gtahx6tq.jpg"></figure><h2>Branching catches</h2><p>For years now, Madden players have had three catch types: secure, aggressive, and on the run. A fourth catch type is coming to Madden 25: the spectacular catch. Yes, spec catching, as the devs and fans often call it, has been in the game, but it's no longer tied to aggressive catches, given how previously an aggressive catch <em>may or may not</em> result in a spec catch. The studio wants to eliminate that guesswork. Now, if you want to attempt a spec catch, even just to be a show-off, you can, and when you want to use an aggressive catch instead, you can do so while trusting the animation you get won't be a David Tyree-like snag.</p><h2>New pass-catching enhancements</h2><p dir="ltr">Also, you'll now be able to change your catch animation before the ball arrives. For example, if you initiate a secure catch (where your wideout will grab the ball and go to the ground) but notice you've got space to turn it upfield, you can switch to catching it on the run before the ball gets there. Think of it like how an NBA player may adjust their drive to the basket in that split-second when a shot attempt is made.</p><p dir="ltr">Benefitting the passing game are also new custom route stems. Building onto the "smart route" option, which tells a pass-catcher to perform his route's break at the first down marker specifically, you can now adjust the depths with more options, like running an out at 5, 10, or 15 yards down the field. This should give Manning-like players more ability to dissect a defense.</p><h2>New NFL kickoff rules</h2><p dir="ltr">The NFL surprised many when it announced it would adopt new kickoff rules meant to reduce the number of touchbacks starting this fall. Basically, the league wants to make kick returns happen more often without sacrificing the player safety initiatives seen as of late. The Madden team has promised these new kickoff rules will be seen in-game at launch, after a mad dash by the team to get them in the game swiftly.</p><p dir="ltr">Oldenburg said the league and the studio both expect NFL coaches to dial up some creative strategies over the next season and beyond, and as they appear in real life, the studio will work to bring those strategies into the game as well.</p><h2>Multiple commentary teams</h2><p dir="ltr">Just like College Football 25, Madden is adopting a strategy of multiple commentary teams for this year's game. The tenured pair of Brandon Gaudin and Charles Davis is still there, but some games will also feature booths such as Mike Tirico and Greg Olsen, as well as Kate Scott and Brock Huard.</p><p dir="ltr">The alternate teams will be used for bigger games, such as primetime matchups and playoffs, while the classic team will remain the primary commentary team.</p><h2>Better Draft presentation</h2><p>For Franchise players, the NFL Draft presentation is getting a visual overhaul, alongside some mechanical improvements, too. For one, you'll now see high draft picks walk up to the stage in their suits--no longer wearing weird Draft jerseys. Later picks will be seen getting calls from GMs in their homes. All the while, a "big board" will display all the picks in the round so far, just like you'd see during a network's presentation of the event.</p><h2>Improved Draft prospect scouting</h2><p>New sorting and player comparison tools will also limit the number of button presses and screens you'll go through in order to browse players by certain metrics, such as 40-yard dash times, and the game will <em>finally</em> let you compare Draft prospects side by side.</p><h2>Roger Goodell, but you can't boo him</h2><p>It wouldn't be the Draft without Roger Goodell announcing picks on the stage. The commissioner is coming to the series for the first time in a move that will also see him present the Lombardi Trophy to the champions at the end of each season. Sadly, despite Madden's emphasis on authenticity, the commish won't be booed, as is the norm in real life. I asked EA Orlando's Mike Mahar why this is, and he joked that he would pitch the idea to the league in his next meeting, "and I guarantee you they will boo <em>me </em>out of the room."</p><h2>Randy Moss in the Lombardi presentation</h2><p>Also new to that Super Bowl championship cutscene will be Randy Moss, not a generic player, carrying the Lombardi Trophy through the crowd of players and up to the stage. In real life, this responsibility falls to a legendary player, and the EA team wanted to give that small moment more authenticity for its game. Straight cash, homie!</p><h2>Female head coaches</h2><p>Women are only recently getting the opportunity to be in the coach's room in the NFL, but EA is staying ahead of the curve and letting you create a female head coach for the first time in the series' history.</p><h2>70 more Franchise story scenarios</h2><p>The Franchise story generator has been in the game for a few seasons now, and in Madden 25, 70 more scenarios are coming, including many that emphasize season-long arcs rather than one-and-done narrative beats. You'll also need to worry about players' personality attributes, which have been in the game seemingly without a purpose for a long time. Now, a player with a low personality attribute may be higher-maintenance and express their frustrations with you as their coach, demanding you appease them, ignore them, or perhaps ship them away to another team.</p><h2>Team Builder</h2><p>College Football is back this year, but thankfully the Team Builder website is not exclusive to the student-athlete sim. Madden players will also have the ability to build their own team logos and uniforms from scratch, share them with the community, import them into H2H or Franchise, or--if they prefer--skip all the work and just enjoy the fruits of someone else's labor by downloading some custom teams from the community downloads suite.</p><h2>Improved player progression</h2><p>The Franchise team wanted to give player progression tuning an overhaul, citing previous examples of an aging Derrick Henry getting a speed upgrade that simply did not make sense. Which 30-year-old running back is getting <em>faster</em> at that age? None, so now in Madden, things like that should stop happening. This is a feature I was only told about, so the jury is out on how well it's been implemented, but the idea makes sense.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4316716-ea_madden25_standard_keyart_16-9_3840x2160.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316716" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4316716-ea_madden25_standard_keyart_16-9_3840x2160.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316716"></a><figcaption>CMC lands on the cover for this year's game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4316716-ea_madden25_standard_keyart_16-9_3840x2160.jpg"></figure><h2>Six-on-six MUT mode</h2><p>Moving into Madden Ultimate Team mode changes, the biggest one is a new 6v6 mode that feels more like a backyard football game. It's not as flashy as Superstar Showdown, and is instead meant to be another way for MUT players to compete with their teams, including 6v6 lineup options.</p><h2>More Superstar appearance customization options</h2><p>The Madden Superstar (formerly Face of the Franchise) customization options have been bad for a long time. This year's game thankfully addresses that, to a degree anyway, with more cosmetic options for your character's face and body, including the return of tattoos, better hair renders for beards, and new (and twice the previous amount of) starting templates to choose from.</p><h2>Renewed NFL Combine experience in Superstar</h2><p>For players in the game's career mode, the NFL Combine will hold more weight on your career arc, helping you climb the expected draft position charts and even improving your character's attributes with an impressive workout. New drills will also be used for specific positions, though some, like the bench press and 40-yard dash, will remain universal. 26 new minigames in total have been added to the game, though these drills are available beyond Superstar mode, too.</p><h2>Better player grading in Superstar</h2><p>The live player-grading system has also been tweaked to better account for additional considerations, such as rushers hitting the right hole on a play, or how well a receiver runs their route. Previously making a play was paramount, but now you'll want to better execute the play that was actually called, though freelancing into the end zone will still be beneficial to your grade.</p><h2>More storylines and team interactions in Superstar</h2><p>Superstar mode is adding quests, too--essentially long-term goals for you to chase such as branding deals, team and league records, and rivalries with other players. Teammate interactions, which have been starkly absent before, will now be more of a focus, and your play on the field can lift up those around you.</p><h2>College Football 25 Road To Glory compatibility</h2><p>Of course, the biggest change to Superstar this year is how it integrates with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-college-football-25/" data-ref-id="5000-618409">College Football 25</a>. Since your custom player is not tied up in the NIL deal that prevents wholesale roster importing from CFB to Madden, your Road To Glory player can be easily moved into Madden, giving your player more depth and history as you experience both their college career and then their journey as a pro that follows.</p><h2>New seasonal rewards for Superstar Showdown</h2><p>For players who like to take their custom athlete into the showboaty Superstar Showdown mode, a deeper seasonal rewards tree will be there to give you more things to do. Just like how MUT adds new rewards every season, Superstar Showdown will add new limited-time modes and rewards to chase as you rank up through the game's new leaderboard system.</p><h2>Classic Madden songs returning as stadium tracks</h2><p>Last on our list is music. Fans of the classic NFL Films bangers won't be treated with the return of them, but the EA team has commissioned its own new--and, I'll admit, instantly appealing--main theme that will greet players as soon as they open the game. It's quite reminiscent of the NFL Films classics of yesteryear, and I'm extremely eager to hear it again once it's available online and in-game. Also, classic Madden tracks from past eras will be coming back and heard in stadiums around the league.</p><p dir="ltr">A few bands mentioned by name were Green Day, Fall Out Boy, and Twenty-One Pilots. So though the menu tracks may be a lot of hip-hop still, the game as a whole will feature a wider spectrum of genres, including some songs that may seem nostalgic to long-time players.</p><hr><p>Madden NFL 25 launches on August 16 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, though players with an EA Play subscription or who purchase the Deluxe edition or MVP Bundle which includes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523761/">College Football 25</a> will be able to play the game as early as August 13.

                <p>Artificial intelligence, or AI, is one of the most-discussed news topics in recent years. Seemingly everyone is weighing in with their thoughts on how AI might change the world--from video games and movies to politics and more. Now, the Pope has shared his thoughts during the G7 Summit in Italy.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2024-06/pope-g7-artifical-intelligence-objective-neutral.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Vatican News</a>, the Pope said AI is a "true cognitive-industrial revolution" that he believes will lead to "complex epochal transformations."</p><p>He said AI could lead to transformations that are both good and bad. For example, AI advancements might help democratize access to knowledge and help with scientific research, the Pope said. He also noted that AI might help reduce "demanding and arduous work." At the same time, advancements to AI could lead to a "greater injustice between advanced and developing nations or between dominant and oppressed social classes," he said.</p><p>The Pope went on to say that AI is a "tool" that can make "algorithmic choices," but this lies in contrast to humans who can use wisdom derived from life experience to make decisions. As such, the Pope said important decisions in the world should always be made by humans, adding that autonomous weapons that are capable of killing with no human input should be banned.</p><p>Ultimately, the Pope said he believes political action is "urgently needed" to tackle the issues that AI presents in the world.</p><p>In the world of media and entertainment, AI was one of the issues that Hollywood unions fought for in its latest round of strikes, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everything-hollywood-writers-got-in-their-new-contract/1100-6518026/" data-ref-id="1100-6518026">ultimately winning a variety of protections</a>. For video games, many have expressed concerns about potential negative impacts of AI, but that hasn't stopped the likes of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-parent-company-ceo-is-very-enthusiastic-about-generative-ai/1100-6523854/" data-ref-id="1100-6523854">Microsoft, EA, Take-Two, and others speaking very positively about how AI can help accelerate and improve game development. </a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-games-industry-has-already-laid-off-more-people-this-year-than-in-all-of-2023/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-games-industry-has-already-laid-off-more-people-this-year-than-in-all-of-2023<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="389" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Summer has always been a hype time for video games thanks to all the industry showcases. Summer Game Fest, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/everything-shown-at-the-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Xbox showcase</a>, and a few others highlighted some incredible titles for everyone to look forward to, but we mustn’t forget that the industry as a whole is in serious turmoil. In fact, as of this week, there have been more layoffs in the past six months than in all of 2023.</p> <p data-characters="481" data-current-count="481" data-injectable="true">As spotted by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24177290/video-game-industry-layoffs-studio-closures-record" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, this is according to <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog by technical artist Farhan Noor</a> that tracks industry layoffs. While these are only estimated figures, the data highlights how dire things are at the moment. By the end of 2023, approximately 10,500 people working in the games industry lost their jobs. There were early signs that these cuts weren’t going to slow down in 2024 and, as of this week, an estimated 10,800 people have been let go since the beginning of the year.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="583" data-current-count="883" data-injectable="true">What tipped this year’s figures past the landmark was the Tencent-owned Sumo Group’s decision to reduce staff by up to 15%, meaning roughly 250 employees would’ve been affected (<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sumo-group-to-reduce-staff-by-up-to-15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via GamesIndustry.biz</a>). One of its subsidiaries, Timbre Games, was shut down entirely, as confirmed by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/timbre-games_there-is-no-better-group-of-people-in-games-activity-7206724903322984448-GoPR/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">this LinkedIn post</a>. The studio was founded only three years ago and had yet to release a single game. These layoffs also came one day after a “<a href="https://x.com/SumoDigitalLtd/status/1800154801671401972" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">busy weekend</a>” where Sumo Group shared new announcements for its upcoming projects during Wholesome Direct and the PC Gaming Show.</p>
 <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false">Obviously, Sumo Group shouldn’t bear all of the blame here. Many other companies are equally responsible for gutting their studios and firing staff, including the likes of Microsoft (which <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/redfall-and-hi-fi-rush-developers-shut-down-in-another-awful-wave-of-microsoft-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infamously shuttered three studios</a> and absorbed another a couple of months ago) and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/gta-publisher-take-two-is-laying-off-five-percent-of-staff-a-few-months-after-saying-it-had-no-current-plans-for-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take-Two Interactive</a>.</p> <p data-characters="582" data-current-count="882" data-injectable="false">There are a number of factors responsible for all this, but it doesn’t change the fact that the future of the industry is looking bleaker than ever. Many people who’ve been let go may very well never work in video games again, which means a lot of lost experience. It’s reached a point where it’s become difficult to recommend anyone pursue a career in game development. All the while, company executives offer platitudes about how such layoffs are difficult but necessary decisions. That’s easy enough to say when you’re not the one out of work.</p>

<p data-characters="324" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/todays-helldivers-2-patch-is-obscenely-large-and-fans-are-loving-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s new update</a> has delivered an awesome assortment of tweaks, fixes, improvements, and new content that hasn’t gone unnoticed by the community. Its most important feature, though, was <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-devs-are-finally-reverting-frustrating-patrols-and-spawn-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the long awaited enemy patrol fix</a>, and something might’ve gotten broken along the way, from the look of things.</p> <p data-characters="545" data-current-count="545" data-injectable="true">Specifically, it would appear that even though Arrowhead Games certainly did do <em>something</em> with the logic behind <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s enemy patrol spawning, it’s definitely not the way it used to be before <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-update-01-000-300-april-29-patch-notes-weapon-balance-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the prior major update</a>. In fact, some players have reported that they’re now coming across even <em>more</em> enemy forces than ever before, which is about the opposite of what was supposed to happen. The issue is so pervasive, in fact, that even Arrowhead Games’ community manager has chimed in, promising to look into it further.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure>  <p data-characters="665" data-current-count="965" data-injectable="true">Here’s the kicker: <em>Helldivers 2</em> comes with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-change-the-difficulty-in-helldivers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over half a dozen disparate difficulty modes</a> for players to peruse at their own pace. This doesn’t mean much in practice, though, when almost every difficulty pushes each encounter into absolute overdrive just for your fireteam to stay alive. The way Arrowhead has handled this aspect of the new update is that they claim to have reverted patrol spawns back to how they worked pre-version 01.000.3000 <em>with</em> “some slight tweaks.” These “tweaks,” specifically, are supposed to make “levels less empty if [the players] are far away from important locations with enemy presence.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="408" data-current-count="708" data-injectable="true">It doesn’t seem to have worked the way it was supposed to, judging by what I’ve seen in action. Now, as a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-may-not-be-a-solo-game-but-its-how-i-like-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solo <em>Helldivers 2</em> player</a>, I can absolutely vouch for the fact that the game does seem <em>somewhat</em> easier to play after the latest update: certainly <em>way</em> less over-tuned in the lower difficulties, where I usually stick around, but it’s still a fair bit more challenging than it used to be.</p>
 <p data-characters="571" data-current-count="571" data-injectable="true">This, too, wouldn’t necessarily be a problem if the challenge felt satisfying, but this isn’t usually the case. On the bug front, patrols are now larger and feature more small-scale enemies that will quickly overwhelm you even in the middle of nowhere. On the bot front, on the other hand, it’s impossible to eke out a safe zone the way we once could simply because a new patrol appears just over the nearest ridge. This results in a gameplay experience where there’s precious little downtime, and you’re always running out of key resources.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="216" data-current-count="516" data-injectable="true">Whatever the case may be, Arrowhead Games will need to let the community know whether this is the intended playing experience across all of the game’s difficulties, or if the new update is bugged yet once more.</p>
 <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="428" data-injectable="false">It’s a bit of a bad look, too: <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-patches-may-slow-down-as-arrowhead-plans-to-take-its-time-with-the-next-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arrowhead Games specifically and very substantially slowed down the game’s update cadence</a> to prevent such problems from taking place. Now, we’re looking at what is either an unexpectedly messed up patrol bug, or the team is still over-tuning the difficulty across the board. Whatever the case may be, I’m hoping Arrowhead explains what’s up sooner, rather than later.</p>

<p id="fenPFB">At last, you’ve reached the Secret Medallion location. If you follow the path just a bit further, you’ll see a dark corner on your right, with a small stone tomb in front and a large tree on the left. In this dark corner, as pointed out by the arrow, there’s a <strong>large pot</strong> — this is Old Albus in disguise. Hit the pot once to <strong>reveal Old Albus</strong> and exhaust his dialogue, after which he’ll hand you the <strong>Haligtree Secret Medallion (Right)</strong>.</p>

<p id="YtkwJJ">To reach Castle Sol, you must cross the narrow bridge toward the north, ride through a valley until you see a massive giant ahead of you, then turn left. Keep riding until you hit a seemingly dead end, then use the wind current on your left (shown in the picture) and fly up the mountains. Cross another bridge (going north again), then ride down the snowy slopes — Castle Sol is in the lower valley.</p>

  <p id="Auq0Rv">Looking for an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> <strong>Malenia boss guide</strong>? Malenia, Blade of Miquella, Goddess of Rot, and bearer of a shard of the <em>Elden Ring</em>, is one of the toughest bosses in the game — and that’s saying something.</p>
<p id="HJ8sAe">Don’t let that discourage you though; with the right preparations and a good battle strategy, even Malenia can be defeated. Our <em>Elden Ring</em> guide will show you <strong>how to beat Malenia</strong>, including details about her location, weaknesses, and attacks.</p>

<hr id="NTApkT">

<p id="EyNyVT">Malenia resides at the bottom of the Haligtree, the relatively small region found north of the Mountaintops of the Giants. To get there, you must advance through <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22972704/liurnia-of-the-lakes-dungeon-locations-rewards">Liurnia</a>, Altus Plateau, and the eastern part of the Mountaintops of the Giants before collecting the Elden Ring <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23934763">Haligtree Secret Medallions</a> and gaining access to the Consecrated Snowfield. </p>

<h2 id="NqdRWN"><strong>Things to know about Malenia</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li id="BC8vp7">
<strong>She heals with every hit.</strong> Malenia regains health every time she lands a hit on you, even if you block it. For that reason, using a shield in this fight is not advised.</li>
<li id="0a42wS">
<strong>She deals physical damage</strong> with slash and pierce attacks. During the second phase of the fight, she’ll inflict Scarlet Rot.</li>
<li id="n2b5Vk">
<strong>She has multiple one-hit-kill attacks.</strong> No matter how high you pump your vigor or how heavy your armor is, you can and will be one-shotted by several of Malenia’s attacks. You must learn to avoid them. We’ll go over them below.</li>
<li id="1oYmPe">
<strong>She does have weaknesses.</strong> Malenia is almost unbelievably strong, but she does have weaknesses. We’ll tell you exactly what to bring to this fight.</li>
<li id="euwMKN">
<strong>Summons are key.</strong> Summoning other players for this fight is a gamble. You might get lucky, or your phantom helpers might die the first time Malenia uses Waterfowl Dance, leaving Malenia with beefed-up health while you’re still fighting her solo. Using a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23022025/best-summons-spirit-ashes-how-to-upgrade">Spirit Ash</a> is a more reliable choice. We’ll go over your best options in the guide.</li>

<hr id="5jeKBW">
<h2 id="LLHJB5"><strong>Malenia’s weakness and resistances</strong></h2>
<p id="7xzKih">Luckily, even Malenia is weak to certain damage and attack types. Here’s a list of <strong>everything Malenia is weak against</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li id="3gWs0H">
<strong>Frost damage</strong>. This is Malenia’s lowest resistance.</li>
<li id="M7MYjl">
<strong>Bleed damage</strong>, also known as Blood Loss. This is Malenia’s second-lowest resistance.</li>
<li id="IEfYeb">
<strong>Fire damage</strong>. While using magical spells isn’t the best strategy against Malenia (more on that below), weapons with innate fire damage work great. </li>
<li id="fk6pfe">
<strong>Physical damage</strong>. Melee attacks can work very well against Malenia.</li>
</ul>
<p id="smXzf7">To avoid using this, here’s a list of <strong>everything Malenia is exceptionally strong against</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li id="5V2dDE">
<strong>Scarlet Rot damage</strong>. Malenia is highly resistant to the Scarlet Rot status effect.</li>
<li id="d3AqrV">
<strong>Poison damage</strong>. Malenia is highly resistant to the poison status effect.</li>
<li id="b0wzSh">
<strong>Holy damage</strong>. Malenia has a high Holy damage absorption. If you have a Faith build, it’s better to use fire incantations like Burn O Flame instead of Holy damage.</li>
<li id="eZ2zn7">
<strong>Most magic</strong>. Malenia will easily dodge most sorceries and incantations you can throw at her. There are exceptions, like the Night sorceries, Ranni’s Dark Moon, and Dragonice. But even then, it’s hard to find enough time to cast them. To top it off, landing spells on Malenia often triggers her most devastating attack, Waterfowl Dance.</li>
<li id="FHqIXT">
<strong>Shields</strong>. Malenia heals herself even if you block her attack with your shield, so using one puts you at a serious disadvantage.</li>
<li id="AVtOwh">
<strong>Parrying</strong>. Unfortunately, Malenia will only be staggered by every third parry, instead of every parry like a normal enemy. It’s doable, but not recommended.</li>
</ul>

<hr id="lEhrgR">
<h2 id="kyzFei"><strong>Prepare for the Malenia boss fight</strong></h2>
<p id="Isui5x">Now that you know Malenia’s strengths and weaknesses, how do you exploit them? Here’s a list of combat strategies that work well against Malenia:</p>
<ul>
<li id="xHtscI">
<strong>Use dual-wielding</strong>. Forget about shields; dual-wield two weapons of the same type instead. This allows you to power-stance, which unlocks new attacks using the L1 button. Fast weapons like katanas or twinblades are best, but greatswords like the Claymore can work if you have more strength than dexterity. Whatever you choose, make sure to upgrade both weapons as much as possible. </li>
<li id="IiyJJK">
<strong>Use a light load</strong>. Malenia is fast and you don’t have a shield, so you must rely on dodging to stay alive. A heavy load makes things difficult, a medium load is doable, but a light load of less than 30% maximum equipment makes dodging easy. Then again, this is a very risky strategy — one mistake could tilt the fight in Malenia’s favor. </li>
<li id="Kcm9KH">
<strong>Or at least not a heavy load</strong>. You can use a heavy weapon, but don’t go for a full heavy loadout as you won’t be able to dodge Malenia’s attacks. Basically, choose the most powerful armor set you have that still falls within medium load range. </li>
<li id="JL7oZt">
<strong>Build resistance against physical damage</strong>. Armor sets with high resistance against slash and pierce are always the best choice. Don’t forget to combine them with a physical damage-reducing talisman like the Dragoncrest Greatshield.</li>
<li id="1VWRLp">
<strong>Make dodging easier with Bloodhound’s Step</strong>. If the light load sounds too difficult, you may imbue your right-hand weapon with the Bloodhound’s Step Ash of War. This is a souped-up dodge that causes you to briefly turn invisible and slide around the room, totally impervious to damage. Without a doubt, it’s the single best tool to give you a slight edge against Malenia. You can get it by defeating the Night’s Cavalry mini-boss at the bridge north of Lenne’s Rise in eastern Caelid.</li>
<li id="WexPSP">
<strong>Exploit Malenia’s Frost weakness</strong>. Imbue at least one of your weapons with the Cold Affinity. Grab the <strong>Glintstone Whetblade</strong> from the courtyard of Raya Lucaria, or use Dragonice, purchased at the Cathedral of Dragon Communion in Caelid (though its slow cast time leaves you vulnerable). The same goes for Ranni’s Dark Moon, which you can get by following <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22982931/ranni-questline-renna-radahn-nokron-eternal-city-three-sisters">Ranni’s</a> questline and reaching the Moonlight Plateau. If you’d rather just chuck grenades at her, the recipe for Freezing Pots is in the Glintstone Craftsman’s Cookbook [6], located in a building on the east side of the main courtyard of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22994833/caria-manor-boss-location-level-map-dragon-sword">Caria Manor</a>.</li>
<li id="teOrHY">
<strong>Focus on causing Bleed damage</strong>. Thanks to its innate Bleed damage, Rivers of Blood is one of the best weapons against Malenia. If using a katana or another weapon with innate Bleed damage is not an option for your build, go get the <strong>Black Whetblade</strong> at Night’s Sacred Ground, a part of Nokron, Eternal City accessed by jumping down the rooftops near the Ancestral Woods site of grace (down the meteor hole that appeared after you defeat <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22993446/radahn-location-general-starscourge">Radahn</a>). The whetblade enables you to add Blood Affinity to most weapons that have no innate element.</li>
<li id="tpdD99">
<strong>Deal fire damage</strong>. If you have a weapon with innate Fire damage, such as the Magma Blade, that’s a great option too. You can obtain it at <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23013379/questline-boss-invitation-locked-door-npcs-hidden-wall-secret-wall-stonesword-key-room">Volcano Manor</a>, where it’s dropped by man-serpents. Alternatively, bring some Volcano Pots and chuck them at Malenia whenever you can. </li>
<li id="utWVjI">
<strong>Stagger Malenia.</strong> Yes, you can stagger Malenia, and it’s actually not that hard. Wait for her to finish an attack combo, then hit her immediately afterward to stagger her. </li>
<li id="CIvrLN">
<strong>Get a Scarlet Rot cure</strong>. Last but certainly not least, bring enough Preserving Boluses with you to cure Scarlet Rot in the second phase of the battle. The crafting recipe is found in Armorer’s Cookbook [6].</li>

A solid choice for dual-wielding would be the <strong>Cold Uchigatana</strong> with Bloodhound’s Step in your right hand and <strong>Rivers of Blood</strong> in your left hand. When using Bloodhound’s Step, equip the Carian Filigreed Crest talisman, which you can purchase from the blacksmith Iji when following Ranni’s quest. It reduces the FP cost of skills, allowing you to teleport-dodge more frequently. </p>
<p id="5jP9wC">The <strong>Nagakiba</strong> katana and <strong>Eleonora’s Poleblade</strong> are also great weapons against Malenia, especially since both come with Bleed damage and (in the case of the Poleblade) Fire damage. Nagakiba is obtained by completing Bloody Finger Hunter Yura’s questline or by defeating him in combat, and Eleonora’s Poleblade is obtained by defeating Eleonora, the Violet Bloody Finger, at the Second Church of Marika in Altus Plateau</p>
<p id="yAxJqs">Don’t underestimate the <strong>Bloodhound’s Fang</strong> either, which has amazing physical damage. You can get it by defeating the Bloodhound Knight Darriwil in Limgrave. Dual-wielding this weapon is quite overpowered as it builds Bleed incredibly fast, but you can only obtain a second Bloodhound’s Fang if it’s gifted to you in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22948338/multiplayer-summon-finger-items">multiplayer</a>. If that’s not in the cards, Bloodhound’s Fang goes perfectly fine with Rivers of Blood. </p>
<p id="E912aD">If you’d rather try to stagger Malenia with a heavier weapon, the <strong>Blasphemous Blade </strong>Greatsword with its massive physical and fire damage is one of the best options. Its Taker’s Flames ability deals amazing stagger damage, knocking Malenia down if you can manage to land it without her dodging the flames. You can trade Rykard’s Remembrance for it in the Roundtable Hold. </p>
<p id="9d4TM9">If you’re looking for a way to ‘cheese’ the Malenia boss fight, the <strong>Ordovis Greatsword</strong> is your friend. This is quite surprising, especially since some of its damage is Holy, but the Ordovis Greatsword’s value lies in its <strong>Ordovis’s Vortex</strong> spinning skill (demonstrated in the picture below).</p>
<p id="gBugD8">This attack requires a short charging time, but if Malenia gets caught in it, she can’t break away and it’ll knock her down — allowing you to use it again. In other words, you must carefully wait for an opening, stun-lock Malenia in Ordovis’s Vortex, and deplete her HP. Ordovis Greatsword is dropped by the Crucible Knight in Auriza Hero’s Grave, a dungeon north of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22982996/leyndell-royal-capital-site-of-grace-tips-tricks-hidden-path-strategy-boss-morgott">Leyndell</a>. </p>

<h2 id="noKJdz"><strong>Best Ashes and Talismans for Malenia</strong></h2>
<p id="csDvOi">Besides <strong>Bloodhound’s Step</strong>, there are other <strong>Ashes of War</strong> that Malenia has a hard time dealing with. Rivers of Blood’s<strong> Corpse Piler</strong> can rapidly proc Bleed and staggers her somewhat reliably. You get it from the NPC invader near the Church of Repose in Mountaintop of the Giants.</p>
<p id="kXryMf">Similarly, Eleonora’s Poleblade’s<strong> Bloodblade Dance</strong> lets you do heavy Bleed and poise damage then dance away from her to avoid retaliation. It’s obtained from the NPC invasion at the Second Church of Marika in Altus Plateau as part of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24168717/yura-bloody-finger-hunter-questline-steps">Yura’s</a> questline.</p>
<p id="6qgTc7">The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23022025/best-summons-spirit-ashes-how-to-upgrade"><strong>best Spirit Ashes</strong></a> to use against Malenia are <strong>Black Knife Tiche</strong> or <strong>Mimic Tear</strong>. Unfortunately, tanky spirits aren’t as good as you might think because Malenia will regain health every time she hits them. Tiche, on the other hand, doesn’t have a ton of health but is excellent at dodging.</p>
<p id="FCsJ5h">She’ll distract Malenia while you unleash your attacks. You can get Tiche from the Ringleader’s Evergaol on the Moonlight Plateau (once again, part of Ranni’s quest). As long as you have a decent loadout, the Mimic Tear is always a great choice, but especially if you’re focused on building Frost and Bleed status effects. </p>
<p id="iWZp81">As for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23065127/every-talisman-map-location-pouch"><strong>talismans</strong></a>, the <strong>Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman</strong> is incredibly useful as it negates a lot of incoming physical damage. <strong>Erdtree’s Favor</strong> can help you increase your equipment load limit (especially handy if your favorite armor set is a tad too heavy) while also improving your HP and stamina. For those who depend on vigor, strength, dexterity, and endurance, <strong>Radagon’s Scarseal</strong> is an amazing option, but beware that it also increases incoming damage. A simple strength-boosting talisman like <strong>Starscourge Heirloom</strong> may therefore be the better choice.</p>

<h2 id="hgtiJJ"><strong>How to defeat Malenia phase 1</strong></h2>
<p id="xMuU6o">Malenia will approach you as soon as you enter the boss arena. When she’s within melee range, be prepared to dodge her first attacks. The trick to surviving is to be very patient, keep dodging, and hit whenever her combos have finished. </p>
<p id="dDkBjb">If you’re able to proc Bleed and Frost multiple times, you can burn her down before she even gets a chance to use Waterfowl Dance. Most of the time, mastering this phase is simply a matter of keeping your distance so she doesn’t catch you by surprise, managing your FP so you can always use Bloodhound’s Step to get away from Waterfowl Dance, and being smart about when you try to get in a hit or two.</p>
<p id="Ba6gel">Here’s an overview of the attacks used by Malenia in the first phase of the battle:</p>

<ul>
<li id="x7cP3P">
<strong>Idling</strong>. Malenia’s idle state during the first phase of her fight is to simply walk slowly toward you. There’s an opportunity to attack here, as it’s often safe to walk up and poke her with a single probing attack while she’s doing this. Just be ready to dodge away when she inevitably responds. You can “trigger” her idling stance if you dodge away and create a lot of distance between you and Malenia.</li>
<li id="7a51pV">
<strong>Side jump</strong>. Sometimes, when dodging or after taking a hit, Malenia will jump to the left (your left) and have a brief moment of poise break. It’s a great opportunity to land another hit, as she won’t attack immediately afterward. You can try to do a quick stab during idling and follow it up with another attack after a side jump. </li>

<ul>
<li id="HPEWb0">
<strong>Normal slashes</strong>. Malenia has a bevy of general slashing attacks using her extra-long katana. She combines these in unpredictable patterns that make them challenging to dodge. Bloodhound’s step makes it easier. In general, you want to keep a medium distance from her for most of the fight, and never try to sneak an attack in during her standard slashing combos. She will punish you almost every time.</li>
<li id="CCTqFg">
<strong>Spin kick</strong>. Malenia often opens her combos with a deadly spin kick, which can’t be blocked or parried. Thankfully, it’s slow and the windup is obvious. Since her follow-ups can be more deadly, get some distance when she kicks. Don’t try to attack after it.</li>

<ul>
<li id="SDrYsh">
<strong>Spark Combo</strong>. One of Malenia’s most common attacks is a quadruple-slash combo that’s telegraphed by a mechanical sound effect and orange spark from her prosthetic arm. Get used to recognizing this cue and get the hell out of her way when she unleashes this, which she does constantly. With Bloodhound’s Step, you can teleport backward and get out of its range. It’s more difficult to avoid with a normal dodge, so you must make sure you’re far enough away from her at all times. </li>
<li id="r3QwFX">There are two variations of that move. You can tell which version you’re getting by the fourth slash in the combo: If the fourth slash arrives quickly after the third, the combo is likely to continue. However, if there’s a slightly longer delay before the fourth slash arrives, she’s about to stop moving for a moment, providing one of your best attack opportunities in the fight.</li>

<ul><li id="KEC214">
<strong>Spark thrust</strong>. This move is predicated by the same sound effect and orange spark as the previous one, but Malenia’s stance is completely different; she hops in the air for a moment while drawing her sword back, then thrusts towards you. This is the single best attack opportunity during phase 1, as there’s a way to predict it (it often triggers when you create a bit of distance between you and Malenia) and dodge; you don’t even have to use Bloodhound’s Step. And she never follows it up with anything during this phase, so you’re always safe to get a slash or two in after she uses it.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li id="BaK28x">
<strong>Slow lunge combo</strong>. When Malenia draws her sword slowly behind her in a crouch, she’s about to lunge toward you for a two-slash combo. There are two variations of this, with slightly different timing. You’ll have to learn the difference, although Bloodhound’s Step makes it easy to dodge either one. This is another attack opportunity — she’s vulnerable after the second swing, and if you’re near her when she starts winding it up, you can even get some hits in before she lunges.</li>
<li id="jn9nuO">
<strong>Overhead jump slash</strong>. This attack is similar to the previous one, but without the long wind-up. It’s always preceded by a standard horizontal slash, and often follows the fast version of the four-slash Spark Combo. It’s another great opportunity to attack, as she’s vulnerable after landing.</li>

<strong>Lunging Grab</strong>. Malenia pulls her left hand back, crouching down slightly, and lunges at you after a short delay. Avoid this at all costs.

<strong>Waterfowl Dance</strong>. This is the big one. Once her health drops below 75%, Malenia can unleash the deadly Waterfowl Dance any time. She jumps into the air for a long pause (see picture above, make sure you recognize it!), then flies toward you, unleashing a flurry of white slashes. This will kill you if she catches you in it — and yes, it’s borderline unfair. Thankfully, it can be dodged. As soon as she rises into the air, you have to sprint or Bloodhound Step away from her as quickly as possible (this is the main reason why you can’t spend the whole fight up in the boss’s face pressuring her with attacks; if you’re right under her when she does this, it’s almost impossible to survive, even with Bloodhound’s Step). If you can catch enough distance, the first two parts of the Dance will miss you. For the third flurry, she always teleports directly to you, no matter how far away you got; you have to dodge toward her as soon as she does it. She’ll shoot past you, and you can hover just outside of her range for the fourth part, including the final spherical slash that marks the move’s conclusion. After this, she’s vulnerable to another attack — provided you survive that long. </li></ul>

<strong>Rot Nuke</strong>. Malenia flies up into the air, orange and scarlet wings fluttering, and pauses before dive-bombing you. You can survive this by dodging at the exact right moment — try activating Bloodhound’s Step as soon as she begins moving from her floating stance. Then, if you survive the initial impact, the boss explodes again as her petals open, turning her into a huge orange flower. Stay out of range as the petals open to avoid the damage and scarlet rot build-up they cause. This is your one reliable ranged attack opportunity during the fight; you can unleash spells, incantations, and throwables while she’s recovering. You can also rush in as the petals finally dissipate to attack her briefly up close. She always opens the second phase with this attack, so it’s imperative that you learn how to dodge it.</li></ul>

<strong>Phantom clones</strong>. Malenia floats into the air and sends a series of phantom clones slashing and thrusting your way. This attack is fairly easy to recognize as Malenia will fly upward in a glowing whirlwind, but the phantoms are hard to dodge. With Bloodhound’s Step, you can simply spam L2, provided you have enough FP. She ends this attack by lunging toward you herself with a powerful sword thrust. She’s vulnerable to attacks afterward, if you’re close enough to her after dodging, though it’s a small window, since she usually starts up another combo a moment after landing.</li></ul>

<ul><li id="6Mpm4L">
<strong>Small scarlet flower</strong>. Malenia plants a small orange bloom in front of her, which explodes a moment later, causing damage and scarlet rot build-up. Sometimes she flies into the air for a moment, but not always. This is the reason why your attack opportunities from phase 1 are unreliable now. Malenia retains all the same moves and combos from before, but now, she has a roughly 50% chance to follow up any move with this ability. Any combo after which she would have previously been vulnerable, from the Spark Thrust to the Slow Lunge, can be followed by this attack instead. Luckily, she always pauses on the ground as the small flower blows up. If you can get behind her and avoid the small explosion, there’s still a window to attack here.</li></ul>
<p id="GdBvSA">In addition to those new abilities, <strong>Malenia retains all the moves from phase 1</strong>. Beware that her combos are even more unpredictable as she tends to fly up into the air more often. Since she spends so much time in the air, it’s harder to predict when Waterfowl Dance is coming. Your only safe bet is to run away anytime she flies upward and get ready to dodge whatever attack is coming. Keep your distance, be patient, wait for your attack opportunities, and keep your FP and health topped up.</p>
<p id="Dj9Aom">When defeated, Malenia drops the <strong>Remembrance of the Rot Goddess</strong>, Malenia’s <strong>Great Rune</strong>, and a whopping <strong>480,000 runes</strong> on your first playthrough. If you manage to take her down, congratulations — you’re a true Tarnished, no matter how you did it.</p>

These deployable skills or equipment drops were broadly swept under the rug as <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s balance was thrown out of whack by frequent patches, much to the chagrin of the community. Iit seems like Arrowhead’s first priority as part of its new approach to fixes was to make stratagems viable again, and it might’ve accomplished that.</p><div data-video-id="196395" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="80" data-playlist="196395,196599,195326" data-current="196395"><div><p>The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21945.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>According to Arrowhead, it “wanted to buff up some of the weaker stratagems to make them more viable and add more possibility for variety in the loadouts.” To that end, most of the stratagems that have fallen to the wayside in the last several months have received some sort of buff or series of balance changes to increase their usage. For example, countless sentry stratagems received buffs to their durability, which was previously shit, and made them impossible to justify bringing into higher-level missions where they’d be wiped out immediately.</p><p>Some <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-eagle-1-horny-fan-art-1851410951&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-eagle-1-horny-fan-art-1851410951">Eagle stratagems</a></span> also received damage buffs, as well as a few <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-new-stratagems-choohee-penta-community-1851439200&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-new-stratagems-choohee-penta-community-1851439200">mines</a></span>, and a number of them even got reduced cooldown timers. Several weapons either do more damage, like the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-r-36-erupter-best-gun-premium-warbond-1851419855&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-r-36-erupter-best-gun-premium-warbond-1851419855">Eruptor</a></span>, or do a much better job at their function, like the explosive crossbow, which now more effectively plugs bug holes. Arrowhead also stated that it isn’t done looking at stratagems to tune up, but this first pass at some underappreciated ones is a good first step.</p><p>Moreover, the patch is also tweaking things to make <em>Helldivers 2 </em>a touch friendlier than it has been in the past. This includes introducing super samples, a collectible resource in the game, on a lower difficulty level so as to not dem and too much of players, as well as removing a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1df6gtp/goodbye_and_good_riddance/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1df6gtp/goodbye_and_good_riddance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">controversial modifier</a></span> that reduced stratagem slots. Even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-balance-patch-planetary-hazards-1851311937&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-balance-patch-planetary-hazards-1851311937">planetary hazards</a></span> are being adjusted, such as fire tornadoes becoming less reactionary to player movement so that divers don’t feel like they’re being uniquely spited by the elements. Changes are also being made to enemy behaviors and players should expect there to be fewer armored enemies on higher difficulty levels.</p><p>The patch, which has gone over pretty well with <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-dark-fluid-mission-fix-arrowhead-1851512049&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-dark-fluid-mission-fix-arrowhead-1851512049">recovering community</a></span>, does come with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dfkqby/patrol_spawns_are_not_fixed_theyre_worse/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dfkqby/patrol_spawns_are_not_fixed_theyre_worse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some issues</a></span>, but the problems seem much more contained than has been typical, and the community has reacted accordingly. Anecdotally, the patch seems to be doing well enough that <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s Steam numbers have trended upwards, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1df6iu9/helldivers_reaches_100000_active_players_for_the/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1df6iu9/helldivers_reaches_100000_active_players_for_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">breaking 100,000 for the first time in two months</a></span>.</p><p>This latest patch is the first since Arrowhead reconsidered its approach to balancing <em>Helldivers 2</em>. After an extended period of constant upheaval, which was upsetting fans and working the team to the bone, Arrowhead eventually announced that it would slow down on the delivery of patches to better consider and test the changes it implemented into the live game so as to cause as few frustrations and bugs as possible.</p><p>If the reception to this patch is any indication, this might just be the move as Arrowhead continues to polish the game moving forward and slow the constant additions that have upset its balance since the start. Maybe, just maybe, things are finally looking up again for everyone’s favorite bug-killing simulator.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
