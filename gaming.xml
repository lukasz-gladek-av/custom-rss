			<p>It's no surprise that Call of Duty takes the top spot in revenue for the month of October across PC and console, as <a href="https://newzoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported by Newzoo</a>. It's not just Black Ops 6 that has boosted the revenue, as Call of Duty Modern Warfare II &amp; III, as well as Call of Duty Warzone, have all contributed to the revenue earnings, helping the franchise take the top spot. In terms of engagement, Call of Duty also did very well for itself, and Black Ops 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-the-biggest-ever-says-activision/">had the most successful launch</a> in the history of the franchise. This is helped by the fact that Black Ops 6 was a day-one release on Xbox Game Pass for the first time ever, helping many people get the opportunity to play the game without having to pay the hefty price tag for the game.</p>
<p>While Call of Duty did take the top spot for revenue and second place for engagement, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-fortnite-chapter-6-trailer-leaks-early-shows-off-godzilla/">Fortnite</a> continues to retain its position as the most-played game across all platforms. It's likely that we will see Fortnite continue to retain this position in November's report, too. This is because the latest chapter of Fortnite has just been released, meaning there is a ton of new content for players to explore. Additionally, they recently just made the change to battle passes that allows players to get all of the battle passes for a single price, rather than paying for them separately.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-adds-new-child-safety-measures-to-protect-pre-teens/">Roblox</a> is also on both the engagement and revenue top 20. Roblox takes the third position for engagement on all platforms. Considering that this year saw a rise in influencers and streamers playing the game due to the release of Dress to Impress, it's not surprising that the game shot up in the rankings. With the release of that particular experience, gamers of all ages have been flocking to the platform to give the game a go. On top of that, celebrities have also been making appearances in the game, with K-pop groups and singers such as Charli XCX having their own collaborations or meet-and-greet events.</p>
<p>In terms of revenue, two Blizzard Entertainment titles managed to make it onto the top 20 list. World of Warcraft shot up by 138 ranks, securing the third position in PC revenue, which was predominantly driven by the 20th Anniversary Celebration and the release of new content from the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-better-than-ever/">The War Within expansion</a>. Additionally, Diablo IV saw a significant boost in revenue thanks to the expansion, Vessel of Hatred being released on October 7.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chivalry-2-torn-banner-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Chivalry 2&nbsp;</em>developer Torn Banner has become the latest studio to be hit by the ongoing wave of industry layoffs, following in the footsteps of both indie and major studios alike.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7269735996861091841/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official Torn Banner LinkedIn page, CEO Steve Piggott says his studio has made the "very difficult decision to undergo a restructure and reduce some of our talented workforce". Piggott doesn't state how many employees have been laid off.</p>

<p>He puts the layoffs down to Torn Banner being a "fully independent, self-funded developer" that is currently "up against many challenges", describing himself and his studio as "saddened to part ways with some of our incredible team".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/torn-banner-layoffs-chivalry-2-army.jpg?itok=_bgY0Mbz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/torn-banner-layoffs-chivalry-2-army.jpg?itok=GOA7c0Yc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Chivalry 2</em>'s Torn Banner is the latest studio to report layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to the future of Torn Banner's games, Piggott says that&nbsp;<em>Chivalry 2&nbsp;</em>won't be affected by these layoffs; the game "is not impacted", and servers will remain up as normal. As a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Chivalry 2&nbsp;</em>received its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chivalry-2-content-complete" rel="nofollow">final major content update</a> earlier this year.</p>

<p>In addition, Piggott says he and Torn Banner are still committed to working on&nbsp;<em>No More Room in Hell 2</em>, which he says he still believes is "one of the most unique and incredible zombie experiences out there". He goes as far as to call&nbsp;<em>No More Room in Hell 2&nbsp;</em>"central to our goals as a studio".</p>

<p>At time of writing, however, it seems that players are divided on whether they agree with him or not.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>No More Room in Hell 2&nbsp;</em>is currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/292000/No_More_Room_in_Hell_2/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sitting at a "Mixed" rating</a> on Steam across over 6,600 reviews, and its 24-hour player peak <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/292000/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">stands at just 228</a>, which isn't a great number for what is supposed to be one of a studio's cornerstone games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/no-more-room-in-hell-2-torn-banner.jpg?itok=dp3ELhqy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/no-more-room-in-hell-2-torn-banner.jpg?itok=xl3FcFfx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>No More Room in Hell 2&nbsp;</em>may not quite be the success Torn Banner had hoped it would be.</figcaption></figure><p>Still, it's entirely possible that with the dedication Piggott seems determined to show to&nbsp;<em>No More Room in Hell 2</em>, the game can be turned around prior to its 1.0 release, which is currently scheduled for next year.</p>

<p>Torn Banner's layoffs are just the latest in a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th" rel="nofollow">sweeping wave</a> that has been consuming both major industry bodies and smaller studios alike, leading to mass layoffs, project <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tequila-works-rime-sexy-brutale-layoffs" rel="nofollow">cancellations</a>, and studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">closures</a>.</p>

        <p>1440p-minded GPUs launch from December, both under $250</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Well slap my backplate and call me CUDA, because not only are Intel’s Arc Battlemage <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">graphics cards</a> not dead – having once been mired in production trouble rumours – but they’ve got names and are out from next week. The CPU makers’ second batch of dedicated gaming GPUs (following the decent budget-end Alchemist series) will comprise the Arc B580, releasing December 13th at $249, and the Arc B570, which arrives on January 16th from $219.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>These prices tell us that Battlemage will, as Alchemist did, attempt to bite into the sub-$250 slice of gaming GPU market share pie that Nvidia and AMD seem content to leave uneaten. This time, however, Intel say they’re aiming for speedy 1440p play, which would suggest a huge performance upgrade over 1080p-focused Alchemist models like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/intel-arc-a750-review">Arc A750</a>. "Best-in-class performance-per-dollar", no less, according to the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-launches-arc-b-series-graphics-cards.html">marketing bumf</a>.</p>
<p>To that end, the Arc B580 and Arc B570 will come packing more VRAM – 12GB and 10GB respectively – and support for XeSS 2. This is new version of Intel’s upscaler that includes a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dlss-3-how-it-works-how-it-performs-and-when-you-should-use-it">DLSS 3</a>/<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amd-fsr-3-demystified-how-the-next-gen-upscaler-could-upgrade-performance-on-any-gpu">FSR 3</a>-style frame generation feature, generating inserting interpolated frames "using optical flow and motion vector reprojection". Nice? I think? With all the bells and whistles running, XeSS 2 can supposedly multiply framerate output by by 3.9x, though I’d wait to see this in action before slapping down money for a pre-order. Democratising the advantages of frame generation is a noble goal in the face of Nvidia keeping DLSS 3 support for only its latest RTX 40 series GPUs, but FSR 3 has never quite matched it on visual quality or input lag management. Thus, grudgingly, we must accept some truth in the idea that frame gen needs very specific, cutting-edge hardware to work comfortably.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Intel-Arc-B570-reveal.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>Anyway, I’m more interested in straight-up, traditionally rendered framerates, and specifically whether Intel really can pull off a proper 60fps@1440p card – or two – at such a low price. Or, as we would have said in 2016 or so, a price. The last few years have seen GPU costs rise, yet the GPU themselves sometimes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-pc-performance-best-settings">struggling to keep up</a> with the ever-increasing demands of high fidelity games, to the extent that you can easily end up dropping £500/$500 or more to get a truly capable Quad HD engine. We probably can’t expect the Arc B580 to knock the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-super-review">RTX 4070 Super</a> off its premium perch, but given the dearth of compelling options in the lower budget ranges, I’m certainly willing to watch it take a shot.</p>
<p>In other graphics card news, Nvidia are widely expected to reveal the GeForce RTX 5090 at Las Vegas’ CES show in early January. It will probably cost more than $219. Just a bit.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/delta-force-review-in-progress.1050825/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/delta-force-review-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">“First-person shooter” is a broad term. It can mean everything from a monster-filled horror game like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/10/25/fear-review-2">F.E.A.R.</a>, to a sci-fi adventure like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-remastered-review">Metroid Prime</a>, to a demon-eviscerating romp like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-eternal-final-review">Doom</a>. Even narrowing it down to a label like “military FPS” still puts the linear campaign of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review">Call of Duty</a>, the enormous PvP clashes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-2042-review">Battlefield</a>, and the white knuckle extractions of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/escape-from-tarkov">Escape from Tarkov</a> under a single umbrella. Delta Force, the latest entry in a now 26-year-old shooter series, is probably best defined as a bit of each of those last three – with a dedicated large-scale PvP mode, a separate extraction shooter mode, and an (as yet unreleased) campaign, it sits somewhat awkwardly at the center of a that Venn diagram. It is still too early to render a final verdict, but my initial hours playing ahead of launch have already left me intrigued enough that I’m looking forward to my next deployment on the live servers later this week. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Because this release is technically the start of an indefinite “open beta” (which, for a free-to-play game, really just means it’s out), only two of the three main modes are currently available, with the campaign planned as paid DLC somewhere down the line. Of the two that are here now, the Warfare mode is Delta Force’s answer to the big team combat of Battlefield. 64 players duke it out for supremacy across one of a handful of massive, sprawling arenas. The matches I played in the early review period were focused on the Attack and Defend option within Warfare, though King of the Hill and some other time-based modes are apparently going to be available at launch. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Attack and Defend puts one team on offense, tasked with capturing some strategic points before running out of a finite number of respawns, while the other team defends those areas with limitless lives. If the offense succeeds, they refill their respawns and the cycle begins anew on another part of the map until all of the field is seized or the defense stops them in their tracks. It’s a good setup; initially, the offense has the advantage thanks to favorable terrain and an abundance of vehicles, but things even out as the match progresses and the defense retreats toward their home base. This means each side typically gets to spend some time as both the figurative hammer and the nail. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The battles certainly do feel big, which is a good thing. Fast respawns mean both teams are dense with soldiers. Once the bullets and rockets start flying, the chaos and confusion on the battlefield is exciting. It’s particularly fun when you get behind the controls of a vehicle and start running roughshod over the other team. A tank fully loaded with gunners can dominate, but don’t sleep on the impact of a simple machine gun turret on the top of an armored car. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Abilities are helpful in battle, but won't outright win a skirmish.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, the times I’ve found myself on the wrong end of that tank barrel I haven’t been totally helpless thanks to the varied operatives you can choose from mid-match. These named characters act as a sort of hybrid between a simple loadout choice and a bespoke hero, which fits the jack-of-all-trades theme persistent throughout Delta Force. If you are being overrun by vehicles, it might be a good idea to spawn with a rocket launcher, or if the fight is taking place in open spaces, it could be time to bust out the trusty sniper rifle. Each character has unique abilities that are helpful in battle too, like Luna’s Detection Arrows that can periodically be fired to reveal enemies, but none are so powerful as to outright win a skirmish, let alone a whole match, for you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I just wish the actual action felt better. Bullet arc and trajectory factor heavily into shooting, so leading your targets is essential for firing accurately at a distance. That, combined with a fast time-to-kill, makes for gunplay more in the spirit of a military sim like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arma-reforger-review">Arma</a>. That’s all well and good on its own, but feels deeply at odds with the aggressive pace of play that the objective-based Attack and Defend mode drives. Slow bullets at the mercy of gravity that kill you instantly feel a little too airsoft-like for an intense battle over a key chokepoint. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Get in, get loot, get out</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other side of things, the Operations mode follows the familiar extraction shooter framework; you and up to two friends can form a three-person squad to enter an area, shoot, loot, and scoot. Whatever you bring back to your base between rounds you can either sell, store, or use in the next attempt, and whatever is on you if you die or don’t escape in time is lost for good. It’s a tried-and-true formula that Delta Force follows to the letter, but the high quality of its execution makes up for that unoriginality. q</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each level is an open sandbox that is dense with potential objectives. Maps easily highlight points of interest for things like bounty targets, safes to plunder, and intel to decode. That might seem like a small detail to praise, but in a genre dominated by games like Escape from Tarkov that are designed to be intentionally opaque, making important information accessible is a nice differentiator. I like being able to just drop a waypoint and know what I’m in for when I get there without having to memorize the maps. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>So far I’m a fan of the enemy variety in the Operations mode.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you pick your destination, you’ll need to shoot your way through squads of AI soldiers, and occasionally human-controlled enemies. You never know who’s around, or in what numbers, so every enemy encounter starts with some fast risk assessment: do you take the shot and risk letting everyone know where you are, or do you sneak by for the stealthy approach, leaving a potential threat on the field? Making quick decisions with limited information does a good job of keeping the action strategic and interesting. That’s particularly true if you see other people, as they are certainly more dangerous than the bots, but could be loot-rich targets worth taking on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far I’m a fan of the enemy variety. My squad has taken down roving bands of riflemen, ducked into buildings to avoid sniper fire, and executed on-the-fly flanking maneuvers to get around riot shields. One memorable moment saw my team pinned down by a massive armored baddie blasting at us with a minigun as we lobbed grenades from behind cover. Another time, a member of our trio was cracking a safe while the other squadmate and I provided cover, and I almost jumped out of my chair when a giant alligator came around the corner and tried to put a stop to our fun. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">My primary worry about Operations at this point is the loop loot. There are all sorts of containers everywhere, like file cabinets, coat pockets, fallen enemies, etc. – but after just a few hours with the mode, I rarely bother to check them anymore now that I have a good idea of where to go for the actual high-ticket items. I’m hopeful there won’t be a point where the maps feel “solved” anytime soon, but they are already feeling less dynamic with each run. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The time between them is spent at the Black Site, which functions as your home base. This is where you buy, sell, and make upgrades, particularly to the amount of storage space in your stash. It’s also where you manage the well-built loadouts option. This lets you save a few different kits you can take into battle and rebuild them with just a few clicks. Pieces will be pulled from your inventory first, and then automatically purchased from the store as needed. It’s a fast and slick way to get back in the action, which helps take the sting out of a failed extraction. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, these are all still just my initial impressions - it takes time to get a comprehensive feel for how well a PvP mode like Warfare is working, and there are still a few Operations I haven’t explored, so I’m not quite ready to give a final verdict until I’ve played on the live servers. However, I can say that the extraction mode is a lot of fun in the early going, and I enjoy the scale of Delta Force’s PvP encounters even if I’m not yet sold that this style of gunplay is the right match for that action. It’s at least clear this is a competent free-to-play shooter that can cater to a few different FPS tastes, but it remains to be seen if it has the staying power to keep my interest once the initial novelty wears off. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Amazon has revealed all the PC games that'll be available this month through its Prime Gaming service, and in total, you can look forward to 18 games in December.

                <p>According to one of the top bosses at PlayStation, the rise in artificial intelligence technologies in game development has the potential to "revolutionize" gaming, but only as a tool that assists humans.</p><p>"Striking the right balance between leveraging AI and preserving the human touch will be crucial," Hermen Hulst told the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gpz291z59o" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BBC</a>.</p><p>He went on to predict that the gaming industry will see a "dual demand," split between AI-driven "innovative experiences" and a second for "handcrafted, thoughtful content."</p><p>There are concerns among industry developers about the potential for advancements to AI ending up taking jobs from humans. This is part of the reason <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/" data-ref-id="1100-6525312">why video game voice actors are now on strike</a> and why some labor unions are calling on workers to organize.</p><p>Another video game executive, Christoph Hartmann of Amazon, said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-can-help-solve-game-industrys-problems-or-at-least-some-of-them-amazon-boss-says/1100-6526061/" data-ref-id="1100-6526061">he believes AI could replace "boring" parts of video game jobs</a>, including localization as he sees it. However, Hartmann and others believe the rise in AI technologies will create enough new jobs to offset any potential job losses. EA's Andrew Wilson previously said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-boss-explains-why-ai-will-be-good-for-gaming/1100-6518421/" data-ref-id="1100-6518421">the agricultural and industrial revolutions took many jobs but created countless more</a>, and he sees an AI revolution following a similar playbook.</p><p>The video game industry had another tough year in 2024 with thousands of worker layoffs, along with game cancellations and studio closures. A number of companies whose executives are speaking positively about AI--including Microsoft, EA, Amazon, and PlayStation--have all cut jobs in the past year. Whether or not these cuts were at all related to AI is unknown, however.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Black Ops 6 Zombies - Citadelle des Morts Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The new gameplay trailer shows off some of the interior and exterior parts of the castle setting, with the cast of characters fighting off hordes with elemental swords, the new Tesla Storm field upgrade, and making use of the map's special traps. One trap looks like it's dumping hot oil or acid on the undead.</p><p dir="ltr">The gameplay also shows the terrifying new Doppelghast enemy. Just like Liberty Falls and Terminus have their own unique elite Zombie type, Citadelle des Morts features the Doppelghast, which has multiple heads and tentacle-like appendages instead of arms. This enemy looks like it can run pretty fast, and it looks very creepy doing so.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to Citadelle des Morts, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-roadmap-shows-mp-maps-7-new-weapons-and-castle-map-for-zombies/2900-5940/#1">the big Zombies update</a> will include the Vulture Aid Perk-a-Cola, the Tesla Storm field upgrade, the Light Mend ammo mod, and 18 more Augments to unlock.</p><p>For more on Zombies, Citadelle des Morts's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-zombies-citadelle-des-morts-trailer-brings-back-a-familiar-face/1100-6528064/">first trailer can be seen here</a>. The cinematics also set up a narrative that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/past-call-of-duty-zombies-storylines-will-collide-in-black-ops-6-dlc/1100-6528073/">merge storylines from Treyarch's previously unconnected Zombies storylines</a>.</p>

			<p>In <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/reports/the-case-for-in-game-video-platforms-closing-the-direct-to-consumer-gap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIDiA Research's upcoming report</a>, they've concluded that gamers spend more time watching videos on platforms like <a href="https://wccftech.com/detroit-become-human-has-sold-over-5-million-units-community-play-twitch-extension-reportedly-very-popular/">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/youtube-videos-skipping-till-end-if-you-have-adblocker-enabled/">YouTube</a> rather than playing games. In the report, it says that there is an 'untapped potential' for game publishers to have video content from inside their ecosystems to third-party platforms such as Twitch and YouTube. The report says that gamers are now spending more time watching videos, averaging 8.5 hours per week on video versus 7.4 hours gaming. Although there are plenty of games to be played, it isn't too surprising that a lot of people watch games instead. Whether this be from watching streamers play their favorite games or watching streamers take on horror games so they don't have to, video content is overall just a tiny bit more popular.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>24% of console and PC players watch game-related videos at least monthly, with 48% of in-game buyers watching game-related content at least monthly. The report shows that a common factor is that those who view content tend to be high-spending gamers, especially when it comes to microtransactions. As a result, the report suggests that there is an open market for in-game video platforms to offer publishers a direct line to the highest-value fans.</p>
<p>For a lot of popular games, it may be a little bit difficult to pull something like that off, but eSports would be a great way to attempt to bring video content inside games, especially considering how often events happen within eSports and Fighting games, for example. By doing this, it would allow publishers to unlock new revenue streams in the process, something that publishers are struggling with when third-party video platforms exist.</p>
<p>This is something that has the potential to be revolutionary, especially at a time when the game market is facing growth stagnation and competition across all genres is at an all-time high. Especially for those living in areas with significant economic crises, it means that people have to choose what game to purchase rather than purchasing multiple.</p>
<p>"It's time for game publishers to think about in-game video as something beyond marketing alone. By reclaiming video engagement, publishers have the potential to unlock new revenue streams like advertising, and drive growth," says Rhys Elliott, Games Analyst at MIDiA Research, the author of this particular report.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/phasmophobia-console-sales-top-1m-total-sales-now-almost-22m.1050792/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-sales<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kinetic Games has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>console sales have already hit a very impressive milestone, even though the game has only been out on consoles for just over a month.</p>

<p>In a press release, Kinetic marks 35 days since&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>'s console launch, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-release" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> multiple <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-delay-halloween" rel="nofollow">times</a> before finally happening just before Halloween this year. Since that point,&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>has sold a million copies on consoles.</p>

<p>According to Kinetic, that figure brings&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>'s total sales up to almost 22 million, which is a very impressive milestone indeed. That figure puts&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>ahead of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hazelight-josef-fares-new-ip-it-takes-two-sales" rel="nofollow">co-op platformer&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hazelight-josef-fares-new-ip-it-takes-two-sales" rel="nofollow">It Takes Two</a>&nbsp;</em>and remaster collection&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-sales" rel="nofollow"><em>Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy</em></a>&nbsp;at last count.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-console-sales-camera.jpg?itok=NTlbRGC1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-console-sales-camera.jpg?itok=QHjnA1_K 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Phasmophobia</em>'s console release has sold very well indeed for Kinetic Games.</figcaption></figure><p>Kinetic CEO and&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>lead developer Daniel Knight describes the sales milestone as "the best Christmas present we could have wished for", thanking the game's "wonderful, supportive, and engaged community".</p>

<p><em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>was originally released on PC via Steam Early Access back in September 2020. It's received a number of updates since then, with major patches bringing things like a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-ascension-update-release-date" rel="nofollow">progression overhaul</a>, new <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-update-0810-adds-insanity-difficulty-and-more" rel="nofollow">difficulty levels</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-update-adds-3-new-ghosts-truck-improvements" rel="nofollow">more ghosts to contend with</a>, among other things.</p>

<p>Technically speaking, the game remains in Early Access; Kinetic still says it's planning a full release in late 2024, but since we're in the early days of December, this is looking more and more unlikely.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>, it's a multiplayer ghost-hunting horror game in which you must team up with your friends to find and document supernatural phenomena in a range of haunted locations.</p>

<p>You'll have access to a range of ghost-hunting equipment to help you do so, and each ghost behaves in a different way, so you'll need to have your wits about you in order to discover which ghost you've encountered and how to best deal with it.</p>

<p><em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10005673" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/phasmophobia-game-preview/9N6D60SBZN05" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

<p>The PlayStation <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/playstation-history/1994-ps-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">turns 30 today</a> (December 3), and it had a lot of us at Insider Gaming thinking about the time we’ve spent with Sony’s first console. From experience Metal Gear Solid for the first time to the chaos that was Twisted Metal, there were no shortage of fun games to pass the time in the 90s. </p>



<p>So we decided to have a little fun and put together our lists of our favorite original PlayStation games. Now, we’re not saying these are the best games ever made. These are just the ones we had the most fun with in our time playing the console. </p>



<p>It’s always fun to look back at what we loved. And who knows, maybe there’s a game you forgot about that you want to revisit or play for the first time. Check out our favorites, and let us know what yours are in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/favorite-playstation-games-ever.1285/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>. </p>

		<p>A brand new city builder called Amberspire has been announced by Bithell Games and Lunar Division, with this providing a twist on the genre by being dice based. Set on an abandoned moon orbiting a gas giant, the fate of how the city grows and flourishes will depend on the dice rolls. The dice determine which resources you get, meaning you will have to adapt the city to what they provide. This will not be the only challenge as the moon’s environment will provide its own challenges, and different factions will spring up, which can upset the harmony you will be trying to create.</p>
<p><iframe title="Amberspire | Announce Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YpkTQUT94-Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Amberspire’s key features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Dice-driven systems</strong>&nbsp;govern resources, buildings, weather, and events. Dice guide you to play reactively and create interesting scenarios.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Systemic ecology and citizen dynamics</strong>&nbsp;create a lively and unique world. The residents of your city grow according to their environment. Likewise, the weather and ecology of the moon respond to the increasing number of buildings and can threaten your progress.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Factions and political drama</strong>&nbsp;can dramatically affect your capabilities. Dynamic events infuse the story of your city as factions compete with each other.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Hand-drawn isometric art</strong>&nbsp;beautifully realize the buildings that comprise your city, and lush portraits depict the many factions in the galaxy.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em><strong>An original soundtrack</strong>&nbsp;composed by nervous_testpilot that brings to life the unique world of Amber and its moon.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>A release date for Amberspire is yet to be confirmed, and it appears that it is PC only.<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3350750/Amberspire/"> Amberspire can be wishlisted on Steam now.</a></p>

			<p><a href="https://www.naeu.playblackdesert.com/en-US/main/index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pearl Abyss</a>, the developer and publisher of Black Desert has announced that they are officially developing native builds of the game for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 5 Pro and Xbox Series X|S. These native builds will offer enhanced visuals, smoother gameplay, and much-needed performance upgrades to make sure that the game runs smoothly and is tailored to next-gen consoles. This update will be free for all current Black Desert Console players.</p>
<p>If you prefer to get your news in the form of a video, General Manager Matt goes into detail about what you can expect from the console updates.</p>
<p><iframe title="Message from Black Desert Console Team" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oW6Ra1fNzwg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As it stands, the PS5 version's development has been completed and is nearing platform certification, while the Xbox Series X development is currently ongoing. Pearl Abyss plans&nbsp; for both of the builds to launch in the first half of 2025, when there will then be additional updates to Black Desert Console, like the Land of the Morning Light expansion.</p>
<p>In addition to the native build development for both the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, it's been confirmed by Pearl Abyss that there will be a ton of updates coming to Black Desert on December 12 to help keep players engaged in the interim between the native build release and the release of the Land of the Morning Light expansion.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-desert-onlines-new-expansion-is-out-now/">Land of the Morning Light expansion</a> was released earlier this year on PC and took players to a new region of ancient Korea, with lots of stunning visuals, traditional Korean architecture, and beautiful scenery. The expansion is free for all players. The most common complaint about the expansion is that the amount of information thrown at you is overwhelming, especially if you are a new player in the game.&nbsp; Additionally, combat, which is a vital part of Black Desert, wasn't really explained as much in Land of the Morning Light, and those who had never played the game before would find it a bit of a struggle to figure out the systems.</p>
<p>On December 12, Kharazad Accessories will be added to the game, as well as an Accessory Exchange System that allows players to exchange parts of the Deboreka accessory set to get other parts of the set that they may need.</p>
<p>Additionally, there will be daily rewards and buffs to help players through the grind. Beneficial items like Mythical Censer and significant buffs that are added to the game will be running until March 2025. This includes a 50% buff to Training EXP, a 100% buff to Farming EXP, and Combat EXP being buffed to 500%.</p>

The two Windows-based handhelds come with 32GB of RAM and larger batteries than their predecessors. They release on December 25th, but you can preorder them now, starting at $799 for the Claw 7 and $899 for the Claw 8.</p><p>When the original MSI Claw shipped last spring, MSI needed to address battery life and performance, both of which were both sticking points in Sean Hollister’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24105991/msi-claw-review"><em>Verge</em> review</a>. The Claw 8 brings more significant changes here; its 80-watt-hour battery is a big jump over the original model’s 53 watt hours. The Claw 7 has a much smaller increase at 54.5 watt hours. The Claw 8 also has an “easy access” SSD storage slot that the Claw 7 lacks. </p><p>Both devices have a 120Hz variable refresh rate LCD display, but the Claw 8’s 8-inch screen is slightly higher resolution (1920 x 1200) than the Claw 7’s 7-inch one (1920 x 1080). Performance-wise, MSI claims the handhelds will have a 113 percent higher peak FPS and 20 percent higher average FPS than its competitors “under identical power conditions.” MSI doesn’t say which competitors it’s referring to, but in Sean’s review, the previous model was outdone by the Steam Deck OLED, Asus ROG Ally Z1E, and the Lenovo Legion Go.</p><div><figcaption><em>The new MSI Claw 8 AI Plus and Claw 7 AI Plus.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: MSI</cite></p></div><p>Other changes to both handhelds include redesigned Hall effects sticks and triggers, and updated bumpers and d-pad. MSI also added a second Thunderbolt 4 port to each one’s complement of I / O ports that includes an audio jack and a microSD card reader. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s unclear how a possible acquisition, which would give the PlayStation 5 maker majority ownership of FromSoftware, would factor into its future plans. I’m guessing the platform holder would be cautious about doing anything that might disrupt the creativity and development pipeline of one of the current top game studios in the world. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After weeks of rumors and leaks, Intel has officially unveiled its first Battlemage graphics cards. Two new GPUs are set to hit the market starting this month in the Intel Arc B580 and the Arc B570, both of which are built on the Xe2-HPG architecture.</p>



<p>Both of the new graphics cards are geared toward the entry- and mid-level market as opposed to the higher-end cards from AMD and Nvidia. </p>



<p>The Arc B580 is the first card to release on December 13 and will retail for $249. The graphics card features 20 Xe2 cores, 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM with a 192-bit memory bus. It’s clock speed comes in at 2.67 GHz, just under the rumored 2.8 GHz from earlier leaks. However it could go higher depending on which board partner you purchase the graphics card from. It’ll also have a TBP (Total Board Power) of just 190W.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Moving on to the Intel Arc B570, the slighter lower-end card comes in at just $219 and will release on January 16. The Arc B570 has a slightly slower clock speed of 2.5 GHz and 10 GB of GDDR6 memory. It also sits on a smaller 160-bit memory bus with a max bandwidth of 380 GB/s.

                <p>In March 2025, the Critical Role team will celebrate the 10th anniversary of their wildly popular live play series that led to an independent media empire that includes The Legend of Vox Machina animated series and more. Now, Critical Role may be close to taking another big step forward by working on its own video game.</p><p>During a recent profile in <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/critical-role-dungeons-and-dragons-interview-1235188141/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rolling Stone</a>, Critical Role's Laura Bailey confirmed that the team has been "talking about creating a video game since we first started playing together." And according to Travis Willingham, those discussions may lead to something more concrete in the near future.</p><p>"I would say it's an active pursuit on our end," said Willingham. "And hopefully, we'll have something really exciting to share, maybe around the end of the year, maybe at the beginning of 2025, just in time for our 10-year anniversary. But it's something we've definitely had our minds on. Those collaborations we've had with various partners have been little toe dips in the pool just to see how it feels. You know, there's a lot of upheaval in the interactive space right now. And we've seen studios sort of bear and weather those strains. It's trying to become smarter about it and find out how we might fit into that larger ecosystem."</p><p>All of the Critical Role cast members are voice actors, and they collectively have a lot of experience lending their voices to games. Bailey, as an example, had high-profile roles as Abby in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-460201">The Last of Us Part II</a> and Mary Jane Watson in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-spider-man-review-amazing-fantasy/1900-6416975/" data-ref-id="1900-6416975">Spider-Man</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-spider-man-2-review-web-warriors/1900-6418134/" data-ref-id="1900-6418134">Spider-Man 2</a>, in addition to narrating <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/critical-roles-laura-bailey-will-narrate-ttrpg-inspired-worlds-of-aria/1100-6519939/" data-ref-id="1100-6519939">Worlds of Aria</a>. Critical Role's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/how-matt-mercer-went-from-testing-games-to-voicing-legends/2300-6465511/" data-ref-id="2300-6465511">Matt Mercer also recently appeared on Star Players</a> to share how he broke into video game voiceovers. If the Critical Role team does move forward with a video game project, it's unknown if it would be based on a previous campaign or if it would be a completely original story.</p>

                <p>Through the first three Indiana Jones movie, Dr. Henry Jones Jr. never met a Nazi he didn't want to punch in the face. Indy's had rivals in each of his cinematic adventures, and that's a tradition that continues in Bethesda and MachineGames' upcoming title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" data-ref-id="5000-525173">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>. This time, Indy's primary enemy is Emmerich Voss, and he presents himself as a far more reasonable man than some of Dr. Jones' past foes. But a reasonable Nazi is still a Nazi, and he has to be stopped. </p><p>The trailer features a few face-to-face encounters between Indy and Voss, including what may be their first encounter. Judging from their interplay here, Voss may not be much of a physical threat for Indy, but his intellect makes him dangerous. Voss was on the trail of the Great Circle before Indy, and he may still find its secrets if Indy can't discover them first.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Indiana Jones and the Great Circle - Official Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>One of the trailer's notable settings is the Vatican, which sends Indy into the Catholic church's city state during his search for answers. That's where he meets reporter Gina Lombardi, the game's primary heroine. Gina may be disguised as a nun, but she's no saint. Her agenda differs from Indy's in that she's less interested in his archeological find, and more focused on locating her missing sister. </p><p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will arrive on Xbox Series X|S and PC on December 9, and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-unlock-times-and-how-to-play-early/1100-6528168/" data-ref-id="1100-6528168">will be on Game Pass on day one</a>. PC players also have the option of trying out the title for only <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-on-pc-for-1/1100-6528163/" data-ref-id="1100-6528163">a $1 via a PC Game Pass trial</a>. PlayStation 5 owners will have to wait until Spring 2025. This game will be one of Indy's biggest adventures to date, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-has-almost-enough-cut-scenes-for-two-movies/1100-6528083/" data-ref-id="1100-6528083">nearly four hours of cutscenes</a>.</p>

		<p>I’m not really the kind of person to go visit a museum when on a rare holiday. Blame the proliferation of information and imagery across the internet, but the slow, meandering nature of many museums doesn’t really do it for me. That said, museums are still a hugely important part of modern society, collecting, preserving and seeking to educate visitors in everything from dinosaurs to modern science, from steam trains to model trains, and from chocolates to sex toys and medieval torture devices (possibly at the same museum). There’s a museum for pretty much everything.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a> somehow manages to come up with some new things that you definitely won’t see in a museum outside of Two Point County.</p>
<p><iframe title="Two Point Museum Preview – We played the&nbsp;Prehistory, Marine Life &amp; Supernatural museums" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zLbM27hYcsk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Sure, Two Point Museum still dabbles in the familiar realms of ancient history or aquatic life, but there’s more than a few funny twists on these themes with the exhibits you’ll get to display, and that’s before you head to a spooky mansion and host spectral beings and haunted dolls as attractions.</p>
<p>We got to go hands on with the opening few hours of the game and the first handful of museums and themes. Starting off with Prehistory, we were plonking funky looking dinosaur skeletons and fossils right next to gigantic footprints, stone-carved floppy disks and ancient beehives and fridge freezers still encased in the ice block they were found in.</p>

<p>Then it was off to the coast and the Marine Life museum, setting up water tanks for the very literally named sea life that we could dredge up from the ocean where Wetlantis used to exist. Think Catfish, Clownfish, Tigerfish, and you’ll know exactly the baseline punning that Two Point Studio has got up to here. Taking a leaf out of Planet Zoo’s book, marine life needs their water tanks to match their specific requirement, such as having certain temperature ranges, amount of foliage, and more to get them into their happiness sweet spot and increase the Buzz level.</p>
<p>But then there’s the spookily haunted mansion of Wailon Lodge. There’s a menagerie of haunted horrors here that will bring punters through looking for a frighteningly informative time, showing them spooky mannequins and dolls, letting them peep through one-way mirrors at Industrial Age Spirits, who you’ve set up in poltergeist-friendly Polterguest Rooms to (un)live out their days with period appropriate furniture and entertainment.</p>

<p>Get things wrong with an exhibit, and fail to have enough of the right type of experts around to maintain them, and things can get out of hand. Frozen exhibits can melt, releasing a swarm of prehistoric bees and fridge contents out into your museum, or spirits can become restless, their Peace level lowering to zero until they break out of their room and terrorise your visitors. In practice, it doesn’t take too much to keep things in check to start off.</p>
<p>You’re free to build out your museum pretty much however you like, but there’s a few key things to consider when placing your exhibits. You want to get the theme right, decorate those prehistoric footprints with faux tusks poking out of the floor, jungle-like walls and shrubs to really get across the right vibe. Every item will also need to be in rough proximity to an info board of some kind, and the environment and amount of information combined will help to raise the Buzz level of an exhibit, increasing the likelihood that a visitor will chuck a few extra coins into one of the many, many donation bins that you scatter around the building.</p>

<p>But where do you get those exhibits? Filling out your museums requires you to hire experts and send them out into the field, visiting dig sites, hopping on boats, and even stepping foot into the Netherworldto find and bring back exhibits. An expedition needs you to send out an expert, perhaps accompanied by other staff members, and with a chance that various event types and conditions will occur –&nbsp;potentially seeing them bring back an ailment like sticky feet. Higher levelled staff will have a better time of it, they could be trained in survival skills to help in more exotic locales, and you can send them packing with items to help cancel out the risk of coming back poorly, or boost their XP.</p>
<p>It’s a neat meta game that you will funnel so much of your museum’s cash into, gradually unlocking sites across a broader map of the world, each with different potential finds. There’s certain narrative blockers to overcome, and the potential that you’ll have to make a decision at a key juncture as well. And it all builds up to the loot box pastiche of an exhibit reveal, the wooden crate bouncing around on screen before bursting open in a glorious light show to reveal what’s inside.</p>
<p>But your experts can’t just go gallivanting around the world on adventures – who do they think they are, Indiana Jones or something? – they have to ensure that the things that belong in the museum stay in good condition, and also do their best to teach the eager museum-goers about the exhibits. Guided tours are where they go face to face with the uninformed masses, and you have to curate a little tour with stops at a bunch of your exhibits, checking them off as though you were creating a bus route in a city builder. You’ve got to balance the length of the tour with the most exciting exhibits and cohesive theme, with the goal at the end to, once again, encourage more donations.</p>
<p>Oh, and don’t forget to put in a gift shop!</p>

<p>It doesn’t take too long before you start to appreciate the layers of management sim that will feature in Two Point Museum. The game eases you in with the more thematic ideas, but then you start to see the familiar elements of staff training rooms, where you can boost their specialisation or traits for expeditions, research rooms that will break down finds to help increase your understanding of a particular theme, but then there’s new twists like a workshop to let a trained janitor put together an interactive display that’s engineered to keep the bogey-producing rapscallions that are the youth of the day entertained and distract them from clambering over the actual exhibits!</p>
<p>Once you’ve unlocked a new museum, hired the right experts and opened up new discovery sites, you’ll be able to revisit previous levels and bring all of those unlocks with you. Of course you can open up a new wing with a completely different theme, but there’s also some finds that will blend between them, such as the Swim Reaper mixing both Marine and Supernatural, of the Exterrogator an oversized aquatic skeleton to mix Prehistory and Marine.</p>

<p>This is shaping up to be the most customisable Two Point game yet from a visual and layout perspective, with things like diagonal walls and floor tile quarters letting you create the kind of flowing floorplans that IKEA would be proud of. It can be a little bit fussy, though, as this is bolted into the game alongside the regular style of room – for staff rooms, gift shops, lavatories and the like –&nbsp;and those are still stuck to the square grid, which didn’t always want to mesh together with the new walls and entrances quite right. Hopefully Two Point Studios can round off some rougher edges here before launch next March.</p>
<p>But on the whole, I had a lovely time visiting the museums of Two Point County. There’s the cheeky, pun-laden, irreverent Two Point humour throughout, and this is a great twist on the studio’s brand of management sim that offers something really quite different to both the rest of the genre and their first two games.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-a-life-20-gsc-game-world</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-dev-gsc-game-world-explains-whats-happening-with-a-life-2-0.1050708/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-a-life-20-gsc-game-world<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>developer GSC Game World has explained exactly what's happening with the game's much-touted A-Life 2.0 game AI system, including why mention of the system was removed from&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s Steam page and why the system itself doesn't seem to be working properly.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-dev-gsc-game-world-explains-for-the-first-time-what-went-wrong-with-a-life-20-and-why-it-was-removed-from-the-games-description-on-steam" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">to IGN</a>, GSC Game World creative director Maria Grygorovych and CEO Ievgen Grygorovych (a husband-and-wife duo) say that the A-Life 2.0 system is, in fact, in&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, but that like much of the rest of the game, it's riddled with bugs.</p>

<p>First, it's worth explaining what A-Life 2.0 is supposed to be. The original&nbsp;<em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>included a system called A-Life, which would essentially dictate NPC behavior. It would simulate NPC movement through the game's world; in essence, NPCs didn't magically spawn around you in&nbsp;<em>Stalker</em>, but had their own paths and lives instead.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-a-life-2.0-explanation-ruined-interior.jpg?itok=RAgYS1sF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-a-life-2.0-explanation-ruined-interior.jpg?itok=3F2aAsrt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stalker 2</em>'s A-Life 2.0 system is apparently in the game, it's just riddled with bugs.</figcaption></figure><p>A-Life 2.0 was, as you've probably surmised, supposed to be an advanced version of that system. GSC Game World <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1g9od8x/alife_20_details_confirmed_by_gsc/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">talked up its inclusion</a> prior to release, but at launch,&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>seemed to tell a different story for many.</p>

<p>Fans pointed out that, contrary to the way A-Life 2.0 was supposed to create organic paths for NPCs, characters were instead simply <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1gx7ja3/alife_20_in_action/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">spawning</a> around players, and the game's AI <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1gvu079/there_is_no_alife/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">seemed prescriptive and scripted</a> to others.</p>

<p>In fact, the apparent failure of&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s A-Life 2.0 system to function was one of the sticking points for our very own Robert N. Adams. In <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stalker-2-review" rel="nofollow">his review</a>, he talks about how the game's sudden NPC spawning "breaks immersion", describing&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s handling of enemy spawns as "downright clumsy".</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago,&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>players noticed that A-Life 2.0 had been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1guf62t/alife_20_is_no_longer_mentioned_on_the_games/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">removed from the game's Steam description</a>, with mention of the system being replaced by a somewhat more generic promise of "advanced artificial intelligence systems".</p>

<p>Now, in the IGN interview, Maria Grygorovych says A-Life 2.0 was removed from&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s Steam page by a marketing staffer who felt the term wouldn't make sense to&nbsp;<em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>newcomers and wouldn't help to sell the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-a-life-2.0-explanation-bubble.jpg?itok=Fm05obZ7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-a-life-2.0-explanation-bubble.jpg?itok=wwOTckEu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>GSC Game World's creative director says&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s A-Life 2.0 system was removed from the game's Steam description for marketing reasons.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Maria, this marketing staffer told her that "there will be a lot of new players who don't know what A-Life is" and that he removed the term "without any discussion or permission".</p>

<p>As for the A-Life 2.0 system itself, Ievgen says that optimization forced GSC Game World to reduce the spawn area for NPCs around the player, which is why some&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>players have noticed NPCs seemingly popping into existence around them.</p>

<p>A-Life 2.0 is supposed to work with a very wide spawn area for NPCs, but this area was reduced in order to free up memory for the game and improve its performance.</p>

<p>Ievgen is insistent that A-Life 2.0 will be fixed and that it will eventually work as intended, but for now, the focus seems to be on fixing&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s bugs, which is fairly understandable given just how many of them there seemed to be at launch.</p>

<p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/stalker-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <p>Tic-tac-toe, known to British people as noughts and crosses, is a famously boring game that is nonetheless often played by anybody with a sweet wrapper, a pencil and five minutes to burn while waiting for any form of public transport. It's boring because it's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe">"solved game"</a> whose outcomes can be safely predicted regardless of where you place your first nought or cross, allowing the "perfect" player to at least draw their opponent. It gets played regardless because a lot of people don't know it's a solved game - specifically, young children you may wish to humiliate using your superior grown-up brain, because when you were a child somebody did the same to you. </p>
<p>How many twisted adults were born from the experience of being bullied via the medium of tic-tac-toe? We'd be better off without this game. But look! Here comes Tic Tactic to shake things up with a touch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>In this roguelike deckbuilder, each round of noughts and crosses is an individual skirmish in a vengeful duck's quest against some murderous chickens. I don't have time to explain that premise, because my opponent has just played a specialised kind of cross that sets neighbouring noughts on fire.</p>
<p>I will retaliate with a nought that causes earthquakes, reshuffling the pieces, then play a nought that restore my health. Yep, Tic Tactic is one of those games that takes a centuries-old proven concept and asks "but what if it was an RPG". So far, it's getting away with it. I've just been playing <a href="https://unbreaded.itch.io/tictactic">the Itch.io browser demo</a>, and I'm enjoying the transformation of a game I loathe into one I can imagine playing on the tube.</p><p>It feels like the trick isn't that the noughts and crosses have a bunch of wacky D&amp;D modifiers. The secret sauce is that when you score a line of three, dealing damage to the other player, it doesn't reset the board. The scoring tiles vanish, leaving spare or opposing tiles in place. So in addition to setting up those trios, you've got to worry about follow-through, plus the usual roguelike business of saving your most powerful pieces for the opportune moment. Just some very cursory impressions, anyway. </p>
<p>Tic Tactic is on Itch.io right now, with a Steam page to follow in the next week or so. I'm writing it up in advance of the Steam page's launch because I'm going to have my hands full next week, but I'll sling the link into the Maw when it arrives. There's no release date yet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Buried under Capcom's Osaka, Japan headquarters is a small foley studio. Dozens--if not hundreds--of shoes are tucked into cubbies outside the door. Inside, the space looks more like an antique store than the high-end recording studio responsible for the sound effects from nearly every Capcom game. The walls are adorned with household appliances, fabrics, and tools of every kind. The foley artist that greets us is holding what appears to be a PVC pipe with a mouth piece haphazardly mounted onto the side of it. The team calls this strange gray tube Murmurs of a King; it's an instrument Capcom created specifically for the Rey Dau, a ferocious beast that players will hunt in Monster Hunter Wilds.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike most instruments, Murmurs of a King does not sound pleasant. Its bass-y screeches don't even sound like an imposing monster, at least at first. After recording the instrument a few times, a sound editor goes to work and within minutes they've created a guttural monster's cry. This approach to monster sound design is new for the series, they tell us. While 2018's Monster Hunter World used natural sounds from real animals, the team wanted the monsters to feel imposing and unfamiliar in Wilds.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, I didn't get to square up with the Rey Dau during my five-hour play session, but under-the-hood changes like these were emblematic of my experience. Monster Hunter Wilds is still a Monster Hunter game; killing monsters net you monster parts that can be used to craft new armor and upgrade weapons, iconic weapons like the Switch-Axe and Insect Glaive return, and hunts can be undertaken with up to three friends. However, what makes Wilds so enticing is how Capcom has streamlined the experience without sacrificing its depth.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4408492-4_huntthequematrice_en.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4408492" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4408492-4_huntthequematrice_en.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4408492"></a><figcaption>Monster Hunter Wilds</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4408492-4_huntthequematrice_en.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Chief among these changes is the seamless open world. Up until now, Monster Hunter's hub area has been cordoned off from its hunting maps. In between each hunt, you'd load back into the hub, craft armor, upgrade weapons, cook meals, and pick up new quests before loading into another hunt. In Wilds, however, everything is connected. This may seem like a small change, but it fundamentally changes the pace of the Monster Hunter experience. Hunts begin and end organically--if there's a specific monster you want to fight, you pull up your map, mark its location, and track it down. Once you've defeated the beast, you can continue exploring the world or fast travel back to camp.</p><p dir="ltr">To help you get around the world, you have a trusty steed called a Seikret. Like the Palamute from Monster Hunter Rise, Seikrets can be summoned at any time and--aside from fast traveling--are the most efficient way to get around the game world. Your Seikret can even auto-path to your destination so you can heal up and sharpen your weapons without dismounting. The auto-pathing feature was a little unreliable during the preview, so I didn't use it much--we'll have to wait and see if the feature works as intended at launch. Unlike Monster Hunter Rise, though, Wilds is much bigger in scale. Wilds' first area, the Windward Plains, is significantly bigger than the Shrine Ruins from Rise. While Capcom hasn't officially revealed the scale of Wilds, it seems like there will be plenty more to explore and your Seikret will be an instrumental part of that.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">Hunts begin and end organically--if there's a specific monster you want to fight, you pull up your map, mark its location, and track it down.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Alongside Wilds' bigger world, it introduces seasons called Fallow and Plenty. In between each season, there's a turbulent period called Inclemency. The environment, the fauna, and monster behaviors change depending on the season. During the Fallow season, the environment is more barren and monsters might be more aggressive as they hunt for food. During Plenty, the world is lush and monsters may be a little more docile. These seasons could make the world itself feel more dynamic, but I didn't play enough to really dig into this feature or see its impact. However, for one quest I did get to experience the Inclemency period, which is a spectacle. A huge storm formed over the Windward Plains and bolts of lightning crashed into the sand as I chased and fought the Alpha Doshaguma, which is the first major hunt of the story.</p><p dir="ltr">During this hunt, other changes that Capcom made further enabled the seamless open-world structure. For example, your Seikret can carry a backup weapon you can swap to in the field. According to game director Yuya Tokuda, "Once a quest is over, [the instance] is not over. You can seamlessly continue to the next quest, so the situation is constantly changing, and we found it hard to go with one weapon." This should make it easier for players to continue their journey without having to return to camp after each hunt. Admittedly, I didn't test out this feature because I was having way too much fun bopping monsters on the head with the hammer.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4408495-10_huntthebalahara_en.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4408495" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4408495-10_huntthebalahara_en.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4408495"></a><figcaption>Monster Hunter Wilds</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4408495-10_huntthebalahara_en.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In another attempt to streamline the experience, Monster Hunter Wilds also adds a portable grill that lets you cook food while out in the world. As far as I could tell, meals work the same as they did in previous entries, but now you don't need to return to the hub area after each hunt to re-up your passive bonuses. As long as you find a safe spot to cook, you can set up your grill and cook tasty-looking meals.</p><p dir="ltr">A change that might be more controversial is the reduction in length of hunts in Wilds. While the fights were still intense, many of the hunts felt shorter than they have in previous games. According to the director, this was intentional. However, Capcom didn't make the monsters easier or shrink their health pools. Instead, the focus mode and injury system are what speeds up the fights. Focus mode lets you pinpoint injuries and aim your weapon at said injuries. Attacking an injury will do extra damage, potentially stunning the monster, and causing them to drop more monster parts. If you've lined your crosshair up on an injury, you can even unleash a powerful Focus Blow that will knock the monster over.</p><p dir="ltr">In previous Monster Hunter games, I'd typically identify the safest spot to attack a monster, but Focus Mode had me circling my foes looking for any injury I could exploit. It's a smart system that forces you to fight a monster from every angle, and adds a bit more risk and reward to what could otherwise be a simple fight. If you target a monster's injuries, you'll do more damage which could speed up the battle, but doing so could put you in a precarious position.</p><p dir="ltr">During my session, I fought seven monsters, and each fight felt dynamic, deadly, and impressive. In addition to the monsters from the beta, I fought four additional monsters: The Quematrice, an oil-spitting wyvern; the Congalala, a gassy baboon first introduced in Monster Hunter 2; the Lala Barina, a red spider-like creature; and the Uth Duna, a flowing water wyvern. The highlight was the Lala Barina. Its erratic movements, weird shape, and swift attacks made it a formidable opponent. Identifying and exploiting its injuries was key to slowing the best down, but its speed and aggression made its injuries difficult to pinpoint.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4408494-6_huntthelalabarina_01_en.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4408494" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4408494-6_huntthelalabarina_01_en.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4408494"></a><figcaption>Monster Hunter Wilds</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4408494-6_huntthelalabarina_01_en.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Part of what makes these monsters so imposing are their animations. After our gameplay demo, Capcom gave us a tour of their motion-capture studio and showed us how they create and iterate on their animations in real time. Two actors covered head to toe in black tights stood in the center of the room surrounded by a team of capture artists. One was a hunter toting a foam greatsword. The other took on the role of the monster. After the director called action, the two actors duked it out. The monster actor was on all fours taking swipes at the hunter, while the hunter swung his foam greatsword with flourishes you'd expect to see in a Monster Hunter game.</p><p dir="ltr">Within seconds, a tech team in the back of the studio had the scene up and running in Capcom's proprietary game engine. As good as it looked, the work is far from over. After a motion-capture shoot, the raw animations are disseminated to animators who go in and adjust the animations to make them feel more fluid during gameplay. Of course, there are some animations that can't be done in a motion-capture studio and require animators to create animations from scratch. These animations tend to be ones that require impossible acrobatics, such as the Insect Glaive's aerial combos. There is clearly a lot of care and attention put into making monsters feel unique and distinct, and the process also allows developers to experiment with strange and unexpected movements that could catch players off guard and put their skills to the test.</p><p dir="ltr">The work Capcom has put into streamlining the multiplayer experience--something that the series has needed for a while--was equally impressive. Folks who played the recent beta likely already have a good idea how it works, but it seems Capcom is doubling down on that seamless experience thanks to the Link Party system, which keeps a group together throughout multiple hunts and quests.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4408496-12_repeltheuthduna_en.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4408496" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4408496-12_repeltheuthduna_en.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4408496"></a><figcaption>Monster Hunter Wilds</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4408496-12_repeltheuthduna_en.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you do end up getting overwhelmed by a monster, you can fire off an SOS flare and other player-controlled hunters can come to your aid. However, in Monster Hunter Wilds, you can also call on support from NPC hunters that consist of key characters from the main story. While they may not be as useful as player-controlled hunters, they were certainly competent enough to be beneficial. They'd draw aggro, deal decent damage, and keep things from getting too out of hand. While it's hard to say how useful they will be for tougher fights, I suspect they will be a great addition for players who want to experience Monster Hunter Wilds by themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">Wilds feels like a logical step forward for the Monster Hunter series. While the core gameplay remains the same, Capcom's efforts to streamline all of its surrounding systems and structure could make for one of the most compelling Monster Hunter games to date.
