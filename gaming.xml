					<p>I thought Dragonflight was the absolute peak of modern-day World of Warcraft, but I didn't think it could be topped. At first, I didn't have much hope for <a href="https://thewarwithin.blizzard.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The War Within</a> when diving into it. However, the action started immediately, and my interest was immediately piqued. While World of Warcraft has had some questionable choices in villains (looking at The Jailer from Shadowlands), Xal'atath feels multi-faceted and genuinely evil compared to other villains that have popped up over the years.</p>
<p>The Warbands feature was one of the best features added in this new expansion. You could choose up to four characters in a Warband, regardless of race, class, or faction. By having those four in the Warband, you could transfer supplies between them, including currencies, appearances, Renown levels, and achievements! With the Warbands feature came the feature of learning a transmog appearance, regardless of whether you could equip that type of armor or weapon, making the potential to get great transmogs even easier.</p>
<p>Admittedly, this feature did break the Guild bank, with my guild, in particular, losing a ridiculous amount of supplies and materials. Many mounts were in there for players to get if they didn't already own them. There is no update on whether Blizzard will resolve that, and neither my guild nor I am hopeful about this situation.</p>
<p>What surprised me most about getting stuck into World of Warcraft: The War Within was how Alliance tailored it felt. Although I play as a Blood Elf Arcane Mage, I immediately noticed that the main characters I interacted with were all Alliance except for Thrall, who is part of the Alliance, and Horde. I went into this expansion without knowing anything about it other than that it centered more heavily around the Void, which I was incredibly excited about. Since Void Elves were introduced in World of Warcraft: Legion, I have loved everything to do with the Void and was excited to see it come back to life in a <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-launch-qa-on-dungeons-raids-and-art/">new expansion</a>.</p>
<p>While the action started brilliantly, I was shocked to see it take such a turn and for them to kill off a main character so soon into the expansion. I'd barely done five quests before seeing the cutscene, and it still feels like a questionable choice. Whether it was done to get rid of a powerful character or to get back at Alleria is something that I'm still figuring out.</p>
<p>The new areas we are introduced to in The War Within are stunning. Khaz Algar and the surrounding areas are incredibly tranquil and feel like something out of Middle Earth. Pair that with the accompanying music, and completing side quests or working on your professions is very peaceful. I usually spend a lot of time completing the surrounding side quests and grinding reputations, and I found the daily quests and world quests enjoyable, as well as some of the mount and pet farms available.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-6.png"></a></figure>

<p>Compared to previous expansions, I was thoroughly impressed with how well the expansion seemed optimized from the outset. During all the last expansion releases I've experienced, servers have been packed, or immense lag has made it difficult to get anything done. This time, the expansion seems to be running like a well-oiled machine, with barely any hiccups along the way.</p>
<p>My main gripe with The War Within is now from an update Blizzard pushed a couple of days ago, making the enemies more challenging to deal with overall. I could initially take care of a pack of five basic enemies alone, but I had to heal and use all defensive cooldowns to deal with just one. Even Delves have become pretty much impossible, even at the lower levels. Regardless of whether you set Brann Bronzebeard up to be in a healer role or a DPS role, his attacks and abilities aren't of much use to you at all.</p>
<p>I find that he's of more value as a damage dealer. Although he drops potions in the healer role, it feels as if the potions don't actually provide any healing whatsoever, and now Delves will only be possible if you are overgeared, which won't be able to happen for a while yet.</p>
<p>Once I get some new gear for my Arcane Mage and max out my Hero Talents, I'll enjoy the challenge of Delves again without dying before completing the first mission. I enjoy being a glass cannon class as my rotation is simple and fun, and I hope I don't have to swap to my Paladin just to be able to progress and complete the Delves entirely.</p>
<p>Compared to some previous expansions, the story for World of Warcraft: The War Within is very well thought out. It's been fantastic to see characters such as Alleria again, bringing hidden characters back into the limelight after not being seen for multiple expansions.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-8.png"></a></figure>

<p>Each area throughout Khaz Algar felt unique, with their features that made them stand out from each other. For example, Dornogal is very peaceful, and you can have a great time while leveling professions there. In contrast, the atmosphere in Hallowfall is very different, with far more tension than the other areas in the expansion.</p>
<p>Thus far, I've found the dungeons to be a little bit samey. They remind me of multiple expansions in the past, specifically Warlords of Draenor and Cataclysm. The dungeons feel inspired by other dungeons from previous expansions, with Priory of the Sacred Flame reminiscent of a dungeon from Shadowlands.</p>
<p>Although there is now the addition of collecting Skyriding Glyphs in the latest expansion, despite collecting a massive amount of them, it seems bizarre to me that the point of these Skyriding Glyphs is to provide the players with a new mount. They served a purpose in Dragonflight, as they offered your Dragon abilities during flight. I like that they were reincorporated into this new expansion, but I feel that it could have been built upon rather than just being used to provide players with a new mount grind.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing what the first season of this expansion brings and seeing my Arcane Mage become more powerful with some better gear, especially with the addition of Hero Talents, which have revolutionized my gameplay as an Arcane Mage. Nothing is quite as cool as summoning your own Arcane Phoenix (even if it can sometimes be a bit temperamental.)</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-7.png"></a></figure>

<p>As someone who has always played the weakest spec of Mage in World of Warcraft, it's been fantastic seeing the Arcane Mage thrive and finally have a spot on the DPS charts. This has been boosted substantially by the Hero Talents, which, as stated above, can give you awesome abilities like summoning an Arcane Phoenix when using Arcane Surge. Depending on what stats you spec into, your Arcane Phoenix can even help with interrupts, utilizing its own Spellsteal.</p>
<p>Interacting with the Earthens and getting to know Magni and his family has been a highlight of the expansion. I wasn't expecting Magni ever to be freed from the curse set upon him by Azeroth, and it was a complete shock to the system to see him as a normal Dwarf rather than one made of stone.</p>
<p>Overall, World of Warcraft: The War Within has been a delight to experience, from fun and rewarding mount grinds to surprisingly adorable pets (looking at you, Oop'lajax), as well as some genuinely heartbreaking quests that you get to experience in the main story campaign. Admittedly, I ignored the main campaign for quite a while and decided to do many of the side quests and Skyriding Glyph collecting, but even then, I had fun at every interval. I can't wait to sink even more hours into World of Warcraft: The War Within and I look forward to seeing what comes next in future updates.</p>

<p>The expansion was so close to perfect. If it wasn't for the update that Blizzard released where they went from undertuning everything to overtuning it, the expansion would have been perfection. The quests are fun, Hero Talents provide lots of cool options, and the music really makes the areas of Khaz Algar magical and threatening, all at the same time. Admittedly, the story for this expansion could have done with being a little longer, as it felt quite short overall compared to previous expansions. However, there is still time for them to add more in future patches.</p>

            <p>Paradox are integrating four of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/europa-universalis-iv">Europa Universalis IV</a>'s DLCs into the base game. The Rights Of Man, Art Of War, Digital Extreme Upgrade and Common Sense DLCs will be free to all current and future players of the eleven-year-old grand strategy game from October 17th onwards. 
</p>
<p>On the same date, Paradox are also introducing a new Starter Edition of the game and lowering the price of the its Ultimate Bundle DLC collection.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We are happy to announce the integration of FOUR essential DLCs into the Europa Universalis IV base game: 'Rights of Man', 'Art of War', 'Digital Extreme Upgrade' and 'Common Sense'. That’s right - all current and future EUIV players will receive these four DLCs absolutely free of charge! And you won’t even need to do anything to receive them," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/236850/view/4599951478208420913">the announcement</a>.
</p>
<p>Three of the above DLC - Digital Extreme Upgrade, Art Of War and Rights Of Man - are already a part of the current Starter Edition, which typically costs £7 more than the base game itself. Common Sense - which, my parents will tell you, I don't possess - would typically be an extra £12.79 on top.
</p>
<p>Upgrading the base edition with these extras is great for those who don't already own them, and less so for those who paid money for them in the past several years. Paradox are positioning the new Starter Edition and lowered Ultimate Bundle cost as a "special treat" for those players, although that seems less than convincing. The Ultimate Bundle typically costs £313.56, by the way - albeit minus the cost of any included DLC you already own.
</p>
<p>From now until September 9th, the base game of EUIV is 76% off <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/236850/Europa_Universalis_IV/">over on Steam</a>, making it £8.39/$10. That'll grant you access to the four DLCs when they unlock for everyone October 17th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Not only is he a former WWE superstar, but he’s a world-renowned talent who has his name in the annals of U.S. wrestling history with WWE and then-competitors WCW and New Japan Pro Wrestling. In many ways, Jericho’s involvement with AEW legitimized it as a new avenue for wayward WWE veterans and new talent alike. Unfortunately, however, most if not all of Jericho’s booking has hampered new talent rather than helping them flourish.<br></p><p>Traditionally, wrestlers enter a feud with another talent that can last upwards of a month with a big payoff at a pay-per-view where the victor—typically a good guy—graduates into a bigger feud with someone who has a championship or is issued a rematch with their villainous competitor. This structure allows companies to build new stars by having them overcome feuds with industry veterans or promising new talent. However, Jericho’s feuds—unaffectionately dubbed the “Jericho vortex” by fans—have had the opposite effect. Jericho’s booking only benefits himself while keeping younger talent like Konosuke Takeshita, Ricky Starks, Darby Allin, and Hook caught in his nebulous orbit until he’s done with them.<br></p><p>AEW’s “Jericho Vortex” phenomenon started to take shape when fans noticed that the Canadian wrestler’s feuds with younger talent felt more like Jericho clinging to their coattails for relevancy. As an AEW fan, knowing your favorite wrestler was entering a program with Jericho meant you wouldn’t see them do anything worth watching until the Jericho Vortex was done sucking up all their star power. Things have gotten so bad that fans began <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ItsGresh/status/1826703038561878283?t=-kZkwCARz0YwtN8kF-ANzw&amp;s=19&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ItsGresh/status/1826703038561878283?t=-kZkwCARz0YwtN8kF-ANzw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">memeing the phenomenon on X/Twitter</a></span> with videos of migrating WWE superstars interrupted by Jericho’s theme music—signaling that they, too, will be stuck in his vortex.<br></p><p>While the Jericho Vortex isn’t as all-encompassing and toxic as Hulk Hogan’s disastrous late-stage TNA run, it has garnered its fair share of groans from AEW audiences whenever they see a promising young talent enter a deadlock feud with the 53-year-old wrestler. Four months ago, fans voiced their growing frustration with Jericho by chanting “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/TheEnemiesPE3/status/1790911976681398700?t=iqkZzl5xCrS0pY7AZ41cow&amp;s=19&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/TheEnemiesPE3/status/1790911976681398700?t=iqkZzl5xCrS0pY7AZ41cow&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Please retire</a></span>!” at him during AEW’s Dynasty pay-per-view.</p><p>Instead of retiring, Jericho did what he usually does: create an on-screen character with a new gimmick. Only this time around, instead of backing off of the antics that got him bad heat in the first place, Jericho leaned fully into the Jericho Vortex meme with his new bad guy persona, “The Learning Tree.”<br></p><p>With this new gimmick, Jericho takes up precious TV time every other week in a talk show segment called “TV Time with Jericho,” a glorified promo segment where Jericho and his lackeys glaze him up while standing next to cardboard cutouts of trees. During these segments, he refers to the Jericho Vortex by name, claiming it’s a mutually beneficial feud for his opponents. In theory, Jericho’s newfound gimmick is meant to give fans a scripted reason to boo him by utilizing their frustrations with how his booking tends to overshadow younger talent. But in practice, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PhilDL616/status/1830967096567832668&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PhilDL616/status/1830967096567832668" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fans absolutely hate it</a></span>. Jericho’s Learning Tree bit makes everything worse because it excuses how terrible his booking continues to be by retroactively folding it into his character arc.<br></p><p>Moreover, Jericho’s character—a fake-smiling “I’ve got the company’s best interest at heart” do-gooder is already cribbing off of The Young Bucks’ <em>Succession</em>-inspired EVP gimmick. A gimmick, mind you, that is also inspired by real-life heat the pair garnered during the whole CM Punk kerfuffle.<br></p><p><br>While this would typically be the part of the wrassling dissertation where a solution would be offered, there isn’t one here short of Jericho leaving the ring to go do something else. He’s a problem that would benefit AEW if he just went away. Whether he takes time off from AEW to appear on <em>The Masked Singer</em> again, or to go on tour with his butt rock band, Fozzy, or to take a vacation with his wife who may or may not have been “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Maffewgregg/status/1735392018719703194&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Maffewgregg/status/1735392018719703194" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">breaking the walls down” on January 6</a></span>, fans need him off TV so they can finally breathe a sigh of relief, knowing his music won’t hit their ears the moment their favorite wrestlers are on AEW.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’m not talking about its story, though you will see some dark turns before your journey in Fa’diel ends. Instead I mean that underneath the bright and casual facade of <em>Visions of Mana</em> lies a deceptively deep RPG. I was amazed at how immersed I was in the game’s class system and team building, and I didn’t expect I’d spend so much time just exploring and uncovering secrets.<br></p><p>That said, to get the most out of <em>Visions of Mana</em>, you do have to kind of play by its rules. For example, if you don’t engage with the game’s RPG systems and try to brute force every battle with your action game sensibilities, you’re straight-up going to have a bad time. To get right to the crunchy center of what makes this trip to the Mana Tree so good, check out these ten tips that will make your journey sing.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4d446d884e73c37291bc2fedeb3fb44d" data-recommend-id="image://4d446d884e73c37291bc2fedeb3fb44d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A piece of shadow art depicting a hero holding a sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A piece of shadow art depicting a hero holding a sword." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4d446d884e73c37291bc2fedeb3fb44d" data-recommend-id="image://4d446d884e73c37291bc2fedeb3fb44d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A piece of shadow art depicting a hero holding a sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you’ve followed <em>Visions of Mana</em> at all, you probably know that it’s the fifth mainline entry in Square Enix’s <em>Mana</em> series (also known as <em>Seiken Densetsu</em>). Fortunately, you won’t miss anything by skipping right to <em>Visions of Mana</em>. Each game in the series typically takes place in its own world, so you aren’t missing any context that would help you understand this one better.<br></p><p>The main point of confusion is that, much like how <em>Legend of Zelda</em> take place across different iterations of Hyrule, <em>Mana</em> games all feature different incarnations of the same world of Fa’Diel. Bosses, locations, and characters will reappear in each game, but they have no connection to their appearances in past games. Similarly, “Sacrifice” tends to be a recurring theme in <em>Mana</em> games, which might make the premise of <em>Visions of Mana</em> make more sense as you’re starting out.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7e81d9ffe9a65c9a9b107f000cf73b38" data-recommend-id="image://7e81d9ffe9a65c9a9b107f000cf73b38" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Our hero swishes a sword with all sorts of fancy effects." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Our hero swishes a sword with all sorts of fancy effects." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7e81d9ffe9a65c9a9b107f000cf73b38" data-recommend-id="image://7e81d9ffe9a65c9a9b107f000cf73b38" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Our hero swishes a sword with all sorts of fancy effects." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The 2020 remake of <em>Trials of Mana</em> is an infamously easy game. It’s not a total cakewalk, but you definitely need to play it on Hard mode to experience any friction in the combat. By comparison, <em>Visions of Mana</em> is more balanced. Hard mode actually feels tough, so you may prefer Normal mode after coming off of a <em>Trials of Mana</em> playthrough.</p><p>Fortunately, difficulty settings can be changed at any time, so you can decide to dial up or down the challenge as you progress.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e53206ae37f4932edfa8545a19ac8713" data-recommend-id="image://e53206ae37f4932edfa8545a19ac8713" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Three heroes pose after a battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Three heroes pose after a battle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e53206ae37f4932edfa8545a19ac8713" data-recommend-id="image://e53206ae37f4932edfa8545a19ac8713" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Three heroes pose after a battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Having said all that, I really recommend a Hard mode playthrough for anyone who wants to have a crunchy RPG experience. It doesn’t feel great in the early game, since enemies inflict major damage and can soak a ton of hits before they’re defeated. At the same time, Hard mode really forces you to optimize your defenses and offenses equally. You know, the kind of stuff that RPG fans enjoy strategizing around. Once you get into some of the game’s deadly DPS builds, those enemy lifebars aren’t going to feel big at all.</p><p>This is how I experienced <em>Visions of Mana</em>, and I recommend it for anyone else who wants to dive into everything that the game’s class system offers.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="dd1ca82865320a12fba3dc77cc7d61c6" data-recommend-id="image://dd1ca82865320a12fba3dc77cc7d61c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The map showing the continents." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The map showing the continents." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dd1ca82865320a12fba3dc77cc7d61c6" data-recommend-id="image://dd1ca82865320a12fba3dc77cc7d61c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The map showing the continents." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At the end of chapter 1, you’ll eventually board a boat in Rhata Harbor to continue the main story.

Some of these are part of larger side quest chains, such as Niccolo’s requests or the woman who asks you to find locations depicted in paintings. Otherwise, most quests exist as an excuse for you to grind. These won’t affect your playthrough if they remain unfinished.</p><p>You can see what a side quest will award you right in the Side Quests tab of your main menu. Quests that give equipment or ability seeds are worth prioritizing, but you can typically save quests that only give money for later. If you’re not in the mood to kill five monsters or find a trinket in a field, don’t force yourself.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="518ca4125df75377b19bd86b550d4d8c" data-recommend-id="image://518ca4125df75377b19bd86b550d4d8c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="It's...an empty courtyard?

However, a fledgling level one Val will <em>not</em> have the ability to 100 percent complete each area he sees. Some chests are hidden inside ruins that house endgame monsters. Others require Elemental Vessels that you don’t have yet. Either way, you’ll need to return later to collect every reward.</p><p>As a fun tip, <em>Visions of Mana</em> will always add new markers on old maps showing you where you can use new Elemental Vessels. There’s no need to take notes if you encounter something you can’t interact with!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3cb99fea0737c2f249ce0a9f1e9abdfa" data-recommend-id="image://3cb99fea0737c2f249ce0a9f1e9abdfa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Elemental madness as fire rips through everything." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Elemental madness as fire rips through everything." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3cb99fea0737c2f249ce0a9f1e9abdfa" data-recommend-id="image://3cb99fea0737c2f249ce0a9f1e9abdfa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Elemental madness as fire rips through everything." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Elemental Aeries are optional battle arenas that you’ll find all throughout your journey. These typically make you fight two waves of powerful enemies, and you’ll only have a couple minutes to pull it off. Fortunately, most character’s class strike skills are <em>very</em> good at totally clearing entire groups of enemies, so these challenges will feel way easier if you begin with a fully charged gauge. The timer won’t even run as the flashy animation plays!</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="36eea9eaa3b9333cc240c216c1f38506" data-recommend-id="image://36eea9eaa3b9333cc240c216c1f38506" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Moves UI." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Moves UI." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="36eea9eaa3b9333cc240c216c1f38506" data-recommend-id="image://36eea9eaa3b9333cc240c216c1f38506" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Moves UI." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>You will unlock a lot of character classes in <em>Visions of Mana</em>. To upgrade them, you’ll need to advance the Elemental Plots found in your main menu. Each character only has so many points to invest in each track found here, so you unfortunately can’t invest in every skill you see.</p><p>That said, even if you don’t use a certain class, any spells or moves learned via Elemental Plots <em>will</em> stick with the character no matter how they’re built. This means characters like Val can natively equip almost every elemental imbuement in the game, while Careena can use debuffs even if you’re using her as a Monk. Characters can only bring so many spells into battle, though, so make sure you set their ring menus after unlocking skills!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c7381dfd463d6b7b6fdf89bcdbbd68db" data-recommend-id="image://c7381dfd463d6b7b6fdf89bcdbbd68db" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A party of four face off against a beastie." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A party of four face off against a beastie." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c7381dfd463d6b7b6fdf89bcdbbd68db" data-recommend-id="image://c7381dfd463d6b7b6fdf89bcdbbd68db" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A party of four face off against a beastie." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As deep as the class system is in <em>Visions of Mana</em>, it does have some limitations. You can’t respec your characters until very late in the game, and the way you approach boss battles will differ from the way you approach Elemental Aeries. Fortunately, you’ll unlock five characters before your journey ends, and building all of them will let you adapt to different situations as you encounter them. For example, you can build Palamena to inflict massive damage on bosses, while Careena can specialize in Class Strike damage that absolutely destroys huge waves of common enemies.</p><p>All characters earn equal EXP, even if you don’t use them in battle. Specialize all your characters in a way that compliments the team—you’ll be happy to have those extra options on standby as you progress.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f5051e718683681f62a6a0ed0c0b14a2" data-recommend-id="image://f5051e718683681f62a6a0ed0c0b14a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Visions of Mana intro screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Visions of Mana intro screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f5051e718683681f62a6a0ed0c0b14a2" data-recommend-id="image://f5051e718683681f62a6a0ed0c0b14a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Visions of Mana intro screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I weally would have wiked this fweature in Twials of Mana<br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>'s October release looming, BioWare is starting to discuss the finer details of its latest fantasy RPG. And its newest deep-dive provides a look at how progression will work for protagonist Rook and the companions they'll meet along the way.
</p>
<p>
Rook's progression systems won't, it has to be said, be much of a surprise to anyone that's had even the faintest brush with a video game in the last decade. Players do stuff, earn XP, gain a new Skill Point each level, then spend them to unlock new abilities on a skill tree.
</p>
<p>
BioWare's <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/combat-and-progression">latest blog post</a> does, however, go a little deeper into the minutiae of things - explaining, for instance, that the biggest experience boost comes from completing quests, although there's still XP to be earn from combat and exploration. Of more interest, though, are the particulars of Dragon Age: The Veilguard's skill tree.
</p>

<p>
Different nodes come in different shapes, and those shapes reflect the type of unlockable it contains. Large circles, for instance, denote core Class skills and weapon proficiencies, while diamonds indicate an unlockable ability that can be placed in your hero's abilities slot. Medium circles, meanwhile, feature major passive or ability upgrades - which add effects and modifiers to existing Abilities or stats - and then we're onto the slightly less impactful stuff.
</p>
<p>
Small hexagons contain traits that modify existing Class skills, while small circles unlock minor boosts to Abilities, Passive, or stats. And if you don't like your choices, Skill Points can be refunded at any time, with no penalty cost.
</p>
<p>
It's not just skills that can be upgraded, however; weapons, armour, and accessories all have their own stats and properties, and equipment can be upgraded and enchanted to unlock additional effects at the Caretaker's Workshop. A single enchantment can be applied to each item and ability, and more enchantments unlock each time the workshop is upgraded. And for fashionable types, armour transmogrification and appearance-only armour is available.
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
What's more, all the above works works in conjunction with Dragon Age: The Veilguard's <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/combat-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard">faction-themed specialisations areas</a>, each featuring unique combat abilities and Ultimate abilities. All Classes - that is, warriors, rogues, and mages - have access to three specialisation areas, and these, BioWare notes, are available to all Rooks, regardless of their chosen faction.
</p>
<p>
As for Rook's companions, each has their own skill tree, and every level they reach unlocks two Skill Points. Companions gain experience fastest through specific quests deepening their relationship with Rook, but experience is also earned through unique conversations and decisions, with bonds and quests coming in both romantic and platonic flavours.
</p>
<p>
Two companions can accompany Rook on a mission, and each has their own gear, which can also be managed, upgraded, and enhanced as players see fit. Additionally, companions have their own Primer and Detonator abilities, the Detonator triggering - and causing increased damage and stagger - if the correct combination of abilities are used. By way of example, BioWare explains Rook can use Toxic Dash to prime a target with the Sundered status, which can then be donated using Neve's Icebreaker ability. 
</p>
<p>
BioWare's blog post contains a couple of videos showing character and companion progression in a little more detail if you're curious, although it does warn some of these may contain "minor spoilers". And if your enthusiasm is piqued, Dragon Age: The Veilguard releases for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 31st October.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-painstaking-process-of-adding-rideable-horses-to-fallout-new-vegas.972228/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/fallout-new-vegas-horse-mod-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> does not contain horses, but it <em>feels </em>like it should. The now 14-year-old game’s whole vibe is <a href="https://medium.com/@thelegendarytai/fallout-new-vegas-the-wild-west-through-and-through-d30bb7cff1fc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exceedingly Wild West</a>, and yet there’s nary a four-legged steed to be seen. The reason for this is simple: In <em>Fallout </em>canon, horses are <a href="https://falloutfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Horse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largely extinct</a>. But that hasn’t stopped one modder, Xїlandro Axeuora, from <a href="https://twitter.com/Xilandro/status/1826434205238043045" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying to add them</a>. Slowing him down, however, are his own expectations, born of other games that came out long after <em>New Vegas</em> made its mark.&nbsp;</p><p>Axeuora, who lives in Ukraine, is working alongside two other modders to complete his vision, which is informed foremost by <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, a game with horses so detailed that their <a href="https://kotaku.com/two-hours-with-the-amazingly-detailed-red-dead-redempti-1829187487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">testicles shrink and expand</a> based on the in-game temperature.&nbsp;</p><p>"In my head I constantly compare what Rockstar developers created – animations aside, of course; I don't have a horse and a mocap studio – and what I'm making,” Axeuora, who says this mod has cost him his “sanity,” told Aftermath. “So I keep rewriting code over and over again, looking for that 'OK, this feels close enough' moment."</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Xilandro/status/1826434205238043045" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What he has right now</a> already looks remarkably smooth, like it time traveled back from a more recent game to save <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> from its grim, horseless future. But Axeuora still isn’t satisfied.</p><p>“As for replicating, [I’m doing] whatever I can,” he said. “But most importantly (and most difficult): the overall feel of natural horse movement [from <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>] without sacrificing responsiveness of controls. Not ‘realistic,’ just natural. It's a living, breathing creature. It can't move and turn like an arcadey tank.”&nbsp;</p><p>Some have suggested that Axeuora and his collaborators are simply porting over the horses from Bethesda stablemate<em> The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em>. Axeuora urges those people to go <a href="https://twitter.com/Xilandro/status/1827360809590071349" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">watch a video</a> of that game’s herky-jerky excuses for equines to see how they stack up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Axeuora has been working on the project for “a couple months,” but he’s been trying to wrap his brain around player movement in<em> New Vegas </em>– specifically via cars – since early this year. It’s been a fraught process, one ridden with burnout.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"Horses were so similar [to other player movement mods] underneath that I ended up doing rather similar work, with the same issues popping up as well. And it quickly nuked the last remains of my motivation," he said. "Some days I just blast nonstop, and then [I] procrastinate for a week or something."&nbsp;</p><p>But Axeuora is gonna get this horse over the finish line, come hell or high water.</p><p>“I've been modding <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> since 2012,” he said. “This isn't my first rodeo (pun totally intended). No breaks until horses are done, though. If I drop them now, I'm not coming back to them ever again.”</p><p>He’s not quite sure when they’ll be done. Could be one month, could be the end of the year. As with a real horse, there are many moving parts involved: Axeuora’s mental state, his pending “aha!” moment where horse movement is concerned, and the availability of other modders.&nbsp;</p><p>He joked grimly about one more possible impediment.&nbsp;</p><p>"I also might very well get killed at any moment by a Russian missile strike,” Axeuora said, “which will make releasing horses a bit difficult.”</p><p>Which kind of puts everything in perspective. That in mind, Axeuora and his horse mod <em>absolutely </em>will not be cowed by a vocal segment of <em>Fallout </em>fans who’ve chosen to question the project: lore purists.</p><p>"We mod <em>Fallout </em>games because we love them, and that includes canon,” he said. “Practically speaking, there's nothing that stops us from giving every NPC in <em>New Vegas</em> a vegetation-based STD, with fungus growing out of their lower parts, or making hordes of giant man-eating battle brahmin swarm Mojave Wasteland. ... Anything we make, no matter how big or small, how lore-breaking or strictly dogmatic, is just that: [a] modification. Optional user-created content. It won't suddenly become part of the canon, and mods' existence can be ignored altogether. We can only speculate why some people are so overly concerned about what mods do. But they really shouldn't be."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-delayed-again-features-removed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The development of Football Manager 25 has hit yet another snag. Developer Sports Interactive studio manager <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/development-update-football-manager-25-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Miles Jacobson has announced</a> that Football Manager 25’s release is being delayed from early November to late November.</p>



<p>“Firstly, we’ve had to shift the official announcement of FM25 to the end of September,” he said. “The gameplay focus period will follow soon thereafter. Our target launch date has moved accordingly and is now scheduled for late November, rather than our usual early November slot.”</p>



<p>In addition to the game’s reveal and launch delay, Jacobson announced that a couple features were being removed from the game. </p>



<p>International Management is being removed from the game on PC, Console, and FM 25 Touch. The reasoning given is that after looking at where it was at this point in development, it was decided that what was going to release wouldn’t reach the company’s “initial quality threshold”.</p>



<p>“We also considered the available game data,” Jacobson said. “Only 5.6% of all FM24 PC saves have used the mode, which we feel validates our view that we need to do much, much better with the experience. That number is even smaller on Console.”</p>



<p>He did say that it will remain available in Football Manager 25 Mobile due to it being built with a different codebase.</p>



<p>“For all other versions, international management will return in a much more feature-rich way to FM26, FM26 Console and FM26 Touch in what will be an exciting year for international football with the World Cup expanding to 48 teams,” he said. </p>



<p>The other removed feature isn’t a major one, but a removal nonetheless. Player weights will no longer be visible within profiles across the game.</p>



<p>Jacobson says that the introduction of Women’s soccer to the game is the leading factor in the decision. </p>



<p>“Through the creation of our Women’s Football database, we discovered that while the weight of male athletes can change a bit month to month, women’s body types are very different from men’s and their weight fluctuates a lot more, often weekly,” he said.</p>



<p>“This perspective encouraged us to review the wider game, much like we have with all other areas, and we’ve ultimately decided to no longer show weight for any players in FM25. A very basic measurement will still be included under the hood, but it won’t be visible on the front end anymore.”</p>



<p>The reason for the multiple delays and feature removals stem from the game’s transition over to the Unity Engine. The series had been built on the studio’s own internal Sports Interactive Operating System (SIOS).</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Nintendo has apparently provided a fresh new timeline for The Legend of Zelda series, one that famously <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-complete-legend-of-zelda-timeline-explained/1100-6513317/" data-ref-id="1100-6513317">splits off into three different branches after Ocarina of Time</a>. We now have an idea of where the most recent entries--Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom--fit into the franchise's chronology. Spoilers: They don't, instead being placed into their own little timeline.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.vooks.net/new-zelda-timeline-places-breath-of-the-wild-tears-of-the-kingdom-seperate-from-older-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Vooks</a> spotted the new Legend of Zelda timeline <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/au/nintendo-live-2024-sydney/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at Nintendo Live</a> over this past weekend in Sydney, Australia. The image--seen below--was shared <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1829703963794624594" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on X</a> by Wario64, showing Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom separated from the official chronology that begins with Skyward Sword.</p><p dir="ltr">Previously, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-timeline-revised-to-include-breath-of-the-wi/1100-6460970/" data-ref-id="1100-6460970">there was a thought that Breath of the Wild brought the three branches back together</a> and corralled them into a new single sequence as the "last" game. However, this new graphic appears to rule that out. This would mean the timeline has become even more confusing, putting it on par <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-evolution-of-michael-myers-throughout-the-halloween-movies/2900-4917/" data-ref-id="2900-4917">with the Halloween movies</a>. However, <a href="https://zelda.nintendo.com/about/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the North American website for the Zelda franchise</a> has not updated with any placement for Breath of the Wild or Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p dir="ltr">It's always sort of seemed like Zelda fans cared a lot more about the timeline than Nintendo ever has. In fact, an official Zelda timeline wasn't even publicly available until the Hyrule Historia book arrived in the early 2010s, decades after the video game franchise was born on NES.</p><p dir="ltr">Keep in mind the updated timeline doesn't even touch on where the upcoming Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom might land. GameSpot just got a recent hands-on with the Switch exclusive and notes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-plays-like-a-mini-tears-of-the-kingdom/1100-6526268/" data-ref-id="1100-6526268">it plays like a mini Tears of the Kingdom</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-progression-systems-get-fully-detailed-by-bioware/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As part of the launch preparations, BioWare has <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/combat-and-progression?isLocalized=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a new blog post and video dedicated to the progression systems within Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>
<p>The info dump begins with confirming the level cap, which the developers have set at 50. While experience points can be obtained by killing enemies and exploring the world, players will find it far easier to level up by completing quests, especially the bigger ones.</p>
<p>With each level, players will be granted a Skill Point to spend in the so-called Constellation Tree. There are many options to choose from, as detailed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Large circle: Class (core skills and weapon proficiencies)</li>
<li>Diamond: Ability (can be assigned to an Ability slot)</li>
<li>Medium circle: Major Passive or Ability Upgrade (adds effects or modifies existing Abilities or stats, like guaranteeing a critical hit on knockdown or extending range)</li>
<li>Small hexagon: Trait (modifies existing class skill, like counter-attack, extending an attack combo or missile block/return)</li>
<li>Small circle: Minor Passive or Stat Boost (increases the efficacy of Abilities, Passive, or stats)</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<p>Very importantly, Skill Points can be refunded for the entire Skill Tree or individually at any time and for free, allowing Dragon Age: The Veilguard players a high degree of experimentation throughout their entire playthroughs.</p>
<p>As you would expect, given the type of game, there will be a variety of equipment to loot or purchase, including weapons, armor, and accessories. Each item will have its own unique stats and attributes. As weapons and armor evolve, duplicate items will allow you to increase stats and unlock additional features. Players can further upgrade and enchant the items through the Caretaker's Workshop in the Lighthouse hub. There will be a list of basic enchantments at first, but each time Rook upgrades the rank of the Caretaker's Workshop, more enchantments will become available. Each item or ability can have a single enchantment applied to it, and each enchantment can only be applied to a single item or ability at a time.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Upon creating their 'Rook' character, players will align with a faction. The chosen Faction will affect the initial appearance of the Rook, especially when dressed in casual clothing. However, all visible armor can be transmogrified' into anything else that has been collected via the wardrobe in the Lighthouse.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Progression Deep Dive | Parts 1-3" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wvr3OV8kYcM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Last but not least, Dragon Age: The Veilguard also allows the progression of Rook's companions, who are getting two Skill Points for each level. Ways to get experience for your companions include completing their personal quests as well as dialogues and decisions made with them.</p>
<p>Players may take two companions on missions. Each companion has its own gear to manage, which can also be upgraded and enchanted in the aforementioned Caretaker's Workshop. Companions also have Primers and Detonators, which can be combined with each other or with the Rook in combat. Each Primer has a matching Detonator. When the correct combination is used, a detonation is triggered - dealing increased damage over an area and increasing the stagger. For example, as seen in the video, Rook can use Toxic Dash to detonate the Sundered target, and Neve can detonate it with her Icebreaker ability.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard will be released on <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-to-launch-on-october-31/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">October 31</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

<p><em>Misfits &amp; Magic </em>season two sees the return of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a77a65bf-2dda-4081-be3d-d54808255109" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/aabria-iyengar-discusses-burrows-end-finale-dice-telling-story-and-what-happens">Aabria Iyengar</a> as the DM of this season of Kids on Brooms, a magic based expansion for Kids on Bikes.</p>
<p>Joining Aabria will be <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="55a80c6c-ea7c-4151-9523-d332db6f6cd5" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/how-brennan-lee-mulligan-created-never-stop-blowing-up-love-letter-to-80s">Brennan Lee Mulligan as Evan Kelmp</a>, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b6ff64e2-0570-485e-860b-402771d3faf6" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/we-chat-dimension-20-burrows-end-generational-trauma-and-environmental">Erika Ishii </a>as K, Danielle Radford as Sam Blask, and Lou Wilson as Whitney Jammer. All of the cast from the original season is reprising their roles as we get to catch up with the magical misfits three years after the events of the first season.</p>

<p>While not much has been officially revealed about this new season the ever-present theme of the winds of change has many members of the magical world spooked.</p>
<p>Throughout the trailer we get hints of the story among the characters reuniting, hints as to what each character might have been up to since we last spoke with them.</p>
<p>"Three years since the events that we last left off with. You're just at that age where you're exiting the traditional understanding of childhood and you're deciding who you want to be... and death is on the table"</p>
<p>A few interesting props in the dome were also shown off. Bicycle handles put into the dome for each player, a very clear reference to <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, a diorama of a solar system in the center of the table that we will see moving, and an animated tablet that will talk to the players.</p>
<p>Season Two of <em>Misfits &amp; Magic</em> will release on September 25th of Dropout.tv. There will be 11 episodes in total putting the finale episode on December 4th.</p>

            <p>Back in July, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> reached version 5.0 with the Worlds update, which refreshed its planetary generation to introduce more variety alongside more detailed water, clouds, and weather. We didn't write about it at the time, because I suppose re-writing the very fabric of the galaxy seemed small-time.
</p>
<p>Today's new update, however, adds fishing, and I can't not write about that.
</p>

Here's the trailer:

<p>The update is called Aquarius, and it makes use of the Worlds update's fancy new oceans with their pulsing, reflective surfaces by allowing you to cast a line into them. There's a wide range of different underwater life to find, from "common minnow-like fish to huge alien marine mammals", according <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/09/aquarius-update/">to the announcement</a>. You'll need to find different bodies of water on different planets to collect them all.
</p>
<p>To help matters, there's a new "Exo-Skiff" which can be deployed, and is basically a hovering, customisable fishing platform. It's got a built-in fridge for storing your catches within. Or you can build your own automated fish farm, whcih will gather fish for you while you're elsewhere, killing some other kind of flora or fauna. However you collect your fish, you can cook 'em for dinner if you wish.
</p>
<p>I'm genuinely fond of fishing in games, particularly in those games like Zelda or Kirby where the fishing is far aside from the much more dramatic adventure I'm meant to be having. No Man's Sky's system seems to have a lot of charming detail, too, including the ability to catch "messages in bottles" left by other players. Cute.
</p>
<p>Aquarius is out now and free to all players. No Man's Sky is also currently 60% off <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/">over on Steam</a> as part of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-space-exploration-fest-kicks-off-deals-and-demos-on-september-2nd">Steam Space Exploration Fest</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

When these are shot, they’ll explode and damage whoever is around, including yourself. This is something you’ll want to use, especially when the game throws large waves of enemies your way. This will help ensure you effectively limit their numbers.</p><h2 id="h14181"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t be afraid to charge into a fight</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="b52c4813cc011989d3f32fa6eed0a952" data-recommend-id="image://b52c4813cc011989d3f32fa6eed0a952" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Charging into a fight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Charging into a fight." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b52c4813cc011989d3f32fa6eed0a952" data-recommend-id="image://b52c4813cc011989d3f32fa6eed0a952" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Charging into a fight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Half the fun of being a Space Marine is being able to rip and tear your enemies apart.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-says-apple-makes-it-impossible-to-monetize-cloud-gaming/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Microsoft continues to not be happy with Apple. In a <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66d6d0d19084b18b95709f13/Microsoft_WP_6_Redacted_version_-_TO_BE_PUBLISHED__1_.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new statement</a> surrounding the CMA (Competition and Markets Authority) investigation into the cloud gaming market, Microsoft says that Apple is making it “impossible to effectively monetize” its cloud gaming offering.</p>



<p>According to Microsoft, Apple’s commission fee is “neither economically sustainable nor justifiable”. </p>



<p>“The 30% commission fee makes it impossible for Microsoft to effectively monetize its cloud gaming service offering,” the company says. </p>



<p>Microsoft continues by calling out Apple’s requirement for services to make content, features, and subscriptions available for in-app purchases within the app. They say that it would require third-part developers needing to make major changes to their games to comply with the requirement, thus limiting potential competition.</p>



<p>“Beyond that, from a practical perspective, CGSPs have no way to ensure that third-party game developers recode their games to comply with this requirement,” they said. “As a result, the restriction effectively precludes CGSPs from offering third-party developed games.”</p>



<p>Lastly, Microsoft <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#business" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">calls issue with Guideline 3.1.1</a> from Apple which says that app developers can’t link to outside sources to purchase subscriptions. </p>



<p>“Apps in this section cannot, within the app, encourage users to use a purchasing method other than in-app purchase, except as set forth in 3.1.3(a),” Apple’s guidelines read. For the record, Guideline 3.1.3(a) allows exceptions for “reader” apps such as magazines, newspapers, etc..</p>



<p>Apple has not responded to the latest statement from Microsoft. In August, however, the company said that developers aren’t having many issues with the IAP requirement.”</p>



<p>A provisional decision from the CMA is expected to come in November. All parties have until the end of September to respond to the investigation.</p>

                <p>Winter is coming in Frostpunk 2, and if the last game was any indication, it's going to be brutal and result in a whole lot of deaths--possibly everyone in your settlement, if your city management isn't up to snuff. The sequel to the intense survival city builder, which imagines the last of humanity surviving a post-apocalyptic ice age world, is set to release on September 20.

The sequel expands on all the elements of the original Frostpunk, giving you larger cities to manage and a lot more humans to deal with. The idea is that, where nature was your biggest enemy in the original Frostpunk, your primary adversary in the sequel is human nature. There's an expanded, multi-chapter story to work through, and you'll have to contend with a city council, more factions, and bigger districts, with a story that sees you building and expanding over the course of months rather than days.</p><p>In addition to the standard edition of Frostpunk 2, Fanatical also offers the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Ffrostpunk-2-deluxe-edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffrostpunk-2-releases-this-month-heres-how-to-save-30-on-your-preorder%2F1100-6526218%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Frostpunk 2: Deluxe Edition</a> on PC, which comes with more content and a few additional benefits. Nabbing the deluxe edition gets you Frostpunk 2's three post-release DLC add-ons, which you'd normally have to buy separately, as well as a digital art book and soundtrack. It also comes with an in-game item and a novella, Warm Flesh, which is part of a Frostpunk story anthology. In addition to the stuff you get, preordering the deluxe edition gets you access to Frostpunk 2's story mode on September 17, three days prior to the official launch.</p><p>You can preorder Frostpunk 2: Deluxe Edition at Fanatical for an even larger 30% discount, bringing the cost down to $52.49 from its usual price of $75. Steam is selling this edition for $67.49 ahead of launch, so you'll get a much better deal by preordering your Steam key from Fanatical instead.</p><p>Fanatical also has a bunch of other preorder deals for upcoming games.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred Mercenary Companions | Gamescom 2024</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Diablo 4's Vessel of Hatred expansion might finally give players the keys to the cow kingdom. As spotted by the dataminers over at <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/diablo-4/news/new-cow-level-hints-in-diablo-4-patch-2-0-ptr-346356" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, several curious items have been found in the test build for the game's 2.0 update, which will be released alongside Vessel of Hatred in October.</p><p dir="ltr">One of those items, the Rusted Bardiche, will look familiar to those who have experienced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-798">Diablo 2's</a> secret cow level, as it is the weapon wielded by the bi-pedal cow enemies found there. In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-25658">Diablo 3</a>, transmuting the Bovine Bardiche item in Kanai's Cube granted access to Diablo 3's cow level, the "Not the Cow Level."</p><p dir="ltr">That's not the only datamined item that may lead to a secret level. Four others--the Unusual Key, the Rusted Old Bell, the Jabbering Gemstone, and the Crooked Staff--have also been datamined. These items (excluding the key) seem like fairly obvious references to Diablo 3's Wirt's Bell, Staff of Herding, and Gibbering Gemstone, which when used together opened a portal to Whimsyshire, aka the "pony" level.</p><p dir="ltr">Just because all these items have been datamined, however, doesn't mean players know where to actually find them in-game just yet, or the steps that might be required to put all the pieces together to finally gain access to the cow level, Whimsyshire, or something entirely new. Judging from past secrets in Diablo 4, finding the cow level will still require some serious sleuthing and experimentation on the part of players.</p><p dir="ltr">The last major <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-secret-cow-level-mystery-just-had-a-major-breakthrough/1100-6518576/" data-ref-id="1100-6518576">cow-level breakthrough</a> came in October 2023, when a player collected a trio of secret items, killed exactly 666 cows, and cleansed the items at the mysterious ox statues in the city of Ked Bardu, all to acquire a Strange Key that unlocked a previously inaccessible area. That location, the Forlorn Hovel, housed a group of cows that when killed, dropped a Stamina Potion--a nod to Diablo 2's Cow King. Consuming the potion grants a buff that has no obvious effect, and so the hunt for the cow level has continued.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4's 2.0 update will bring huge changes to the ARPG on October 8, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-completely-changing-how-it-handles-difficulty-taking-a-page-from-diablo-3/1100-6526194/" data-ref-id="1100-6526194">complete re-work of the game's difficulty system</a> and a reorganization of its endgame. That will be in addition to all the new features coming as part of the Vessel of Hatred expansion on that same day, which includes the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-hours-with-diablo-4-vessel-of-hatreds-spiritborn-reveals-a-diablo-class-unlike-any-other/1100-6525108/" data-ref-id="1100-6525108">new Spiritborn class</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-getting-diablo-2-style-runewords-so-you-can-make-your-own-spells/1100-6526197/" data-ref-id="1100-6526197">Diablo 2-style Runewords</a>, Mercenary companions, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-getting-a-huge-first-of-its-kind-dungeon-filled-with-exclusive-rewards/1100-6526026/" data-ref-id="1100-6526026">"first-of-its-kind" endgame dungeon</a>.</p>

Now, three years on, the game will finally be released on Xbox, as announced in August 2024. The game will be released on Xbox Series X|S on November 20, 2024.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/hoyoverse-gave-us-some-details-on-how-genshin-impact-will-work-with-xbox-game-pass-as-well-as-xbox-cloud-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussion with Windows Central</a>, HoYoVerse spoke about the deal with Xbox and the fact that Genshin Impact will have special in-game bundles on day one for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, as well as bundles available to subscribers in subsequent version updates. While Genshin Impact is coming to Xbox, it's been officially confirmed that it won't be coming to Xbox One, but it will be available to those on Xbox One by using Xbox Cloud Gaming. However, to play Genshin Impact through the Xbox Cloud Gaming, players will need an active Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription to access it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Genshin Impact - ONL | gamescom 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pazRlb7gn5Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While most online games require you to have Xbox Game Pass Core (Xbox Live Gold), this game won't. This is because it's already a free-to-play game, which would make it a dangerous path to tread if they were to monetize the social aspects of the game. This was confirmed by a HoYoVerse representative after the Xbox website incorrectly cited that those wanting to participate in multiplayer gameplay in Genshin Impact would need Xbox Game Pass Core.</p>
<p>At the moment, it remains unknown what sort of bundles players can expect from seeing Genshin Impact on Xbox, specifically for those using it via Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. It could be anything from Banner Pulls to Primogems or other basic consumables, but for now, it remains to be seen or revealed by HoYoVerse.</p>
<p>HoYoVerse has gone on to make many different gacha games, but Genshin Impact continues to be one of their most popular. Last year saw the release of Honkai: Star Rail, with this year seeing the release of Zenless Zone Zero, which is the most stark difference to Honkai: Star Rail and Genshin Impact, which have some crossovers and similarities in features.</p>
<p>With how popular Genshin Impact is, it continues to receive frequent updates, adding new areas and storylines for players to explore. The developers also continue to add new characters for people to love (or hate) and save up their Primogems to pull for them on their banners.</p>
<p>Whether the other HoYoVerse games will follow suit after Genshin Impact makes its way to Xbox Series X|S remains to be seen. The developers will probably discuss this once the statistics about the game's performance on the new platform come out.</p>

            <p>Nikhil Murthy's Syphilisation is a "postcolonial 4X game", which might sound like a contradiction in terms. While approaches to 4X and grand <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> vary hugely between games, factions and players, the genre as a whole is firmly wedded to imperial conquest, both structurally and at the level of narrative aspects and set-dressing. Many 4X games are triumphal re-enactments of specific periods of colonial settlement and expansion. All of which is to say that Syphilisation is fascinating. It's a reworking of the genre which dismantles and reconstructs concepts such as diplomacy, research and production. It's also just left early access - find more details and a playthrough video below.</p><!--more-->

<p>Some quick notes on the title. In attaching his own name, I suspect Murthy is gently sending up Sid Meier and other creators who've built themselves up into global brands. "Syphilisation", meanwhile, is a pun which Murthy originally took from <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/the-rise-and-fall-of-western-syphilisation-an-irishman-s-diary-about-a-once-dreaded-disease-1.3101963">James Joyce's novel Ulysses</a> - it references a sexually transmitted disease whose spread is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3956094/">entangled</a> with the formation and expansion of empires.</p>
<p>One of Syphilisation's most gripping devices is that it's a conversation with itself. Rather than making you the leader of a faction or nation, it casts you as a student participating in a group report on Gandhi, Churchill, the Raj and the Indian Independence Movement during the 19th and 20th century. From afar, it looks a lot like other games in the genre, with units moving across a tile-based map featuring settlements and resources, but the group report premise makes room for disagreement about these fundamentals and the events depicted. The other students are all distinct characters with their own backgrounds, and as Murthy quips on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1712530/Nikhil_Murthys_Syphilisation/">the Steam page</a>, "the politics of nations are just the politics of student groups writ large".</p>
<p>While it's possible to pay Syphilisation selfishly, covetously and aggressively, building empathy is a goal and a site of intense design exploration. "In particular, I try to show that the ideas of winner-take-all and growth-for-the-sake-of-growth that underpin most of the genre have viable alternatives," Murthy adds. In practical terms, this includes experimenting with nonviolent conflict resolution, "non-deterministic" tech trees and cooperative win conditions. Research is partly a question of deciding how to interpret figures such as Winston Churchill, rather than simply exposing a codex entry with a new technology attached.</p>
<p>Murthy has also looked at "history from below", and how the game's 'subjects' might have their own agency. "The citizens of your empire have many requests of their own and will often just handle them by themselves rather than wait for you to get around to them. They will research new technologies, complete buildings and units and simply deal with their issues by themselves. You can make yourself more popular by getting there first, but Syphilisation understands that leaders need the people and not the other way around."</p>
<p>I spoke to Murthy together with former Civilization developer Jon Shafer and Paradox's Ryan Sumo about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/can-you-make-an-anti-imperial-empire-game">the idea of an "anti-imperial empire game"</a> last year. It remains one of the most enlightening interviews I've ever done, mostly because I kept my mouth shut while the three of them talked about things like visualising map space and the concept of progress.</p>
<p>I've not played much of Syphilisation as yet - I'm still getting my head around it, partly thanks to the ambition on show, and partly because the presentation is a bit dense and overwhelming (as was the case with the developer's previous, similarly imaginative <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-quiet-sleep">The Quiet Sleep</a>). One thing I'm currently pondering is whether the bits I find obfuscatory are deliberate rejections of the omniscience other imperial simulations offer. If you're eyeing up the 1.0 release and would like to have a try yourself, there's still a demo on Steam at the time of publication.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It is a sad day to learn of some of the heinous acts committed by people who were, at one point, highly regarded within the esports space. The former UK League of Legends coach, <strong>Lorcan ‘Lorcz’ Elliott</strong>, has officially been sentenced on child sex offenses, putting the man in prison for four years and eight months.</p>



<p>The news, which broke at Esports News UK, came earlier today (September 4, 2024), as the former LoL coach was officially sentenced.</p>



<hr>







<p>The former League of Legends coach has pleaded guilty to 22 different sex offenses regarding children. The man was found guilty of inciting children to engage in sexual activity, taking indecent photos of children, distributing indecent photos of children and attempting to have sexual conversations with children.</p>



<p>Elliot has now been barred from working in any industry with children in the future and has been officially placed on a sex offender list. The former coach had originally been sentenced to seven years in prison, but his sentence was reduced due to no prior convictions.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Elliot had also sent sexual photographs and videos of himself to underage children.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-lorcan-elliot-charged-on-22-accounts-of-child-sex-offenses">Lorcan Elliot Charged On 22 Accounts Of Child Sex Offenses</h2>



<p>Lorcan Elliot was a notable name in the UK League of Legends scene just a few years ago, as the man worked as an esports coach on several different teams. Some of these teams included Nuclear Storm, London Esports and Giants.</p>



<p>The man had also spent plenty of hours representing the University of Cambridge in NSE national university League of Legends esports tournaments.</p>



<p>It is incredibly disheartening that someone could fly so low under the radar, with many peers in the industry having no idea of the malicious and disgusting intent someone holds. </p>



<p>Hopefully, no one ever has to fall victim to Elliot’s behavior ever again. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warhammer-40-000-space-marine-2-review.972105/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I was halfway through the opening level of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2’s campaign, unloading bolt rifle rounds alongside my two squadmates, when I found myself smiling at just how good it feels to be back in this futuristic grimdark fray. It’s been over a decade since the original, but Space Marine 2 reinvigorates the squad-based shooter series with seeming ease. The environments are varied and breathtaking, the running-and-gunning feels great, and the sense of comradeship while fighting with your team, be they bots or friends, can be exhilarating. It may not break much new ground in its genre, but it didn’t need to for me to have a blast playing through its dozen-hour campaign.</p><p>Let’s get this out of the way early: The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/09/09/warhammer-40k-space-marine-review">original Space Marine</a> clearly took inspiration from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/11/07/gears-of-war-review-2">Gears of War</a>, and this sequel follows suit. It’s a squad-based shooter starring heavily armored dudes who growl their dialog while either shooting guns or revving Chainswords to ward off invading aliens. The similarities don’t bother me a bit (especially when one could make the case that Gears borrowed from Warhammer first). It’s been years since I’ve played a game that scratched that particular itch, and Space Marine 2 uses the rich lore of Warhammer 40k to carve out its own identity. That’s true in both the meaty campaign that can be played solo or co-op, as well as two additional modes that let you upgrade your weapons and customize your armor between rounds, which are meant to keep you coming back after the credits roll.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The campaign drops you back into the considerable boots of Demetrian Titus, the hero of the first installment. It picks up over a hundred years later, and does a good job of explaining everything you need to know, whether you played the original or not. Despite the century-long gap, not much has changed for our dour hero since we last saw him. He’s still a gravelly-voiced, seasoned soldier who doesn’t appear to have aged at all thanks to his genetically-engineered longevity. He’s spent the last century serving in the Space Marines’ Deathwatch chapter, which goes on the most dangerous of missions. After an intense opening level that has you deploying a “Virus Bomb,” you’re rewarded for your bravery and dedication by being brought back into the fold as a blue-armored Ultramarine.</p><p>The story is more than serviceable, and it moves at a fast clip, sending your squad to interesting locations across several planets. It has a few twists and turns that bring it to surprising places, and there’s even some intriguing inter-squad conflict to spice things up. That said, the whole thing is pretty one-note: it’s all very serious. I get that there’s a war going on and lives are on the line, but just a dash of humor – even the gallows humor many other 40k games use – would have added a welcome extra dimension.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Enemies have enough variety that I rarely got bored of blasting them.</p></div><p>You're accompanied on your missions by two squadmates who are bots by default, but you can invite friends to take their place. The bots are serviceable comrades, capable of doing their part to fend off enemies and revive you when you fall in battle. But as with most games like this, it’s more fun to play with friends, which you can coordinate from your home base, called the Battle Barge.</p><p>Gone are the Orks from the first Space Marine, and in their place is humanity’s latest intergalactic enemy: the Tyranids. These alien monstrosities come in many forms, from hulking Carnifex beasts to hordes of smaller creatures that look like xenomorphs or velociraptors. Some can fly, while others swarm across the ground, piling on top of each other to scale cliffs in order to attack you and the rest of the Imperial Guard’s forces. You’ll encounter other enemy types as you progress through the campaign as well, which provides enough variety that I rarely got bored of blasting them to the shreds with an array of Imperial and alien weaponry.</p><p>It’s a good thing the guns and melee weapons feel great to use, because that’s how you’ll spend the bulk of your time in Space Marine 2. You can customize your loadout between missions, picking a primary weapon, sidearm, and close-combat accessory to start out with. You also find plenty of weapon caches scattered throughout the levels, letting you swap in flamethrowers, plasma blasters, sniper rifles, power swords, and all manner of explosives, from sticky bombs to shock grenades that deploy an electric area-of-effect. There’s a weapon for every style of encounter – though you usually don’t know what’s ahead when you have to choose. Checkpoints are frequent, though, so if you get wiped you can make a more informed choice the next time.</p><p>Hitting an enemy with any of those weapons produces a satisfying splatter of blood. Larger enemies on the brink of death flash red, indicating you can execute them with a gruesome finishing move. Performing executions recharges your shields, which is helpful, and you can pick up Medicae Stimms to heal, or enable Titus’s Righteous Fury special ability, which boosts your health bar as you slice through enemies with your melee weapon. I always appreciate it when recovering health in a shooter is tied to putting the hurt on your enemies.</p><p>In fact, just moving around feels great in Space Marine 2. You’re a hulking, heavily armored soldier, and walking feels appropriately chunky – but your character is also more nimble than he was in the previous outing, so that weight is never aggravating. It feels just right.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Wherever you're deployed, the art design is uniformly stunning.</p></div><p>One of the main drawbacks of the original Space Marine was its drab brown-and-gray color palette – an ill-advised trend of the era it came out in. Thankfully, that’s gone in favor of much more colorful and lively environments in the sequel. Some levels have you tromping through alien worlds that are green and purple and lush with extra-terrestrial flora. Others are set in towering urban areas full of gothic buildings with stained-glass windows. Wherever your squad is deployed, the art design is uniformly stunning, gorgeous enough to justify leaving the previous generation of consoles behind. </p><p>Most areas are active war zones, with human soldiers fighting hordes of enemies both in the foreground and the background. Sometimes you’re following a tank through the ruins of a city, backing up squads of Astra Militarum soldiers. Other times you’ll see flying Tyranids swarm through the sky like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4f_1_r80RY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>murmuration of starlings</u></a> while platoons of soldiers blast projectiles at them. More than most military games, Space Marine 2 makes it feel like there really is a war going on, and you’re only one part of the effort. I’m usually not prone to taking screenshots, but here I found myself switching to photo mode in almost every level so I could capture the beauty.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The campaign is a fine enough chunk of game on its own, but that’s not all you get in Space Marine 2. In addition to Titus’s saga, you can play two other modes that aren’t so linear, each connected to the other: Operations and Eternal War.</p><p>Eternal War is a PvP mode, but unfortunately the pre-launch population was so low that I wasn’t able to test it out for this review – I’ll add an update later with my impressions. I was able to spend time with Operations, however, which lets you play side missions that are directly referenced in the main story but are carried out by other teams while Titus does his thing. </p><p>In both Operations and Eternal War, you get to choose from six classes of Space Marine, each with different loadout options and special abilities. There’s Tactical, which can use an Auspex Scan to highlight and weaken enemies; Sniper has a limited-use camo cloak; Bulwark plants a banner flag that restores the shields of any nearby squad mates; Vanguard has a grapnel launcher to pull himself into the action for close combat; Assault has the Jump Pack that Titus uses occasionally in the campaign; and Heavy get a bubble shield. All of the abilities are useful and fun to use in combat. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3>Chris’s Favorite Third-Person Shooters</h3></p></div><p>Playing these modes also earns you various currencies you can spend to upgrade your weapons and customize your armor with cosmetics, which turns out to be great fun. You can unlock a ton of neat emblems and charms for each piece of your armor, as well as new colors that represent the different Space Marine chapters. Pretty much all of the colors look cool as hell, and the ornament options let you adorn your dude with chains, skulls, and other details that wouldn’t be out of place on the cover of a heavy metal album.</p><p>The Operations levels themselves aren’t all that different from the ones in the campaign, even taking place in the same environments, which does make them a little bit less exciting. There are currently six missions, and while playing through them once was fun – especially with a team of co-op partners – I don’t really feel compelled to replay them, even to earn currency to upgrade my weapons and customize my armor. I’m still eager to try out the Eternal War PvP mode, as well as the additional modes promised in developer Saber Interactive’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-post-launch-roadmap-includes-new-maps-a-horde-mode-and-more"><u>post-launch roadmap</u></a>, but at least at launch the PvE offerings are more a brief but amusing distraction rather than a mode I’ll keep returning to. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
