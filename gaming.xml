            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="8c0db7dfabaf5"><a title="Game-Key Card" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8c0db7dfabaf5/game-key-card.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Game-Key Cards have been perhaps the hottest topic of the Switch 2's lifecycle so far. Outside of particularly large releases, the running theory is that many studios are turning to a Game-Key physical release because Nintendo has failed to offer small/cheap options for those who don't want to cough up for the big 64GB cartridges. But that might be about to change.</p>
<p>A rumour making the rounds online today states that Nintendo will soon introduce 16 and 32GB cartridge options, so smaller devs hoping to launch a physical release won't have to turn to Key Cards as the only financially viable way of making it happen.</p>
<p>That is according to both the game preservation community <a href="https://x.com/DoesItPlay1">Does It Play</a> and <a href="https://x.com/SoWhatAboutGame">Physical Paradise</a> on Twitter, the latter of which claims to have been informed of the introduction by two separate sources.</p>


<p><a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal" tabindex="-1">@Nintendeal</a> also claimed to have heard the same information, though it pointed out that increasing material costs and chip shortages mean there's no guarantee that more cart size options will directly affect pricing.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/ubisoft-employee-explains-why-star-wars-outlaws-is-a-game-key-card">Ubisoft employee Rob Bantin explained</a> that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> had launched on Switch 2 as a GKC, not because of a cost issue, but because the S2 carts "simply didn’t give the performance we needed at the quality target we were going for". To be clear, different cart <em>sizes</em> would do nothing to mend this issue, but they would provide an alternative for smaller games that are less reliant on speedy asset streaming.</p>
<p>Of course, it is nothing more than a rumour for the time being, so make sure to take things with a hefty pinch of salt.</p>
<p>Something that isn't rumoured, however, is the physical launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/r-type-dimensions-iii">R-Type Dimensions III</a>, which ININ Games has today announced will be arriving as a Game-Key Card since "switching entirely to cartridges would significantly raise manufacturing costs and increase the retail price by at least 15€".</p>
<p>"To avoid this, we chose to release the game on a key card while continuing to explore alternative solutions for the Special and Collector’s Edition," the publisher wrote in an explanation post on <a href="https://x.com/ININ_Games/status/2001279550135644222">Twitter</a>. "There is still hope for a real cartridge, and we are trying everything."</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether more cart sizes from Nintendo will actually impact the number of Game-Keys on the market, or whether studios will continue to stick firmly to the download option. We'll be keeping an eye out for more developments in this particular rumour, and will update you should we hear anything.</p>

            <p>As the second series of Amazon's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tv-shows/fallout">Fallout TV show</a> emerges from a hole in the ground with a cog-shaped door, Todd Howard has uttered the word Fallout and stuck a five after it. He's given a verbal thumbs up - or a reminder depending on how you look at it - to the idea of the events which play out in the TV show having an impact on the next mainline entry on the series, at least in terms of being a consideration in worldbuilding.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Asked by the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgr488vlmmo">Beeb's Newsbeat</a> whether the show will have an impact on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-5">Fallout 5</a>, cleanliness is next to Toddliness replied: "In short, yes." "Fallout 5 will be existing in a world where the stories and events of the show happened or are happening," he expanded. "We are taking that into account."</p>
<p>Based on the phrasing, I'd assume all he's likely talking about here is the need for the likes of terminal entries or other in-game lore whisperings which refer to places in the post-apocalyptic US that the show has touched to mirror what the adaptation says took place. For example, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-season-2-still-sounds-like-it-wont-commit-to-a-new-vegas-ending-but-for-the-love-of-all-thats-housely-i-hope-it-will">everyone's brains getting very foggy</a> following the second battle of Hoover Dam. Or, well, all that bollocks around <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesdas-todd-howard-clarifies-the-fate-of-shady-sands-in-the-fallout-tv-show-timeline">the NCR capital going boom</a>, which I honestly just thought was a rather unnecessary can of worms for the show to have opened.</p>
<p>Is any of that, or possible cheeky references to the likes of Lucy and The Ghoul, stuff I'm particularly bothered about the next single-player Fallout containing whenever it finally arrives? Not really, no. Then again, I've been clear in my view that I reckon the show'd likely benefit from its creators not having to dedicate so much time to debates involving the word canon. Is it nice to have all your things' worlds nicely slot together in a way that can serve the wider narrative by layering together a shared history - and also result in them being neatly corporately synergised? Yeah, it is, but at the same time, that wider lore building should ideally serve the key stories being told in the here and now of a game or show first and foremost, not the other way around.</p><p>With both the showrunners and the Todd having already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-season-3-will-be-filmed-next-summer-if-all-goes-plan-showrunners-as-its-showrunners-want-to-keep-their-big-iron-in-the-fire">kicked off chatter about a third series</a> prior to the latest one even going live, the Howard has also revealed - this time to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/fallout-season-3-scripts-fallout-76-game-tie-in-1236610167/">Variety</a> - that the two sides are already hard at work deciding how they can do Fallout game stuff to coincide with that next series.</p>
<p>"For us on the game and TV show side, we’re writing season three now," Fairly Todd Parents said. "We’re having those conversations now of, what are we doing in season three for the TV show and what elements can we bring into our games at that time when it comes out that don’t feel forced or fake." So, more crossover like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-76s-next-expansion-goes-all-in-on-fallout-tv-show-season-2-bringing-walton-goggins-and-new-vegas-feel-to-ohio">Gogginsy Burning Springs update</a> being lined up ahead of time, which to be fair is vastly superior to people having to shout en-masse 'Where be the new Fallouty bits now you've whetted my appetite?'</p>
<p>Fallout 5, as of writing, is still without a release date. One assumes that it'll drop around the year 453689386890290906789, a little bit after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-progressing-really-well-bethesda-shout-from-the-kitchen-as-they-baste-a-gta-shaped-turkey">The Elder Scrolls 6 arrives in 303689386890290906789</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-dlc-mega-dimension-special-scan-2000654217</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>There were two things I wanted most out of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-review-dlc-raichu-2000653106"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span>: </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246"><span>Mega Raichu</span></a><span> and the return of Latias to my party. The dragon/psychic monster has been a favorite of mine for over 20 years, and she’s been a mainstay of my team in every game she’s featured in. Latias is flying around the Hyperspace Lumiose City featured in </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>, but I still haven’t caught her yet. Why? </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>’s maddening grind makes catching her and several other Legendary monsters a game of chance, harkening back to some of the more frustrating capture mechanics of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s past that the series</span> <span>has mostly gotten away from.</span></p> <p><span>Latias, along with several other Legendary Pokémon who aren’t tied to the main plot, is gated behind a mechanic called Special Scans. These allow you to find rare pockets of </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>’s Hyperspace that include powerful trainers to battle, valuable loot, and, in some cases, Legendary monsters you won’t be able to find anywhere else. All of that is well and good, but the mere act of acquiring a Special Scan is already such a time sink that the randomization of what follows makes the whole process an almost insulting waste of your time.</span></p>

 <p><span>To get a Special Scan, you have to grind through </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>’s various mini-quests in Hyperspace. These are typically simple objectives like beating trainers in the Battle Zones, capturing a certain number of Pokémon, or finding loot in the mirrored city. Each of these gives you intel points to contribute to the scan, and it’ll take multiple runs through Hyperspace to reach the appropriate number.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The problem is that the results of Special Scans are randomized. You </span><i><span>might</span></i><span> find a Legendary Pokémon, but you may also find a battle zone full of powerful trainers that can’t give you anything beyond more intel points to do another Scan, or you could stumble into an area of Hyperspace filled with Pokémon you’ve already caught. Sometimes, if you’re lucky, you’ll find a repeat of one of the Rogue Mega Evolution boss fights, which remain one of the best parts of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, but if you’re trying to find the monsters you need to fill the Pokédex, even those feel like a barrier you can’t get around.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654219" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654219"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654219">© The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>There’s no way to game the system and manipulate these scans to lead you where you want to go, and even if they do take you to a Legendary Pokémon’s lair, there’s no guarantee that you’ll go back to Lumiose City with one in a Poké Ball. I’ve put more than 20 hours into </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span> and have only found two Legendary Pokémon through these methods, and neither of them was Latias. When I happened upon Virizion’s home after hours of grinding and acquiring one of these scans, I searched every square inch of the space for grass/fighting antelope, and couldn’t find it before the time limit ran out. These Special Scan portals close behind you after you leave, willingly or not, so I spent all that time grinding and battling through Special Scan areas with nothing of value in them to get to this point, all for nothing.</span></p>

 <p><span>Gating Legendary monsters behind chance is bad enough, but making it a lengthy grind to even roll the dice artificially inflates an already hefty expansion that relies on the grind to fill out the time between its better moments. If your sole value determination for a video game is how much time it takes up, </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>offers that with reckless abandon. If you want to feel like you’re accomplishing something rather than wasting your time, Special Scans are one of the most annoying things </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>has implemented in years.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In some of the earlier generations, certain Legendary Pokémon were roaming encounters you had to essentially track and follow throughout a region, hoping that you’d stumble upon them in a random battle. This mechanic was notoriously derided, and the series has largely moved away from it, but Special Scans feel like that design philosophy magnified in a way that kills momentum so thoroughly that I’m not sure if I’ll ever actually complete the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>Pokédex. I guess I can live with that, but I’m pretty fucking sad that my girl Latias is waiting for me in Hyperspace, and we might not get to reunite until another game.</span></p>

              <p>The chances are you’ll know developers Butterscotch Shenanigans from their&nbsp;<em>Crashlands</em> games—enormous open-world action games in which you fight, loot and craft your way to victory. However, if you’re an indie game developer, it’ll be their <em>Coffee with Butterscotch</em> podcast that’s most familiar, the long-running show dissecting everything indie for years. But today I draw your attention toward them for something far, far sillier:&nbsp;<em>How Many Dudes</em> is a forthcoming…I’m not sure there’s a genre title for this…game that asks, how many dudes does it take to kill 30 toddlers and a duck-sized horse? So yes, I spoke to them to see what on Earth is going on.</p> <p>Butterscotch Shenanigans was created by three brothers—Seth, Sam and Adam Coster—and was originally best known for fun, experimental and superbly animated mobile games, like <a href="https://www.bscotch.net/games/flop-rocket"><em>Flop Rocket</em></a>&nbsp;and <em><a href="https://www.bscotch.net/games/quadropus-rampage">Quadropus Rampage</a></em>. That is, until <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-game-i-make-before-i-die-fighting-cancer-by-m-1758326409">Sam Coster was diagnosed with stage 4b lymphoma</a>, and the three decided that was the moment to work on something bigger and more substantial. The result was <em>Crashlands</em>, and it proved successful enough, after creating platform game&nbsp;<em>and</em> engine&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/792710/Levelhead/"><em>Levelhead</em></a>, for the team to move on to <em>Crashlands 2</em>.</p>

 <p>With Sam in remission (and, I’m delighted to report, now officially cancer free!), that sequel was a four-and-a-half-year project, with another six months of updates and new content after launch, leaving the three siblings and their newer colleagues really ready to do something else. Something smaller. Something incredibly dumb. Thus <em>How Many Dudes</em>.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654200" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654200"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654200">© Butterscotch Shenanigans / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The game plays something like an auto-battler, in which you gather an ever-growing group of dudes who must fight teams of enemies of various bizarre natures. You begin the game with a single dude, tasked with fighting a group of 10 toddlers. Yup, right out of the gate. At this stage you’re essentially an observer, watching the battle play out before you, and you’ll either be relieved or horrified to learn you’ll definitely win. As a result you gain $100 to spend on items you can deploy during battles, and also get to select a new dude to add to your team. In that first choice you can pick between a Knight Dude or a Paladin Dude, and obviously each of the many, many dudes has their own stats and skills. From then on, it’s all about picking the right dudes, deploying the right skills at the correct moments, and trying to save enough money to buy revives for all who fall in battle.</p>

 <p>Having played an early build of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3934270/How_Many_Dudes/">the demo being released today</a>, I chatted with Seth Coster about why I’d just spent so long punching crowds of toddlers to death.</p> <p>“First of all, those toddlers are gonna be fine,” Coster assured me. “I have it on good authority that they’re happily munching on hay in a farm upstate.” So that’s a relief. But I still wondered how they got here. What process brings a creative team to an idea like this? “In the past, when starting a new game, we would start by asking what we wanted to play, and then we would try to bring that into the world. It has always worked for us in terms of quality—we’ve found that we can make whatever game we set ourselves on, and we can make it at a high level of polish and fun.”</p>

  <p>Despite this, and despite routinely high review scores, Butterscotch Shenanigans has found it tough to get much attention. “It has always been very difficult to get players, press and streamers to notice our games and talk about them,” says Seth. “And I don’t blame them; there are a trillion games out there!” As a result, the team decided to try a new approach this time. “What can people not stop talking about?” they asked themselves, eventually landing on the internet debate about “how many dudes it would take to beat up a gorilla.”</p>

 <p>“We didn’t even have an idea of what the game would be,” notes Seth, “we just wanted to make it about that. From there we iterated fast with no real roadmap or plan—we prototyped the game during the Game Maker’s Toolkit Jam, so there wasn’t really time to overthink it.”</p>

 <p>Five days later they’d created something that felt to them like a mix between <em>Balatro</em> and&nbsp;<em>TABS</em>, a “roguelike thing,” and people’s response to the jam entry was really positive. “We thought we might’ve just struck gold. Or at least copper.”</p> <p>As bizarre as it all sounds, from what I’ve played this appears to be true. While the first couple of rounds where you have little role might seem strange, it ramps up quickly as your decisions have more effect on the results. Which types of dudes you choose to recruit strongly changes your experience in any run, along with the upgrades and bonuses you pick, and with each battle lasting less than 30 seconds, it’s a quick and bloody process.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000654202" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654202"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654202">© Butterscotch Shenanigans / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>So how do you go about deciding the rules here? Who does the research to identify the correct amount of power and skill necessary to win in a fight with 30 duck-sized horses? “An anchor point in the game is the Regular Dude,” explains Seth Coster. He’s the one you start with, the average dude. “Everything in the game is orientated around him—how hard he can hit, and how many hits he can take. So when we’re designing a new enemy, we just ask, ‘Do we think this thing hits twice as hard as a Regular Dude? Five times as hard? TEN? And how many hits can it take compared to a Regular Dude?'”</p>

 <p>So yes, a horse “can probably take lot of punches.” (I hope my mum doesn’t read this article.) A horse-sized duck is the game’s first boss fight, for instance. “Weight classes exist for a reason, and horses are HUGE,” observes Seth. “Plus you gotta get past its flailing legs. Our sophisticated calculations have shown that a horse has 35 times the HP of a Regular Dude, which equates to about 70 seconds worth of regular punches.” Uh-huh. “Trust me, the math is sound.”</p> <p>I wondered, given the nature of that bar discussion topic of how many people it might take to fight a hundred worm-sized tigers and so on, whether the game might also pitch the enemies against one another to decide other natural questions. Who would win in a fight between a horse-sized duck and 100 toddlers? “The game isn’t about the answer,” says Seth very wisely, “it’s about the question. Because the answer to the question can only be, ‘It depends.’ The reason there’s ever a debate about ‘who could win in a fight’ is that the debate is actually about assumptions. How much prep time do the various parties have? If we’re talking about mythical creatures (like lion-sized ants), what kids of liberties are we taking with their capabilities?”</p>

 <p>He’s not done. “If we’re talking about Dudes versus a gorilla, what kinds of Dudes are we talking about? Olympic gymnasts? MMA fighters? Accountants? Marines? And do the Dudes have prep time, or are they just all thrown into the ring with the gorilla without warning?”</p> <p>I’m regretting the question.</p> <p>“The fun of the debate isn’t in having an answer, it’s about exploring all the possibilities. So that’s really what the game has ended up being about! We have LOTS of different types of Dudes in this game, each with their own unique capabilities and limitations. And then we throw them into the ring with a whole bunch of weird opponents to see what happens.”</p> <p>So <em>will</em> the game let the enemies fight, too? No, I’m not asking again. Moving on, I wondered what motivated this return to a smaller, sillier idea, after the success of the <em>Crashlands</em> games. Was it something Butterscotch had missed?</p>

  <p>“Certainly!” says Seth. “When you work on one thing for longer than it takes to get a college degree, you go a little crazy. But also, that one thing tends to take on an outsized importance. When you’re committing that many resources to something, you start to get in your own head about how everything has to be perfect. Especially if you’re trying to make a game that has a big story and lots of world-building.”</p> <p>But in this case? “<span><em>How Many Dudes </em>exists for one reason only: to be fun and stupid. It’s not trying to say anything important. It’s not trying to be anything other than what it is: a goofy game. So whenever we think of something that makes us chuckle, we just throw it in there. We don’t have to ask about the story implications, or whether it ‘fits’ with the world, or how it’s going to integrate into some larger vision for the game.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000654199" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654199"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654199">© Butterscotch Shenanigans</figcaption></figure> <p>Butterscotch Shenanigans has always been a very mobile-forward developer, but also one that charges a price for its games instead of littering them with ads and IAPs. Given just how dire things feel in mobile spaces for premium games, I wondered if this is still viable. “I’m not gonna lie…” says Coster. “It’s rough. Over the past nine years, our mobile revenue for new premium launches has declined by about 90 percent. I’m not sure whether others are experiencing the same thing, but that’s one data point for you. On the flipside, Google Play Pass and Apple Arcade do offer much clearer paths to success for a premium game—provided you can get into either of them.”</p> <p>This is why the company has shifted to cross-platform launches. “We plan to launch <em>How Many Dudes</em> on Steam, Google Play and the App Store,” says Seth, “and maybe Xbox if the Game Pass team reads this article and wants to give us a call…”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654203" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654203"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654203">© Butterscotch Shenanigans / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I highly recommend those&nbsp;<em>Crashlands</em> games, by the way. They feel perfect on a tablet, playable in short bursts, and come with hours and hours of stuff to do. And their daunting scale certainly does suggest a daunting amount of work. Do those games put pressure on the studio to have to match them, or even go bigger, spend more, raise ambitions ever-higher? “There are always expectations and demands,” says the Coster brother, “but that comes with the territory. Players will never stop asking for more sequels and more features and more updates, but that’s just them expressing that they love a thing and want more of it. In a weird way, those player demands don’t create pressure; they just create guidance on possible next steps.”</p> <p>The real pressure, says Coster, comes from within the team. Previous games have been about proving something to themselves, proving they’re capable of making long-lasting “hobby games” (<em>Levelhead</em>) or big and intricate games (<em>Crashlands 2</em>). “But in both cases, those were pressures we put on ourselves.&nbsp;<em>How Many Dudes</em>, on the other hand, feels pretty light by comparison. We’re not out to prove anything about our skills or capabilities. We’re just making something fun.”</p> <p><em>You can get <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3934270/How_Many_Dudes/">the&nbsp;How Many Dudes demo right now from Steam</a>, and go slaughter ducks and toddlers to your heart’s content.</em></p>

                <p dir="ltr">The conventional wisdom is that Kinect was an albatross on Xbox One, making the system more expensive at launch and taking away resource power. But now, over a decade later, the Kinect-like Nex Playground has outsold Xbox hardware for November in the US, according to Circana.</p><p dir="ltr">Nex Playground came in third for hardware units sold last month, outpacing Xbox Series X|S. The only saving grace is that Xbox raked in more dollar sales, as Nex Playground retails for $250 but has been on sale for $200 over the holiday season. Overall, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hardware-sales-in-the-us-just-had-worst-month-in-30-years/1100-6537041/">video game hardware sales were pretty bleak</a>, reaching a low not seen since November 1995.</p><p dir="ltr">This might not be a total shock for those paying attention. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-probably-wont-guess-what-just-outsold-every-ps5-and-xbox-console-model-in-the-us/1100-6536701/">Nex Playground actually outsold every PS5 and Xbox console bundle</a> for a week last month in the US. The cube-shaped console features a camera to track body movements, similar to Kinect. Five games are pre-installed, with the option to purchase <a href="https://www.nexplayground.com/play-pass" rel="nofollow ">a subscription Play Pass</a> for a larger library of games. It's $49 for three months or $89 for a year.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-physical-software-and-hardware-sales-just-had-the-worst-november-in-the-us-since-1995" rel="nofollow ">IGN</a>, Circana senior director Mat Piscatella noted that the Nex Playground has been a "remarkable story" recently. "There could be a lesson here that more affordable, family-friendly gaming devices carry appeal during holiday gifting season," Piscatella added.</p><p dir="ltr">On the software side, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7s-sales-struggles-come-into-focus/1100-6537040/">the best-selling game last month in the US</a>. However, the FPS faced a double-digit percentage decrease compared to 2024's Black Ops 6, and Battlefield 6 is the top-selling game for 2025 to date.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/17/carmageddon-rogue-shift-first-five-vehicles-have-been-detailed/</link>
            <guid>1386142</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Developer 34BigThings has posted a new blog giving details on five of the 17 vehicles that will be available in Carmageddon: Rogue Shift. Each of these five cars has different attributes changing how you can handle the track and the weapon load outs. With such varied styles for each one, there will be clear favourites depending on your own playstyle.</p>
<p><iframe title="Chop Shop - Eagle GT" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hxKie2O5ZoQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The first of the cars is the Eagle GT which is considered a good allrounder muscle car, with its best attribute being its handling. It also has armour and is heavier than most of the other vehicles in the game, making it useful for close melee encounters with others. The Eagle GT’s starting weapon is the machine gun which can be lethal against metal and flesh, but its effectiveness drops the further away you are from your target. The starting perk is Boost Refill which lets you start a race with a boost bottle, and refunds it if you get reset.</p>
<p><iframe title="Chop Shop - Clunker" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4d9jXu92N84?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The first unlockable vehicle in Carmageddon: Rogue Shift is the Clunker. The Clunker is one of the tankier options available where its durability and defense is very high, but this comes at the cost of speed so it will not win outright. Instead, players using The Clunker should be more focused on getting close to other players and taking them down by either bashing into them or using the shotgun. The Tank Return perk increases damage output the more you improve the Clunker’s defense.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Chop Shop - Firecracker" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZOJYzOm3olY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Firecracker Turbo is the care for players who value speed over all else. Acceleration is this vehicle’s top stat followed by speed, meaning players can dominate in a straight line but there is the risk of spinning out if control is not maintained. The Firecracker Turbo comes equipped with missiles to take out anyone who passes, while the Magic Number perk gives boost and ammo bonuses but only on every 7th use.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Chop Shop - SQR-NE55" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tmvm6PA_Obs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The SQR-NE55 is the most balanced vehicle of the bunch, an allrounder with no standout stats, with this being a car to choose once you are confident with game. While it has no standout stats, the SQR-NE55 does have a laser gun that can do heavy damage at all ranges. The vehicle comes with the Whale perk which gives upgrade discounts and free restocks so you can shape the SQR-NE55 into your own style.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Chop Shop - Hawk GT" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LsbBYSbkvTU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Hawk GT is a vehicle that as top speed, offense, and acceleration but at the sacrifice of handling, meaning all of that power under the hood is useless if you can’t keep it on the track. The Hawk GT is armed with a high-caliber shotgun which is slow to use but deals high damage to targets, and the vehicle also comes equipped with the Meat Shield perk which increases durability with every undead that is defeated.</p>
<p>A pre-registration event is taking place on the <a href="https://playcarmageddon.com/#unlock-rewards">Carmageddon: Rogue Shift&nbsp;</a>website, where players can unlock rewards for the game. Carmageddon: Rogue Shift is due to release in early 2026 for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch 2.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[With Significant GPU and CPU Performance Improvements, Unreal Engine 5.7 Is Another Step in the Right Direction]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/with-significant-gpu-and-cpu-performance-improvements-unreal-engine-5-7-is-another-step-in-the-right-direction/</link>
            <guid>1386136</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>While Unreal Engine 5's Lumen and Nanite redefined modern visuals, the engine makes more than a few gamers shudder in fear due to its heavy system requirements and its widely known <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-pc-performance-benchmarks/">performance and stuttering issues</a></strong>, which prevent many from enjoying games powered by the engine properly, especially on PC.</p>



<p>Since the engine's launch, however, Epic has attempted to mitigate these issues, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-7-out-now-with-nanite-foliage-and-megalights-powered-stunning-dynamic-shadow-casting-lights/"><strong>Unreal Engine 5.7</strong></a> seems to be yet another step in the right direction.</p>



<p>A new comparison video put together by MxBenchmarkPC highlights the performance improvements introduced in the latest version of the engine by running the Unreal Engine 5.4 and Unreal Engine 5.7 versions of the <a href="https://scansfactory.gumroad.com/l/DEMO-Venice"><strong>Photorealistic Venice Tech Demo created by Scans Factory</strong></a> running side-by-side.</p>



<p>In terms of performance on an RTX 5080 GPU, <em>"GPU performance is improved by up to 25% in UE 5.7 (depending on a scene), and the 5.7 version is now better utilizing GPU resources, hence the GPU power draw is now higher," </em>writes the YouTuber. </p>



<p>CPU performance on an Intel Core i7-14700F is significantly improved, up to 35%, which leads, according to MxBenchmarkPC, to <em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">"more stable frametimes with less hitches across all scenes."</em> This last improvement is particularly welcome, as the biggest issue in most games powered by Unreal Engine 5 is unstable frametimes that lead to a choppy and very unpleasant experience.</p>



<p>Unreal Engine 5.7 also brings some image quality improvements, as MxBenchmarkPC highlighted in their analysis. <em>"In terms of image quality, UE 5.7 offers more stable and accurate Lumen lighting, and especially higher quality Lumen reflections (with better performance at the same time)."</em> Unfortunately, Lumen denoising quality has only been improved slightly, so tech like NVIDIA DLSS Ray Reconstruction still does a better job than the engine's native solution.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Unreal Engine 5.7 vs Unreal Engine 5.4 Comparison - Significant Performance Improvement | RTX 5080" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S2Yi64DcooY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>While it will be a while to see games built to take advantage of the enhancements introduced in Unreal Engine 5.7, the fact that Epic continues to address some of the engine's most critical flaws is encouraging, and bodes well for the future. Hopefully, it won't take too long to finally see Unreal Engine 5 games running smoothly even on mid-range PC hardware.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Nacon has revealed that post-apocalyptic survival game <em>Terminator: Survivors </em>has been delayed beyond its initial 2025 release window, and that a key feature has been canceled as well.</p><p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2617340/view/624439505179377725" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">news post</a> on Steam, Nacon says <em>Terminator: Survivors</em>, which was originally due to launch in Early Access sometime this year (having <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/terminator-survivors-early-access-release" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="59cf7b33-22f3-452a-868e-dc0d1af2d92f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">already been delayed once</a>), "won't be launching in 2025", and that the studio doesn't have a new release date "locked in" yet either.</p><p>However, there is a small (potential) silver lining to this news; Nacon says that it's adjusting its release plans because it no longer wants to launch <em>Terminator: Survivors </em>in Early Access, so when the game does arrive, it'll be a "complete and polished experience", per the studio.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Terminator: Survivors </em>isn't coming out in 2025, unfortunately.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Additionally, Nacon says it's canning the co-op multiplayer aspect of <em>Terminator: Survivors</em>, having come to the conclusion that a single-player title would be better for delivering an "authentic <em>Terminator </em>experience".</p><p>Nacon says that although <em>Terminator: Survivors </em>won't be launching in 2025, the studio will be holding a number of closed playtests under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) "as the launch window gets closer". If you want to sign up for those tests, you can <a href="https://my.nacongaming.com/en-GB/playtests" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">do so here</a>.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with <em>Terminator: Survivors</em>, it is, as the name suggests, a survival game based on the <em>Terminator </em>series of movies (and ancillary media, of course).</p><p>Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/terminator-survivors-and-more-unveiled-at-nacon-connect" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dc6ce4d7-d291-4d5c-8751-0809354ad4e9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">revealed last year</a>, <em>Terminator: Survivors </em>takes place four years after Judgment Day, the event that devastated humanity and saw the machines rising up to rule the world. You'll need to battle Skynet's prototypes and help the Resistance claim a new future for mankind.</p>
<p>We no longer know exactly when to expect <em>Terminator: Survivors</em>, but if you want to keep up with Nacon's progress on the game, then you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2617340/Terminator_Survivors/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">wishlist it on PC via Steam right here</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Reports of <em>Call of Duty</em>'s demise are greatly exaggerated, at least if Circana's latest US gaming sales data roundup is to be believed; the latest game in the long-running shooter series still reigns supreme.</p><p>According to the firm's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6t4njxoc2w" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">ever-reliable Mat Piscatella</a>, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </em>still managed to top the all-format premium sales chart for November, beating out rivals like <em>Battlefield 6</em>, <em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, and <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>(all of which, admittedly, originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-october-best-selling-circana" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="15da8cce-653d-4fe6-aa54-3cae8b3a0758" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">launched in October</a>).</p><p><em>Battlefield 6 </em>is in second place for the month, with annual sports releases <em>NBA 2K26</em>, <em>Madden NFL 26</em>, and <em>EA Sports FC 26 </em>taking up third, fourth, and fifth place respectively. <em>Pokemon </em>and <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>are in sixth and seventh before another sports game, <em>EA Sports College Football 26</em>, snags eighth.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>EA Sports College Football 26 </em>is one of November's best-selling games in the US.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Rounding out the top ten for the month are <em>Minecraft</em>, which can always be seen pretty close to the top few places in the chart, and <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>.</p><p>Despite <em>Black Ops 7</em>'s strong performance in November's chart, it hasn't managed to topple <em>Battlefield 6 </em>in the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6t4pndwc2w" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">year-to-date</a> stakes; in fact, it's currently sitting at a rather measly seventh on that chart, having been beaten out by the likes of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>and <em>NBA 2K26</em>.</p><p>It's worth saying that <em>Black Ops 7 </em>is at something of a disadvantage here given that all of its rivals have had several months to rack up sales, but given that <em>Call of Duty </em>is usually a sales behemoth, this probably won't be particularly encouraging for Activision.</p><p>Indeed, the publisher recently revealed that back-to-back yearly releases of <em>Modern Warfare </em>and <em>Black Ops </em>games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-modern-warfare-activision" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1b6f0e4f-b66c-47da-8092-f3d497caf8fe" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">will end</a>, presumably paving the way for another sub-series to break up the repetition a little.</p>
<p>It's well worth taking a look at Piscatella's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6t4juhvs2w" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">full thread</a> for some more nerdy statistical breakdowns of how the gaming industry did sales-wise in November.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A listing for adventure game-slash-management sim <em>Dispatch </em>has been spotted on the Nintendo eShop, suggesting that the game may be coming to both Switch 2 and Switch next month.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/dispatch-coming-to-switch-2-switch-on-january-29-2026" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Gematsu</a>, an Australian eShop <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000105332" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">listing</a> for <em>Dispatch </em>appears to point to a release date of January 29th for the game on both of Nintendo's consoles. It'll have an install size of 13.6GB on both machines and will also offer a free Switch 2 upgrade path for original Switch owners.</p><p>It is, of course, possible that the January 29th date is a placeholder, but it's an oddly specific one if so, given that the date in question is only just over a month away. I'd say it's a safe bet AdHoc Studio's game will be arriving on Switch 2 and Switch soon.</p><figure role="group">

<p>If you're not familiar with <em>Dispatch</em>, it's an adventure game created by AdHoc Studio, a developer that boasts <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-telltale-employees-go-on-to-form-adhoc-studio" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ebf6f25a-7f8d-4c5f-bcf6-4525c284b84e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">several ex-Telltale staffers</a> among its ranks.</p><p>As you might expect from folks who worked on Telltale's games, <em>Dispatch </em>is primarily an episodic choice-based adventure in which you'll make a series of decisions that will impact the game's narrative as it progresses.</p><p>However, the game also features a management element in which you must serve as a dispatcher, sending heroes to tackle crimes across the city. The decisions you make during the narrative segments may also end up impacting what you can do while you're dispatching.</p><p>Released earlier this year, <em>Dispatch </em>managed to cross a million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dispatch-sales-1m-10-days" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fdb19357-4765-4684-bf2c-7f64112fcdbd" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">in just ten days</a>, going on to pass the two million mark <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dispatch-sales-2m" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">less than two weeks later</a>. It's safe to say there's a voracious appetite for this one.</p>
<p><em>Dispatch </em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/dispatch/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and if this report is correct, then it's due to launch on Switch 2 and Switch in January as well. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-sells-its-tv-soundbar-3-times-cheaper-than-direct-rivals-now-at-record-low-before-christmas-2000654172</link>
            <guid>1386112</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Soundbars don’t have to cost close to $1,000 like the Sonos Arc Ultra to make your TV’s sound much better, especially if your current TV speakers sound weak and thin. Amazon’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5862/">Fire TV Soundbar is currently on sale for $99, down from its regular price of $119</a> and this is the kind of aggressive pricing that Amazon uses for all of its hardware brands (including Ring, Blink, and eero). This 2.0 speaker system has two speakers that fit naturally under most TVs without taking over your entertainment center and it makes sound fuller, dialogue clearer, and bass deeper.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5862/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Virtual surround sound that is better than its price</h2>
<p><strong>DTS Virtual:X technology</strong> makes it possible to hear sound in three dimensions from just two speakers, instead of needing several satellite speakers placed around the room. The processing looks at audio signals and makes it seem like sound is coming from different directions and heights and makes movies, shows, and games more immersive without the cost and complexity of real surround systems. <strong>Dolby Audio suppor</strong>t makes this effect even better by keeping detail and dynamic range across all kinds of content, from quiet dialogue scenes to loud action scenes.</p>
<p>The included HDMI cable makes setup quick and easy because it connects directly to your TV’s HDMI eARC or ARC port. This one cable connection sends both audio and control signals, so the soundbar turns on when you turn on your TV and responds to volume changes from your TV remote. You don’t have to mess with optical cables, figure out how to use complicated menu settings, or set up universal remotes to make everything work well together.</p>



<p>The <strong>soundbar is 24 inches long and only 2.5 inches tall</strong> so it will fit comfortably on most TV stands and entertainment consoles without blocking your TV screen or infrared remote sensors. This small profile works best with TVs that are small to medium-sized, since a big soundbar would look out of place and take up too much space. You can put it right in front of your TV stand or mount it on the wall below your TV if you want a cleaner look.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth makes the soundbar more useful</strong> than just for TV audio: You can also stream music directly from your phone or tablet. You can play music from Spotify, Apple Music, or any other audio app on your device without having to turn on your TV or switch inputs. The wireless connection pairs quickly and stays stable over normal room distances, so you can control playback from your couch or even another room without losing sound.</p>



<p>If you have a Fire TV device, the integration works perfectly and lets <strong>you control both your TV and audio settings with just one remote</strong>. The soundbar automatically picks up Fire TV commands and changes the volume for different types of content and it works with smart TVs and any TV that is connected to streaming media players from other brands, like Roku, Apple TV, or Chromecast, even if you don’t use Fire TV devices.</p>
<p>You can get a big improvement in sound quality for $99 instead of $119, which is about the same price as a nice dinner out. You can find budget soundbars from generic brands in this price range, but they don’t have DTS Virtual:X processing, Dolby Audio support, or the ability to work with Fire TV like Amazon’s does.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Video Game Console Sales Just Flatlined Ahead Of The Holidays As Prices Soar]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-sales-inflation-economy-2000654196</link>
            <guid>1386109</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A new Nintendo console is on the market <a href="https://kotaku.com/light-up-the-town-cozy-christmas-holiday-lights-simulator-steam-demo-review-2000652213">this Christmas</a> for the first time in eight years, but that apparently wasn’t enough to juice overall hardware sales. According to the latest data, last month was the worst November for new video game hardware sales in the U.S. since 1995, the year the original PlayStation launched here.</p> <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social">Circana’s Mat Piscatella reports</a> that only 1.6 million new consoles were sold last month, including during Black Friday. That’s just a few hundred thousand more than the 1995 low of 1.4 million. Perhaps just as surprisingly, the Switch 2 wasn’t even the best-selling hardware in November. That honor went to the PS5, a console that’s five years old and ended up not benefiting from the expected <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-gta6-reaction-news-2000641817"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em></a> launch hype this year.</p>

 <p>Part of that no doubt came down to a discrepancy in Black Friday deals. Sony was aggressively discounting the all-digital PS5 by $100 while Nintendo actually got rid of its long-standing <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-black-firday-sales-2025-mario-zelda-2000642413"><em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> bundle</a> for the original Switch. The Switch 2 did end up getting some surprise discounts from retailers by <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-sale-cyber-monday-mario-kart-world-walmart-amazon-2000649232">Cyber Monday</a>, but that ended up falling on December 1 this year, so it doesn’t fall within this period.</p>   <p>Piscatella reports that the average price of a new console “reached an all-time November high of $439, up 11 percent compared to a year ago.” Back in November 2019 the average was just $235. That’s partly the impact from <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881">President Trump’s trade war</a> which led Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft to all implement multiple rounds of price increases in 2025. A new Xbox Series X, first released five years ago for $500, now costs $650 at Best Buy.</p>

 <p>Microsoft was also notable for being the only hardware manufacturer not to discount its consoles at all during the holiday season. It’s almost as if the company’s been trying <em>not</em> to sell new hardware, encouraging players instead to play its games in the cloud or on rival platforms. The Xbox ended up coming in third for the month, even as <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-activision-2000652111"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a> launched as November’s best-selling game (it will likely still remain behind <em>Battlefield 6</em> for the year, however).</p> <p>Is console gaming <a href="https://kotaku.com/donald-trump-administration-white-house-halo-gamestop-2000639566">just getting too expensive</a>? Is the floor <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/us-economy-flashes-warning-signs-new-data-analysts/story?id=128463726">secretly falling out</a> from under the U.S. economy? Why not both, Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6uq52s3c22">suggested</a>. “Correlation does not necessarily imply causation…unless it does,” he wrote when speculating about the drop-off in console sales. With Roblox free and <em>Fortnite</em> back on phones, it’s never been easier for parents to look at the $500 sticker price for a new system and say, “no thanks.”</p>

It's still years away from release, but now Bethesda boss Todd Howard has shared a small update about it.</p><p>He told the <a href="https://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgr488vlmmo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BBC</a> that Fallout 5 will be influenced in part by the popular Prime Video Fallout TV show. "In short, yes," he said. "Fallout 5 will be existing in a world where the stories and events of the show happened or are happening. We are taking that into account."</p><p>Fallout 76 has also been influenced by the TV series, and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-expansion-is-adding-the-ghoul-from-prime-videos-fallout-series/1100-6535155/" data-ref-id="1100-6535155">gets new content based on the show, including Walton Goggins' character, The Ghoul. </a>That game is free to play now through December 22, presumably to cash in on the debut of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-episode-release-date-schedule/1100-6536675/" data-ref-id="1100-6536675">Fallout Season 2.</a></p><p>Bethesda <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-is-coming-after-the-elder-scrolls-vi-confirms-todd-howard/1100-6504615/" data-ref-id="1100-6504615">first revealed Fallout 5 back in 2022</a>, saying it would be released after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>. There is no word yet on when that game will be released, so fans should get very comfortable for Fallout 5. It's not coming out anytime soon.</p><p>Earlier this month, Bethesda said Fallout was the franchise that the developer was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-is-the-franchise-that-bethesda-is-doing-the-most-in-right-now/1100-6536889/" data-ref-id="1100-6536889">"doing the most in."</a></p><p>"We've had a long-term plan for Fallout, and so I wish I could talk about all those today," Howard told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-chief-todd-howard-says-fallout-is-the-franchise-that-were-doing-the-most-in-right-now-coy-on-potential-return-to-new-vegas-or-a-fallout-3-remaster-while-fans-wait-for-fallout-5?utm_source=bluesky,threads,twitter" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "I'll just say this: It's the franchise that we're doing the most in right now."</p><p>In the BBC interview, Howard also discussed how he's happy that the Fallout TV show on Prime Video can help introduce more people to the world of Fallout.</p><p>"There's still so many people that won't play a game--I think that's getting better but there's still people who are intimidated," he said. "They still get to experience Fallout and I think that's really important because they're now equal fans of the world."</p><p>Beyond Fallout 5, it's rumored that Bethesda is working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-3-remaster-is-real-another-report-says/1100-6536093/" data-ref-id="1100-6536093">remaster of Fallout 3.</a></p><p>For more on the wider Fallout world, be sure to read <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-episode-1-kicked-off-with-a-bang-literally/1100-6537031/" data-ref-id="1100-6537031">GameSpot's breakdown of Fallout Season 2, Episode 1</a> and our rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-episode-1-easter-eggs-include-a-damn-fine-twin-peaks-reference/1100-6537032/" data-ref-id="1100-6537032">all the Easter eggs in Episode 1.</a></p>

            <link>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/17/video-game-hardware-and-physical-software-sales-this-year-had-the-worst-november-since</link>
            <guid>1386100</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Video game hardware and physical software sales just had the worst November since 1995 here in the U.S. That's according to the latest <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6t4juhvs2w">U.S. Video Game Market report</a> from industry analyst group Circana, with senior director Mat Piscatella revealing that 1.6 million units of hardware and a 14 percent spending decline in physical software led to the worst November in consumer video game spending since 1995.&nbsp;</p><p>It's important to note that Piscatella explicitly cites 1995 as the year this kind of tracking began. Monthly hardware spending dropped by 27 percent compared to 2024, down to $695 million, which Piscatella calls "the lowest video game hardware spending total for a November month since the $455 million reached during the November 2005 tracking period," in his <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6t4rms722w">highlights thread</a> on Bluesky. However, when you look at unit sales (rather than spending totals), the 1.6 million hardware units sold during November 2025 across all platforms is the lowest total for a November since 1995, when 1.4 million hardware units were sold. That's especially surprising considering Black Friday is in November, a popular consumer spending holiday in the U.S.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JJ8hBanNhWg"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JJ8hBanNhWg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>That said, the PlayStation 5 was November's best-selling hardware in both units sold and dollar sales, which is the first time this has occurred since the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 in June. Switch 2 ranked second in both categories last month.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of physical software sales, November spending fell 14 percent compared to last November, an all-time low for that month since tracking began in 1995, Piscatella says. However, video game content spending grew by 1 percent compared to a year ago, to $4.8 billion, with a 16 percent increase in subscription spending and 2 percent growth in mobile, which Piscatella says offsets declines in console and PC content spending.&nbsp;</p><p>Diving into the specifics of video game software, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> was still the best-selling game of last month, despite fans of the franchise calling it one of the weakest entries in years (<a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/10/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-release-back-to-back-modern-warfare-or-black-ops-games">something the devs behind the game recently acknowledged</a>). This marks the 18th consecutive year that a Call of Duty release is the best-selling game of its release month. This streak started with the November 2008 release of Call of Duty: World at War. However, Piscatella says the franchise experienced a "double-digit percentage full game dollar sales decline" when compared to November 2024.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HmyqN8nDcCQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HmyqN8nDcCQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Fortnite was the most-played game in November on PlayStation and Xbox consoles by monthly active users. However, on PC via Steam, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/arc-raiders/consequential-and-worthwhile-multiplayer">Arc Raiders</a> was the most-played game.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of accessories, which are categorized separately from platform consoles, spending fell 13 percent last month compared to November 2024, down to $327 million. Controller spending declined 19 percent year-on-year, driving this 13 percent spending drop. The Midnight Black edition of the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/tech/2023/11/15/is-the-playstation-portal-worth-a-purchase">PlayStation Portal</a> was the best-selling accessory of November in dollar sales, while the Midnight Black PlayStation 5 DualSense controller led the month in unit sales.&nbsp;</p><h3>Here Are The Top 20 Best-Selling Premium Games Of November 2025</h3>

<p>Looking at the data a bit closer, the PS5 managed to beat the Switch 2 to be the highest-selling platform during November, which is the first time Sony has managed such a feat since the launch of Nintendo's new console. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/12/xbox-series-xs-had-no-black-friday-deals-so-they-lost-to-a-console-weve-never-heard-of-us">the NEX Playground came in third place</a> in units sold, though the Xbox managed to bag third in dollars.</p>
<p>In terms of software, the highest-selling game of the month was, rather predictably, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/call_of_duty_black_ops_7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. Nintendo's highest-charting title was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[AdHoc Studio’s Dispatch Will Arrive On Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 Next Month, According to AU Store Listing]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/adhoc-studios-dispatch-will-arrive-on-nintendo-switch-and-nintendo-switch-2-next-month-according-to-au-store-listing/</link>
            <guid>1386076</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Dispatch, the interactive narrative from former Telltale developers at AdHoc Studio that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">secured a nomination at The Game Awards</a> despite releasing its final episode only five days before the nominations were announced, appears to be coming to the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 next month on January 29, 2026.</p>



<p>At least that's according to <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000105332">a store listing on the Australian eShop</a> listing that was spotted online. There's been no official word from AdHoc Studio through its social media channels or its website acknowledging the new release, but an official store listing is, at the very least, a strong sign that Dispatch will be available on Nintendo's hybrid consoles in the new year.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even though Dispatch didn't arrive until later in the year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-telltale-devs-announced-release-date-new-dispatch-game/">with its first batch of episodes releasing on October 22</a>, followed by the rest of the episodes releasing weekly up until November 12, it still made a significant impact on the year in the eyes of players. Featuring Aaron Paul as the lead, supported by actors like Jeffery Wright and Laura Baily, along with other voice actors players know from other games and from Critical Role, Dispatch is easily one of the year's most successful indie titles.</p>



<p>Not only has it <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-reportedly-closing-in-on-7m-copies-sold/">continued its strong sales since launch</a> and since the release of its finale episode for Season 1, according to <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/novembers-best-selling-steam-games">Alinea Analytics</a>, it was also one of the best-selling games on Steam for November 2025.</p>







<p>Currently, AdHoc Studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dispatch-season-2-cant-take-gta-6-amounts-of-time-fret-adhoc-as-they-decide-whether-or-not-to-make-it">is still weighing up whether it'll make a Season 2</a>, though that appears to be highly likely based on the reception the first season received and the success the game has had so far. It might be the case that we'll get a Season 2 after Dispatch has made it to all major platforms, since it is currently only available on PC and PS5. Once it arrives on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 next month, and Xbox sometime later, then we might finally get confirmation of Season 2, if AdHoc decides to make it.</p>

            <guid>1386058</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Mini computers offer a great way of enjoying powerful performance while keeping things minimal and mess-free. If you’re after a solid option from Apple, Amazon is making the upgrade quite easy.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">If you act fast, you can grab the 2024 Mac mini desktop computer (16GB memory, 256GB storage) with the super-fast M4 chip for $479, after a nice 20% discount.</a> It’s rated as Amazon’s Choice at the retailer, and has plenty of good reviews backing it up. Those looking to have it delivered before Christmas should place their orders today, as delays can push the delivery past the holiday season. Not married to the Apple brand? There are plenty of other mini PCs going at a discount right now, too. We’ve been covering the best drops (across multiple retailers) out there, so be sure to check our Deals page to find the one that fits your needs and budget.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Supercharged By M4</h2>
<p>This mini, yet mighty PC is five by five inches of incredible power. Design-wise, it’s quite sleek and is made to sit nicely next to a monitor, or anywhere else, without cluttering things up. It runs on the powerful M4 chip, which delivers incredible performance for all your tasks, whether you’re working on a group project for school, editing a creative project, developing a presentation, or brainstorming ideas. The chip also makes it up to 13x faster than the fastest Intel-based Mac mini, which means you can rely on it for your everyday tasks, as well as those busy, productive days where you’re handling a bit too much at the same time. Additionally, macOS is quite convenient to use and lets you run all your favorite apps responsively.</p>
<p>Apple Intelligence integration takes the experience even further. It’s Apple’s personal AI system that lets you search, write, develop ideas, communicate, and create stuff with ease. You’re getting personalized tools for a bunch of tasks, which can help you get a lot more done throughout your day.</p>
<p>There’s a 16GB memory to keep things running smoothly. It’s not massive, but you should be able to perform some light multitasking with ease. Storage is taken care of by the built-in 256GB SSD. Again, it’s not the biggest out there, but it does a good job at housing all your important files and content in a single place.</p>



<p>The PC also includes Thunderbolt, HDMI, and Gigabit Ethernet ports on the back, plus, for the first time, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack. These are enough to connect all your important peripherals without feeling limited. What’s more, the Mac mini plays nicely with other Apple devices like iPhones and iPads, too. When using it with your iPhone, for instance, you can mirror your smartphone on the monitor and control it from there. You can move things around, copy something on the iPhone and paste it on the Mac, reply to texts, take FaceTime calls, and more.</p>
<p>There are a lot of other features to like here, but to wrap it up, if you’ve been looking to upgrade your workstation by grabbing something fast and efficient, we highly recommend considering the 2024 Mac mini desktop computer. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">It’s now going for $479, meaning you can save over $100 on your purchase, but only if you grab it quick.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">There's always Game Pass.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launched last month to become the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-physical-software-and-hardware-sales-just-had-the-worst-november-in-the-us-since-1995">best-selling game of November</a> in the U.S. by dollar sales. It's both a huge sales feat and a common Call of Duty W, as the franchise has topped the charts in its launch month every year for 18 straight years. However, it looks like its rival Battlefield 6 will reign at the top of the U.S. sales charts at year's end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from Circana's monthly report, which has Black Ops 7 debuting as the best-selling game of November and the seventh best-selling game of the year-to-date, behind Battlefield 6 at No.1, NBA 2K26 at No.2, Monster Hunter Wilds at No.3, Borderlands 4 at No.4, EA Sports College Football 26 at No.5, and Madden NFL 26 at No.6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of those games have a few more months on the market on Call of Duty, but it's still a lot of ground to make up in a single month, and Call of Duty's at a bit of a disadvantage. The game launched into Game Pass, meaning its actual dollar sales on Xbox consoles are much lower than that of its rivals as people use the subscription service to access it instead, and there's no good recent data on how Call of Duty's presence on the service impacts subscriptions.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It is worth noting, though, that Black Ops 7 doesn't seem to be doing as well as Black Ops 6, a fact that's reflected in everything from the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review">critical review scores</a> to fan response to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-suffers-terrible-launch-in-europe-with-63-fewer-copies-sold-than-battlefield-6-but-theres-important-context-to-consider">European sales figures</a> to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-releases-of-modern-warfare-or-black-ops-games">Activision's own admissions</a>. Circana reports that the Call of Duty franchise saw a double-digit dollar sales decline compared to November 2024, and Circana senior director Mat Piscatella tells me that November full game dollar sales of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 finished below those of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 last November, with Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launching in the October 2024 tracking period. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is Piscatella's projection that Battlefield 6 is "extremely likely" to finish as the best-selling game of 2025 in the U.S. This would not be the only time Call of Duty didn't top the annual charts in recent memory. In 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-beats-modern-warfare-3-as-best-selling-game-of-2023-in-the-us">Hogwarts Legacy defeated Modern Warfare 3</a>, and that was with Modern Warfare 3 not launching into Game Pass. However, Black Ops 6 still dominated in 2024, and prior to that only Rockstar's GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 had been able to dethrone Call of Duty going all the way back to 2008's Rockband.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Call of Duty Campaigns</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Given all that, it's perhaps unsurprising that Activision is considering <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-releases-of-modern-warfare-or-black-ops-games">significant changes</a> to how it plans and releases its Call of Duty franchises year after year. Then again, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-just-had-the-best-month-of-sales-in-the-us-of-any-game-in-the-last-three-years">while Battlefield 6 had an incredible launch</a>, it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-lay-out-game-plan-after-winter-offensive-update-introduces-widespread-issues-across-pc-and-consoles">recently introduced an update</a> that broke the game in pretty significant ways across PC and consoles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was a weird November for all, I guess. Game sales in general had a shockingly weak November in the U.S., as we covered in our larger roundup of Circana's numbers. You can see what's going on and why gaming hardware and physical software just <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-physical-software-and-hardware-sales-just-had-the-worst-november-in-the-us-since-1995">had the worst November since 1995 right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <guid>1386043</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">November 2025 was a shockingly terrible month for video game sales in the U.S. While we traditionally think of November as a huge sales month what with Black Friday and all, November 2025 was the worst November in video game hardware unit sales, and the worst in physical software dollar sales the U.S. has seen since 1995.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's according to Circana's monthly report, which paints a pretty dismal picture of last month's commercial performance. The industry in the U.S. saw declines across the board in hardware, accessories, and console spending for an overall drop of 4% year-over-year, at $5.9 billion in total spending.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hardware</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">More specifically, hardware spending was down a whopping 27% year-over-year to $695 million, the lowest hardware spending total for November since 2005's $455 million. Even worse, unit sales reached 1.6 million, which is the lowest November total since 1995's 1.4 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that's representative of declines across the board. Xbox Series hardware sales were down 70% year-over-year. PS5 sales were down over 40%, and combined unit sales of Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 were down over 10% from Switch sales last year, despite this being a launch year for the Nintendo Switch 2.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What's going on? As pointed out by Circana senior director Mat Piscatella, video game hardware has never been more expensive, reaching an all-time November high of $439 per unit, up 11% year-over-year. The Xbox specifically saw its average price per unit increase by over 30%, perhaps confirming one reason why folks aren't so keen to buy Xboxes specifically.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the Nintendo Switch 2, Piscatella says he's watching its sales "very closely," and offers this analysis of its current situation:</p><blockquote>With six months in the market, it remains the fastest-selling video game hardware in U.S. history. However, part of what was driving that was its availability to be bought during its launch window. It's been extremely rare to have such a successful new device not suffer supply constraints going into its first holiday sales period. Unit sales of Switch 2 were lower than those of Switch 1 during each console's first November, but the price points are also quite different. The average price paid for a new Nintendo Switch in November 2017 was $309 (which, if adjusted for inflation, is approximately $405 in November 2025 dollars), compared to the $486 for Switch 2 in November 2025. Perhaps it is a case of demand having been pulled forward earlier in the year because people could find them. Or perhaps the mass market is not as quickly adopting Switch 2 as it did Switch. Or perhaps consumers are looking elsewhere for holiday gifting as the prices continue to rise in video game hardware. Tough to say at the moment.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">There's one piece of hardware that's doing okay, and it's not what you'd expect: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-box-that-looks-like-the-ouya-and-kinect-had-a-kid-outsold-the-ps5-in-the-us-the-week-before-thanksgiving">the NEX Playground</a>. It was the third best-selling piece of video game hardware of November by unit sales, surpassing the Xbox Series, while the more expensive Xbox Series beat it in dollar sales (the PS5 was first in both categories, the Switch 2 was second). Piscatella calls the NEX Playground a "remarkable story," noting that while everyone else is having a bad time, it just had a superb November by comparison:</p><blockquote>November 2025 tracked unit sales at U.S. retailers for NEX Playground were just 7% below its entire tracked lifetime sales at retail through October. With an average selling price of just over $200 in November, strong placement at retail, and some successful influencer and viral marketing efforts, the NEX Playground became one of the hottest video game products of the holiday season during the month. We'll have to see how well the pace can keep up, as there are reports that the NEX Playground is now largely sold out, with secondary market prices on sites like eBay soaring accordingly. </blockquote><blockquote>There could be a lesson here that more affordable, family friendly gaming devices carry appeal during holiday gifting season.</blockquote><h3 data-cy="title3">Software</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Things aren't looking much better on the content side. While Circana reports that content spending was up 1% year-over-year to $4.8 billion, that's with subscription spending rising 16% and 2% growth in mobile. Physical software sales, meanwhile, dropped 14% year-over-year to the worst November since 1995, the year Circana began tracking them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 put the Call of Duty franchise back on top for another debut month in November as the month's best-seller, marking the 18th year in a row a Call of Duty has launched to the top of the charts. That said, Circana reports that the franchise saw a double-digit percentage full game dollar sales decline when compared to November 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a little tricky to make precise comparisons between Black Ops 7 and its predecessor, Black Ops 6, given both games launched into Xbox Game Pass, and Black Ops 6 released in October last year, not November. Still, Piscatella tells me that Black Ops 7's full game dollar sales finished below those of Black Ops 6's last November. Additionally, Black Ops 7 is currently the seventh best-selling game of the year-to-date, and Piscatella anticipates that its rival, Battlefield 6, will end the year as the best-selling game of 2025. This isn't the first time in recent memory it's been beaten, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-beats-modern-warfare-3-as-best-selling-game-of-2023-in-the-us">Hogwarts Legacy coming out on top in 2023</a>. Notably, that year, Hogwarts Legacy beat Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, which did <em>not</em> launch into Game Pass, while Black Ops 7 this year did, almost certainly making its actual dollar sales total lower as a result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth noting as well that accessories spending was down 13% year-over-year.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Red Flags</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This is shaping up to be a pretty weird year. I asked Piscatella what he makes of all this, and what it means for the games industry. He pointed out that much of the story remains to be told in December, and that it's possible consumers are waiting for better deals closer to the holidays. Alternatively, it's possible that economic factors and price of consoles are pushing people to hold off on gaming purchases. Here's what Piscatella had to say:</p><blockquote>Retail spending had been holding up relatively well until now, despite the pressure from higher prices we've been seeing in the market. More affluent consumers have kept on spending so far, which has made up for some of the declines in spending from the less affluent portions of the market. Perhaps this is a sign that those higher prices are beginning to impact purchases of pricier items, like consoles. Perhaps not.</blockquote><blockquote>However, if the crunch on RAM pricing continues, if we see rising prices on consoles and gaming PCs over the coming months it could, theoretically, be potentially devastating to the dedicated gaming device market. Which would, of course, have potential carryover effects on the content side. </blockquote><blockquote>I certainly see some of the relationships between hardware unit sales and pricing we're seeing in the November results as a red flag. </blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">We won't get the December and full-year results in until January, which will tell us a lot more about whether the games industry is about to enter a lean period, or if this November was just a goofy one-off.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">November 2025 U.S. Top 20 Best-Selling Games:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 (NEW)</li><li>Battlefield 6</li><li>NBA 2K26</li><li>Madden NFL 26</li><li>EA Sports FC 26</li><li>Pokemon Legends: Z-A*</li><li>Ghost of Yotei</li><li>EA Sports College Football 26</li><li>Minecraft*</li><li>Kirby Air Riders (NEW)*</li><li>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment (NEW)*</li><li>The Outer Worlds 2</li><li>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</li><li>Donkey Kong Bananza*</li><li>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</li><li>Red Dead Redemption II</li><li>Grand Theft Auto V</li><li>Borderlands 4</li><li>Forza Horizon 5</li><li>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>* Indicates that some or all digital sales are not included in Circana's data.

            <title><![CDATA[Morse Makes Learning An Obscure Skill Fun]]></title>

            <guid>1386034</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>You don’t need me to tell you that the world is a hellscape lately, but a fun thing about living in it is that it’s full of people with specific interests or niche areas of expertise, and they know all kinds of things you don’t know that you can go learn from them. Recently-released video game <em>Morse</em> is about Morse code, a very niche interest, and is even getting some people into telegraphy, an even <em>more</em> niche interest.</p><p>I feel like I’ve been hearing about <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1976860/MORSE/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Morse</u></em></a> for years (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playmygame/comments/1ovfric/my_game_morse_released_yesterday_after_10_years/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>10 years</u></a>, apparently!), and it finally released in November. It’s changed quite a bit from the <a href="https://aftermath.site/steam-next-fest-demos-summer-game-fest/"><u>demo</u></a> I played last year, which featured a narrative; now, you fend off growing waves of enemy ships on a grid you navigate with Morse code.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bSLMGwQ2nsI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="MORSE - Official Launch Trailer"></iframe></figure><p>You tap out letters to move your cursor between grids and squares, all while enemy ships steadily approach from the right side of the screen. You can’t see them at first, so you need to set up mines to reveal them, or fire exploratory rounds to get a sense of what’s happening. As you move through the game, you unlock and upgrade weaponry, but things also get tougher: more ships to beat back, and more rows and columns to frantically dot-and-dash your way around.</p><p>I’ve only spent about an hour with the game, but I’ve really enjoyed its very specific mix of stressful and calm. In one way, it’s frantic; there’s way more ground to cover and problems to deal with than I feel like I can, and I’m constantly scanning the field and clicking away with my mouse to dart around. On the other hand, there’s something particularly slow about the whole thing. Tapping too fast will cause you to enter the wrong letter or nonsense instead of letters, so you need to take your time to keep from getting jumbled up. There’s a bit of a delay before you move, and shells take some time to load in. So peppered among a chaotic battle are all these micro-moments of downtime, and the whole game requires a kind of intentionality and level-headedness to succeed at that, when I pull it off, really makes me feel like I’m mastering a skill.</p><p>The ideal way to play this game, obviously, would be with an actual telegraph, which has been an option at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8KyM6g-WUw&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>festivals</u></a> but less so at home. The Steam forums have a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1976860/discussions/0/689741058327776126/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>guide</u></a> on how to get, build, or use one, and players have shown off their <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alexvscoding.bsky.social/post/3m5mtblpni22p?ref=aftermath.site"><u>own</u></a> <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1976860/discussions/0/686364876128408036/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>versions</u></a> online. It’s a game that invites <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYGJ1S8HkMw&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>weird controllers</u></a> and making your own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfP5D6UTV48&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>weird controllers</u></a>. While I am not a <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-modded-my-ps5-controller-and-you-can-too/"><u>controller sicko</u></a> like Chris Person, I can respect people who are, and the pared-down input required for <em>Morse</em> seems like an approachable way to get into tinkering.</p><p>Morse code and its <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/3759672.stm?ref=aftermath.site"><u>preservation</u></a> isn’t something I’ve thought a lot about, but there’s a whole world of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6W_RJU0ssZg&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>enthusiasts</u></a> out there keeping it alive. In an email, developer Alex Johansson said he hopes to use <em>Morse</em> to introduce more people to a hobby with an <a href="https://rsgb.org/main/publications-archives/radcom/silent-keys/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>aging</u></a> population, which is an issue I have literally never considered before–what happens if there’s no one left alive who knows Morse code? I love how such a simple little game has given me a peek into a whole world I knew nothing about, with its own customs and lingo and values.
