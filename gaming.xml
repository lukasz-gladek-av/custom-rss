<p>Epic Games continues to give people what they want. More OG Fortnite content is on the way thanks to OG Season 3, and there‚Äôs plenty of love for this early season, meaning the anticipation is already building.</p>



<p>OG Fortnite Season 3‚ÄîAKA Meteor Strike‚Äîis next up for the battle-royale title in 2025. Fortnite has a plethora of game modes at this point with regular battle royale, LEGO Fortnite, a Rocket League crossover, and so much more. But Fortnite OG is another shrewd move from Epic: Giving us all a chance to enjoy the earlier years.</p>



<p>Fortnite OG Season 3 was first released in February 2018, and yet we‚Äôre celebrating it again in 2025‚Äîpossibly with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-mortal-kombat-mythics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat Mythics</a> and maybe some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-is-receiving-yakuza-skins-soon-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yakuza skins</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-og-season-3-releases-in-march">Fortnite OG Season 3 Releases in March</h2>



<figure><figcaption>How did we get so Lucky? Credit to Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>A message on the <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1903099532868505615" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fortnite X social media channel</a> has confirmed <strong>Fortnite OG Season 3 gets underway on March 25</strong>. One of its standout additions was a new POI‚ÄîLucky Landing (shown in the screenshot above).</p>



<p>Lucky Landing is characterized by its Asian-themed buildings and lush, eye-popping Cherry Blossom tree in the center. The majority of the season‚Äôs storyline focused on a meteor heading for the map. </p>



<div><article><p><span>Why crash out when you could crash in?

Back to where it all started‚Ä¶OG Season 3 launches March 25 üöÄ </span></p></article></div>



<p>The map slowly started altering as the season progressed, and we were beginning to see the creativity of the Fortnite map and how your experience would dynamically change as the weeks went on. I also fondly remember the Battle Pass having the ‚ÄúTake the L‚Äù emote which I unashamedly dropped on fallen enemies after I two-tapped them with Pump Shotguns.</p>



<p>It was a simple time. Long may the OG Fortnite map trend continue.</p>

<p>Dave the Diver‚Äôs Like a Dragon DLC, Ichiban‚Äôs Holiday, will release on April 10, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-dave-the-diver-s-ichiban-s-holiday-dlc">What‚Äôs New in Dave the Diver‚Äôs Ichiban‚Äôs Holiday DLC?</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/dave-the-diver-x-like-a-dragon-collaboration-dlc-ichibans-holiday-launches-april-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a>, Dave the Diver‚Äôs Ichiban‚Äôs Holiday DLC will see the beloved character, Ichiban Kasuga, and his favourite bartender from Survive Bar arrive at Blue Hole for a vacation. However, things never go smoothly for Ichiban, and during his vacation time, he gets into a conflict with Sea Blue when he realises that they are capturing dolphins.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-classic-arcade-brawler-experience">Classic Arcade Brawler Experience</h3>



<p>To remedy the situation, Ichiban decides to infiltrate Sea Blue‚Äôs base. However, things will not be easy for him, and he needs a partner. Cobra joins on the journey, and as soon as you reach the base, the game turns into a classic arcade beat ‚Äôem up title, with players having to switch between both characters during the fights. Players should keep an eye out for a special reward at the end of this stage.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-karaoke-minigame-and-more">Karaoke Minigame and More</h3>



<p>Moreover, Ichiban‚Äôs Holiday DLC will add more content to Dave the Diver. In the spirit of Like a Dragon, players now have a new Karaoke minigame where they can sing along with their favourite characters. Also, some unique characters from the Like a Dragon series will be introduced as Bancho Sushi staff.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players should know that Ichiban‚Äôs Holiday will be the first paid DLC for Dave the Diver. Also, the DLC will be only available for a limited time of six months on all platforms once it arrives, as this is ‚Äúa special collaboration with a big game‚Äù, revealed game director Jaeho Hwang.</p>

It‚Äôs full of cool little touches, whether it‚Äôs throwing something at an enemy with the grappling rope or dropping from your glider onto your horse. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs also a game full of map clutter, bloated systems, and a truly absurd amount of junk loot, and the time I spent clearing out everything that didn‚Äôt spark joy and dealing with all these non-essential systems made me pine for a leaner, meaner, more focused game. Rise of the Ronin is excellent when it has the courage to be itself and lean into its challenging, rewarding fighting; too often, however, it feels stuck in indecision, torn between what it wants to be and what it feels it‚Äôs expected to be, and not even the best samurai can overcome that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

                <p>Baldur's Gate 3 actor Samantha Beart, who played Karlach, has spoken out against artificial intelligence technologies being used for short-term gain. Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/edge/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Edge</a>, Beart said CEOs want to use AI to "save money," but long-term reputational damage may be coming for those who take this approach.</p><p>"In the long term, it'll destroy their reputation, their company, everything," Beart said, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/baldur-s-gate/baldurs-gate-3-karlach-actor-says-ceos-just-want-to-save-money-with-ai-itll-destroy-their-reputation-their-company-everything/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by GamesRadar</a>.</p><p>Beart went on to say that actors are unlikely to back down in the fight against AI because doing so would mean, "You've just signed your way out of any sort of job or career."</p><p>"We have an industry of highly artistic people who've had a calling to do this stuff, and then you've got these people with money, who don't play games, who see it as an easy way to make a return on investment," Beart said.</p><p>Video game voice actors in the SAG-AFTRA union are currently on strike against video game companies, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-actor-on-why-ai-is-existential-issue-in-ongoing-strike-negotiations/1100-6528710/" data-ref-id="1100-6528710">issues around AI said to be the final sticking point in the talks</a>.</p><p>"The dream of the tech industry is to sell off your company at an overinflated price and retire," Beart said. "And I feel that's being done with game studios right now."</p><p>Video game voice actors have been on strike since July 2024, meaning the strike has now stretched beyond seven months. SAG-AFTRA video game performers also went on strike in 2016, with a work stoppage spanning 18 months.</p><p>A recent study found that the majority of game developers worldwide use AI technologies to make games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">despite workers raising major concerns</a>. AI has been a controversial topic in video games and beyond, in part over fears about job losses with fears about generative AI being used to potentially take jobs. Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson has said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969">rise in AI will lead to job losses in the short term</a> but will ultimately create more jobs total, just like what happened with previous labor revolutions.</p><p>In other news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-uses-horizons-aloy-to-demonstrate-new-ai-tech-and-its-about-as-impressive-as-youd-expect/1100-6530023/" data-ref-id="1100-6530023">a recent video showed Horizon's Aloy in a tech demo for an AI assistant</a>--and people quickly voiced their concerns about this. Even Aloy's actor, Ashly Burch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-actor-ashly-burch-worried-in-wake-of-ai-aloy-video/1100-6530163/" data-ref-id="1100-6530163">spoke out to criticize it</a>. </p>

The event also included first-time reveals for previously unannounced games, of which many looked really neat. My personal favorite was a cozily bleak isometric survival crafting game called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2604490/I_Hate_This_Place/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2604490/I_Hate_This_Place/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>I Hate This Place</em></a></span>. <br></p><p>We are now practically inundated with quarterly showcases and festivals from all the major events and platform holders, and they can‚Äôt always be revealing brand new games. So a lot of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsFTvIsRYbw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsFTvIsRYbw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2.5 hour-long Future Games Spring Showcase</a></span> consisted of reminders of titles that was already announced, but so many continue to look cool, well worth a place on your radar. </p><p>That includes Brazilian roguelike ARPG <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1782460/Hell_Clock/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1782460/Hell_Clock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Hell Clock</em></a></span>, grimdark sci-fi adventure <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2154070/INDUSTRIA_2/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2154070/INDUSTRIA_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Industria 2</em></a></span>, atmospheric puzzle platformer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1928690/Bionic_Bay/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1928690/Bionic_Bay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Bionic Bay</em></a></span>, and cyberpunk shooter <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/990380/METAL_EDEN/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/990380/METAL_EDEN/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Metal Eden</em></a></span>.

A bunch of games also have recent demos out, including the evocative retro pixel-art JRPG <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1864000/Artis_Impact/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1864000/Artis_Impact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Artis Impact</em></a></span>. </p><p>In the meantime, here are nine games we didn‚Äôt know about until they were revealed during yesterday‚Äôs showcase. </p></div></div><div><p><em>Outriders</em> developer People Can Fly is taking a stab at a mix of the hottest live-service genres around. <em>Lost Rift </em>is a base-building survival shooter that combines PvE coop with PvPvE extraction gameplay. The crudest way I can describe it is mashing together <em>Far Cry</em>, <em>Fortnite</em>, and <em>Rust</em>. </p></div><div><p>Based on the Kyle Starks‚Äô comic by the same name,<em> I Hate This Place </em>is about surviving in the woods by collecting resources in the day, and navigating occult horrors at night. What helps set it apart form similar survival crafting loops is the inky art-style and ‚Äò80s analogue horror vibes. </p></div><div><p>Don‚Äôt be fooled, <em>Elsewhere Electric</em> is not a van life adventure game. It is instead a co-op first-person exploration game where you solve puzzles in a strange facility. It supports virtual reality headsets and will show each player different things, forcing them to communicate to overcome obstacles. </p></div><div><p>This one is a bonkers mashup. <em>Shelf Heroes</em> is an FPS with roguelike elements, and card-based perk powerups, and multiplayer co-op. You have to assemble your perfect action figure to take back your home from rogue toys. <em>Risk of Rain</em> <em>2</em> meets <em>Toy Story</em>?<br></p></div><div><p>What if you could ponder the Roman Empire from the cozy comfort of a <em>Stardew Valley</em>-like? <em>Romestead</em> looks the part, but will offer less chill with up to eight players battling for dominance across limited resource maps. So maybe less slice-of-life farming sim than <em>Age of Empires </em>clash of civilizations?<br></p></div><div><p>A robot with a gun awakens on an abandoned oil tanker and searches for meaning. <em>The Last Caretaker</em> calls on players to ‚Äúcraft, explore, and battle rogue machines‚Äù as they try to bring humanity back from apparent extinction. There‚Äôs a choose-your-own-adventure tag on Steam though, so maybe you can decide to leave humans behind in the end. </p></div><div><p>Kickstarted over four years ago, the table-top dark fantasy tactical RPG <em>Frosthaven</em> is getting a video game adaptation. It‚Äôll feature single-player, co-op, and online multiplayer, with a closed beta happening soon, ahead of its Early Access release. </p></div><div><p><em>Raev</em> is a kingdom builder that blends RPG elements with 4X strategy. You guide a civilization of furries on their way to environmental harmony, architectural beauty, and societal greatness. It‚Äôs coming to PC in 2026. </p></div><div><p>Old-school first-person shooter <em>Painkiller</em> is being revived by Saber Interactive. The <em>Doom</em>-inspired fast-paced gothic gorefest will offer co-op as players battle the fallen angel Azazel and his army of demons using steampunk-looking weapons. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Microsoft has recently revealed a new UI mockup for Xbox that shows what games players own across a variety of devices and storefronts, including Steam.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633478/microsoft-xbox-steam-games-support-ui" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, Microsoft posted a new blog post that had a picture of the proposed UI, but it was subsequently removed. In the picture, you can see games like Diablo IV and Microsoft Flight Simulator in the "recently added" in the UI. However, you can also see the "Steam" and "Game Pass" tabs, indicating that you'll be able to see sort games based on which platform you purchased them on.</p><p>It seems like the UI is just a mockup for now, as the "owned" and "action-adventure" tabs are listed twice. The <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2025/03/gdc-2025-opening-a-billion-doors-with-xbox/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post </a>is about how Xbox is trying to reach a larger audience, as younger generations regular switch between platforms and expect seamless integration.

			<p>Ukrainian developer Frogwares is currently <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-shows-off-gameplay-and-launches-kickstarter-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seeking funds</a> for The Sinking City 2 on Kickstarter. After two weeks, and with another two left before the end, the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2/description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaign</a> has so far gathered over ‚Ç¨383K, nearly four times the minimum amount of ‚Ç¨100K. Of course, the studio hopes that the momentum continues; according to <a href="https://kicktraq.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2/#chart-exp-projection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kicktraq projections</a>, it could land anywhere between ‚Ç¨424K and ‚Ç¨483K.</p>
<p>It has not been smooth sailing for Frogwares in the past few years. In 2019-20, their games were delisted from digital stores twice in the span of a year due to problems with French publishers <a href="https://wccftech.com/frogwares-claims-to-be-endangered-by-focus-home-interactive-policy-games-being-delisted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Focus Home Interactive</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-delisted-from-storefronts-frogwares-cites-breach-of-contract-with-nacon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nacon</a>. Then there was the pandemic, of course, which affected everyone. Just as things were looking better, the Russian invasion of Ukraine suddenly happened in early 2022.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://wccftech.com/frogwares-ceo-talks-about-the-wars-tragic-impact-on-the-ukrainian-game-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked with them</a> just a few days after the war started, learning of all their fear and day-to-day troubles. Thankfully, Epic <a href="https://wccftech.com/frogwares-receives-epic-games-megagrant-to-help-support-ukranian-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">awarded the studio a MegaGrant</a>, offering them a reprieve of sorts. Even so, they had to re-evaluate their roadmap and decided to develop <a href="https://wccftech.com/frogwares-announces-project-palianytsia-game-project-for-sinking-city-and-sherlock-holmes-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Palianytsia</a>, which turned out to be Sherlock Holmes The Awakened, a reboot of the first entry in the franchise that was funded via Kickstarter. The ongoing war <a href="https://wccftech.com/sherlock-holmes-the-awakened-delayed-due-to-continued-russian-strikes-in-kyiv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caused</a> a short delay, but the studio still managed to release a solid game, as outlined in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sherlock-holmes-the-awakened-the-only-way-forward-is-the-abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our review</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the studio has returned to what it really wanted to make: The Sinking City 2. This one <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-announcement-ue5-horror-frogwares-deliver-ukraine-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will be a full-fledged horror game</a>, whereas the first entry was more of an open world investigation game with horror undertones. Right in the middle of the Kickstarter campaign, we reached out once more to Sergiy Oganesyan, Publishing Director at Frogwares, to discuss how the project evolved over the past couple of years (including the switch to Unreal Engine 5), what fans can expect from it, and how the war is still affecting the development team.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Our vision for The Sinking City 2 is a Lovecraftian survival horror game with deep investigation mechanics, and that hasn‚Äôt changed much. But there‚Äôs still a huge difference between the first vertical slice we created back in 2023 and the recent playable footage that we published for Kickstarter, and that, thanks to the feedback from playtests, has definitely shown us where we need to adjust our priorities.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Exactly a year ago, you <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-goes-to-kickstarter-soon-as-frogwares-needs-a-safety-net-from-the-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> fans the Kickstarter campaign would open up soon, but then you went dark for a while. Can you disclose what happened?</strong></p>
<p>A few things really. Over the past year, we made the decision to focus on giving ourselves some time to develop the game so we could showcase real gameplay for Kickstarter, rather than just concept art. Along the way, we also refined some of our designs to better fit actual gameplay, ensuring a stronger experience.</p>
<p>When we announced it in 2024, we had some closed playtests very soon after that with a group of our closest fans. Through their feedback, we started refining even more on where we should place our focus and efforts, which dictated a lot about how we‚Äôd present the game in our campaign. Much of what we showed in the gameplay and dev diary we just released is due to our work with our fans. Additionally, we took the time to carefully map out and design physical rewards for the campaign, making sure they are meaningful and high-quality for our backers. It‚Äôs the first time we've done something like that, and there was a lot of fog of war to deal with.</p>
<p>Lastly, we are all still mostly working remotely as a team due to the war. So, we work more around our team and their needs. We didn‚Äôt want anyone to feel rushed on the campaign. Progress on the game was the priority, and then getting what we needed for the launch of the Kickstarter came when everyone felt ready to help. So these factors all stacked up, but we‚Äôre glad we could take our time.</p>
<p><strong>How has your vision for The Sinking City 2 evolved since the game's announcement?</strong></p>
<p>Our vision for The Sinking City 2 is a Lovecraftian survival horror game with deep investigation mechanics, and that hasn‚Äôt changed much. But there‚Äôs still a huge difference between the first vertical slice we created back in 2023 and the recent playable footage that we published for Kickstarter, and that, thanks to the feedback from playtests, has definitely shown us where we need to adjust our priorities.</p>
<p>If you take combat, for example, we spent a lot of time improving the overall feeling of it. How enemies behave, how they react to being shot, how impactful the shotgun is, that kind of thing. There‚Äôs still a lot of work ahead, but we are happy to see that most people are satisfied with where this particular mechanic is going.</p>
<p><strong>How recent is the Pre-Alpha gameplay footage that you just shared? How much more polished do you expect the full game to be?</strong></p>
<p>Well, this is sort of the downside of a Kickstarter campaign‚Äîyou often have to launch it at a time when you can‚Äôt really show anything totally final. Much of what we showed was recorded in&nbsp;late 2024, but in order to really understand how much things can change, we need to take into consideration how game development works.</p>
<p>For example, we create our levels in a vacuum of what we call Vitaras (visual targets) - separate maps inside the engine where you don‚Äôt have any real gameplay. So while the work on those continues, inside the real game you have placeholder assets, which, as you can imagine, are very far in terms of the quality of what we want to achieve. But when those Vitaras are fully migrated to the real game, you suddenly have beautiful meshes, materials, lighting and so on and the difference is like night and day. The same goes for your enemies and everything else, really. What I‚Äôm trying to say is that there wasn‚Äôt anything in the trailer that was truly final, locked, and won‚Äôt ever be touched again. Once we fully integrate our locations, combat, and other gameplay together, you‚Äôll see the difference for the better.</p>
<p><strong>One of the big areas of focus for this sequel is combat. Can you talk about some of the improvements fans will see compared to the first game?</strong></p>
<p>Where do I even begin? I have already mentioned that we are putting a lot of emphasis on how combat feels because it must feel fun and convincing. You must enjoy landing a shot, and this is achieved through a number of things, primarily VFX, sound design, recoil, enemy hit reaction, etc. We mentioned a wound body system for our enemies in our recent dev diary - it‚Äôs essentially a second layer of muscle, ligaments, and blood mass underneath the skin, which reacts when hit. It‚Äôs all a bit gory, but in my opinion, very satisfying to see working under the hood.</p>
<p>So, a lot of work is being done on enemy visuals, animations, attacks, and, of course, enemy placement around each map to make this all come together. I‚Äôm not going to lie; combat is probably the most challenging aspect for us, especially since this is now a core focus of the game compared to the original. One enemy can take months of work, and that‚Äôs just the visual design, without any gameplay. But so far, the results we and our closed playtesters have seen prove we‚Äôre on the right track. We‚Äôve still got a lot more work to do, and we‚Äôll likely be refining this right to the end, but we‚Äôre really happy with the progress so far.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'You must enjoy landing a shot, and this is achieved through a number of things, primarily VFX, sound design, recoil, enemy hit reaction, etc. We mentioned a wound body system for our enemies in our recent dev diary - it‚Äôs essentially a second layer of muscle, ligaments, and blood mass underneath the skin, which reacts when hit. It‚Äôs all a bit gory, but in my opinion, very satisfying to see working under the hood.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Will players be able to dodge out of the way and perform some melee actions in combat?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we are experimenting with some dodge and ‚Äúlast-resort‚Äù melee mechanics.</p>
<p><strong>In terms of narrative and atmosphere, how is The Sinking City 2 going to set itself apart from its predecessor? Are there going to be any easter eggs or even returning characters for fans of the original?</strong></p>
<p>So, the two games are set in the same universe and time setting. 1920s United States drenched in a gloomy, Lovecraftian horror vibe. And just like before, a supernatural flood has taken hold of a city and is changing it in unfathomable ways. But that‚Äôs mainly where the similarities end. The Sinking City 2 features a new, stand-alone story entirely separate from the one told in the original game. So we‚Äôre not going back to playing as Charles Reed, nor are we going back to the city of Oakmont in any way, and we made all these narrative and atmosphere choices for a reason. We wanted to create a story and setting that wasn‚Äôt burdened by what we created in the original game, especially since players have various endings they favor or consider the ‚Äútrue ending‚Äù to that story.</p>
<p>This way, we can let existing fans come back into this familiar world fresh, while anyone who never played the original can also step in without feeling like they are missing a big chunk of the story. So while we might have some small Easter eggs or hints here and there, they will be there mainly as a wink and nudge for us and our most devoted fans.</p>
<p><strong>You've said that while this isn't an open-world game, it will feature plenty of secrets and large explorable zones. Considering side content, how long should we expect the game to be?</strong></p>
<p>That‚Äôs not something we can answer right now, as there are still parts of the game we haven‚Äôt finalized yet. However, it‚Äôs a survival horror game, so it would be fair to look at some recent releases in the genre to get a ballpark idea.</p>
<p><strong>The Kickstarter campaign appears to have gone very well so far.</strong></p>
<p>Yup. Just yesterday we unlocked another stretch goal - a new giant monster type, the Shoggoth. Now, just to be clear, we already did promise a Shoggoth encounter in the game, but these are two very different enemies, both visually and mechanically. We‚Äôll probably hit one more stretch goal after this one is funded.</p>
<p><strong>Will the game launch in early access or straight to full release?</strong></p>
<p>The game will launch in full on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox X/S at the same time. At one point, we considered the Early Access route but decided we were better off using Kickstarter and closed playtests to help develop the game.</p>
<p><strong>Was it hard to transition to Unreal Engine 5? Are you leveraging all their technologies (Lumen, Nanite, etc.) to elevate the visuals?</strong></p>
<p>There was a learning curve for sure, but it was quite smooth. It was really helpful that we knew from the start that The Sinking City 2 was going to be made in Unreal 5. Speak to any team who made the transition, and almost all of them will tell you to make the switch at the start if you can. It will save you so much time and effort in the long run. So, we finished our last game on UE4 and started pre-production for TSC2 from scratch. All our internal tools were developed as separate plugins, so although the migration took some time, it was fairly straightforward. This also provided a great opportunity to get rid of a bunch of legacy code and finally perform a long-overdue refactor.</p>
<p>The tools UE5 brings have been amazing, for sure. Lumen has significantly improved our lighting and reflection systems, creating a more immersive and visually stunning environment. For us, especially where The Sinking City 2 has many wet surfaces, Lumen allows us to achieve much more realistic and dynamic lighting effects that were previously really difficult to attain.</p>
<p>With Metahuman, we were astonished at how fast, simple, and realistic the results were. After our initial tests, we reviewed our entire cutscene and dialogue creation process and reworked everything to better utilize these tools.</p>
<p>Nanite significantly changed our approach to asset creation, allowing us to use highly detailed models without compromising performance. This has been particularly beneficial for creating the much more detailed environments that were required for this game. Since we are going for that feeling of isolation and a more contained play space, we need the environment itself to do a lot of the immersion heavy lifting.</p>
<p>That said, while new technologies are fantastic and help solve old problems, they can also bring new issues to tackle. Nanite was no exception. For instance, in our previous projects, a single Static Mesh asset did not take up more than 200MB of disk space, but now it is pretty common. So, managing the increased asset sizes and optimizing our workflows to accommodate this change has been a significant task.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'The tools UE5 brings have been amazing, for sure.

For us, especially where The Sinking City 2 has many wet surfaces, Lumen allows us to achieve much more realistic and dynamic lighting effects that were previously really difficult to attain. [...] Lumen already supports software ray-tracing out of the box. Our team is also looking at the hardware one, but it‚Äôll depend on the optimization.'</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Will you support ray traced effects like global illumination, reflections, etc.?</strong></p>
<p>Lumen already supports software ray-tracing out of the box. Our team is also looking at the hardware one, but it‚Äôll depend on the optimization.</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to prepare enhancements for the PS5 Pro console?</strong></p>
<p>It‚Äôs likely, but I can‚Äôt say which enhancements yet.</p>
<p><strong>Would you like to share anything about Ukraine's situation and how it's still impacting your daily work?</strong></p>
<p>Missile strikes and drone attacks almost every goddamn night. Just yesterday, around 20 drones attacked the city of Kropyvnytskyi. In Kyiv, you can‚Äôt fall asleep without listening to air defense fighting off another swarm of Russian drones. In a way, we have become used to it, but not exactly in a healthy way. You have to just accept it and try to keep living, not knowing if your luck will run out soon.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time, and stay strong.</strong></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/split-fiction-movie-reportedly-in-the-works-bidding-war-underway.1141371/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which claims that a&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>movie is in the works, and that several major Hollywood studios are already engaged in a bidding war over the rights to said movie.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-video-game-adaptation-1236344367/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Variety</a>, media company Story Kitchen is currently scouting writers and directors, as well as cast members, for the project. You might also recognize Story Kitchen's name from the likes of the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-action-dredge-movie" rel="nofollow"><em>Dredge&nbsp;</em>movie</a>, which was announced last year, as well as the upcoming&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/it-takes-two-movie-and-tv-adaptations-in-works" rel="nofollow"><em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>movie adaptation</a>.</p>

<p>Citing "sources at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in San Francisco", Variety says that a number of "top Hollywood studios" are currently making offers for the rights to the&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>movie, although it sounds like nothing has been decided yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-movie-report-barriers.jpg?itok=9mK7HXCQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-movie-report-barriers.jpg?itok=72JyqCAo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>movie adaptation is apparently in the works.</figcaption></figure><p>Given&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>'s close focus on gameplay, I'm having a bit of a hard time imagining how a movie would work; I can only imagine some of the game's uniqueness will be lost in the transition. Still, it's testament to&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>'s popularity that a movie adaptation is already underway.</p>

<p>Of course, the movie makes a lot of sense from a financial perspective, too. After all,&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>managed to reach <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">two million sales in a single week</a>, so creating more media based around the IP is sound logic.</p>

<p>It's the same logic that drove Story Kitchen to create the&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>adaptation, and that game recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hazelight-josef-fares-new-ip-it-takes-two-sales" rel="nofollow">passed the 20 million sales mark</a>. It just remains to be seen whether&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>'s gaming audience would also be interested in a non-interactive version of the story.</p>




<p>In case you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, it's the latest co-op adventure from&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>A Way Out&nbsp;</em>developer Hazelight, led by Josef Fares.</p>

<p>The game casts you and your co-op buddy as Mio and Zoe, two writers who must learn to work together when they're thrust into a diabolical machine that threatens to steal all of their ideas.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2001120/Split_Fiction/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/split-fiction/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/games/store/split-fiction/9n1wxxd1rl8d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

Some provide incremental buffs while others cover specific hero weaknesses or even adjust how you want to play them.

<p>A new PlayStation patent describes a controller that can be charged with solar energy, which might solve all your battery-related problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/sony-patents-solar-power-controllers/?fbclid=IwY2xjawJIDShleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHVwVHGQueVMZZupV-8DT_-KIESWvFQMimNqN7_WL90EACfvjRBhqzmNO1g_aem_pn2iGOc8pztrFDDWfs47hQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tech4Gamers</a>, Sony Interactive Entertainment has published a new patent called ‚Äò<a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025046814&amp;_cid=P21-M80ZRL-19120-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Operation Device</a>‚Äô. The patent is for a PlayStation controller that features ‚Äúa plurality of photovoltaic elements‚Äù on its housing and a storage area that ‚Äúaccumulates power generated by the plurality of photovoltaic elements‚Äù, which in turn will charge the device with solar energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The diagrams provided on the website suggest that the photovoltaic elements will be placed on the top half of the body, around the analogue sticks and the different buttons. This controller can then be placed under sunlight to charge itself.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment has also mentioned the problem they are trying to solve with the solar-powered PlayStation controller. Sony has stated that a conventional controller needs a replaceable or rechargeable battery to run, and without this power source, it cannot operate. With their new patent, they wish to solve this problem with technology that charges a controller‚Äôs secondary or primary battery through an external power source.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is not the first patent PlayStation has published. Last year, we saw a controller concept <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-new-patent-reveals-a-controller-concept-with-conductive-ink/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that uses conductive ink</a>. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-adaptive-controller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox‚Äôs one-handed ‚Äòadaptive joystick</a>‚Äô controller is now available. What are your thoughts on a solar-powered PlayStation controller?

<p>In recent months, the AI industry's biggest boosters have started converging on a public expectation that we're <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/ai-versus-the-brain-and-the-race-for-general-intelligence/">on the verge of ‚Äúartificial general intelligence‚Äù</a> (AGI)‚Äîvirtual agents that can match or surpass "human-level" understanding and performance on most cognitive tasks.</p>
<p>OpenAI is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/what-does-phd-level-ai-mean-openais-rumored-20000-agent-plan-explained/">quietly seeding expectations for a "PhD-level" AI agent</a> that could operate autonomously at the level of a "high-income knowledge worker" in the near future. Elon Musk <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/elon-musk-ai-will-be-smarter-than-any-human-around-the-end-of-next-year/">says</a>&nbsp;that "we'll have AI smarter than any one human probably" by the end of 2025. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei thinks it might take a bit longer but similarly <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/anthropic-chief-says-ai-could-surpass-almost-all-humans-at-almost-everything-shortly-after-2027/">says</a> it's plausible that AI will be "better than humans at almost everything" by the end of 2027.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">A few researchers at Anthropic have, over the past year, had a part-time obsession with a peculiar problem.</p>
<p>Can Claude play Pok√©mon?</p>
<p>A thread: <a href="https://t.co/K8SkNXCxYJ">pic.twitter.com/K8SkNXCxYJ</a></p>
<p>‚Äî Anthropic (@AnthropicAI) <a href="https://twitter.com/AnthropicAI/status/1894419011569344978?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Last month, Anthropic presented its ‚ÄúClaude Plays Pok√©mon‚Äù experiment as a waypoint on the road to that predicted AGI future. It's a project the company <a href="https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/1894419011569344978">said</a> shows "glimmers of AI systems that tackle challenges with increasing competence, not just through training but with generalized reasoning." Anthropic made headlines by <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/visible-extended-thinking">trumpeting</a> how Claude 3.7 Sonnet‚Äôs "improved reasoning capabilities" let the company's latest model make progress in the popular old-school Game Boy RPG in ways "that older models had little hope of achieving."</p>
<p>While Claude models from just a year ago struggled even to leave the game‚Äôs opening area, Claude 3.7 Sonnet was able to make progress by collecting multiple in-game Gym Badges in a relatively small number of in-game actions. That breakthrough, Anthropic wrote, was because the ‚Äúextended thinking‚Äù by Claude 3.7 Sonnet means the new model "plans ahead, remembers its objectives, and adapts when initial strategies fail" in a way that its predecessors didn‚Äôt. Those things, Anthropic brags, are "critical skills for battling pixelated gym leaders. And, we posit, in solving real-world problems too."</p>

<p>But relative success over previous models is not the same as absolute success over the game in its entirety. In the weeks since Claude Plays Pok√©mon was first made public, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/claudeplayspokemon/">thousands of Twitch viewers</a> have watched Claude struggle to make consistent progress in the game. Despite long "thinking" pauses between each move‚Äîduring which viewers can read printouts of the system‚Äôs simulated reasoning process‚ÄîClaude frequently finds itself pointlessly revisiting completed towns, getting stuck in blind corners of the map for extended periods, or fruitlessly talking to the same unhelpful NPC over and over, to cite just a few examples of distinctly sub-human in-game performance.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>

<p>Watching Claude continue to struggle at a game designed for children, it‚Äôs hard to imagine we‚Äôre witnessing the genesis of some sort of computer superintelligence. But even Claude‚Äôs current sub-human level of Pok√©mon performance could hold significant lessons for the quest toward generalized, human-level artificial intelligence.</p>

<h2>Smart in different ways</h2>
<p>In some sense, it‚Äôs impressive that Claude can play Pok√©mon with any facility at all. When developing AI systems that find dominant strategies in games like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/05/googles-alphago-ai-beats-worlds-best-human-go-player/">Go</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/08/ai-bot-takes-on-the-pros-at-dota-2-and-wins/"><em>Dota 2</em></a>, engineers generally start their algorithms off with deep knowledge of a game‚Äôs rules and/or basic strategies, as well as a reward function to guide them toward better performance. For Claude Plays Pok√©mon, though, project developer and Anthropic employee David Hershey says he started with an unmodified, generalized Claude model that wasn‚Äôt specifically trained or tuned to play Pok√©mon games in any way.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is purely the various other things that [Claude] understands about the world being used to point at video games,‚Äù Hershey told Ars. ‚ÄúSo it has a sense of a Pok√©mon. If you go to claude.ai and ask about Pok√©mon, it knows what Pok√©mon is based on what it's read‚Ä¶ If you ask, it'll tell you there's eight gym badges, it'll tell you the first one is Brock‚Ä¶ it knows the broad structure.‚Äù</p>

<p>In addition to directly monitoring certain key (emulated) Game Boy RAM addresses for game state information, Claude views and interprets the game's visual output much like a human would. But despite <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/farewell-photoshop-googles-new-ai-lets-you-edit-images-by-asking/">recent advances in AI image processing</a>, Hershey said Claude still struggles to interpret the low-resolution, pixelated world of a Game Boy screenshot as well as a human can. ‚ÄúClaude's still not particularly good at understanding what's on the screen at all,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou will see it attempt to walk into walls all the time.‚Äù</p>

          
                  </div>

<p>Hershey said he suspects Claude‚Äôs training data probably doesn‚Äôt contain many overly detailed text descriptions of ‚Äústuff that looks like a Game Boy screen.‚Äù This means that, somewhat surprisingly, if Claude were playing a game with ‚Äúmore realistic imagery, I think Claude would actually be able to see a lot better,‚Äù Hershey said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt's one of those funny things about humans that we can squint at these eight-by-eight pixel blobs of people and say, ‚ÄòThat's a girl with blue hair,‚Äô‚Äù Hershey continued. ‚ÄúPeople, I think, have that ability to map from our real world to understand and sort of grok that... so I'm honestly kind of surprised that Claude's as good as it is at being able to see there's a person on the screen.‚Äù</p>
<p>Even with a perfect understanding of what it‚Äôs seeing on-screen, though, Hershey said Claude would still struggle with 2D navigation challenges that would be trivial for a human. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty easy for me to understand that [an in-game] building is a building and that I can‚Äôt walk through a building,‚Äù Hershey said. ‚ÄúAnd that's [something] that's pretty challenging for Claude to understand‚Ä¶ It's funny because it's just kind of smart in different ways, you know?‚Äù</p>

<p>Where Claude tends to perform better, Hershey said, is in the more text-based portions of the game. During an in-game battle, Claude will readily notice when the game tells it that an attack from an electric-type Pok√©mon is ‚Äúnot very effective‚Äù against a rock-type opponent, for instance.&nbsp;Claude will then squirrel that factoid away in a massive written knowledge base for future reference later in the run. Claude can also integrate multiple pieces of similar knowledge into pretty elegant battle strategies, even extending those strategies into long-term plans for catching and managing teams of multiple creatures for future battles.</p>

<p>Claude can even show surprising ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù when Pok√©mon‚Äôs in-game text is intentionally misleading or incomplete. ‚ÄúIt's pretty funny that they tell you you need to go find Professor Oak next door and then he's not there,‚Äù Hershey said of an early-game task. ‚ÄúAs a 5-year-old, that was very confusing to me. But Claude actually typically goes through that same set of motions where it talks to mom, goes to the lab, doesn't find [Oak], says, ‚ÄòI need to figure something out‚Äô‚Ä¶ It's sophisticated enough to sort of go through the motions of the way [humans are] actually supposed to learn it, too.‚Äù</p>

<p>These kinds of relative strengths and weaknesses when compared to ‚Äúhuman-level‚Äù play reflect the overall state of AI research and capabilities in general, Hershey said. ‚ÄúI think it's just a sort of universal thing about these models... We built the text side of it first, and the text side is definitely... more powerful. How these models can reason about images is getting better, but I think it's a decent bit behind.‚Äù</p>
<h2>Forget me not</h2>
<p>Beyond issues parsing text and images, Hershey also acknowledged that Claude can have trouble ‚Äúremembering‚Äù what it has already learned. The current model has a ‚Äúcontext window‚Äù of 200,000 tokens, limiting the amount of relational information it can store in its ‚Äúmemory‚Äù at any one time. When the system‚Äôs ever-expanding knowledge base fills up this context window, Claude goes through an elaborate summarization process, condensing detailed notes on what it has seen, done, and learned so far into shorter text summaries that lose some of the fine-grained details.</p>
<p>This can mean that Claude ‚Äúhas a hard time keeping track of things for a very long time and really having a great sense of what it's tried so far,‚Äù Hershey said. ‚ÄúYou will definitely see it occasionally delete something that it shouldn't have. Anything that's not in your knowledge base or not in your summary is going to be gone, so you have to think about what you want to put there.‚Äù</p>

<p>More than forgetting important history, though, Claude runs into bigger problems when it inadvertently inserts incorrect information into its knowledge base. Like a conspiracy theorist who builds an entire worldview from an inherently flawed premise, Claude can be incredibly slow to recognize when an error in its self-authored knowledge base is leading its Pok√©mon play astray.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe things that are written down in the past, it sort of trusts pretty blindly,‚Äù Hershey said. ‚ÄúI have seen it become very convinced that it found the exit to [in-game location] Viridian Forest at some specific coordinates, and then it spends hours and hours exploring a little small square around those coordinates that are wrong instead of doing anything else. It takes a very long time for it to decide that that was a ‚Äòfail.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<p>Still, Hershey said Claude 3.7 Sonnet is much better than earlier models at eventually ‚Äúquestioning its assumptions, trying new strategies, and keeping track over long horizons of various strategies to [see] whether they work or not.‚Äù While the new model will still ‚Äústruggle for really long periods of time‚Äù retrying the same thing over and over, it will ultimately tend to ‚Äúget a sense of what's going on and what it‚Äôs tried before, and it stumbles a lot of times into actual progress from that,‚Äù Hershey said.</p>

<h2>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting pretty close‚Ä¶‚Äù</h2>
<p>One of the most interesting things about observing Claude Plays Pok√©mon across multiple iterations and restarts, Hershey said, is seeing how the system‚Äôs progress and strategy can vary quite a bit between runs. Sometimes Claude will show it's ‚Äúcapable of actually building a pretty coherent strategy‚Äù by ‚Äúkeeping detailed notes about the different paths to try,‚Äù for instance, he said. But ‚Äúmost of the time it doesn't‚Ä¶ most of the time, it wanders into the wall because it's confident it sees the exit.‚Äù</p>

<p>One of the biggest things preventing the current version of Claude from getting better, Hershey said, is that ‚Äúwhen it derives that good strategy, I don't think it necessarily has the self-awareness to know that one strategy [it] came up with is better than another.‚Äù And that‚Äôs not a trivial problem to solve.</p>
<p>Still, Hershey said he sees ‚Äúlow-hanging fruit‚Äù for improving Claude‚Äôs Pok√©mon play by improving the model‚Äôs understanding of Game Boy screenshots. ‚ÄúI think there's a chance it could beat the game if it had a perfect sense of what's on the screen,‚Äù Hershey said, saying that such a model would probably perform ‚Äúa little bit short of human.‚Äù</p>
<p>Expanding the context window for future Claude models will also probably allow those models to ‚Äúreason over longer time frames and handle things more coherently over a long period of time,‚Äù Hershey said. Future models will improve by getting ‚Äúa little bit better at remembering, keeping track of a coherent set of what it needs to try to make progress,‚Äù he added.</p>

<p>Whatever you think about impending improvements in AI models, though, Claude‚Äôs current performance at Pok√©mon doesn‚Äôt make it seem like it‚Äôs poised to usher in an explosion of human-level, completely generalizable artificial intelligence. And Hershey allows that watching Claude 3.7 Sonnet get stuck on Mt. Moon for 80 hours or so can make it ‚Äúseem like a model that doesn't know what it's doing.‚Äù</p>
<p>But Hershey is still impressed at the way that Claude's new reasoning model will occasionally show some glimmer of awareness and ‚Äúkind of tell that it doesn't know what it's doing and know that it needs to be doing something different. And the difference between ‚Äòcan't do it at all‚Äô and ‚Äòcan kind of do it‚Äô is a pretty big one for these AI things for me,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúYou know, when something can kind of do something it typically means we're pretty close to getting it to be able to do something really, really well.‚Äù</p>

Shiny Pok√©mon are coming to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pok√©mon TCG Pocket</a> as part of the game's next themed booster pack, Shining Revelry, which launches next week on Thursday, 27th March.
</p>
<p>
Cards featured in Pok√©mon TCG Pocket's next pack include fan-favourite Shiny creatures such as the cool-looking black Charizard, golden Lucario, and pink squirrel Pachirisu.
</p>
<p>
Shiny Pok√©mon are the ultra-rare alternate-coloured versions of regular creatures that have been found in the Pok√©mon games since the series' earliest days. Hunting for them, however, has grown in popularity more recently and been boosted further by the popularity of Shiny Pok√©mon in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pok√©mon Go</a>.

<p>
In Pok√©mon TCG Pocket, Shiny Pok√©mon cards will have their own sparkling effect when tilted. You'll also be able to buy a Shiny Charizard display board and binder. 
</p>
<p>
Shining Revelry will feature some non-Shiny creatures too, most notably Pok√©mon and characters from the recent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-scarlet-violet-walkthrough-tips-9015">Pok√©mon Scarlet and Violet</a> for Nintendo Switch, including sushi creature Tatsugiri and Grass-type Starter cat Sprigatito.
</p>
<p>
Next week will also see the arrival of Ranked Matches, with the gfirst in-game season beginnin next Friday, 28th March at 6am, and lasting for a month. Ranked Play will let you battle and achieve an emblem on your player profile that shows off your ultimate end-of-season rank.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-overhauls-trading-following-player-backlash">Pok√©mon TCG Pocket recently announced an overhaul to its trading feature following player backlash</a>, though the changes won't come into action until later this year. In the meantime, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-pokemon-tcg-pockets-success-digimon-getting-free-to-play-mobile-card-game">long-time rival Digimon is also getting into the action</a>. Digimon Alysion, a free-to-play smartphone card game, is now in development.

<p>The two studios describe&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>as "an intense new spin on the classic action-shooter" that you can experience either solo or in co-op play. According to a press release,&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>will support "online co-op for up to three players", which is a little odd given that it has four playable characters.</p>

<p>In any case, the game is promising "gruesomely detailed gothic environments" and the chance to "blast your way through hordes of demons and titanic terrors", so it sounds very much like Saber and Anshar are hoping to give Bethesda's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marty-stratton-dark-ages-like-nothing-players-have-had-their-hands-on-in-doom-game" rel="nofollow">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>&nbsp;</em>a run for its money.</p>

Rejoice.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will boast an emphasis on traversal, promising the ability to "jump, dash and hook" across each stage while engaging in "bloody, fast-paced combat". You can also look forward to a host of new weapons, as well as the return of some of the original's classic arsenal.</p>

<p>Four playable characters will be available: Ink, Void, Sol, and Roch. They'll each have "unique perks" you can take advantage of, and your abilities are upgradeable via the use of signature&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>tarot cards as well.</p>

<p>It sounds as though those extra characters will be crucial to&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>, too, since the game will replace your co-op buddies with bots if you're playing on your own.</p>

<p>All of this will, according to Saber and Anshar, be set to a "powerful metal soundtrack". There's no other genre suitable for this kind of thing, really, but if Judas Priest's "Painkiller" doesn't feature in this game, I will be very disappointed indeed.</p>




<p>Saber and Anshar's&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>reboot comes to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300120/Painkiller/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013491" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/p/9NMSW622HWNH" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> in the fall. Stay tuned for more.</p>
