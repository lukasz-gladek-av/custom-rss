<p>We wouldn't HATE it if he was correct</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Yes, we already reported a little while back that well-known YouTuber, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NatetheHate">NateTheHate</a>, has suggested that a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/rumour-a-nintendo-direct-is-set-to-take-place-later-this-month-its-claimed">Nintendo Direct is incoming</a> sometime in and around July. That's this month!</p>
<p>Speaking on his YouTube show, Mr TheHate (hope we got that right) had said that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What I have been told... There is a Direct this month, so the month of July. But, that Direct will not take place until after Donkey Kong Bananza releases. Beyond that, I have no additional information, I do not have information as to the exact timing at this point.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>If I had to speculate, I would say probably the last week of July because Friday of that week is August 1st, right, which is Nintendo's earning report day. So I could see them having a Direct that week leading to that investor's report."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it seems he has now doubled down on this belief, with precious little time left for it to transpire. As seen over <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">on on his social media</a> (cheers <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/07/23/natethehate-states-again-that-he-believes-nintendo-direct-happening-this-month/">MyNintendoNews</a>), in answering another poster, Nate reveals that "to my knowledge"the Direct is still on the cards.</p>
<figure><a title="DIRECT IN JULY?" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d7f16c52ccdeb/direct-in-july.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: x/@natethehate2</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nate has been reliable in the past, getting the Switch 2 announcement date correct, as an example, but we will all just have to wait and see with this one. At least there's not too long to go either way. One thing that may add a little credence, though, and it's something we've also reported on already, is that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/rumour-major-third-party-devs-reportedly-sitting-on-multiple-switch-2-announcements">a whole bunch of major devs are sitting on "multiple Switch 2 announcements".</a></p>
<p>Let's keep our fingers crossed that he's right, and a big juicy content drop is just around yonder corner.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Reckon there'll be a Direct in the window Nate points out? Looking forward to anything being announced in particular? make sure to let us know in the comments!</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Square Enix and Tactic Studios have announced that the multiplayer murder mystery game KILLER INN will host a Closed Beta Test this weekend on Steam. The CBT is set to begin on Friday, July 25, 2025 at 3 PM Pacific Time and will be live until Monday, July 28, 2025 at 3 PM Pacific Time. Access can be requested <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1598230/KILLER_INN/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via the store page</a>.</p>



<p>The developers warned that this is first and foremost a test meant to verify how the servers hold up when a large number of players join the game at the same time. This version also lacks the tutorials that will be available when the game actually launches in the near future.</p>



<p>KILLER INN is an asymmetrical competitive game where players are divided into two teams. The larger group (16) of players is called Lambs and faces off against a smaller group (8) of Wolves. Each team must reduce the other team's ranks through combat—the first team to eliminate all of the other team's members wins. The difference is that the Wolves know who their teammates are from the start, but the Lambs don't know which of their teammates may actually be a Wolf.</p>



<p>Whenever a Wolf kills a Lamb, at least one clue is left behind. Lambs must gather these clues to figure out the Wolves' identities. When coming across a corpse, players must ensure to pick up any clues on it, as this is an essential aspect of the game. To survive, players will need weapons and armor. They can get them either by opening chests with tokens earned after completing quests for the castle's staff members in the castle, or saving up gold to buy items from the in-game shop.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles' Classic mode, which will allow players to experience the original game released back in 1997 on the first PlayStation, has been built from scratch, as the original source code has been lost, but this allowed the development team to add content that was cut from the original release.</p>



<p>In a new post shared on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/21/the-secrets-behind-final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-makeover/">Official PlayStation Blog</a>, the game's director Kazutoyo Maehiro confirmed once again that the Classic mode, which attempts to recreate the original as faithfully as possible, has been created from scratch, as the original master data and source code have been lost. As Maehiro-san highlighted, back in the day, developers didn't have effective resource management tools as they do today, and games were essentially developed by overwriting the previous code every time a bug was fixed or a language option was added.</p>



<p>As the Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles Classic mode is meant to provide an experience faithful to the original, the development team also had the option of emulating the original, but doing so would have prevented them from making granular improvements. Eventually, it was decided that the best option would be to rebuild the original game from scratch. This choice paid off in a big way, as recreating the original experience gave the team a solid foundation upon which to create the Enhanced version, and add features that were cut from the original, such as character dialogues playing during battles under certain conditions that will help flesh out story character after they have joined Ramza's party. This is, in my opinion, a great addition, as it was sad to see this characters slide in the background and essentially become like generic units.</p>



<p>Although Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles will include some new features not seen in the original, it may not be the definitive edition some were waiting for, as tt won't feature the additional content seen in the War of the Lions PSP release, upon which the mobile release is based. <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-tactics-interview">The decision</a> to not include this extra content was made because the remaster's main goal was to be as faithful to the original as possible.</p>



<p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles launches on September 30th on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft’s push to separate the concept of Xbox games from the Xbox console itself has always felt a little...annoying?

However, the really significant aspect of this detaching of the games from the machines is the releasing of once-Xbox exclusives onto Sony’s consoles. And in the case of flagship release&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, it’s proven such an enormous success that the game has outsold everything else released on the PS5 this year.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197533" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why People Are Rushing To Sell Their Xbox Series X To GameStop Right Now" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="105" data-playlist="197533,196181,197567" data-current="197533"><div><p>Why People Are Rushing To Sell Their Xbox Series X To GameStop Right Now</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197533/197533_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197533/197533_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197533/197533_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23065.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p> While we should always take industry analysis figures with a bucket of salt, it’s being reported by the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/forza-horizon-5-is-now-2025s-top?just_subscribed=true&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/forza-horizon-5-is-now-2025s-top?just_subscribed=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alinea Insight newsletter</a></span> (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xboxs-forza-horizon-5-is-the-top-selling-new-ps5-game-of-2025&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xboxs-forza-horizon-5-is-the-top-selling-new-ps5-game-of-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thanks <em>GI.biz</em></a></span>) that <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> has now sold over 3 million copies on the PS5, pushing it ahead of <em>Monster Hunter World</em>, and seeing it outselling last year’s PlayStation exclusives <em>Astro Bot</em> in a third of the time, and far ahead of one of this year’s big PS5 launches, <em>Death Stranding 2</em>, which Alinea says has sold one million over the last month, but is now leveling out. </p><p>Platform exclusivity has long been held as vital for the success of a console, ensuring people are forced to pick up <em>this</em> $500 box rather than <em>that</em> one. And once you’ve got your customer locked in, they’re yours for the generation. This led to the nonsense of the “console wars,” a successful marketing campaign of tribalist disharmony that’s still fought out in the comments sections and X replies to this day. Gross. But <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/console-wars-are-over-ps5-xbox-forza-switch-2-sony-1851752956&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/console-wars-are-over-ps5-xbox-forza-switch-2-sony-1851752956">as Zack observed at the beginning of this year</a></span>, that era is now over. And the signifying factor? The announcement that lifelong Xbox exclusive racing franchise <em>Forza </em>was to see its games released on bitter rival Sony’s PlayStation.</p><p>This <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-playstation-xbox-fans-react-angry-1851752763&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-playstation-xbox-fans-react-angry-1851752763">bemused audiences</a></span> who had spent decades as the target of inculcating campaigns of division, many genuinely upset as they perceived that their brand loyalty was being betrayed. But if any argued that it would fail, that door is well closed. According to Alinea, what drove <em>FH5</em> into the lead was a recent 25 percent off sale.</p><p>The weird thing is, as much as it may upset those who formed parasocial relationship with their console manufacturer, this is pretty much a win for everyone involved. Most importantly as far as we’re concerned, it means more people get to enjoy a truly fantastic game without having to buy a whole new console or PC. But it also means millions more dollars for both Microsoft <em>and</em> Sony, given that the PlayStation owner will be getting a likely 30 percent of every sale.</p><p>Obviously, Microsoft’s moves are in a large part a tacit admission of having lost this console generation—it was reported last year <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-outselling-xbox-50-million-data-sony-microsoft-1851243811&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-outselling-xbox-50-million-data-sony-microsoft-1851243811">that the PS5 could be outselling the Xbox Series two to one</a></span>, although some estimates claimed it difference <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.techradar.com/gaming/the-ps5-is-massively-outselling-the-xbox-series-x-and-s-combined-analyst-claims&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/the-ps5-is-massively-outselling-the-xbox-series-x-and-s-combined-analyst-claims" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">could be as much as five times</a></span>. If you’ve got millions more people owning a PlayStation, it makes a lot of sense to sell your games to them, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-ceo-phil-spencer-console-wars-over-ps5-switch-era-1851765304&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-ceo-phil-spencer-console-wars-over-ps5-switch-era-1851765304">even if you’re losing a third on each sale</a></span>.</p><p>This means we’ll likely see former Xbox exclusives now hitting PS5 on day one—<em>Forza Horizon 6</em> could be an example. The argument for Xbox remains that these games will also be on Game Pass, with that accompanying sense of being “free.” Meanwhile, Sony still refuses to put its own first-party games straight onto its own subscription service, PS Plus, and is certainly showing no signs of reciprocating when it comes to launching its games on Microsoft’s consoles.</p><p>It all makes for far more interesting times, and if nothing else, hopefully the increased sales might stop sodding Microsoft from closing more studios.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-5-playstation-ps5-microsoft-xbox-1851786765]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Blizzard co-founder Mike Morhaime has launched a new live-service game with the new publisher he co-founded, Dreamhaven.</p>
<p>Wildgate - not to be confused with Splitgate 2, which has just gone back into beta - is a crew-based first-person space shooter available now across PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5.</p>
<p>It's been developed by Moonshot Games, one of two developers under the Dreamhaven umbrella. The other is Secret Door, which recently launched its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sunderfolk-from-former-world-of-warcraft-boss-is-streamlined-tabletop-dd-by-way-of-final-fantasy-crystal-chronicles-and-some-is-hidden-on-your-mobile">tabletop-inspired RPG Sunderfolk</a>.</p>

<p>Wildgate casts players as "prospectors", teaming up and exploring space in search of an ancient relic known as the Artifact. Crews must either collect the Artifact and safely reach the exit, or destroy all rival ships to dominate space.</p>
<p>It's all presented in an over-the-top cartoonish style, filled with colourful alien characters and a vibrant sci-fi aesthetic.</p>
<p>"The response to Wildgate's open beta was incredible," said Morhaime. "It was truly inspiring to see so many players teaming up, jumping in, and having fun.</p>
<p>"Wildgate represents what Dreamhaven believes games can be: rich, imaginative, and deeply engaging. We're just beginning to open the gate to a galaxy full of wonder, strategy, and discovery, and we hope the game resonates with players of all kinds."</p>
<p>The development team has already shared its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3504780/view/530976484112732607">planned roadmap</a>, including bi-weekly updates, mid-season patches, and seasonal content drops.</p>
<p>"We're also going to present a few opportunities for players to purchase in-game content; however, our goal for paid content in Wildgate is for it to remain cosmetic and opt-in," the developer said.</p>
<p>At Blizzard, Morhaime was heavily involved in the development of World of Warcraft, and was CEO during the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>.</p>
<p>No doubt Morhaime and Dreamhaven will be hoping for live-service success with Wildgate, despite the difficulties of launching a new game in this genre.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> is finally getting a reveal livestream tomorrow, where the public will be able to get their first look at the upcoming modern FPS in-action.
</p>
<p>The livestream will take place on the 24th July, at 4PM BST / 5PM CEST / 11AM EST / 8AM PST. You can watch it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgNCgJG0vnY&amp;ab_channel=Battlefield">the official Battlefield YouTube channel, right here</a>!
</p>
<p>The livestream will be the first <em>official</em> reveal of Battlefield 6 for those who haven't been able to jump into the game's closed beta tests, which have been running over the past few months. There's no word as of writing what exactly will be shown, nor the exact length of the trailer we'll be seeing.

<p>Despite there being little revealed from the game's developers or publishers, there have been some leaked details in recent months. Earlier this month leaks <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-image-suggests-the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-called-battlefield-6-and-the-reveal-event-is-coming-very-soon">indicated that the game would in-fact be called Battlefield 6</a>. Details on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-single-player-campaign-details-leak-online">Battlefield 6's single player component</a> have also crept out, plus the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-leak-confirms-return-of-fan-favourite-mode">fan-favourite Rush mode</a>.
</p>
<p>Information on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-most-important-leaks-battlefield-6">Battlefield 6 weapons and the game's battle royale mode</a> have also been sneakily dropped by closed beta testers. Reporting has also claimed that lofty expectations have been levied against Battlefield 6, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reportedly-expects-battlefield-6-to-have-100-million-players-three-times-more-than-the-series-best-seller">with a 100m player figure established internally</a> for the main game and its free-to-play battle royale.
</p>
<p>Excitement for Battlefield 6 is palpable among FPS lovers and series diehards alike. This group <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-youre-worried-about-one-of-battlefield-6s-most-controversial-design-changes-dice-just-confirmed-your-fears">has been torn as of late due when it comes to classes</a>. In the past, weapons and gadgets have been locked to these dedicated classes, and old fans love this system. A classless approach has been announced for Battlefield 6, though official Battlefield social media accounts has recently announced <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1947310614411616383">playlists for both class and classless matches</a>.

<figure><a title="grounded peer to peer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/29ce1cc0c3a7d/grounded-peer-to-peer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Obsidian</em></figcaption></figure><p>We reviewed Obsidian's excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grounded">Grounded</a> back when it released on Switch last year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/grounded">giving it a 7/10</a> and remarking that it was really only the game's performance on the console that held it back from a much better score.</p>
<p>Indeed, Grounded, when it's running well, is perhaps one of our favourite survival games of the past console generation or two. With this in mind, and given that the game does now perform better if you happen to have a Switch 2 (well, it's much less blurry, that's for sure), Switch players may be wondering if it's going to suddenly disappear, now that the dev has moved onto the final prep phase for Grounded 2 (which sadly is only aiming at xbox and PC, for now).</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067zvkjyr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Thankfully, during an interview (thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-not-going-anywhere-if-people-still-want-to-play-it-as-grounded-2-gets-ready-to-launch-obsidian-promises-its-not-the-end-of-the-road-for-the-original-game">Eurogamer</a>) the game's executive producer, Marcus Morgan, has said that, "We actually have this strong passion to ensure our games can stand the test of time and keep updating through history...There's a strong desire on our side to make sure that our games are preserved,"</p>
<p>He continued, "Now, are we going to be doing content and these story expansions to Grounded 1? No, that's the continuation of Grounded 2. But even as recently as April we released 1.4.7 to Grounded 1, so there's a maintenance and a desire that that game will always exist. So we'll keep that up, it's not going anywhere if people still want to play Grounded 1 as well." They did also give us gyro controls in an update last year, so you can't knock the enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Recently, of course, there's been a little extra attention on what happens with games when they've had their time in the limelight, with groups such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/it-will-have-a-chilling-effect-on-game-design-eu-group-responds-to-stop-killing-games">Stop Killing Games</a> drawing attention to the issues faced when games are taken offline.</p>
<p>To this end, Morgan gets a little more detailed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"One of the things that we did in terms of how we structured Grounded is multiplayer is done through peer-to-peer, which in first blush, feels antiquated versus dedicated servers. But we were able to blend that with shared worlds, and what that does is it allows you, effectively, a cloud save that you can share with your friends. So it gives that experience of being able to have a more dedicated server vibe, but it doesn't have that same requirement of actually having servers.</p>
<p>And this is no commentary on the Stop Killing Games stuff or anything like that...More to say it does establish (the game) so it can exist into the future a lot easier than if you're on the other side, where you are more of a server-based game."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, while we wait and hope that Grounded gets one last switch drop in the form of a gentle Switch 2 upgrade (you know you want to, Obsidian), us Grounded fans can at least rest assured in the knowledge that the game isn't just gonna disappear on us. Probably.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a> is being taken "back to beta" by developers 1047 Games, who say it "launched too early" and are now planning to rerelease it next year. The move has reportedly seen the studio lay off 45 workers, and they've confirmed that the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splitgate">Splitgate</a>'s servers will be shutting down in a month's time.</p>
<p>The news comes following a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splitgate-2-remains-a-portal-hopping-fps-delight-but-it-really-needs-to-lighten-up">mixed launch reception</a> for the portal-filled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>, which likely wasn't helped by studio CEO Ian Proulx controversially announcing that it was going live while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splitgate-2-boss-admits-the-trumpish-hat-he-wore-at-summer-game-fest-was-a-publicity-stunt-after-it-goes-sour">wearing a MAGA-style “Make FPS Great Again” hat</a> on stage at Summer Game Fest. The exec subsequently apologised for that boneheaded publicity stunt.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In an update posted to the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2918300/view/510712444576860070?l=english">Steam page</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/1947717804364353641">socials</a> Proulx and fellow 1047 Games co-founder Nicholas Bagamian wrote that they "had ambitious goals with Splitgate 2", but "rushed certain features, made some boneheaded mistakes, and most importantly – we didn't give you the polished, portal-filled mayhem you fell in love with".</p>
<p>So, the game is returning to beta until early 2026, with the studio promising a major overhaul that'll include "reworking progression from the ground up, adding more portals to our maps, simplifying monetisation, refocusing on classic game modes you've been asking for, and more". Though, 1047 say Splitgate 2'll remain playable in the interim, with its Chapter 3 update and some bug fixes still incoming.</p>
<p>The update acknowledged that this decision has been accompanied by layoffs at the studio, but didn't state how many. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-will-go-back-to-beta-to-undergo-a-massive-rework-amid-more-layoffs-and-splitgate-1-shutdown?utm_source=threads,twitter">IGN</a> reports that 45 workers have been affected. This is the second round of job cuts at 1047 this year, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/following-their-hat-and-pricing-controversies-splitgate-2-studio-1047-games-have-laid-off-an-unspecified-number-of-devs">an unspecified number of devs having been let go</a> in June.</p>
<p>The studio are also planning to shut down the original Splitgate's servers in a month's time. "While we'd love to keep servers online indefinitely, it's cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars over the past couple of years, and we have to prioritize our team," Proulx and Bagamian wrote. "Like us, we know this game means a lot to so many of you, so we are exploring the possibility of supporting offline or peer-to-peer matches."</p>
<p>Hopefully the folks affected by these layoffs can land on their feet.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splitgate-2-devs-1047-games-lay-off-more-staff-as-the-shooter-heads-back-to-beta-eyeing-a-2026-rerelease]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Obsidian has given Eurogamer a good indication of how long Grounded 2 will be in early access for, and whether the game will come to PlayStation and other platforms besides Xbox and PC.</p>
<p>As with the original ant-sized backyard survival game, Grounded 2 will launch in early access, starting next week, from 29th July. But how long will it remain in open development for? "As long as we need to to get the game right," executive producer Marcus Morgan told me.</p>
<p>"We don't plan on being in early access forever," he added, "but you definitely need the time. We were in early access for Grounded 1 for about two years and that gave us enough time to meaningfully take community feedback and actually adjust the game. Roughly that window again, but the appropriate amount of time to make it right."</p>

<figcaption>Grounded was one of the first Xbox-exclusive games to travel to other platforms, but there were a few teething issues.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJqr2IZp2m0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>Grounded 2 will be a PC and Xbox game because Obsidian is a Microsoft-owned studio. But Grounded was also one of the series Microsoft experimented with offering on other platforms, on PlayStation and Nintendo Switch. Those versions launched last year and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-console-exclusive-just-topped-europes-ps5-download-charts">they seem to have performed well</a>. Tonally speaking, Grounded is a perfect fit for Switch, and though there were performance issues on original Switch hardware, we are now of course in the era of the more powerful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>Will Grounded 2 come to other platforms besides PC and Xbox, then? Marcus Morgan smiled when I asked him this, specifically about a PlayStation release, then said, "Can't talk about that right now. But I will say that Grounded 1 is on all of those platforms so..." And then he smiled again.</p>
<p>Grounded 2 will bring a bevy of new ideas to the Grounded formula, notably insect mounts to ride around a much larger playing world in, that of Brookhollow Park, which will have ice dungeons and other varied biomes to explore. There are also deeper gameplay systems now and added nuance in combat, which lends the game much more staying power and interest over time.</p>
<p>I can tell you more about Grounded 2 when the embargo on early access impressions lifts on 29th July.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/will-grounded-2-come-to-playstation-and-switch-2-grounded-was-on-all-those-platforms-teases-obsidian-executive-producer]]></content:encoded>

            <p>They do say pride comes before a fall, and despite donning <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-director-apologises-for-causing-division-following-controversial-summer-game-fest-appearance">a hat proclaiming "Make FPS Great Again" at Summer Game Fest earlier this year</a>, studio founder Ian Proulx and 1047 Games are putting Splitgate 2 back into the beta box. Not only that, the studio is also taking the original Splitgate offline and laying off members of staff. </p>
<p>In a statement shared on Tuesday addressing the Splitgate 2 community, the studio admitted  it had exited the sequel's initial beta far too early. "We had ambitious goals with Splitgate 2, and in our excitement to share it with you, we bit off more than we could chew. We rushed certain features, made some boneheaded mistakes, and most importantly - we didn't give you the polished, portal-filled mayhem you fell in love with," 1047 Games wrote.</p>
<p>As such, Splitgate 2 is going back into beta, less than two months after its official launch. The studio will now do a significant amount of rework on areas including progression, as well as adding more portals to maps and "simplifying" monetisation.</p>

<p>This rebuilding phase will last "until early next year", the developer said, and Splitgate 2 will remain playable during this time. The game's third chapter will still ship, and the team has promised "fixes and high priority changes" for those who stick around. "We hope you will continue to play and support the game," it wrote.</p>
<p>However, all of this has come with a human cost, and as a result of this decision the studio is laying off staff, and that's after it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-developer-1047-games-lays-off-small-group-of-valued-staff">already laid off other team members shortly after Splitgate 2's initial launch</a>. "This is heartbreaking. These are our teammates and our friends, and they helped build what we have today," 1047 Games said of the studio's most recent layoffs. According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-will-go-back-to-beta-to-undergo-a-massive-rework-amid-more-layoffs-and-splitgate-1-shutdown">IGN</a>, the number of those affected totals 45.</p>
<p>In closing, 1047 Games wrote: "We've faced a lot of dark days and have made many mistakes, but we've learned a lot and are as determined as ever to make Splitgate as great as possible. Splitgate has been our life for 10 years, and we wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
<p>"We've got work to do, but we aren't giving up."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5wMXD5U7aP5imdxB186rmg/d3ffd32ed3c2821d7e89d3c48d0ade35/Ubisoft_FY26_Q1_Sales_EN_vf.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reporting its Q1 2025 financial results</a>, Ubisoft revealed that Assassin's Creed Shadows continues to perform well. After reaching 3 million players <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-surpassed-3-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by the end of March</a>, the game has now surpassed 5 million unique players, who have collectively performed 2 billion stealth kills, traveled 1 billion kilometers, and petted 38 million animals. However, the publisher's quarterly financial results still reported lower than anticipated net bookings, mostly due to issues with Rainbow Six Siege, as noted in the below statement by Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot:</p>



<p><em>The first quarter delivered mixed results. On the positive side, Assassin’s Creed Shadows delivered on its expectations, with now more than 5 million unique players since its launch, and Rainbow Six Siege X received highly positive player feedback thanks to its renewed gameplay and enhanced features that drove significant player engagement growth. However, player spending in Rainbow Six Siege faced temporary but significant disruptions due to technical pricing issues, which have now been identified and addressed. Despite this one-off setback, the growth potential of the game is strong with solid traction on activity and in-game spending.</em></p>



<p>Ubisoft also noted that the other two causes for the lower net bookings include a 'partnership that is now expected to materialize in Q2 and, to a lesser extent, an unfavorable foreign exchange impact'.</p>



<p>Guillemot then added that Ubisoft will continue creating so-called Creative Houses. The hope is that these business units will boost creative vision and business performance. The first one is, of course, the subsidiary <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> earlier this year, which is set to oversee the Rainbow Six, Far Cry, and Assassin's Creed franchise. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-name-yves-guillemot-son-christophe-derennes-co-ceos-tencent-subsidiary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> recently, it will be led by Christopher Derennes and Yves Guillemot's own son.</p>



<p>As for the Assassin's Creed Shadows expansion, Claws of Awaji, Ubisoft only reiterated that it's coming in their fiscal Q2 and will offer more than 10 hours of new content, as well as a new weapon, skills, and abilities. <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-reportedly-set-for-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to rumors</a>, it might launch as early as September, although if that's truly the case, an official announcement will have to be made soon by the publisher.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, Bethesda Game Studios <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1947686948799389848" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a new beta update for Starfield on Steam. As usual, interested users can check it out by selecting the beta build in the game's tab via the Steam library. This is, however, a minor patch, as you can easily glean from the changelog:</p>



<p><strong><em>General</em></strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Minor improvements to format and display in Creations menus.</em></li>



<li><em>Addressed an issue that could cause that Extreme Temperature gear to appear incorrectly.</em></li>



<li><em>Minor improvements to sorting in the Missions Menu.</em></li>



<li><em>General crash and stability fixes.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>More interesting is the fact that Bethesda has reiterated its promise that 'exciting things' are on the way to Starfield, and more details about those will be revealed 'in the coming months'. The development studio had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-will-get-exciting-things-later-this-year-says-bethesda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> as much back in March, following a fairly long period of silence. </p>



<p>Game Director Todd Howard had previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-crossed-14-million-players-will-get-annual-story-expansions-shattered-space-set-on-single-planet-is-far-harbor-sized/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that the sci-fi roleplaying game would receive annual story expansions. However, the lack of any such announcement and today's reiteration that it will take months before we hear about those exciting new things all but confirms the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-second-expansion-unlikely-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumor</a> that the second expansion won't launch in 2025 after all.</p>



<p>This could perhaps be tied to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-port-happening-later-than-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allegedly delayed PlayStation 5 port</a>. Bethesda might want to bundle a second expansion when the game launches on Sony's console. Another side is that the developers are possibly trying to deliver a more impactful expansion after the underwhelming Shattered Space, which got a middling reception, including a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">6/10 score here</a> from Wccftech's Francesco De Meo:</p>



<p><em>The Starfield: Shattered Space expansion offers an engaging new story but adds little beyond that. Fans of the game's universe will appreciate spending more time in it and discovering a faction more complex than it appeared in the base game, but those who didn't enjoy Starfield or were primarily interested in its space exploration mechanics won't change their opinion with the expansion, as it doesn't address the vast majority of the issues that still plague the experience.</em></p>

<p>Now, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/borderlands-4-boss-confirms-there-will-be-a-download-even-for-physical-copies-on-switch-2-which-will-mostly-run-at-30-fps-with-some-dips/">in an interview with GamesRadar+</a>, Pitchford has shared some additional details about the upcoming Nintendo release. Firstly, the game will run at "mostly around 30fps", with some supposed dips during more intense moments.</p>
<p>This reportedly follows previous comments from Pitchford about how the <a href="https://gamingbolt.com/borderlands-4-is-targeting-60-fps-gearbox-ceo-addresses-balance-concerns">new entry was aiming for 60fps on consoles</a> – with the final decision about the frame rate in the Switch 2 version apparently based on the developer not wanting to "cut anything", including cross-play support.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-1ksWY9W4EA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-1ksWY9W4EA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-1ksWY9W4EA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-1ksWY9W4EA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed39956flqpmnt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1ksWY9W4EA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Randy Pitchford:</strong> "It was important to us to not cut anything and to support cross play with other platforms. So, no. It'll be mostly around 30 fps, with some dips in some intense moments, heavy combat or if hosting a multiplayer game in handheld mode, etc."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to this, it's also been confirmed the Switch 2 version of Borderlands 4 will require a download "even for physical copies" of the game – so expect a Game-Key Card release.</p>
<p>And as for the current <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/borderlands_3_ultimate_edition">Borderlands 3</a> performance issues on Switch 2, when asked about this, Pitchford noted how this title was obviously not made to run on the Switch 2. Gearbox will supposedly need "some help" and "some time" to see what it can do with this in the future, but for now, the focus is on Borderlands 4.</p>

<p>Following an update earlier this month, Toby Fox's latest game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a> has now been updated to Version 1.03.</p>
<p>This latest update includes improvements to Chapter 2, 3 and 4, along with various other changes. This includes multiple fixes across each chapter, including some softlock fixes, and there are also some fixes tied to minor graphical errors.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown (<a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/deltarune-1-02-update-out-now-patch-notes/" rel="noopener">via Nintendo Everything</a>):</p>
<h3>Deltarune Version 1.03</h3>
<p>Chapter 2</p>
<ul>
<li>[Switch 2-only] Fixed a softlock in the part where you catch mice in a basket on your head.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chapter 3</p>
<ul>
<li>Swords used in a certain boss’s “Sword Tunnel” attack now have a reduced hit box relative to the graphic, making the attack easier to dodge.</li>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wuchang-fallen-feathers-review.1250598/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a great time to be a fan of soulslikes. Between the fantastic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-berserker-khazan-review"><u>The First Berserker: Khazan</u></a> earlier in the year, the excellent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lies-of-p-overture-review"><u>Lies of P: Overture DLC</u></a> last month, and the multiplayer/co-op focused <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-review"><u>Elden Ring: Nightreign</u></a>, we have been eating well in 2025 – and you can add Wuchang: Fallen Feathers as yet another course in that meal. This debut game from developer Leenzee Games impressed me from the start with its exciting, fast-paced, and dynamic combat. It also has one of the best skill trees in the genre, along with intricate and interconnected level design that guides us through gorgeous vistas and grotesque sights in equal measure. That said, its difficulty is all over the place, with truly wild dips and spikes that go from a relative walk in the park, to “oh my god, when is it my turn to attack?!” levels of aggression in some of its later bosses. So while I’m left with a little whiplash after beating it, it’s still an easy strong recommendation for anybody who’s hungry for more.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Mitchell's Favorite Soulslikes</h3><p>My 15 favorite soulslike games, ranked. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In typical soulslike fashion, Wuchang expects you to do the heavy lifting when it comes to piecing together its story and lore – but it’s not handled quite as elegantly as a FromSoft game or something like Lies of P. I was actually on board for the intriguing opening, which shows our titular, mostly silent hero awaken in a cave to discover she has a disease that robs those afflicted of their memories and gradually turns them into hideous monsters. What starts as a personal journey to discover who she is and cure her affliction before she mutates into a nasty bird beast turns into a descent into dark fantasy as the mysteries of the disease, known as The Feathering, start to come to light and you do battle with those transfigured by its effects. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Lore fiends who enjoy digging into item descriptions might get more out of the story. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That was a good start, but by the end of its 45-hour campaign, I’d lost track of the many characters who pop up, say a few lines of dialogue, and then disappear for 10 or so hours until they pop up again in a completely new location. People kept referencing names that I’d never heard of before, making it impossible for me to follow the conversation. Lore fiends who enjoy digging into weapon and item descriptions for clues might get more out of the story than I did, but playing through it the same way I have many other games meant its big revelations largely fell flat. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>A Game of Skills</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat, though, had the flexibility and depth to carry me through to the end in style, with a ton of different offensive and defensive options at my disposal at all times. Where Wuchang sets itself apart from others that use the familiar stamina-fueled light and heavy attacks to get you from checkpoint to checkpoint is its huge focus on combining the skills and abilities that are tied to your weapons with Discipline skills you unlock on the absolutely massive skill tree. For instance, equipping the sword parry Discipline skill while using the Flamebringer Longsword weapon will let you build up the burn status ailment with its Infernal Firebrand Weapon Skill while also giving you a defensive counter option on top of that. Or you could pair that same weapon with something like Crescent Moon, which still gives you that same burn build ability, but also allows you to get in and then get out to avoid counter attacks all together while still being able to build Skybound Might with it’s built in evade. On top of that, you can swap between two weapons mid-fight, even mid-combo, which doubles your options. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s good that you have these extra options, too, because this is not a game where you can get by with just the basics, especially when it comes to the tougher fights. Powering your skills and spells hinges on generating a resource known as Skyborn Might, which is gained mostly by perfectly dodging enemy attacks at the last instant, but can also be gained in certain weapon-specific ways, such as landing the fourth hit of a light combo string with the Axe, the second hit of a light combo string with the Longsword, clashing weapons with the dual blades, or automatically over time simply by having the one-handed sword equipped.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I felt like I usually had more interesting decisions to make with each level up than I do in most soulslikes.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I had a blast discovering ways to incorporate both Weapon and Discipline skills into combat to get around limitations like stamina, since using a Skyborn Might charge often gives you a powerful attack that doesn’t deplete your meter, or lets you blow through an enemy’s strong defense with a poise break-afflicting mist and take huge chunks out of their health in seconds. I felt like I usually had more interesting decisions to make with each level up than I do in most soulslikes when it came to defining my build.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A big part of that is how instead of just boosting your preferred stat and making numbers go up each time you get enough currency to level, Wuchang uses a progression system that resembles the Sphere Grid from Final Fantasy X and Salt and Sanctuary. It has six paths to go down and unlock progressively more powerful skills, with five being devoted to stat and weapon upgrades enhancing each of the different types of armaments, and the last one focusing more on more universal boons, like extra healing charges, general buffs for executing certain techniques, etc. The grid is absolutely gigantic, and even 20 or 30 hours into the 45-hour campaign I was still unlocking brand-new branches with new Discipline skills and tons more upgrades to choose from. That’s a lot, but thankfully respecs are free, allowing you the freedom to change up your entire build with zero cost or penalty, whether to simply try out a new weapon or alter your game plan against a challenging boss. It’s an excellent system that encourages experimentation while also rewarding you for having a clear idea of what kind of build you want to make.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a fairly impressive amount of different types of enemies as well, with each area you visit packing plenty of new twisted creatures with a brand-new set of attacks and skills that you’ll need to learn how to adjust your build and your tactics to deal with. Everything in this game can be threatening: from the small hunchbacked dudes that go down in just one or two hits, but can sneak up on you with a hugely damaging grab, to the towering fiends that are almost like minibosses unto themselves. This variety kept the action fresh throughout the whole adventure and kept me tense whenever I would venture in a new area, since I never knew what to expect around the corner.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Bumpy Roads</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">For the first 10 or so hours, though, I didn’t have to do a ton of build tweaking to breeze through most of these fights. That wasn’t to say that it was a walk in the park, but I’ve played a lot of soulslikes in my day, and once I got the hang of dodging through the last hit of an enemy combo and charging up a heavy attack to instantly stagger them, I initially felt like I had figured Wuchang out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The deaths that I did experience mostly came from an abundance of some cheap-feeling “gotcha” moments like: <span tabindex="-1" role="button">Tap to Reveal</span> </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To be fair, lots of soulslikes have moments like these, but in Wuchang it happens with such frequency that it felt like I was getting constantly pranked by the developers – and at a certain point that joke gets old.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Other than that, it was mostly smooth sailing until I came across a boss called Commander Honglan. She wasn’t so much a difficulty spike, because that implies at least some degree of an incline or ramp up, as she was like running into a brick wall. She took me about two hours to beat, and while I still came out on the other side of it having mostly enjoyed the intensity of the fight, Honglan serves as a non-spoilery encapsulation of what I don’t like about several of Wuchang’s later boss fights. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Honglan wasn't so much a difficulty spike, because that implies at least some degree of an incline or ramp up. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest issue is that the punishment window for correctly and precisely dodging most of their attacks is super tight, which takes away from the satisfaction of actually being able to dodge a huge sequence of swings. Compare that to games like Sekiro or Khazan, where you’re damaging the boss’s posture bar every time you precisely block an attack, getting closer to being able to do a damaging critical hit once you completely drain it. There’s no such satisfying mid-fight progress here, because perfect dodges just give you Skyborn Might charges, which you still need to find an opening to be able to use. Wuchang does have a posture meter on enemies, but it only increases when you land hits and decreases after a time if you don’t, which makes it extremely difficult to get that reward for nuanced aggression when your opportunities to deal damage are so minimal and so fleeting. Not every boss fight after Honglan is like this, but the ones that are feel very drawn out to a degree that diminishes their fun. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Dark Descent</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The world all of these ups and downs take place in is rich with secrets to discover, interconnected paths that satisfyingly link entire sections of the map together, and tough optional challenges with appropriate rewards. I loved the gradual descent into dark fantasy – you begin in a very colorful and beautiful Chinese village that is <em>just </em>showing subtle signs of the terrible illness sweeping through its population, and then as you progress deeper underground and through areas that have been absolutely ravaged by The Feathering it starts to feel more and more like a horror game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also some really cleverly put together sequences that create tension and chaos even without combat being involved. One example is a section where you start on a straightaway with an enemy at the end who builds up an instant-killing status affliction called Despair just by looking at you. To evade his gaze and get through, I had to make a mad dash past a bunch of enemies, climb up a ramp while avoiding poisonous drops from the ceiling, and navigate around constantly spawning tough monsters that were created by another out-of-reach foe. It’s a great example of strong enemy design meshing with clever level design to create an absolutely intense sprint through a dangerous environment.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/wuchang-fallen-feathers-review]]></content:encoded>
