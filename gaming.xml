			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> last week, Bethesda Game Studios has just <a href="https://twitter.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1790052783183286435?t=hcEqTzxx-2tllly_Gdfo0g&amp;s=09" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the second update for Fallout 4 Next-Gen, the latest version of the RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fallout-4-review-a-welcoming-wasteland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originally launched in 2015</a>.</p>
<p>This patch fixes various outstanding bugs and, most importantly, adds more options to tweak graphics and performance for console users on PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to your feedback, we’ve been able to implement the ability to control your graphic fidelity and performance. We highly recommend you run with the default settings but now you can change your options to better fit your playstyle and display.</em></p>
<p><em>Frame Rate Target allows you to choose between 30, 40, and 60 (default). It is important to note that to select 40, your display must be able to support 120hz. You can now choose between Visuals and Performance (default) while trying to maintain frame rate target. If you choose Frame Rate Target of 60, we recommend selecting Performance. Both modes may adjust internal resolution dynamically when scenes or action get heavier. Please note both modes can only be changed from the main menu.</em></p>

<p>Fallout 4, just like Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 76, is having a bit of a renaissance thanks to the incredible popularity of the Prime Video TV show (which has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-officially-renewed-by-amazon-for-second-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned</a> a renewal for its second season). Bethesda's latest single player entry in the franchise has easily topped April sales in the United Kingdom.</p>

			<p>Back in 2022, Ubisoft announced that they were finally making a much-demanded trip to Feudal Japan with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/assassins-creed-red/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin’s Creed Red</a>, the latest open-world RPG take on the series from developer Ubisoft Quebec (Assassin's Creed Odyssey). It was always expected that Assassin’s Creed Red would eventually get a different title, Red was just a codename, and today, Ubisoft revealed it – Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>
<p>The Assassin’s Creed Shadows title was announced on X, alongside an image of an hourglass situated in what appears to be a modern Japanese setting. Ubisoft is promising a “countdown” will play out on their social media channels over the next couple of days. Ubisoft is also challenging fans to crack a puzzle connected to the hourglass, saying “those who succeed will be rewarded.” Hmmmm!</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Assassin's Creed Codename Red becomes Assassin's Creed Shadows.<br>
Tune-in for the Official Cinematic World Premiere Trailer on May 15, 9 AM PT.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AssassinsCreedShadows?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AssassinsCreedShadows</a> <a href="https://t.co/GF0BWqVOhS">pic.twitter.com/GF0BWqVOhS</a></p>
<p>— Ubisoft (@Ubisoft) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ubisoft/status/1790049608720125969?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As indicated by the tweet, we’ll get a full Assassin’s Creed Shadows reveal this coming Wednesday (May 15) at 9am PT. The Ubisoft Store now has an <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/ca/assassin-s-creed-shadows/660e5a03fbff4e2940488bcd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Assassin’s Creed Shadows landing page</a>, which also includes some images featuring mysterious number sequences. Hmmmm again!</p>
<p>For those who haven’t been keeping up with Assassin’s Creed Shadows, there have been a number of rumors from reliable sources about the game. The game is <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-red-to-feature-samurai-and-shinobi-as-main-characters-focus-on-stealth-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored to feature two main characters</a>, a male samurai, said to be based on real-life figure Yasuke, and a female shinobi/ninja, of which we know less about. The game will reportedly ramp up previous AC titles’ stealth gameplay, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-red-early-2024-reveal-destructible-environments-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Splinter-Cell-style mechanics and destructible environments</a> said to be in the mix. Of course, take all rumors with a grain of salt – we won’t have to wait too long to find out if some of them were true or not!</p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is strongly rumored to be launching sometime this year. Platforms have not been confirmed, but i<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassins-creed-shadows-formerly-red-will-have-its-premiere-on-may-15.869313/post-122913546" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nsider Shinobi has hinted it will be the series’ first current-gen-exclusive title</a>.</p>

<p>When Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches later this year, it’ll mark a new era for the franchise as it won’t be released on last-gen consoles.</p>



<p>According to multiple reports, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassins-creed-shadows-formerly-red-will-have-its-premiere-on-may-15.869313/page-2?post=122913546#post-122913546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including from notable insider Shinobi602</a>, Assassin’s Creed Shadows won’t release on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One. That means the game will be available only on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.  It marks the first time since those consoles launched in 2013 that the latest Assassin’s Creed games won’t be available on the platform.</p>



<p>Last year’s Assassin’s Creed Mirage released on all platforms aside from the Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>Back in 2022, <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/227nBAMiGtBTXKouvVkNyF/the-future-of-assassins-creed-feudal-japan-standalone-multiplayer-much-more">Ubisoft first mentioned</a> that Assassin’s Creed games starting with Red, now Shadows, would be built for “current-gen consoles”. It appears now, however, that the plans remain in place for that to happen.</p>



<p>“Starting with Assassin’s Creed Codename RED, games will be built specifically for current-gen consoles; the extra time in between allows the development teams to improve their Anvil engine to deliver a more polished experience,” the company said.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is scheduled to launch in the fall 2024. The game’s first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gets-first-trailer-on-may-15/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official cinematic trailer</a> is coming on May 15 with a full gameplay reveal planned for Ubisoft Forward on June 10.</p>

<p>The developers of team-based shooter <em>Marvel Rivals</em> have apologized for a contract clause that made creators promise not to provide "subjective negative reviews of the game" in exchange for early access to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/">a closed alpha test</a>.</p>
<p>The controversial early access contract gained widespread attention over the weekend when streamer Brandon Larned <a href="https://twitter.com/A_Seagull/status/1789468582281400792">shared a portion on social media</a>. In the "non-disparagement" clause shared by Larned, creators who are provided with an early download code are asked not to "make any public statements or engage in discussions that are detrimental to the reputation of the game." In addition to the "subjective negative review" example above, the clause also specifically prohibits "making disparaging or satirical comments about any game-related material" and "engaging in malicious comparisons with competitors or belittling the gameplay or differences of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>."</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Extremely disappointed in <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MarvelRivals</a>.</p>
<p>Multiple creators asked for key codes to gain access to the playtest and are asked to sign a contract.</p>
<p>The contract signs away your right to negatively review the game.</p>
<p>Many streamers have signed without reading just to play</p>
<p>Insanity. <a href="https://t.co/c11BUDyka9">pic.twitter.com/c11BUDyka9</a></p>
<p>— Brandon Larned (@A_Seagull) <a href="https://twitter.com/A_Seagull/status/1789468582281400792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 12, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>In a Discord post <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/marvel-rivals/contract">noticed by PCGamesN</a> over the weekend, Chinese developer NetEase apologized for what it called "inappropriate and misleading terms" in the contract. "Our stand is absolutely open for both suggestions and criticisms to improve our games, and... our mission is to make Marvel Rivals better [and] satisfy players by those constructive suggestions."</p>
<p>In a follow-up <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals/status/1789895401723822410">posted to social media this morning</a>, NetEase went on to "apologize for any unpleasant experiences or doubts caused by the miscommunication of these terms... We actively encourage Creators to share their honest thoughts, suggestions, and criticisms as they play. All feedback, positive and negative, ultimately helps us craft the best experience for ourselves and the players." NetEase says it is making "adjustments" to the contract "to be less restrictive and more Creator-friendly."</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>What can you say, and when can you say it?</h2>
<p>Creators and press outlets (including Ars) routinely agree to embargoes or sign review and/or non-disclosure agreements to protect sensitive information about a game before its launch. Usually, these agreements are focused on <em>when</em> certain information and early opinions about a game can be shared. These kinds of timing restrictions can help a developer coordinate a game's marketing rollout and also prevent early reviewers from having to rush through a game to get a lucrative "first review" up on the Internet.</p>
<p>Sometimes, companies use embargo agreements to urge or prevent reviewers from sharing certain gameplay elements or story spoilers until a game's release in an effort to preserve a sense of surprise for the player base. There are also sometimes restrictions on how many and/or what kinds of screenshots or videos can be shared in early coverage for similar reasons. But restrictions on what specific <em>opinions</em> can be shared about a game are practically unheard of in these kinds of agreements.</p>
<p>Nearly a decade ago, Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/01/stealth-marketing-microsoft-paying-youtubers-for-xbox-one-mentions/">faced criticism</a> for a partnership with a Machinima video marketing campaign that paid video commentators for featuring Xbox One game footage in their content. That program, which was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/01/electronic-arts-also-paying-youtubers-to-promote-games/">aped by Electronic Arts</a> at the time, restricted participants from saying "anything negative or disparaging about Machinima, Xbox One, or any of its games."
</p><p>In response to the controversy, Microsoft said that it was adding disclaimers to make it clear these videos were paid promotions and that it "was not aware of individual contracts Machinima had with their content providers as part of this promotion and we didn’t provide feedback on any of the videos..."</p>
<p>In 2017, Atlus threatened to use its copyright controls to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/04/atlus-threatens-takedown-of-persona-5-spoiler-videos/">take down videos that spoiled certain elements of <em>Persona 5</em></a>, even after the game's release.

            <p>
After nearly 14 years of waiting, PC players might soon have a version of Rockstar's original open-world cowboy adventure Red Dead Redemption to call their own - if a new datamine proves accurate.
</p>
<p>
The original Red Dead Redemption - which follows former outlaw John Marston as he travels across the American West and Mexico - has remained doggedly console-only since its PS3 and Xbox 360 launch back in 2010, but its recent re-release on Switch and PlayStation had reignited hope a long-overdue PC release might finally be on the cards - and a new discovery by a dataminer with some form when it comes to Rockster leaks suggests that is, indeed, the case.
</p>
<p>
As unearthed by Tez2 and <a href="https://twitter.com/TezFunz2/status/1790031522315026508">shared on social media</a>, Rockstar has today updated its PC launcher site file with new "marketing strings". As Tez2 <a href="https://x.com/TezFunz2/status/1790038268630663441">notes</a>, this is "the same way Rockstar promotes GTAV". The revealing bit of text here, not publicly visible on Rockstar's launcher at present, is listed under the header "RDR_ProductPromotion_Intro_Body" and reads, "Journey across the sprawling American West and Mexico in Red Dead Redemption, and its zombie-horror companion, Undead Nightmare - now playable on PC."
</p>

<p>
It's certainly compelling evidence of an imminent - or, at the very least, planned - PC release for one of Rockstar's most beloved titles, even if nothing is official until the studio makes it so.
</p>
<p>
As for the port itself, Digital Foundry's  Oliver Mackenzie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-red-dead-redemption-on-playstation-has-one-impressive-upgrade">called the recent PlayStation release</a> a "conservative updates" of a classic game. "It'll satisfy those who are keen to revisit Rockstar's wild west epic," Mackenzie concluded, "but the game deserved a more substantial upgrade."

            <p>Bethesda has released its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-fallout-4-graphics-update-coming-to-all-platforms-next-week">previously promised update for Fallout 4</a> across platforms.</p>
<p>This update, Bethesda says, will allow players to "manage your control over the game's graphic fidelity or performance".</p>
<p>It has additionally sorted out a few other issues that had been left in the game following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-upgrade-launches-to-mixed-response-with-broken-mods-and-bugged-xbox-quality-mode">hefty 'next-gen' upgrade patch</a> a few weeks ago. This includes stability and sorting out crashes that could occur when players on PS5 returned to the Main Menu with queued mods still downloading.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Here's our Zoe with 11 hidden quests in Fallout 4 for Veterans and Newcomers.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQ9ly6Lf2xk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can read the full patch notes for Fallout 4 below, as shared by <a href="https://twitter.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1790052783183286435">Bethesda</a>.</p>
<h2>
<p><strong>Xbox Series S/X and PlayStation 5 Display Settings</strong></p></h2>
<p>Thanks to your feedback, we've been able to implement the ability to control your graphic fidelity and performance. We highly recommend you run with the default settings but now you can change your options to better fit your playstyle and display.</p>
<h2><p><strong>Frame Rate Target</strong></p></h2>
<p>Frame Rate Target allows you to choose between 30, 40, and 60 (default). It is important to note that to select 40, your display must be able to support 120hz.</p>
<h2><p><strong>Visual and Performance Prioritisation</strong></p></h2>
<p>You can now choose between Visuals and Performance (default) while trying to maintain frame rate target. If you choose Frame Rate Target of 60, we recommend selecting Performance. Both modes may adjust internal resolution dynamically when scenes or action get heavier.</p>
<p>Please note both modes can only be changed from the main menu.</p>
<h2><p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p></h2>
<ul>
<li>General stability improvements</li>
<li>Fixed visual issue with certain image spaces</li>
<li>Auto HDR is re-enabled (Xbox Series S/X)</li>
<li>Fixed issue where reserved space was not displayed correctly in load order menu (Xbox Series S/X)</li>
<li>Fixed issue with character name field when in widescreen mode. (PC)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that occasionally caused bundles to not fully download and could cause a crash</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with material swaps</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with load order that would break DLC until a restart after downloading mods (PlayStation 5)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that would occasionally cause a crash if you returned to the Main Menu with queued mods still downloading (PlayStation 5)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that could cause the Creation Club menu to not appear (Microsoft Store)</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could occur when connecting to the network after a suspend/resume with the network disabled (Xbox One)</li>
</ul>
<h2><p><strong>Creations Fixes</strong></p></h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed missing art issue with certain Creations</li>

<p>Fallout 4 has seen a large uptick in popularity following the debut of Amazon's TV adaptation last month. Soon after the show burst its way forth in a rather gory but highly enjoyable way, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-has-more-than-doubled-its-player-counts-on-steam">Fallout "more than doubled its concurrent players" on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>A few days later, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-currently-europes-best-selling-game-almost-a-decade-after-release">Fallout 4 specifically had become the best selling game in Europe</a> for that week.</p>

Even though it’s random, you can at least know the value of each unit you summon. The units in the S Tier are extremely versatile and should always be equipped, as they are powerful on all maps and stages. Those in the A Tier are strong as well and can be used in most situations, though there may be some better options depending on your lineup. Those in the B Tier are decent enough to use until you build out your S Tier and A Tier arsenal, while those in the C Tier should be avoided at all costs as they are simply way too undertuned. Here is our <em>Anime Crossover Defense</em> Tier List including the May 2024 update:</p>

            <p>After rebooting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> as the trilogy of Remake, Rebirth and Really, You Went With That? (TBC), Square Enix are now planning to reboot themselves. Among the publishers’ revamped approach to making money - following a recent drop in profits, per their latest financials - is a more “aggressive” approach to bringing their games to more platforms than specific consoles (in other words, PlayStation) as exclusives, with a particular focus on “win[ning] over PC users”.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>The New Medium-term Business Plan, which is also referred to in the presentation as “Square Enix Reboots, and Awakens” - which I especially like for how much it sounds like it could’ve come from a Final Fantasy or Kingdom Hearts trailer - plans to spend the next three years shifting “from quantity to quality”. (Thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">Eurogamer</a>.)</p>
<p>In a pleasing corporate balm to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">other</a> multi-million/billion/trillion companies shutting down their more experimental projects that don't instantly make a gazillion dollars, Square Enix say they will “be bold in attempting to create new IP, prioritizing novel forms of excitement and striking the right balance with earnings potential”, giving “bringing smiles to our customers’ faces” top billing to boost players’ loyalty to existing series while also releasing “mid-class” titles that aim to increase the company’s “hit rate”.</p>
<p>Part of the effort to grow existing audiences for their franchises and win over some new players to boot is an “aggressive” multiplatform push that aims to “build an environment where more customers can enjoy our titles in regards to major franchises and AAA titles”. That certainly sounds like corpo-talk for putting out games across more platforms than just PlayStation - the presentation mentions PC alongside Xbox and Nintendo consoles.</p>

<p>PC in particular is a real point of attention for Square Enix, as they say they will “pursue initiatives designed to win over PC users”, adding that PC is a “growth market” for the company - hard to argue with that, given how long we’ve been waiting for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> on PC now, with the currently PS5-exclusive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> yet to even be officially confirmed to follow FF7 Remake over onto PC at some point.</p>
<p>It won’t just be console games that make their way over onto PC, mind. Square also plan to consider PC releases for their mobile games, starting with the already revealed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-vii-ever-crisis-pc-release-confirmed-will-share-data-between-steam-and-mobile">Steam launch for gacha spin-off Final Fantasy Ever Crisis</a>.</p>
<p>It’s not like Square Enix or Final Fantasy have a particularly weak showing on PC - though that arguably is largely thanks to the ongoing success of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy XIV</a>, while PC ports for the more mainline <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/final-fantasy">Final Fantasy games</a> have been of more mixed quality and showing over the years. If this increased dedication to bringing games to PC more quickly and with higher quality pays off, who knows - perhaps we’ll even see the third <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake">FF7 Remake</a> game land day and date with its console release. We can but dream (and give us Rebirth sooner, at least).</p>

The mod also replaces <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-automaton-robots-back-1851397017&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-automaton-robots-back-1851397017">Automaton</a></span> enemy force with the droid army of the Separatists. Even the massive ships that stay in orbit and function as in-game lobbies have been made to appear like <em>Star Wars</em>’ massive Star Destroyers. The mod pack stops shy of being a <em>total</em> conversion, but the results are still rather impressive nonetheless. If we’re not going to get a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-fps-respawn-canceled-cuts-layoffs-ea-1851295478&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-fps-respawn-canceled-cuts-layoffs-ea-1851295478"><em>Star Wars </em>shooter</a></span> anytime soon, this might be the next best thing.</p><p> The more you think about it, the more it makes sense that fans of both properties would specifically want <em>this </em>collaboration. Whenever you die in <em>Helldivers 2</em>, reinforcements are called and an identical version of your character drops in, almost as if they were cloned to fill out the ranks of a fascist space empire. Helldivers are treated about as callously as the clones in <em>Star Wars </em>are, making them effectively one and the same. Admittedly, there’s also a lot of physical humor in the reckless tossing around of Helldivers that translates pretty well if you do a <em>Star Wars</em> palette swap, and the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/deathtroopers-fan-game-star-wars-zombies-stormtroopers-1851420306&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/deathtroopers-fan-game-star-wars-zombies-stormtroopers-1851420306">clone troopers</a></span> are an especially popular bunch to put through the ringer.</p><p>The <em>Star Wars</em> mod pack that includes all of the extensive reskins is not available just yet, but will be in the very near future. According to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/ToastedShoes/status/1789636825390432706&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/ToastedShoes/status/1789636825390432706" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toasted</a></span>, “the mods don’t work consistently across all planets and difficulties so we want to iron out the kinks before dropping them.” In the meantime, the team will be dropping the 501st legion “and other mods” on Nexus Mods individually throughout the week before bundling them all together. As an added and very neat gesture, Toasted and their mod team will also be releasing the tools they used to build the <em>Star Wars </em>mods so that others might use them and make their own.</p><p>It’s fortunate that <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s modding scene is generating some positive buzz because the game and its developers are otherwise <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-psn-steam-account-linking-explained-sony-1851455071&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-psn-steam-account-linking-explained-sony-1851455071">going through a rough patch</a></span> right now.

Rockstar community member Tez2 recently posted on X/Twitter that "it looks like Rockstar is gearing up to release #RDR1 on PC" and attached a screenshot that they claim was pulled from a Rockstar launcher site file.</p><p>"Journey across the sprawling expanses of the American West and Mexico in Red Dead Redemption, and its zombie-horror companion, Undead Nightmare.

                <p dir="ltr">Originally supposed to launch tomorrow, May 14, The Rogue Prince of Persia will now wall jump over to May 27 for the game's release date on Steam Early Access. The roughly two-week <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-has-been-slightly-delayed-thanks-partly-to-hades-2/1100-6523344/" data-ref-id="1100-6523344">delay partially came in response to Hades 2</a> surprise-releasing earlier this month.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to Hades 2, developer Evil Empire also noted that pushing back The Rogue Prince of Persia "lowered the stress levels" of the team and should allow them to "kick some stubborn bugs out," too. The 2D action-platformer is a spin-off of Ubisoft's Prince of Persia franchise and comes from the studio behind Dead Cells. In fact, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rogue-prince-of-persia-builds-on-dead-cells-formula-wall-running/1100-6522522/" data-ref-id="1100-6522522">The Rogue Prince of Persia builds on the Dead Cells formula</a>, though offers up a lot more wall running.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Rogue Prince of Persia - Official New Release Date Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">It was just a bit over a month ago that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-from-dead-cells-dev-announced-launching-in-may/1100-6522555/" data-ref-id="1100-6522555">The Rogue Prince of Persia was announced</a>. It will be the second game in the long-running franchise to come out this year, following in the footsteps of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review-crowning-achievement/1900-6418167/" data-ref-id="1900-6418167">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> in January. Ubisoft also has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-might-be-going-through-a-remake-of-its-own-report/1100-6522543/" data-ref-id="1100-6522543">a Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake in the works</a>. However, the game has switched development teams previously and is reportedly now seeing a huge overhaul.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2717880/view/4204749829170749418?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">On Steam</a>, Evil Empire revealed that The Rogue Prince of Persia will cost $20. The team also teased a "cheeky little launch discount" for people looking to pick up the game.</p><p dir="ltr">As for The Rogue Prince of Persia's new release date, Evil Empire added one funny tidbit as well. "If Silksong shadow drops in the next two weeks," then the studio might just be "burning the whole thing down!"</p><p dir="ltr">The Rogue Prince of Persia is planned to be in Steam Early Access for "around a year, probably a little bit longer," according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2717880/The_Rogue_Prince_of_Persia/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the game's Steam page</a>. Evil Empire will look to add levels, weapons, bosses, and story acts to the action-platformer over this time. The price of The Rogue Prince of Persia could also increase as new content comes to the game in the future.</p>

We’ll also get our first full-length look at the series' first Japanese entry this week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ubisoft announced on <a href="https://twitter.com/Ubisoft/status/1790049608720125969">X</a> that the game’s cinematic world premiere trailer will air on May 15 at 9 a.m. P.T./12 p.m. ET. Ubisoft’s use of the word “cinematic” suggests that this trailer will not include gameplay. If that’s the case, Ubisoft could be saving a gameplay reveal for its <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/04/03/ubisoft-forward-confirmed-for-june-same-week-as-summer-game-fest">Ubisoft Forward</a> presentation less than a month later, on June 10.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows was first announced in 2022 and will be the first entry set in feudal Japan. At the time, Ubisoft described the game as being an open-world RPG and the ultimate "shinobi fantasy." It is being developed by Ubisoft Quebec, the team behind Assassin's Creed Odyssey. It has no release window, but the game is expected to launch later this year.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft's upcoming feudal Japan-set Assassin's Creed game now has a final name: Assassin's Creed Shadows. 
</p>
<p>
Previously, it was known only under its working title, Assassin's Creed: Codename Red.
</p>
<p>
Shadows will get a full reveal later this week, on Wednesday 15th May at 5pm UK time. It's then we'll get a full trailer for the game, which will debut on YouTube (or you'll be able to find it right here on Eurogamer).
</p>

</figure>
<p>
Ubisoft is yet to say when Shadows will launch, other than confirm it will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/japan-set-assassins-creed-codename-red-out-before-end-of-march-2025-says-ubisoft">arrive before the end of the current financial year</a> (in March 2025). But the game will almost certainly land during the series' usual prime end of year sales slot - in either October or November 2024.
</p>
<p>Shadows will be the first full-fat Assassin's Creed game since 2020's Valhalla, after the snack-sized Mirage launched last year to celebrate the series' 15th anniversary. More pertinently, however, Shadows is the first Assassin's Creed to come from the talented Ubisoft Quebec studio since 2017's Assassin's Creed Odyssey - the excellent if enormous entry set in Ancient Greece.</p>
<p>This year's entry will also coincide with the launch of Ubisoft's new Assassin's Creed Infinity platform, which will serve as a story hub for the franchise's ongoing modern day plotline. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-explains-what-assassins-creed-infinity-actually-is">I spoke with Ubisoft Quebec's Marc-Alexis Coté</a> - now a figurehead for the entire Assassin's Creed franchise - back in 2022 to discover more.</p>
<p>Details on what exactly Shadows will be about are thin on the ground, though its feudal Japan setting has long been requested by fans. We do now at least have a first look at Shadows' version of the iconic Assassin's Creed franchise logo, now daubed in red blood:</p>

<p>A post to the official Assassin's Creed social media account on X today shows a large hourglass situated somewhere - presumably in Japan! - with blood red sand now pouring through it. Presumably this will run out on Wednesday at 5pm UK time - see you then!</p>

            <p>
An unopenable door in Super Mario 64 - thought impossible to pass through without the use of mods - has finally been prised open.
</p>
<p>
The door in question can be found within the game's infamous penguin level - you know, the one where you definitely didn't yeet the baby penguin off the mountain. 
</p>
<p>
There, a log cabin can be found with a door that opens outwards - but that's impossible to return through due to an invisible wall. Because of this, it's the only door in the game that was thought impossible to be opened both ways - until, last month, someone finally pulled it off.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>SM64's Unopenable Door Has Finally Been Opened! by pannenkoek2012
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmqFoojMeD8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
As shown in the video by pannenkoek2012 above, Nintendo fan Alexpalix1 managed to finally crack open the penguin level's door from the outside thanks to some detailed knowledge of how Super Mario 64's code logic works - and with some help from a certain baby penguin's mother. 
</p>
<p>
It's been known for some time that the level's invisible wall can be breached using Mario 64's clipping ability - and that you can use the penguin to push Mario into the log cabin. But this simply leaves Mario plummeting to his death out of bounds. 
</p>
<p>
The new breakthrough here is the knowledge that the game's code logic handles Mario's turning action in a certain way so that if he's both falling and running in the same frame, the latter outcome will take precedent. This requires some careful timing, but means if Mario clips through the door with just a frame of walking, the door will open - and Mario will instead warp back to the room inside the cabin, safe and sound. 
</p>
<p>
It sounds complicated, but the video above lays the whole thing out perfectly - and after 27 years, is well worth a watch. 
</p>
<p>
If newer Nintendo games are more your style, the company last week confirmed it would finally reveal <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> in the coming months - or to be precise, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">before April 2025</a>.

            <p>Today I learned Monkey Island creator Ron Gilbert is working on a new game, which he describes as "Classic Zelda meets Diablo meets Thimbleweed Park". Well, hello there!</p>
<p>Work on this project actually started several months ago, but it only came to my attention this afternoon thanks to <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/05/monkey-island-creator-ron-gilbert-is-working-on-a-zelda-style-rpg-adventure">TimeExtension</a>. I have since done more browsing, and come across some posts on Terrible Toybox, as well as Gilbert's own <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@grumpygamer">Mastodon</a> page.</p>
<p>Now, admittedly there still isn't a huge amount of information on Gilbert's upcoming project at this time. The game doesn't even have a proper name yet, and rather has been labelled as Game Name TBD on <a href="https://terribletoybox.com/">Terrible Toybox's website</a>. Meanwhile, Gilbert has been using the hashtag #rpgtbd to tag his social media posts. </p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Newscast: Video game TV and movie adaptations that need to happen<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bbNu8_c4U4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But, regardless, the information that is there is enough to make me very excited. First off, the fact that this is coming from the man that gave the world Guybrush Threepwood, and he has used the words 'classic Zelda' to tease the game is pretty awesome. But then, the handful of screenshots he has shared also look great.</p>
<p>As you can see in the images above and below, the upcoming release has a charming 2D pixel aesthetic. The screenshots shared so far show a town, which is said to have both a bakery and a weapon shop. As Gilbert noted, these two establishments will really set players up with "all [they'll] need before setting out on a day of questing".</p>
<p>There is also a graveyard area, and I assume that this will lead to the cemetery crypt and the source of those skeletons.</p>

<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/81g9o9d6in_Screenshot_1710365406.png?width=1200&amp;height=1200&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Terrible Toybox</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Earlier this month, Gilbert also announced Elissa Black, who has worked on Swords of Freeport and TownCraft,  has joined the team as a quest designer. "This ups the chance by 37 percent that I'll finish the game before becoming bored and disillusioned," <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@grumpygamer/112401714030473672">Gilbert</a> said announcing Black's arrival to the team.</p>
<p>Right now, Game Name TBD is slated to launch late this year, although Terrible Toybox says this may slip into early next year. "This is gamedev after all," the site reasons.</p>
<p>I will let you know as soon as I hear more.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/a-warm-farewell-and-exciting-welcome.1676646/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post on its official website</a>, Paradox says that the contract between it and Double Eleven "was fulfilled" with&nbsp;<em>Prison Architect 2</em>'s passing of certification across all platforms.</p>
<p>Following that milestone, however, the two companies "could not find a commercial agreement that worked" for them both, and so a mutual agreement was made for Paradox and Double Eleven to split, seemingly amicably.</p>

<p>Kokku has worked on games like&nbsp;<em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, the&nbsp;<em>Sniper: Ghost Warrior&nbsp;</em>franchise, and&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</em>, among others. It counts Ubisoft, Electronic Arts, and Paradox itself among its clients.</p>
<p>Paradox says that it spoke to multiple studios in the wake of Double Eleven's departure from&nbsp;<em>Prison Architect</em>, but that Kokku was "found to be the best fit" due to its experience and appreciation of&nbsp;<em>Prison Architect</em>.</p>
<p>Over the course of the next few months, Paradox and Kokku will be releasing development diaries and deep dives discussing&nbsp;<em>Prison Architect 2&nbsp;</em>and the developer's role in bringing the game to life.</p>

<p><em>Prison Architect 2&nbsp;</em>was originally announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prison-architect-2-announced">back in January this year</a>. At first, it was slated for a March release, but it was subsequently pushed back to May <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prison-architect-2-delayed">and then to September</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the change in developer, no fresh delay has been announced, so it looks like we're still on track for the September launch.

Since the show’s debut, the three characters—Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup—have become beloved heroes and have appeared in numerous games, books, and even a rebooted animated TV show.

Looking online, where the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=powerpuff&amp;src=typed_query&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=powerpuff&amp;src=typed_query" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Powerpuff Girls are now trending on Twitter</a></span>, it seems that WB Games got what they wanted.

<p>It looks like Rockstar Games could be getting ready to release the first Red Dead Redemption on PC. The information comes from data found inside Rockstar’s launcher site files, and was shared on <a href="https://twitter.com/TezFunz2/status/1790031522315026508" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter via Tez2</a>.</p>



<p>The promotion information mentions the original game as well as the Undead Nightmare DLC being “now playable on PC”. </p>



<p>“Journey across the sprawling expanses of the American West and Mexico in Red Dead Redemption, and its zombie-horror companion, Undead Nightmare, now playable on PC,” the product promotion data reads.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-and-ps4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Last summer the game launched</a> on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4. As far as the future of the series goes, the man behind the voice of Arthur Morgan, Roger Clark, said that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-3-is-likely-says-lead-role-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he’s “certain” there will be</a> a Red Dead Redemption 3 one day. That said, he doesn’t think Morgan will be a part of any future games in the franchise.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Rockstar Games for comment on the rumors. If a response is received, this article will be updated accordingly. Until then, take this rumor with a grain of salt.</p>

Just as customers can already trade in video games for cash or store credit, the same system will be available to those trading in Pokémon, Yu-Gi-Oh, Magic: The Gathering, and other trading card game cards.</p><p>The key word here is "graded", of course, meaning lapsed players or collectors can't just bring in a box of their old cards to be cashed in. Grading is a process which determines the exact condition of the card and essentially verifies it as being genuine (and valuable).</p><p>It's unclear how GameStop will value the cards being traded in. and it will only accept those graded by the Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA), at least at the beginning of the program. It also won't accept cards valued at more than $500.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>"GameStop’s leaders believe this is the obvious next step for the company," said one store manager who's tested this program for GameStop. "Physical media is waning, especially for video games. It was time for the company to branch out to trading cards. They are the future."</p><p>Pokémon will seemingly be the chain's focus, as single holographic and reverse holographic cards from the Pokémon TCG will be sold in store too at $1 each.</p><p>The card collecting market is growing more and more popular, helped in part due to high profile cases of cards being sold for millions of dollars. The perpetually popular Pokémon sits at the top of the list in terms of value (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-most-expensive-pokemon-cards">its most expensive card is valued at $5.275 million</a>) but a special Lord of the Rings Magic: The Gathering card was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/post-malone-buys-magic-the-gatherings-one-ring-card-valued-at-2-million">bought by rapper Post Malone for $2 million in 2023</a>, and that record was soon broken as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forget-the-one-ring-a-magic-the-gathering-card-just-sold-for-3-million">another card sold for $3 million just months later</a>.</p><p>The popularity of Pokémon cards is otherwise evidenced by the number of people trying to steal them. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-and-other-trading-cards-targets-of-unprecedent-number-of-robberies-in-japan">Tokyo police reported an unprecedented number of trading card thefts</a> in the latter half of 2022, while <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thousands-dollars-pokmon-merch-reportedly-stolen-after-thief-breaks-through-a-store-wall">an independent gaming store in Minnesota reportedly had around $250,000 worth of Pokémon</a> merchandise stolen in February of that year. One month later, again in Tokyo, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/man-arrested-after-literal-pokemon-card-heist">a man was arrested for allegedly launching a literal heist</a> in order to steal the treasured cards.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

                <p>Square Enix has revealed its three-year plan to achieve long-term growth within the company. It also gave the plan a catchy name, "Square Enix Reboots, and Awakens."</p><p>There are four pillars in this <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20240513_01_en.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">plan</a>. The first one involves enhancing productivity by focusing more on quality rather than quantity. Additionally, there will be an emphasis on making games "fun" and making sure that Square Enix finds more ways to leverage its rich library of IP.</p><p>The second pillar sees Square Enix embracing multiplatform releases, including PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo, iOS, and Android. The focus here is on trying to get more customers to enjoy Square Enix properties. Square Enix is also looking into expanding its IP across all media formats, which could possibly mean things like movies.</p><p>The third pillar focuses more on foundational stability, including structural reforms in the company's European and American offices. There will also be closer collaboration between divisions in Japan. Square Enix will rebuild its systems for training new gradates, and junior and mid-level employees, as well as for hiring and promotions.</p><p>Lastly, Square Enix will designate a maximum of 100 billion yen, or approximately $640,000,000, for strategic investments over a three-year period. As for what kind of investments Square Enix will make, the company isn't ruling out inorganic investments designed to expand its business, which means that acquisitions could be considered.</p><p>Last month, Square Enix <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-is-rethinking-how-it-approaches-games-and-its-coming-at-a-huge-cost/1100-6523070/" data-ref-id="1100-6523070">announced</a> that it expected to lose 22.1 billion yen, or $140,000,000, in "content abandonment losses" for the fiscal year ending on March 31, 2024 due to seemingly canceling projects. Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu revealed earlier this year that the company would shift development processes to create fewer, and higher-quality games.</p>

            <p>NetEase, the publisher of Marvel Rivals, is retracting its no negativity clause for streamers previewing the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/marvel-rivals/contract">As reported by PCGamesN</a>, the move came after streamer <a href="https://twitter.com/A_Seagull/status/1789468582281400792">Brandon Larned shared some contract details on social media</a>.</p>
<p>"Extremely disappointed in Marvel Rivals. Multiple creators asked for key codes to gain access to the playtest and are asked to sign a contract. The contract signs away your right to negatively review the game. Many streamers have signed without reading just to play."</p>
<p>NetEase advised PCGamesN that it is revising the contract with content creators.</p>
<p>In a statement sent to the publication, the publisher said, "The contract is a draft version aiming for long-term cooperation with the creators who are interested in Marvel Rivals. The development team hopes to have more meaningful and consistent feedback, suggestions, and criticisms through more in-depth cooperation."</p>
<p>It also posted a statement on the Marvel Rivals content creator Discord saying it would revise the agreement terms.</p>
<p>Net Ease Games announced Marvel Rivals a month ago. It currently has no release schedule and is currently running a closed alpha test.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/narration-avenues-in-multiverse-games.869322/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/narration-avenues-in-multiverse-games" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Narration Avenues in Multiverse Games</a> - Anjali Tyagi</div><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Apart from the traditional screenplay and 3d production hurdles, multiverse narratives and games produce even more complex structures of going about the production of ideas and concepts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The most obvious challenges happen during the very early stages of production, i.e. the brainstorming and writing stage. From debating how many characters to have, what personalities to give them, what their character arcs might look like, and what main events will take place to give shape and craft the entire story, directors often end up chucking their semi-formed ideas either because it seems too complicated at first glance, or it doesn’t make sense halfway into creation, or because they don’t have the budget or resources to keep iterating on changes with the same passion.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Right off the bat, ideas tend to start off as too ambitious or too complicated, or often both. Which is a good thing. The struggle begins when three quarters into writing, the ideas seem to get tedious and eventually the script starts to look boring if events don't start to come together.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Timing and attention span of viewers also play a major role in the absorption of the content, leaving directors with multiple checklists to mark off from the traditional filmmaking rules, which, one are difficult to define, and two give them little room for radical experimentation of storylines and story plots.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are certain obvious mistakes that if avoided during the first quarter of brainstorming could save the team and the production a lot of time and resources, and keep the excitement and momentum for ideation going. Here’s a helpful list to look out for:</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="The first smart thing to do:">The first smart thing to do:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Characters that seem repetitive and have overlapping personalities should probably be merged into singular characters, leaving each player/main character to be distinctive from the other in all the ways that they think, behave, and go about problem solving on their quests. This gives plenty of starting points for writers to come up with unique events that seem organic and can be fun to encounter while playing/watching the game narrative.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The most obvious challenge of multiverse narration:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The infinite tree branching of follow up events. To make a game that could have the possibility to take a variety of routes, directors face the obvious challenge of creating too many pathways to be able to interlink them back to each other where it matters, let alone produce assets for such story branches. To this we say, giving careful choices to their players, is both the challenge and the solution to this problem. The challenge would be to not give the illusion of choice. Instead, give the users definite choice making moments that actually matter and would lead to some fundamental change in the making of the personalities of their player characters. Events that could go different ways but don’t really contribute significantly to character arcs or story plots are the obvious ones to completely overlook.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="A hack to go about improving your writing and brainstorming your main events:">A hack to go about improving your writing and brainstorming your main events:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">First thing to embrace would be your main characters. Studying the way they behave, think, and operate is a big window to defining your main events. Afraid nobody will care about your characters? That can only happen if you’ve got overlapping personalities going, that’s if you haven't studied them enough. If inspired from real life, which most characters are, with enough attention to mapping out their personalities, each character will be unique and have their own - universal story to tell. Main events are a lot like inevitable occurrences that can only play out one typical way based on the developing instincts of your characters, they are usually critical moments of crisis or change.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Say you’ve got the characters, but can’t think of useful main events that come together. A good thing to do would be to put your characters with each other in scenes of different emotions, like fear, excitement, glee. Don’t worry about the order at first. Think about how each one of them would respond to the problem they’re facing, and how they’d affect each other based on their actions. Some would learn from others, some would lead, some would be dismissive, while others may be oblivious. After these various moments, think of quests they could go on with each other, or under what circumstances you’d like them to meet. While drafting these vague moments - keep connecting them, which will then create the path of your overall story fate.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Next, write the same main events from the perspective of your different characters, their understanding of the occurrences, and their outlook and opinions of other characters. No perspective will be a repetition, giving the writer room of experimentation of choices, quests, and lessons learned. The main events stay the same in all of their paths, hence being the crux of your overall story.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There aren’t many books out there to help you systematically craft multiverse plots that can be saturated into a compact reasonable game. Some novel series make attempts at multiplot narratives but unless you’re recreating those specifically, which would be a different kind of challenge in itself, you’d have better luck crafting your own vision that you wish to direct, formate, and give life to, i.e. if you’ve got some big ideas. Needless to state, this stage of writing is meat for your entire production and should be given the most amount of time. To profile your budget and streamline your thinking. It would take intuitive writing, reworking of ideas, and most of all organized planning, which brings me to talk about some obvious and great tools to help you on this journey.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Look and Feel/Art Direction - Start with the staple look and feel of certain scenes you have in mind. Make a google doc, flood it in. But in an organized structure. Collect lots and lots of references, from other movies, scenes, preferably live action, but animation also works wonders. Collect everything you see fit, that matches your vision.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Beat Sheet (Excel sheets) - A classic.">Beat Sheet (Excel sheets) - A classic.</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While drafting your multi-plots and developing the different characters, having it all in one place is a god sent - logic gift. Don’t abuse the empty space, keep reiterating, keep it clean, keep color coding your sequences and scenes. The beat sheet acting like a visual map will help you figure out the story challenges and how to bridge the gaps in them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Storyboarding - Bad at drawing? Work with stick figures. Or don’t draw at all. Storyboarding is a must however, so some alternate heavy lifting will be needed, take screenshots from your visual references. Researching the camera shots you want in your scene, the number of characters, the time of day, the motion of the players. Be sure to include all kinds of details you imagine taking place, from set details to expression details. Although keep in mind to depict moments concisely, to not stretch them unnecessarily, and be mindful of the time they take up. Alternatively, if you’ve got a good collection of references going, you could also edit together an acting reel.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With these basics covered, next define your sets, your quests, and your levels - if it's a game - and even otherwise. And you’ll be all set with a happening multi-branch game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And finally, we wanted to advocate for using AI tools to help out here and there, but we strongly believe that during brainstorming, you’re better off without AI in your production. We think it slows down the momentum that otherwise has the potential to go smoothly. AI might be useful to find references, but then again the technology is not built for that, and it does more harm than good to our existence, for no needed reason. A whole upcoming blog in itself, stay tuned!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="298" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As of the Era 7 update for Roblox’s <em>Sol’s RNG</em>, there are six biomes you might find yourself in (not to mention weather and time of day). One of these is Hell, which isn’t even the rarest of the biomes, but it does allow you to roll for four unique auras, including the coveted Bloodlust aura.</p> <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">I probably don’t have to say this, but getting to the Hell Biome is largely just random chance, as is most things in <em>Sol’s RNG</em>. It’s right there in the name. To be specific, the Hell Biome has a 1/6666 (0.015%) chance of appearing and lasts 11 minutes. This gets rolled every second, but it could still take a long time before you can experience Hell.</p> <p data-characters="91" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true">If a roll is successful, you will be notified that the biome has appeared via in-game chat.</p>
 <p data-characters="329" data-current-count="329" data-injectable="false">But to make a long story short, if you want to get to the Hell Biome without waiting for a lucky roll, then you can join <em>Sol’s RNG’s</em> Discord and check the private server tab. You can then join a server and be spawned in the Hell Biome. This will allow you to start rolling for auras, but remember, this only lasts 11 minutes.</p> <p data-characters="91" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true">If you need more info on how to join the Discord server, we <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/sols-rng-trello-and-discord-links-to-join-the-community/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have a guide</a> you can check out.</p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-get-the-bloodlust-aura-in-sol-s-rng" data-injectable="false">How to get the Bloodlust aura in Sol’s RNG</h2> <p data-characters="116" data-current-count="116" data-injectable="false">If you want to get the Bloodlust aura in Sol’s RNG, then you’ll have to keep rolling the dice (of course).&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true">That could take quite a while because the chances of getting the Bloodlust aura is 1/50,000,000 (0.000002%). To put that into perspective, the odds of getting struck by <a href="http://lightningsafetycouncil.org/Odds.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lightning in a given year</a> is 1/1,600,000. A year is a long time between “rolls,” but it paints an interesting picture.</p>
 <p data-characters="193" data-current-count="193" data-injectable="false">You can improve your odds of getting rare auras by using certain gear like the Gravitational Device. You can also improve your odds of getting struck by lightning by carrying a long metal pole.</p>

Rolling for this while it is raining may increase your chances, but it still isn’t guaranteed.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="542" data-injectable="true">To tilt the odds in your favor, consider using Lucky Potions for a temporary 100% Luck boost. Jake’s Workshop also holds many handy items, such as the Luck Glove, Exo Gauntlet, and Subzero Device. These can enhance your chances, but remember, other auras may still be in the mix.</p>

			<p>Red Dead Redemption may finally launch on PC 14 years after its original release, judging from some recent findings.</p>
<p>As reported by Tez2 on<a href="https://twitter.com/TezFunz2"> X/Twitter</a>, a screenshot showing a code string mentioning the PC version of the popular Old West-themed open-world game released back in 2010 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 is making the rounds online. As Tez2 has yet to mention where this string has been discovered, we must take this PC port rumor with a huge grain of salt until more info comes in. [<strong>Update</strong> - The strings were found in <a href="https://twitter.com/TezFunz2/status/1790038268630663441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1790038268630663441%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=">Rockstar's launcher site file</a>.]</p>

<p>While this PC port of Red Dead Redemption has yet to be confirmed, it's not like Rockstar Games denied its game would never be released on PC. Following the release of an updated port on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick did not deny its existence, saying that any <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc/">game announcement is up to the developer</a>, suggesting that something was indeed in the works.</p>

<p>Id Software developed 2020's Doom Eternal, the latest entry in the main series. The mobile game Mighty Doom released in 2023 and was made by Alpha Dog Games. Microsoft recently closed the studio as part of a wider shakeup. Mighty Doom will go offline in August.</p><p>In January this year, ZeniMax filed a trademark application for <a href="https://twitter.com/Odah_SFA/status/1747585089804832836" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"IDKFA,"</a> which is an <a href="https://doom.fandom.com/wiki/Doom_Cheat_Codes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">iconic classic Doom cheat code.</a> Whether or not this is related to a new game announcement is unknown.</p><p>Doom Eternal had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-eternal-review-intelligent-inferno/1900-6417432/" data-ref-id="1900-6417432">positive critical reception</a> upon launch in 2020.

The latest episode of the GI Microcast is now available in podcast form, delivering your weekly dive into the biggest stories of the past week. The video will be available tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
This week, we take a quick dive in <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-reportedly-shutting-down-four-bethesda-studios">Xbox's closure of four Bethesda-owned studios</a>, as well as what this means for Microsoft's wider gaming strategy, the future of the smaller studios it still owns, and its reputation with the rest of the industry and gamers.
</p>
<p>
We also discuss <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-switch-2-promises-announcement-by-april-2025">Nintendo's first official word on Switch 2</a> - or, as it should be called, New Nintendo Switch U XL - as well as the platform holder's financials, and why the market really needs a new console before Christmas 2025.

<p data-characters="345" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The last game we got in the <em>Doom</em> series was 2020’s <em>Eternal</em>. A fine game it was as well (though I personally prefer the 2016 entry). Given that it’s only been four years then, one would hardly expect a new installment so soon. We know how long AAA titles take to develop in this climate. However, something may be on the horizon soon.</p> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">Back in January of this year, <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/98349237" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZeniMax Media registered a trademark</a> that many interpreted as being <em>Doom</em> related. The trademark itself was given the title “IDKFA,” a well-known reference to a cheat code from the earlier games. Given this, many have assumed that this <em>has</em> to be in relation to an upcoming game.</p> <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="645" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151814/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-strategy-changes-arkane-tango" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge’s Tom Warren</a> also teased a <em>Doom </em>may be on the way in a recent write-up on what’s happening inside Microsoft and Xbox right now. “Microsoft will be banking on some new game announcements lifting the <em>Doom</em> around Xbox,” Warren writes. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-trademark-offers-doom-hint-as-suggestion-of-an-imminent-reveal-swirls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eurogamer</a> also reports that it’s heard similar things.</p>
 <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">We have so few details about this speculation that I’m surprised I’m able to fill the required word count for this article (though I do waffle sometimes). As such, it can’t be said what ZeniMax has planned. All we can do is play the Speculation Game based on what people strongly suspect, given the <em>Doom</em> reference.</p> <h2 id="h-could-an-announcement-be-made-soon" data-injectable="false">Could an announcement be made soon?</h2> <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="680" data-injectable="true">Not long ago, the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xbox-games-showcase-locked-in-for-june-with-a-rumored-cod-direct-afterwards/">Xbox Showcase for 2024</a> was announced, which will be going ahead on June 9. This will be a chance for a lot of Xbox-related content to be shown off and teased. Seeing as id Software – the studio behind <em>Doom</em> – is part of this business umbrella, there’s every possibility a new game in the iconic series could be announced.</p>
 <p data-characters="237" data-current-count="237" data-injectable="false">I’m spit-balling, of course. None of the official Twitter/X accounts from the likes of id, Bethesda, Xbox or even the <em>Doom</em> profile itself mention any kind of announcement inbound. Makes sense if they want to keep it schtum, though.</p> <p data-characters="339" data-current-count="576" data-injectable="true">We don’t even know if id Software will be the developer of any future <em>Doom</em> games. I mean, it would seem likely, given the studio has been making them since 1993 (albeit not with the same people onboard). But as I say, these are just rumors, so we’ll hopefully know more either during or just before the Xbox Showcase goes live.</p>
 <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="293" data-injectable="false">The showcase will be an important moment for Xbox either way, as the company <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xbox-says-it-needs-smaller-prestigious-games-right-after-killing-the-studio-behind-the-small-prestigious-hi-fi-rush/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">faces scrutiny</a> for its recent closure of several studios, including Arkane Austin and Tango GameWorks. This summer’s stream will show what road Xbox has ahead without the makers of <em>Prey </em>and <em>Hi-Fi Rush </em>on-board.</p>

<p data-characters="446" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Sol’s RNG </em>is a combat experience in <em>Roblox</em> where you explore various biomes, complete quests, and roll for auras. While the main idea is to gain auras through your rolls and craft items, learning how to get started or where to find rare auras is tricky. Checking out the <em>Sol’s RNG</em> Trello and Discord server is a great way to talk to community members and learn more, especially if you’re just starting or need a quick refresher.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-join-the-sol-s-rng-trello" data-injectable="false">How to join the <em>Sol’s RNG</em> Trello</h2> <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="311" data-injectable="false"><em><a href="https://trello.com/b/vvaNo51o/sols-rng-in-dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sols’ RNG</a></em><a href="https://trello.com/b/vvaNo51o/sols-rng-in-dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;has a Trello page</a>&nbsp;where you can view information about its gameplay features, including various biomes, auras, and items.

 <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="252" data-injectable="false">While it’s unknown whether this is a permanent change, you’ll have to find other means of finding the answers to your questions.
