            <p>As you might’ve heard, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-release-date-details-everything-we-know">Hades 2</a> is out in early access, offering up the much-anticipated sequel to Supergiant’s mythical (and delightfully thirsty) roguelite. Though the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-early-access-review">sheer amount of polish and Stuff</a> in even its pre-release form might have you thinking that a full 1.0 release can’t be too far down the line, the game’s creative director reckons we’ve still got around a year to wait before it’s considered all finished up.</p>

</div>
<p>That’s per Greg Kasavin’s recent chat with cheery RPS fansite<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/hades-2s-creative-director-says-we-expect-to-be-in-early-access-at-least-through-the-end-of-this-year/"> PC Gamer</a>, during which Kasavin touched on the gameplay differences between OG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades">Hades</a>’ Zagreus and Hades 2 hero Melinoë - with more of a lean towards fast-paced spellcasting and area-of-effect attacks - and the litany of small details packed into the game, such as the different reactions of characters to the player’s choices such as picking boons or during boss fights.</p>
<p>With Hades 2 crammed full of those small touches on top of the obvious need to constantly tweak and balance its combat, Kasavin said that the team won’t be rushing to get the finished game out the door. In the near future, there’ll be a run of smaller patches that further polish existing parts of the gameplay - similar to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/first-hades-2-patch-lets-you-gather-seed-silver-and-souls-simultaneously">recent tweaks to resource-gathering and sprinting</a> - with at least one bigger update that will introduce brand new elements such as enemies, environments and features. While that big update is in the works for “several months”, there’ll be a pause on the smaller fixes.</p>

<p>“We'll patch that a few times to shore up any issues, and repeat this broader process... until we consider the game complete!” Kasavin said, which suggests we’ll see some more ‘Major Updates’ after that, too. For the first big addition, at least, Kasavin teased that Supergiant already have a particular theme in mind, which enterprising players may uncover if they delve deep enough into the game.</p>
<p>All in all, Kasavin expects Hades 2 to remain in early access “at least through the end of this year”. That’s perhaps not surprising given the first game took around two years from early access launch to 1.0, and the sequel has arrived with even more to play with in the meantime - meaning even more to tweak and balance along the way for its developers, too.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-game-pass-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the reports circulating</a> that Microsoft is set to put Call of Duty Black Ops 6 onto Xbox Game Pass at launch, the company appears to ready to make changes to the services tiers as well. According to multiple insiders, Xbox Game Pass is set to receive changes to its tiers due to the addition of Call of Duty.</p>



<p>“We can assure you that changes are coming to the Xbox Game Pass Tiers mainly due to Call Of Duty,” Insider eXtas1stv <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1791468893925417436?t=P6CsgjcO5D50_1lhFayKEg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on Twitter</a>. “There are still things to confirm, but I hope to report back soon.”</p>



<p>This was then followed up by Shinobi602 <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot30-why-so-series-x-s.820296/page-540?post=123109182#post-123109182" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Reset Era saying</a>, “There will be changes, yes”.</p>



<p>Whether that means price changes or simply adding another premium tier remains to be seen. But it seems clear that more changes are in store for Xbox Game Pass. Currently, the service has three total plans. There’s Xbox Game Pass Core for console that replaced Xbox Live Gold for $9.99/month, Game Pass PC for $9.99/month, and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate that covers both console and PC for $16.99/month.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft for comment on these reports. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly.</p>

You can deactivate the Super early to create a blinding explosion and gain a temporary bonus to Arc damage. Your Arc staff will also consume less energy when you're not attacking with it. The stats here are mostly well balanced, with mobility being the best, but resilience is very low. Intellect is average, so you'll want to mod those two stats specifically.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 18</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 2</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 12</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 7</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 14</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 9</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 62</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">Aeon Safe (Exotic Titan gauntlets)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4304745-destiny22024-05-1719-12-54.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4304745" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4304745-destiny22024-05-1719-12-54.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4304745"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4304745-destiny22024-05-1719-12-54.jpg"></figure><p>Like other Exotic armor pieces in the Aeon line, Aeon Safe has three unique Armor Mods that work well with team-focused builds. Sect of Insight specializes in empowering your allies, and the stats on this roll aren't too bad. Resilience is pretty good and intellect is very high here, allowing you to gain quicker cooldowns on your Super abilities. Discipline is very low and mobility is unnecessarily high, so you'll have to plan your build accordingly to work around these.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 13</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 16</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 6</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 2</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 20</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 11</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 68</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">The Stag (Exotic Warlock helmet)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4304746-destiny22024-05-1719-13-04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4304746" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4304746-destiny22024-05-1719-13-04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4304746"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4304746-destiny22024-05-1719-13-04.jpg"></figure><p>While it looks like it belongs in Alan Wake 2, The Stag is actually a Destiny 2 classic. This Exotic buffs Warlock Rifts to reduce damage for allies, and if you fall in battle, you'll leave a healing rift behind for your teammates. This is a pretty good roll that goes all in on the identity of this Exotic, as the recovery stat is almost maxed out. Resilience is sadly low and intellect could be better, but this is a good Exotic to grab in case you plan to be the team medic.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 2</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 2</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 30</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 18</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 6</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 7</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 65</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">Exotic Weapons</h2><h3 dir="ltr">Arbalest (Exotic linear fusion rifle)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4304747-destiny22024-05-1719-12-29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4304747" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4304747-destiny22024-05-1719-12-29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4304747"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4304747-destiny22024-05-1719-12-29.jpg"></figure><p>A very nice linear fusion rifle, Arbalest has two great abilities.

His exact location is always a mystery when he first arrives, as he is not listed on the map, and for novice players, he can be easy to miss. However, there are a set number of locations where he takes up residence, including the Tower Hangar area, on Nessus in Watcher's Grave, and in the Winding Cove area of the EDZ.</p>

<p data-characters="367" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> has a new promotional event where buying items in real life benefits players in-game. If you want to collect some of the sweet new Mountain Dew crossover items in <em>FFXIV</em>, including a brand new exclusive mount, you’ll want to pick up a few bottles of the sugary drink. Here’s what to do to earn all of the items while this event is still running. </p> <h2 id="h-all-mountain-dew-drinks-and-points-explained" data-injectable="false">All Mountain Dew drinks and points, explained</h2> <p data-characters="506" data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true">For starters, the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-event-calendar-seasonal-ongoing-and-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FFXIV</a></em> crossover event with Mountain Dew is only running for a limited time, so don’t wait or you might miss out on these goodies. How the event works is players buy specially marked Mountain Dew Gaming 20oz bottles, and only them. 2-liters, cans, and so on don’t count at this time. They have a banner around them that reference rewards you can unlock right now. These bottles have a 10-digit code underneath the cap, which grants you some points to your Mountain Dew Gaming account. </p>
 <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false">You can then turn around and exchange those points for various prizes, of which there are a few themed around <em>FFXIV</em>, specifically. Unfortunately, some of the 20oz bottles of Mountain Dew go for different points than others, which might be a bit confusing. Below, you’ll find all the different flavors and how many points they’re worth online: </p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="547" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Mountain Dew Frostbite:</strong> 200 points</li> <li><strong>Purple Thunder:</strong> 200 points</li> <li><strong>Maui Burst:</strong> 200 points</li> <li><strong>Over Drive:</strong> 200 points</li> <li><strong>All other flavors (original, Zero Sugar, Code Red, etc):</strong> 100 points each</li> </ul>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-mountain-dew-gaming-points" data-injectable="false">How to redeem Mountain Dew Gaming points</h2> <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="713" data-injectable="true">Once you’ve bought yourself a Mountain Dew bottle (or a dozen), it is now time to finally start redeeming some points. What you want to do is look underneath the cap for a 10-digit code. Head to this website right <a href="https://www.mtndewgaming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and create a Mountain Dew Gaming account or login to an existing one. You’ll see the option to enter each code and you’ll receive the appropriate number of points, as mentioned above. </p>
 <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">You can seemingly redeem as many codes as you want while the event is live. However, this event is only available in the United States for now. Unfortunately, this event excludes Canadian players. Worse still, don’t waste your time trying to redeem one of the rewards on your <em>FFXIV</em> account if its region is different from the US, because it won’t work. </p> <figure data-current-count="657" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-all-ffxiv-x-mountain-dew-rewards-and-costs-explained" data-injectable="false">All <em>FFXIV</em> x Mountain Dew rewards and costs, explained</h2> <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="371" data-injectable="false">There are quite a few <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-live-letter-recap-dawntrail-job-trailer-fall-guys-and-mountain-dew/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FFXIV</a></em> in-game and merchandise rewards you can get through the Mountain Dew event. Note that you can’t redeem some of the reward codes on your account, such as the Sparkling Citrus Refreshment and Mountain Zu mount, until <em>Dawntrail</em> early access begins. Here are all of the items you can unlock and how many points you’ll need to unlock each one: </p> <ul data-found-items="17" data-items-injection="true" data-current-count="1051" data-injectable="false"> <li data-index="0"><strong>Sparkling Citrus Refreshment:</strong> 100 points </li> <li data-index="1"><strong>5 pots of Metallic Green Dye:</strong> 200 points</li> <li data-index="2"><strong>5 pots of Metallic Blue Dye:</strong> 200 points</li> <li data-index="3"><strong>5 pots of Metallic Orange Dye:</strong> 200 points</li> <li data-index="4"><strong>Mountain Zu mount:</strong> 600 points</li> <li data-index="5"><strong><em>FFXIV</em> Starter Edition game:</strong> 2,000 points</li> <li data-index="6"><strong><em>FFXIV</em> x Mountain Dew magnet:</strong> 2,000 points</li> <li data-index="7"><strong>Various Taito Prize Cups:</strong> 4,000 points</li> <li data-index="8"><strong>Various Plush:</strong> 4,000 points</li> <li data-index="9"><strong>Figurines:</strong> 4,000 points</li> <li data-index="10"><strong>I Drank Dew T-Shirt:</strong> 4,000 points</li> <li data-index="11"><strong>Desk Mats:</strong> 6,000 points</li> <li data-index="12"><strong>Puma T-Shirts:</strong> 9,000 points</li> <li data-index="13"><strong>Pictomancer or Viper Keycap Set:</strong> 18,000 points</li> <li data-index="14"><strong>Hoodies:</strong> 20,000 points</li> <li data-index="15"><strong>Sweatpants:</strong> 20,000 points</li> <li data-index="16"><strong>Elgato + Stream Deck Studio Controller:</strong> 25,000 points</li> </ul>

<p data-characters="244" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Rumors about a&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fallout</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;x&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fortnite</span></em>&nbsp;collaboration have been circulating the community, particularly in light of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-biggest-changes-the-fallout-show-introduced-to-the-lore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon Prime Video</a> show. Those speculations are now realized with an artwork teaser for an upcoming&nbsp;<em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fortnite</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;update.&nbsp;</span></p> <p data-characters="234" data-current-count="234" data-injectable="false">In this teaser, we see the series’ iconic Power Armor, which almost anyone, fan or not, would recognize. But instead of&nbsp;<em>Fallout’s&nbsp;</em>classic look, the suit of armor will be transcended into&nbsp;<em>Fortnite’s&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnite-players-claim-its-almost-impossible-to-complete-battle-pass-without-spending-real-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale</a>.</p> <figure data-current-count="534" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">Now, the burning question is: What unique elements will this&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>x&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>&nbsp;collaboration bring? It’s a safe bet that we’ll see new&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>skins, a trend we’ve witnessed with numerous other franchises like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnite-aang-skin-avatar-last-airbender-elements-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>. The Power Suit, featured prominently in the teaser, is likely to be one of them. Personally, I’m hoping for a&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em> Vault Jumpsuit to be part of the mix.</p>
 <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">New&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>-themed quests could be&nbsp;another feature included in the crossover.&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>&nbsp;isn’t shy of having collaboration missions, similar to&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-a-lightsaber-in-fortnite-x-star-wars-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lightsaber tasks</a>. Map iterations may also be a part of this, possibly including vault locations.&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>already has vaults in-game, so why not add a&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>touch to match the theme?&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="516" data-injectable="true">As for items, a Pip-Boy could be used for Battle Royale. It would make for a great accessory, keeping with the tradition of tracking information for the player.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="330" data-injectable="false">Given that the&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>franchise has multiple entries,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>could go almost anywhere with this collaboration. It could offer content for one of the most famous entries<em>, Fallout 4</em>, or focus on some of the newer elements of the TV show. Of course, there are plenty of other iterations, such as&nbsp;<em>Fallout 76</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>New Vegas</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="142" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="false">Only time will tell what this&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>x&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>&nbsp;collaboration will bring. But the one thing we know for sure is that war never changes.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="200" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Good news for anyone playing <em>Redfall</em>, or anyone who cares about a gaming ecosystem where publishers can’t make entire titles vanish from existence: the game is still going to get its offline mode.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="458" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="true">Arkane Austin has just announced that <em>Redfall</em> will be getting one final update before the studio shuts its doors for good. The update will make some changes to the Neighborhood and Nest systems, potentially pulling in new or returning players, and it will also add single player pausing and an offline mode to let people actually continue to play the game, which otherwise would have all but disappeared whenever Microsoft decided to take down the servers.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Thank you for all your supportive messages. </p><p>We are working to release our final update, Game Update 4, that brings revamped Neighborhood and Nest systems, Single Player Pausing, Offline Mode, and more. </p><p>We’ll provide additional details soon. Thank you all.</p></div>— Redfall (@playRedfall) <a href="https://twitter.com/playRedfall/status/1791491460858020040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 17, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="481" data-current-count="781" data-injectable="true">Earlier this month <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/redfall-and-hi-fi-rush-developers-shut-down-in-another-awful-wave-of-microsoft-cuts/">Microsoft essentially dissolved four studios</a> in one unceremonious swoop. <em>Redfall </em>developer Arkane Austin got cut alongside Tango Gameworks (<em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>) and Alpha Dog Games (<em>Mighty DOOM</em>), while Roundhouse Studios got merged into ZeniMax Online Studios. It was another heartbreaking example of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-people-making-the-games-keep-paying-the-price/">game developers losing work</a>, whether or not their game succeeded in the market. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-redfall-pc-xbox-arkane-microsoft/"><em>Redfall </em>didn’t wow reviewers</a> or gamers last year, but <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hi-fi-rush-represents-game-pass-secret-strength/"><em>Hi-Fi Rush </em>was a definite success</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="501" data-current-count="501" data-injectable="false">The final <em>Redfall </em>update is bittersweet news to say the least. The game might have failed to make an impact, but Arkane proved with <em>Prey </em>that it has the capacity to make a great game. Given a little more time to make updates and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/microsoft-killed-redfall-right-before-arkane-could-save-it-from-online-only-fate/">actually release the game’s planned DLC</a>, Arkane Austin might have been able to turn <em>Redfall </em>around. Now we’ll never know. The last update will technically keep the game alive, but with Arkane Austin itself being shuttered, that doesn’t feel like much of a win.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
Endless Legend, the superb fantasy 4X game from developer Amplitude Studios, is currently free to download and keep on Steam - and there's still almost a week to claim it.
</p>
<p>
Amplitude - which has also developed the likes of Endless Space, Dungeons of the Endless, and Humankind - released Endless Legend back in 2014. It quickly drew praise for its fantasy flavoured Civ-style strategy - enlivened by some smart twists on the formula and its highly distinctive factions - mixed with a heavy dollop of lore.
</p>
<p>
If you're still a stranger to Endless Legend's action some ten years after its release, and the above description has set your strategy nubbin a-tingling, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/289130/ENDLESS_Legend/">permanently add it to your Steam library</a> for the princely sum of zero money right now. And don't panic if you're currently indisposed: the offer runs until next Thursday, 23rd May.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Get Endless Legend for FREE!" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jYc_j0Y3o-0?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
To coincide with Endless Legends' 100% price slash, its nine expansions are also heavily discounted, with the priciest currently costing £2.19 and the cheapest slinking in at a svelt 59p.
</p>
<p>
And if you'd like to check out more of Amplitude's work, it's probably also worth noting the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/AmplitudeStudios">studio's entire catalogue</a> is currently discounted on Steam, meaning substantial savings on everything from Endless Space and Humankind to the more recent Endless Dungeon.

            <p>If you’ve been wondering what Valve’s been working on as their next game after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/counter-strike-2-best-settings">Counter-Strike 2</a>, the answer may be at hand. Details and screenshots for Deadlock, a third-person hero <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> with MOBA elements, have seemingly leaked out of a recent closed playtest, revealing a blend of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a> and Valve’s own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>Deadlock is apparently the latest evolution of a project previously known as Neon Prime, which you may faintly recall <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-register-mysterious-new-neon-prime-trademark-in-the-us">Valve registering a vague trademark for</a> a couple of years back. The game’s reappearance as Deadlock came via <a href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/1791110448114188557">noted Valve leaker Gabe Follower</a>, who described it as being a competitive hero shooter in the vein of Overwatch or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valorant">Valorant</a> - albeit in third-person - with the lane-based map design and even tower defence elements of MOBAs like Dota 2 or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a>.</p>
<p>Those maps will host matches between two teams of six players, who will control unique hero characters able to pop off different abilities and items. The maps themselves are said to be “huge”, with the inclusion of floating rails - a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a> - to help players zip around.</p>
<p>The game’s world also seems to draw at least a little from the likes of BioShock, with a mixture of steampunk and fantasy in a European-inspired city home to strange creatures, robots and magicians alike. (Gabe Follower notes that the game was originally more sci-fi-themed closer to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/portal">Portal</a> - which might explain the futuristic-sounding Neon Prime moniker - but shifted more to fantasy after “bad feedback” from testers.)</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Since testers started sharing Deadlock screenshots all over the place, here's ones I can verify, featuring one of the heroes called Grey Talon. <a href="https://t.co/KdZSRxObSz">pic.twitter.com/KdZSRxObSz</a></p>— Gabe Follower (@gabefollower) <a href="https://twitter.com/gabefollower/status/1791311128422748285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 17, 2024</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">

The character design does indeed look very Overwatch-y or Dota-y to my eye, with the teases of the map showing graffitied city streets and alleys.</p>
<p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8MqhEz6N_k">Tyler McVicker</a> added to the swirling rumours by claiming that the now-leaky closed playtest already has hundreds of people giving Deadlock a go, with a proper announcement and reveal of Valve’s next “major” game due sometime soon - perhaps sooner than even the developers expected, given the information already finding its way out into the public eye.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24158351/mad-max-fury-road-rock-riders<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="PbJcr0">There are many things that make <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/5/14/8607723/mad-max-fury-road-review"><em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em></a><em> </em>one of the most <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/5/20929735/best-movies-of-the-decade-2010s">enduring crowd-pleasers of the century</a>. Death-defying stunts, a fantastic and deep cast, extremely quotable dialogue, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/6/1/8700423/watch-how-mad-max-used-center-framing-to-keep-the-action-scenes">breathtaking imagery</a>. But one of the most important elements in the movie, and the Mad Max franchise in general, is the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/9/21/9364407/mad-max-game-disabiliy-fury-road">evocative character design</a>.</p>
<p id="cGlfBc">The War Boys and The Doof Warrior get their fair share of attention, and rightly so — their designs are vivid and very memorable, and before a recent rewatch they were the characters I remembered the best. But there’s one group I feel gets overlooked, that I gained a new appreciation for on that recent rewatch: The Rock Riders.</p>

<p id="wvBHh1">The Rock Riders are a group of motorcycle-riding bandits who live in a canyon smack dab in the middle of the path of Furiosa’s breakaway convoy in <em>Fury Road</em>. Furiosa made a deal with them to trade Guzzolene for safe passage, but the Rock Riders reneged on that deal when they saw just how upset Immortan Joe was at Furiosa’s betrayal. </p>

<p id="OdkgjH">That leads to a very cool sequence where Furiosa and her crew fight off the Rock Riders, as their motorcycles jump over The War Rig and repeatedly drop bombs on it. It’s like a circus act shows up in the middle of <em>Fury Road</em>, injecting some extra life and excitement in a movie already full of it.</p>
<div id="loGjug"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-K20x3mFhZs?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="D3x4Cs">The circus act isn’t far off — the origin for the Rock Riders <a href="https://www.cbr.com/exclusive-brendan-mccarthy-goes-full-throttle-for-mad-max-fury-road/">came from a beach trip by co-writer Brendan McCarthy</a>. While at a surfer pub, a video caught his eye of bikers doing eye-popping stunts. He pitched the idea of bikers leaping over Furiosa’s truck to George Miller (who, naturally, loved it), and they <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/mad-max-fury-road-the-story-behind-its-most-insane-stunts-41441/">hired professional motocross riders from around the world</a> to perform the sequence. </p>
<p id="na359n"><em>Fury Road </em>is made up of many great action sequences, yes, but they work in large part because of the character designs behind them, and the hard work to pull them off. The Rock Riders might not get quite as much attention as some of their bandit brethren, but they deserve recognition for this excellent sequence.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/nintendo/24159010/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-deluxe-set-buy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="firstHeading">You might not know this if you grew up in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo">later eras of Nintendo</a>, but the company ran an esports competition called the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/6/15/8780155/nintendo-world-championships-e3-2015-kickoff">Nintendo World Championships</a> way back in 1990. The event toured 29 American cities and players from across the country gathered to compete using a custom Nintendo Entertainment System Game Pak. The cartridge used in the event went on to become a prized collectors’ item, but now, players will get a chance to buy a physical item directly inspired by it. </p>
<p id="7g4kUI">On Wednesday, Nintendo shared a trailer for the upcoming game, <em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</em>. The game recreates the competitive spirit of the event and will allow players to speedrun more than 150 “<a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-switch/">challenging moments</a>” from across 13 NES games like <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> and <em>Metroid</em>. In addition to the virtual eShop download, the company announced <em>Nintendo World Championships </em>would be getting a physical edition as well. And while it’s not replacement for those rare early NES cartridges from the actual competition — the physical version of the game has plenty to ooh and aah over. </p>
<p id="oxqPej">You can buy the <em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition – Deluxe Set</em> off of <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-deluxe-set-121051/">Nintendo’s website</a>. It will go on sale July 18 and cost $59.99. (The virtual game-only version costs $29.99.) The Deluxe Set comes with a Gold replica NES cartridge and stand to commemorate the 1990 World Championships, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/games/switch">Nintendo Switch</a> game card, 13 art cards, and a set of five pins. The golden NES pack cartridge is not playable, but this physical version touts details like embossed pixel art of the Nintendo games featured in the World Championships event. </p>

The polygonal graphics are inspired by the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-one-ps1-hanami-handheld-ff7-yveltalgriffin-1851410777&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-one-ps1-hanami-handheld-ff7-yveltalgriffin-1851410777">PlayStation 1</a></span> in the same way as the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/crow-country-indie-survival-horror-review-1851462202&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/crow-country-indie-survival-horror-review-1851462202">retro-horror trend</a></span> is. But its character models feel lifted from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-game-ever-thief-the-dark-project-is-the-only-way-5897240&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-game-ever-thief-the-dark-project-is-the-only-way-5897240"><em>Thief: The Dark Project</em></a></span>. <em>Dread Delusion</em> expertly weaves these inspirations together into a wholly unique cloth. It’s a game talked about in comparison, that manages to be more than its inspirations.</p><p>The star of <em>Dread Delusion</em> is its setting, the Oneiric Isles. A floating archipelago under a menacing red sky filled with warring armies and cosmic mysteries. As a prisoner of one such army, the player is essentially deputized into the fight and tasked with the mission of taking down a rebellious woman named Vela Callose. Infiltrating her fortress and assassinating her is your first goal, which you won’t be able to complete and will send you down a dozens-of-hours quest to finish the job. Once you have your (conditional) freedom from your jailers, <em>Dread Delusion</em> sets you loose in its weird world. </p><p><em>Dread Delusion</em> wants you to get lost. But don’t get so lost that you fall off the side of the map, these are floating islands remember? When the game warns you to watch your step at the start of your journey you, like me, might laugh and think that will never happen. Then you laugh right off the side of the island. It’s undeniably hilarious but also highlights that the world is in fact dangerous if you aren’t careful. Like <em>Morrowind</em>’s Vvardenfell or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-fromsoftware-review-hidetaka-miyazaki-dark-s-1848694257&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-fromsoftware-review-hidetaka-miyazaki-dark-s-1848694257"><em>Elden Ring</em></a></span>’s Lands Between, the joy of the Oneiric Isles is encountering its unique charms naturally along your journey. A pub inside of a dead god’s head, a castle haunted by illusions, a traveling college of wizards, all of these and more await the curious player. What makes all these discoveries so much more compelling is that they all have stories to tell—they aren’t just set dressing. Everything here has depth.</p><figure id="" data-id="1351a30b700f4b4fcb6f18074fde91a2" data-recommend-id="image://1351a30b700f4b4fcb6f18074fde91a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A withered man stands in front of a gothic city under a red sky" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A withered man stands in front of a gothic city under a red sky" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Dread XP</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1351a30b700f4b4fcb6f18074fde91a2" data-recommend-id="image://1351a30b700f4b4fcb6f18074fde91a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A withered man stands in front of a gothic city under a red sky" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That narrative depth and sense of discovery tendrils out from the game’s mechanical intricacy that offers so much player freedom. Like in <em>Elder Scrolls</em>, players are able to tailor their protagonist to different styles of play. You can focus on combat, magic, stealth, or even charm, and unlock different ways to complete problems. Instead of fighting your way through, maybe you could just befriend the guards and walk right into your desired area. It all depends on what skills you are able to unlock with Glimmers of Delusion, the resource that gives the game its name.<br></p><p>Combat does remain perhaps the most silly element of the game, a feeling I had during early access. <em>Here</em> the game lacks depth, and in most encounters, I find myself circling enemies and slashing until they die, a surprisingly effective tactic. It makes it simple but not very fun. Sneaking, lockpicking, and charming your way through encounters is always more compelling.</p><p>Tying leveling into a sense of cosmic horror is a great tonal decision that supports the game’s low-poly horror aesthetic. Visually and mechanically the game is unsettling in the most enthralling way, perhaps taking further inspiration from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/deciding-whether-to-restart-a-video-game-is-my-latest-d-1835134928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/deciding-whether-to-restart-a-video-game-is-my-latest-d-1835134928"><em>Pathologic</em></a></span>. But <em>Dread Delusion </em>shifts between so many different tones. It has cosmic horror and fantasy, but also comedy. The humor of the game feels especially well used in relation to its mechanics. Like in <em>Elder Scrolls</em> games, in which mechanical freedom often leads to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/i-met-a-very-immature-serial-killer-in-the-elder-scroll-1846839859&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/i-met-a-very-immature-serial-killer-in-the-elder-scroll-1846839859">hilarious unintended consequences</a></span>, <em>Dread Delusion</em>’s freedom will make absurd scenarios occur regularly. It’s nice that the game’s inhabitants have a sense of humor about it too.</p><p>In an already overflowing few weeks of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/animal-well-review-metroidvania-puzzle-2024-goty-1851465730&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/animal-well-review-metroidvania-puzzle-2024-goty-1851465730">compelling</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/1000xresist-indie-narrative-time-travel-impressions-1851466481&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/1000xresist-indie-narrative-time-travel-impressions-1851466481" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">indie</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-indie-pc-switch-review-1851476967&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-indie-pc-switch-review-1851476967">games</a></span> punching well above their weight, <em>Dread Delusion</em> is another fantastic game to put on your radar. Come for the deep skill system and the fascinating world, but stay for the unexpected adventures you’ll surely fall into. Just don’t fall off the sides.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Redfall is set to get one final update before work ends on it entirely. </p>



<p>In a message <a href="https://x.com/playRedfall/status/1791491460858020040" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on Twitter</a> on Friday, the game’s official account thanked fans for the support since it was announced that developer Arkane Austin was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-shutting-down-four-studios-including-tango-game-works-and-arkane-austin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of four studios being closed</a> by Microsoft.</p>



<p>The message went on to reveal some of the features included in the final update, including the promised offline mode that will allow players to play even after Microsoft shuts down the game’s servers in the future.</p>



<p>“We are working to release our final update, Game Update 4, that brings revamped Neighborhood and Nest systems, Single Player Pausing, Offline Mode, and more,” the Twitter post reads. “We’ll provide additional details soon. Thank you all.”</p>



<p>When it was first announced that Arkane Austin was closing, the studio said there would be no more updates for the game. It seems clear that, based on the pushback from players, releasing one last update was the best thing to do for players to ensure that they can keep playing the game now and in the future.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA VI) Trailer Breakdown</p>
      </div>
<p>GTA V originally launched in 2013 for PS3 and Xbox 360 before expanding to PC, PS4, and Xbox One. After that, the game came to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. One platform the game never launched on, though, was Nintendo Switch.</p><p>As for Red Dead Redemption II, the acclaimed Western has now passed 64 million units sold and the entire franchise has reached 89 million copies sold. The game originally launched in 2018 for PlayStation and Xbox before landing on PC in 2019. The series was back in the news recently regarding <a href="https://kotaku.com/rdr-red-dead-redemption-pc-port-leak-rockstar-launcher-1851473262" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">rumors of a potential port of the first Red Dead for PC.</a></p><p>Looking ahead, Rockstar is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-now-set-for-fall-2025/1100-6523520/" data-ref-id="1100-6523520">launching Grand Theft Auto VI in Fall 2025</a>. There is no word yet on if Rockstar will make a third mainline Red Dead game, as the current rumors about the franchise have focused on a potential port of the first game for PC.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>. Fortnite frequently changes. The next big change for Fortnite, Chapter 5 Season 3, is expected to kick off next week, and today Epic has let a major detail out into the open: A Fallout collaboration is on the way. Depicted in our first bit of art for the next season is the iconic Power Armor helmet from the Fallout franchise, as well as a pair of emojis in the tweet that act as a stand-in for the blonde-haired Vault Boy who is so intertwined with the Fallout universe.</p><p>The Fallout collab comes just a few weeks after the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-is-happening-amazon-confirms/1100-6522787/" data-ref-id="1100-6522787">Amazon Prime Video series became a huge hit</a>, and is just the latest in a years-long run of Epic's gargantuan video game platform staying in lockstep with pop-culture moments happening elsewhere.</p><p>It's not yet clear exactly what the crossover will entail, but an in-game skin seems like the bare minimum. Perhaps the new map and/or weapons will also be inspired by Bethesda's post-apocalyptic franchise.</p><p>The image also interestingly features what looks to be a massive dust storm and some sort of industrial tanks, lending credibility to the rumor that Chapter 5 Season 3 will feature some Mad Max-like dieselpunk inspirations, including an emphasis on vehicle combat--and likely a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/furiosa-a-mad-max-saga-review-a-whole-new-gear/1900-6418226/" data-ref-id="1900-6418226">Furiosa</a> crossover too.</p><p>For everything else we know about the next major Fortnite update, read our story on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-start-date/2900-5356/" data-ref-id="2900-5356">Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 3 start date</a> and more.</p>

                <p>A Star Wars-themed Total War game is reportedly currently in development over at Creative Assembly.</p><p>According to to <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/total-war-star-wars-reportedly-in-works-at-creative-assembly/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DualShockers</a>, there are three Total War games being worked on right now. It's unclear which project Creative Assembly is furthest along with in development. However, the closest one is presumably the next mainline installment, as Total War is an annual series. The only exception is 2021, which was the first year without a new mainline Total War game since 2014.</p><p>The second one is a Total War: Star Wars game that seemingly started development in October 2023. Currently, any info about the alleged third Total War game is unknown. The most recent game in the series is Total War: Pharoah, which was released last year. Creative Assembly Sofia is <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-pharaoh/blogs/19-total-war-pharaoh-update-announce" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">currently preparing a large update</a> for the game that will add more campaign content and cultures.</p><p>Back in September, parent company Sega canceled Creative Assembly's latest game, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/segas-shooter-hyenas-canceled-other-games-canned-as-well-as-part-of-restructuring/1100-6518042/" data-ref-id="1100-6518042">multiplayer shooter called Hyenas</a>, and it laid off the developers who were working on it. In November, Sega president Haruki Satomi said that Creative Assembly would go back to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/total-war-dev-creative-assembly-is-returning-to-real-time-strategy-games/1100-6519563/" data-ref-id="1100-6519563">creating RTS games such as Total War as that was the studio's primary expertise</a>.</p>

But it seems like the fallout from this recent boom in popularity hasn't died down quite yet. Thanks to a teaser shared on Fortnite's official social media pages, we know that Fallout will be coming to Fortnite pretty soon</p>



<p>The teaser image shows power armor in a cloud of orange dust, accompanied by what appears to be some sort of industrial building. Other than that, there's not much to go on, but we can make educated guesses. For one, Fortnite's current season will end on May 24, so this is the perfect time to tease the skins that might be coming in the next battle pass. And if it's anything like the recent <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f5b5da80-dc07-4895-9626-9cdca5c3d817" href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/04/09/avatar-the-last-airbender-skins-now-available-in-fortnite">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a> and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ef3902aa-9994-4d48-bfe5-4dd44b9364c8" href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/04/15/fortnites-next-star-wars-crossover-will-span-lego-festival-and-battle-royale-modes">Star Wars crossovers</a>, we might see Fallout-themed mechanics or areas appear on the battle royale map itself.</p>

<p>It will almost certainly involve some sort of cosmetic pack as well, which could include characters from the games, the Amazon Prime show, or both. Thanks to the teaser, we know power armor will be making an appearance, but it's unclear whether it will be an item to equip in-game or a skin that can be unlocked or purchased.</p>

            <p>
A final update is on its way to Redfall after all.
</p>
<p>
Following the news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">Microsoft was closing a number of Bethesda studios</a> including Redfall developer Arkane Austin, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/redfall-studio-was-reportedly-working-on-offline-mode-for-may-release-before-closure">the team was working on DLC and updates</a> - including an offline mode - until very recently.

</p>
<p>
A new post on X, however, states the update is still on the way. "Thank you all for your supportive messages," it reads. "We are working to release our final update, Game Update 4, that brings revamped Neighbourhood and Nest systems, Single Player Pausing, Offline Mode, and more. We'll provide additional details soon. Thank you all."

What's not specifically mentioned here, though, is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/redfall-hero-pass-dlc-still-missing-a-year-after-its-release">Hero Pass DLC</a>, which will add two new player characters to the vampire shooter but remains missing a year after the game's release.
</p>
<p>
This was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/redfall-hero-pass-cancelled-following-arkane-austin-closure">cancelled after the studio closure</a>, with players directed to a <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/?linkId=100000260400360#en/answer/65606">Bethesda support page</a> with details forthcoming of a credit programme to reimburse anyone who already purchased the DLC.

</p>
<p>
At present, that support page still stands. It suggests that while the offline mode and other requested features are still on the way, the Hero Pass is not.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Bethesda to confirm.
</p>
<p>
Even before this final update, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/one-last-stroll-through-redfall-at-the-pace-it-was-always-meant-to-be-played">Redfall remains worth checking out through one last stroll of its world</a>.

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/playRedfall/status/1791491460858020040" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on&nbsp;<em>Redfall</em>'s official X (formerly Twitter) account, Arkane Austin says that one last update, titled Game Update 4, is in the works for&nbsp;<em>Redfall</em>, so it looks like the studio will get to finish <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/redfall-offline-mode-update-report">what it was working on before that shutdown</a> after all.</p>

<p>The first major feature the update will bring is the long-called-for Offline Mode, which will allow you to play&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>without being connected to a server. With online games being shut down left, right, and center, this is a pretty important move for preservation.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/redfall-update-offline-mode-vampire-stairs.jpg?itok=M8bwdiZP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/redfall-update-offline-mode-vampire-stairs.jpg?itok=DNYIrNCA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>is getting one last update after all.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to being able to play offline, the last&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>update will also bring "revamped Neighborhood and Nest systems", and Arkane doesn't seem to have intended that pun.</p>

<p>The update will also bring the ability to pause the game if you're in single-player mode, so no more getting ganked by nasty vampires while you're making a cup of coffee in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Arkane says additional details for the update will be revealed "soon", and there's no release date for the update yet, so it might be a little while before it arrives.</p>

<p>Still, it's nice to know that although&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>was much maligned by critics and players alike, there will still be a way to revisit it in future, even if it is just to figure out what went wrong.</p>

You'll soon be able to do just that.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Redfall</em>, it's a shooter developed by&nbsp;<em>Prey&nbsp;</em>studio Arkane Austin.</p>

<p><em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>has a multiplayer focus (although it can technically be played single-player), with each character taking the role of one of the game's survivors, each of whom has special abilities that complement the rest of the group.</p>

<p>On release,&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/14768/redfall" rel="noopener" target="_blank">met with ambivalence</a> by critics and players, with many pointing to its lack of Arkane's signature immersive sim-style gameplay features, as well as the shallowness of its gameplay loops and story.</p>

<p>Last week, Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">made the call to shut down Arkane Austin</a>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>developer Tango Gameworks and two other studios.&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>will, however, seemingly survive the death of its studio. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>Around a week after Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">shuttered a number of beloved studios</a> with a track record of making excellent single-player, story-driven games, their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-finally-buys-activision-blizzard-as-last-legal-hurdles-fall-away">newly-owned arm of Activision</a> has revealed a brand new studio. Working on a new series of story-driven, triple-A games.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The unveiling of Elsewhere Entertainment comes days after the sudden and shocking closure of Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks and Mighty Dog Studios, who between them have been responsible for games including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prey">Prey</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-evil-within-2">The Evil Within</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghostwire-tokyo">Tokyo: Ghostwire</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> and more.</p>
<p>With the exception of multiplayer misfire <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/redfall">Redfall</a>, the likes of Arkane and Tango were arguably known for specialising in inventive and well-liked-to-loved single-player titles built around their narratives, making the emergence of a new studio doing exactly that somewhat frustrating timing.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting, of course, that Activision and Microsoft operate separately in many respects - including budgets - despite now being merged into one multi-billion-dollar megacorp, so the new Activision studio’s launch isn’t directly tied to Microsoft’s decision to close several other developers. (Elsewhere will apparently draw from Activision’s resources and use their tools for their projects.)</p>
<p>On top of that, the Polish team made up of devs with experience on Naughty Dog’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us">The Last of Us</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/uncharted-legacy-of-thieves-collection">Uncharted</a>, CD Projekt Red’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, and Ubisoft’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division">The Division</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a> was <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/activision-and-microsoft-are-opening-a-new-game-studio-in-poland-elsewhere-entertainment-with-a-totally-new-ip">apparently put together a little while back</a>, rather than being freshly formed now.</p>
<p>Given those particular credits, it might not come as a surprise to learn that Elsewhere will be working on an original “narrative-based and genre-defining AAA franchise", which lines up with those blockbuster single-player titles.</p>
<p>“The team’s underlying mission encourages everyone to explore and collaborate creatively to craft a franchise with an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games,” Activision added in their <a href="https://blog.activision.com/activision/2024/activision-announces-new-studio-elsewhere-entertainment-all-new-franchise-development">announcement</a>.</p>
<p>By “enduring legacy” and “resonates beyond games”, I can only assume they mean “makes a whole boatload of money and gets turned into a prestige TV show like The Last of Us and The Witcher”. Whatever it ends up being, expect it to be at least a while off while Elsewhere continues to staff up on their debut project.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/24158250/upgrade-netflix-movie-cyberpunk-scifi</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/upgrade-is-a-terrific-cyberpunk-thriller-disguised-as-an-action-movie-and-it%E2%80%99s-now-on-netflix.874191/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/24158250/upgrade-netflix-movie-cyberpunk-scifi<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="oyOft2">Compelling sci-fi dystopias are few and far between in movies these days, which is why it might be surprising that one of the best is hiding inside an underappreciated action movie from 2018. <em>Upgrade</em>, which arrived on Netflix this week, is full of bone-crunching, genuinely funny action, but it’s also secretly a fantastic thriller with an excellent sci-fi world hiding beneath the surface. </p>
<p id="m2tJ6n">The movie follows Grey (Logan Marshall-Green), a mechanic living in a not-too-distant future. Early in the film, Grey’s wife gets murdered in a seemingly random mugging that leaves him paralyzed, but he finds an opportunity for revenge thanks to an experimental cybernetic implant, called STEM, that allows him to walk again. But that implant seems to have a mind of its own, and talks to him almost constantly.</p>
<p id="XbbP80">This dynamic between STEM and Grey (voiced by Simon Maiden) gives <em>Upgrade </em>a surprisingly welcome dose of comedy that most action movies or thrillers don’t make time for. Because STEM can’t read Grey’s mind, Grey has to say everything he wants to tell STEM out loud, leading to hilarious fight scenes that leaves bad guys (who are also getting their asses kicked) completely baffled. It’s all the fun of Tom Hardy’s <em>Venom</em>, without the constraints of comic book characters holding anything back, and with the added comedy of a cold emotionless machine processing helping make the violent decisions quicker.</p>
<p id="O67W14">The fights themselves are also an excellent blend of silly and brutal that keeps them fun. Because Grey doesn’t really have a natural talent for fighting, he has to let STEM take over his body for brawls. As such, every fight is as robotic as you’d expect from a microchip learning to pilot a person. Arm and leg movements are staccato and instant, with barely any bending or smoothness to them at all. Punches are blocked without thought and delivered even more swiftly, and gunshots land with the perfect precision of an algorithm that’s worked it all out ahead of time.</p>

<p id="kH7o2l">What really sells all this is Logan Marshall-Green’s reaction to it. He plays the character like if Tom Hardy was in an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23737241/every-i-think-you-should-leave-sketch-ranked-best-to-worst-itysl"><em>I Think You Should Leave</em> sketch</a>, with a mix of terrified faces, unintelligible yells, and confused expressions, all while he’s putting random assassins in the dirt or throwing them through walls. For its part, the camera follows this strange style of movement too, frequently bending with Grey when he dodges a punch at an unnatural angle, giving us bizarre views and tipping us into the same kind of passenger-in-his-own-body feeling that Grey has when STEM takes over.</p>
<p id="7HuwUT">But in between all this action, director and writer Leigh Whannell (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/2/28/21154461/invisible-man-review-movie-elisabeth-moss-blumhouse-saw-leigh-whannell"><em>The Invisible Man</em></a>, <em>Insidious</em>), fills <em>Upgrade</em>’s world to the brim with fascinating details. Voice assistants and self-driving cars are just starting to eclipse the old mechanical ones on the road — putting Grey’s custom car repair business in jeopardy — while humans are getting augmentations to improve their everyday lives. The big city is swarming with police drones that monitor every street and alley for crime, but somehow never actually do anything to prevent it. While most of society is aware that human modification is common, the cops seem baffled to see it, making them feel decades behind the crimes they’re trying to solve. </p>
<p id="bW2vj5">It’s the kind of setting that feels quietly on the precipice of a full-on cyberpunk dystopia. The movie’s main characters all live in beautiful high-tech homes that look like they cost a fortune, while the side characters reside in abandoned apartment buildings, tiny run-down houses at the edge of town, or tent cities. Meanwhile, in the background of one scene we see a few people hooked into VR-headsets they rarely ever disconnect from, because for some, living in the virtual world is easier than living in the real one. The movie presents its nameless city setting as one slowly sliding into a massive class disparity that leaves only the ultra-wealthy and the incredibly poor, and it’s happening incrementally enough that no one in the movie even thinks to comment on it. </p>
<p id="hWoJI1">It’s rare that any movie manages to craft a cyberpunk world so subtly, but it’s even rarer when it’s all tucked neatly inside a black comedy about violent revenge, but that’s exactly what <em>Upgrade </em>pulls off. And while it wasn’t a particularly big hit in theaters back in 2018, hopefully the movie can get the appreciation it deserves now that it’s on Netflix. </p>

This led to the games becoming more popular than ever, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-show-nexus-mods-heavy-traffic-fallout-4-1851425977&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-show-nexus-mods-heavy-traffic-fallout-4-1851425977">even crashing a mod site in the process</a></span>. So it’s not surprising that Epic and Bethesda would work together on a big <em>Fallout/Fortnite</em> event. </p><p>At the moment, as previously mentioned, we don’t know much about what to expect with this crossover or when it will go live in <em>Fortnite</em>. It’s possible that this will be a tiny thing, just a few skins and nothing more. But I’d bet a few V-Bucks that this is a bigger event that will feature more than just a few cosmetic items, maybe even some quests. The teaser image posted by Epic seems to show at least one on-the-map location inspired by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-amazon-prime-bethesda-1851421573&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-amazon-prime-bethesda-1851421573"><em>Fallout</em></a></span>, so perhaps there’s more to this upcoming event than just cool-looking power armor. </p><p>Interestingly, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-dataminers-unearth-evidence-of-fallout-gundam-and-the-crow-crossovers-for-modern-warfare-3-season-4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-dataminers-unearth-evidence-of-fallout-gundam-and-the-crow-crossovers-for-modern-warfare-3-season-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">earlier in May</a></span>, <em>Call of Duty Warzone </em>dataminers discovered evidence of a <em>Fallout</em> crossover happening in that battle royale game. Is that still going to happen? Will they happen at the same time? For now, we just have to wait and see.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-memorial-day-deals-xbox-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">In search of Xbox deals over Memorial Day weekend? Here's what we think will pop up.</h2></div><div><section><p>There are a few different points in the year that feature some great sale events, offering excellent discounts on a variety of gaming-related items. Memorial Day weekend is one of those times and usually has quite a few deals for Xbox fans to enjoy. Whether you’re looking for deals on games or controllers or storage, there’s plenty to check out at numerous different retailers.</p><p>While we don’t know what exactly will be hitting those virtual sale shelves this year, we can take a good look at previous years to see what could be making a comeback. Below, you can also find information on when Memorial Day lands this year, how long sales will last, and when the next big sale event will be that you can mark your calendar for.</p><p><strong>Best Xbox Deals Today</strong></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/wKDXA?_ga=1195960001.1647009307" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate 3-Month<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$36.99</span></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/NMXbE?_ga=1195960001.1647009307" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank">Xbox Core Wireless Controller – Robot White<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$35.99</span></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/dPVeM?_ga=1195960001.1647009307" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank">Xbox Series X Mini Fridge<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$39.94</span></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/5OYlN" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank">Xbox Series X Diablo 4 Bundle<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$469.99</span></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/MY3X4" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank">Xbox Wireless Headset (Official)<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$89.99</span></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/3v3em" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$30.00</span></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Y0r6o" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank">Seagate Storage Expansion Card For Xbox Series XS 1TB<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$139.99</span></li></ul></div><h2>When is Memorial Day?</h2><p>While Memorial Day lands on <strong>Monday, May 27</strong>, some of the sales start up a bit earlier. Sometimes even a week before, but that depends entirely on the retailer. Places like Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart will put up a notice on their respective websites stating when their sale event begins and how long it will last for, so it's worth checking out your preferred site to see when the best time to buy is.</p><p>It's also worth noting that some of these retailers offer early access to sale events through their respective memberships. Though that hasn't been confirmed yet at one of their locations for this one, it's still worth keeping in mind. Places like Walmart, for example, offer this through their Walmart+ membership and you can even score a free 30-day trial to test it out! They're also offering some excellent bonus offers right now that you can take advantage of, like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-plus-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-deal"><u>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for two months for free</u></a>, a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-plus-youtube-premium-free-trial"><u>three-month trial of YouTube Premium for free</u></a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-plus-apple-music-deal"><u>five months of Apple Music for free</u></a>, and more.</p><h2>What Xbox Deals to Expect This Year</h2><p>Based on previous years, there are quite a few different Xbox deals that could pop up again this year. Xbox video game deals will absolutely come back around, but last year saw various <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/here-are-saturdays-best-memorial-day-deals">expansion cards go on sale</a> and there's a very good chance that Xbox controllers will be discounted as well. We'll make sure to update this piece with the best Xbox deals as they appear, but if you simply can't wait for Memorial Day weekend and want to see what the best deals are right now, make sure to have a look at our roundup of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-deals">best Xbox deals</a>.</p><h2>How Long Do Memorial Day Sales Last?</h2><p>While some sales will just run through the three-day weekend, others can extend a few days after, which is nice if you're feeling on a tight schedule of picking up your favorite deals. Again, this entirely depends on the retailer, so it's worth checking out your preferred shop to see what their sale event plans are.</p><h2>When Will the Next Sale Event Happen After Memorial Day?</h2><p>Summer is a great time to shop around as there are a wide variety of sale events that go on over those months. You won't even have to wait too long for the next one, as June usually sees some big Summer gaming sales very early on. With <a href="https://www.ign.com/live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN Live</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/summer-game-fest-2024-date-and-livestream-details-officially-announced">Summer Game Fest</a> kicking the festivities off this year in June, there will likely be a sale that happens around that time on each platform's store. IGN Live will run from <strong>June 7-9 in LA </strong>and SGF's big livestream event will kick off on <strong>June 7 at 2pm PT/5pm ET/10pm GMT</strong>, so make sure to keep your eyes peeled around this time to see what the Xbox Store has up its sleeve.</p><p>Not long after these events will be <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prime-day-2024">Amazon Prime Day</a>, which is an excellent time for Prime members to scope out deals they may have missed over Memorial Day weekend. While we don't know the exact dates for it this year, if it follows the pattern of previous years, it'll likely land around the second week of July. </p><p>If you want to see even more deals outside of Xbox, check out our roundups of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-playstation-ps5-deals">best PlayStation deals</a>, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals"><u>best Nintendo Switch deals</u></a>, and the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pc-video-game-steam-deals">best PC video game deals</a>.

Competitive gaming YouTubers are reportedly already playing under a non-disclosure agreement.</p><p>However, that hasn’t stopped what looks like a slew of screenshots showing off Deadlock. X/Twitter account <a href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/1791115270905290793" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@gabefollower</a> was first with the details, describing Deadlock as a third-person hero-based shooter, with 6v6 battles on big maps with four lanes. There are abilities and items alongside tower defense mechanics. The setting is described as fantasy with steampunk.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Since testers started sharing Deadlock screenshots all over the place, here's ones I can verify, featuring one of the heroes called Grey Talon. <a href="https://t.co/KdZSRxObSz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/KdZSRxObSz</a></p>— ‎Gabe Follower (@gabefollower) <a href="https://twitter.com/gabefollower/status/1791311128422748285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>These elements will be familiar to players of Valve’s multiplayer online battle area (MOBA) game Dota 2 as well as its own hero shooter, Team Fortress 2. Blizzard’s Overwatch, Riot's Valorant, and Hi-Rez’s Smite also look like they're in the mix.</p><p>Valve boss Gabe Newell is yet to announce Deadlock. IGN has asked Valve for comment.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Every IGN Valve Game Review</h3></div></output><p>Valve’s last developed game to release was competitive first-person shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/counter-strike-2">Counter-Strike 2</a>, which effectively replaced Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Before that, in 2020, Valve released <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a> exclusively for virtual reality headsets. Valve has also released a Dota-themed digital card game called <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/artifact">Artifact</a> and a Dota auto chess game called <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dota-underlords">Dota Underlords</a>, although both have failed to find as big of an audience as the company’s previous titles.</p><p>All the while, the wait for Half-Life 3 continues. Back in 2020, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-3-left-4-dead-3-details-cancelled-valve">a making-of for Half-Life: Alyx revealed a swathe of games developed and shelved by Valve</a> between the release of Half-Life 2: Episode 2 and Valve's latest VR game. That list included details on a version of Half-Life 3 that was in development for around a year, and an open-world Left 4 Dead 3.</p><p><em>Photo by Olly Curtis/Future Publishing via Getty Images</em></p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Booty also confirmed that Redfall's servers will remain online.</p><p>It seems like Game Update 4 only contains quality-of-life changes, as there's no mention of any additional story content. Those who purchased the premium editions of the game were entitled to two extra playable heroes. After Arkane Austin's closure, however, they were instead promised credits for the undelivered content.</p><p>Redfall is available on PC and Xbox Series X|S, as well as Xbox Game Pass. The game is included in <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/pick-and-mix/build-your-own-supreme-collection?aff_track=CJ&amp;CJEVENT=af14b923146511ef817d01af0a1cb826&amp;utm_source=CJ&amp;cj_pid=100770772&amp;cj_aid=13797872" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a Fanatical bundle</a> (both GameSpot and Fanatical are owned by Fandom) as part of the Supreme Collection.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/final-fantasy-xiv-players-left-feeling-excluded-by-region-locked-mountain-dew-promo/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=final-fantasy-xiv-players-left-feeling-excluded-by-region-locked-mountain-dew-promo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="288" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Any <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> player will know by now, considering the <a href="https://x.com/search?q=ffxiv%20mountain%20dew&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deluge of memes</a> across the internet, that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/final-fantasy-xiv-adds-the-mountain-zu-a-mountain-dew-themed-bird-mount/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>FFXIV </em>and Mountain Dew Gaming</a> are working together on a promotion that provides prizes both in and out of the virtual world. But for those excluded from events, it’s not much fun.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="358" data-injectable="false">The bummer here is that the Mountain Dew Gaming partnership isn’t for all players on the North American Data Centers — the <a href="https://www.mtndewgaming.com/terms-and-conditions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">terms and conditions</a> state it’s for residents of the United States only — so that excludes a lot of players typically in that region. And for physical prizes, there’s no shipping outside of the continental US. </p> <p data-characters="239" data-current-count="597" data-injectable="true">Of course, more region locked codes have frustrated players excluded again, particularly those in North American Data Centers but not US residents. The responses to<em> Final Fantasy XIV’s</em> official Twitter account demonstrate as much. <br></p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We're excited to partner with <a href="https://twitter.com/MTNDEWGaming?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MTNDEWGaming</a> to offer fun rewards!</p><p>Please note that the Mountain Zu/Sparkling Citrus Refreshment item codes cannot be redeemed on Mog Station until Dawntrail early access. Attempting to redeem before then will display an "invalid code" error. <a href="https://t.co/GYGvNT6cWA">https://t.co/GYGvNT6cWA</a></p></div>— FINAL FANTASY XIV (@FF_XIV_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1791177357979697259?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="222" data-current-count="522" data-injectable="true">The complaints are pretty evenly spread between <a href="https://x.com/ChaosValentine/status/1791183714346528957" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Canadian players</a> upset and confused they aren’t included, and those in the <a href="https://x.com/umbrastaff/status/1791182937456771406" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UK and EU</a> lamenting that we don’t even seem to get thrown the scraps of these promotions.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">There’s one <a href="https://x.com/TailzSnowMew/status/1791181116033921485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common theme</a> among the comments – why are these promotions region locked? This isn’t the first time that North America (or a select part of it) has benefited from a promotion while the rest of us could only look on longingly. Off the top of my head, I can name two that happened in 2021:</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="389" data-injectable="false"> <li><a href="https://x.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1390023980195532801" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Butterfinger promo</a>, which gave players the Chocorpokkur mount</li> <li>The controversial <a href="https://x.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1726571133254963235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grubhub promotion</a>, which gave players the ‘Eat Pizza’ emote</li> </ul> <p data-characters="157" data-current-count="546" data-injectable="true">Admittedly, the Eat Pizza emote is now available to purchase on the<em> FFXIV</em> Online Store, but the Chocorpokkur mount is still only owned by those in the USA.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="279" data-injectable="false">Of course, there are other promotions, such as the Japan-exclusive KFC promotion, which provides players with the ‘Eat Chicken’ emote. But I’d like to mention here that the only promotion that happened in the EU was <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/9303c603b00fb18f64bd7d0beaeba8eead0ebecd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this one</a> back in 2016, which didn’t make it to the UK. </p> <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="613" data-injectable="true">During the May 16 Live Letter stream, Yoshida noted EU Data Center players should shout out ideas and partnerships they’d like to see. It’s a nice gesture and all, but it’s been a while, and even if you play on one of the Data Centers typically of a certain region, there’s no guarantee you’re included. </p>
 <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">Maybe I’m just salty. After all, I am a British player on North American servers, so I will soon have the Mountain Dew exclusive rewards in front of my face with no way of earning them, while my American friends discuss how much Mountain Dew they need to buy to get cool items.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="283" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Are you <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-prepare-for-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preparing for <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em></a>? Well, if not, it might be time to do so, as not only is the community <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-month-ahead-of-the-final-shape-destiny-2s-community-is-at-ease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seemingly fully on board</a> with Bungie’s next flagship, but there’s a lot of exciting stuff being shown off, like the improved weapon enhancement system.</p> <p data-characters="705" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true">Indeed, <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid-05-16-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie’s latest <em>This Week in Destiny</em> blog post</a> has gone in-depth on <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s new and improved weapon enhancement feature, and everything suggests it’s going to be a hoot. The gist of it is that all the currently active weapons (i.e. the stuff that’s been issued out after <em>Beyond Light</em>) will have access to an up-to-date version of the masterworking and levelling systems, available via the three-stage enhancement upgrades that unlock as a given weapon is levelled-up. Some of the biggest boons of the new system include the ability to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-how-to-unlock-the-lost-memento/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">apply a Memento to a non-craftable weapon</a>, for example, though the same functionality will not be available on <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-can-you-get-your-old-sunset-guns-back-after-the-final-shape-comes-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously sunset gear</a>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-destiny-2-the-final-shape-adds-three-stages-of-weapon-enhancement" data-injectable="false">Destiny 2: The Final Shape adds three stages of weapon enhancement</h2> <p data-characters="419" data-current-count="719" data-injectable="true">Broadly, <em>The Final Shape</em>‘s new weapon enhancement system allows you to upgrade <em>most</em> of the game’s available weapons to gain access to enhanced traits, weapon levels, and a Memento socket. A rougher, work-in-progress version of this new system has been available for some time now via the Raid Adept weapons, but the same features (and then some) will be accessible to a wider array of gear with the new DLC.</p>
 <p data-characters="61" data-current-count="61" data-injectable="false">Here’s how the new weapon enhancement system will work:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="181" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Enhancement Tier 1:</strong> replaces a weapon’s Masterwork, unlocks an enhanced intrinsic, leveling, and a Memento socket; Raid Adept weapons can have their perks adjusted via the Martian Relic</li> <li><strong>Enhancement Tier 2 (at weapon level 11):</strong> upgrades the weapon’s left column trait to its enhanced version</li> <li><strong>Enhancement Tier 3 (at weapon level 17):</strong> upgrades the weapon’s right column trait to its enhanced version</li> </ul> <p data-characters="175" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false">Further, Bungie has promised that all of the currently available weapons from the following activities will be eligible to acquire enhanced traits in some way, shape, or form:</p> <ul data-found-items="7" data-current-count="636" data-injectable="true"> <li>Vow of the Disciple (Adepts)</li> <li>King’s Fall (Adepts)</li> <li>Guardian Games</li> <li>Gambit PvPvE</li> <li>Crucible PvP (including Competitive, Iron Banner, and Trials of Osiris activities)</li> <li>Vanguard PvE (Operations, Nightfalls)</li> <li>Prophecy Dungeon</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="441" data-current-count="441" data-injectable="true">“Unfortunately,” says Bungie’s blog, “due to some technical constraints, there are a handful of weapons instances from before Season 17 that have origin traits and are active drops, but they will not be eligible for weapon enhancement. If a weapon is not actively dropping in these activities and playlists or it’s under the legacy focusing options, it will not be enhance-able when The Final Shape releases.”</p>
 <p data-characters="506" data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true">It shouldn’t be overly surprising that some of the active weapons will be precluded from the system, given how many different iterations of the weapon enhancement system <em>Destiny 2</em> has gone through over the years. We don’t yet have a concrete list of the weapons that won’t be eligible for enhancement just yet, but the good news is that Bungie will update them to support the new system “if [they] are reissued and become a part of a playlist’s active drops once again.”</p>
 <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="355" data-injectable="false">It’s good news all around, then, and it seems that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-content-update-and-four-streams-completely-turned-the-destiny-2-community-around/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie has successfully turned <em>Destiny 2</em> around</a> following all the problems that cropped up during the year of <em>Lightfall</em>. It’s an impressive feat, to be sure, and it’ll become even more impressive if Bungie manages to deliver something truly meaningful and engaging with <em>The Final Shape</em>.</p>
