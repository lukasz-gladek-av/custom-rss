            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-march-2025-all-news-and-announcements<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, Nintendo held a Direct showcase based on upcoming Switch games, and we've got all the news and announcements from that showcase right here.</p>

<p>As a reminder, this Direct doesn't have anything for you when it comes to the Switch 2; you'll have to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">wait until next week's show</a> for that. With that in mind, here's everything that was announced during today's Nintendo Direct showcase!</p>

<hr><h2><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD Remaster</em>&nbsp;still coming this year</h2>

<p>First, we got to see a little footage from the upcoming JRPG collection&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD Remaster</em>, which is still coming to Switch sometime this year. No release date was revealed for the collection, sadly.</p>

<h2><em>No Sleep for Kaname Date - From AI: The Somnium Files&nbsp;</em>is a&nbsp;<em>Zero Escape</em>-style adventure</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-direct-march-2025-ai-somnium-files.jpg?itok=-Dhrt5J0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-direct-march-2025-ai-somnium-files.jpg?itok=_CzgAo5U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>AI: The Somnium Files&nbsp;</em>game is coming.</figcaption></figure><p>Next up, it's time to take a look at the next game in the&nbsp;<em>AI: The Somnium Files&nbsp;</em>series. This one stars detective Kaname Date, who must work together with the sophisticated AI embedded in his eye in order to save internet personality Iris from a "mysterious escape game". It's coming to Switch on July 25th.</p>

<h2><em>Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army&nbsp;</em>has more Atlus RPG shenanigans</h2>

<p>A remastered version of Atlus' action RPG <i>Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army&nbsp;</i>is coming to Switch on June 19th. If you like&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>but wish the combat was a bit more active, this one's probably for you.</p>

<h2><em>Shadow Labyrinth&nbsp;</em>is, uh, a&nbsp;<em>Pac-Man&nbsp;</em>Metroidvania</h2>

<p>Have you ever wanted Pac-Man to star in his very own Metroidvania platformer? Well, you're in luck.&nbsp;<em>Shadow Labyrinth&nbsp;</em>is that very thing, although you're teaming up with "Puck" rather than exclusively playing as him. This one's coming on July 18th.</p>

<h2><em>Patapon 1+2 Replay&nbsp;</em>brings the&nbsp;<em>Patapon&nbsp;</em>games to Switch in July</h2>

<p>The PSP's&nbsp;<em>Patapon&nbsp;</em>games were some of that system's most delightful and joyful titles, and they're now coming to Switch as part of&nbsp;<em>Patapon 1+2 Replay</em>, which will hit the system on July 11th.</p>

<h2><em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar&nbsp;</em>is a remake of a DS farming classic</h2>

<p>A new&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons&nbsp;</em>game is coming to Switch...well, sort of.&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar&nbsp;</em>is a remake of the DS game (which was released under the series' previous&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon&nbsp;</em>name), and it's coming on August 27th.</p>

<h2>More&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond&nbsp;</em>gameplay info revealed</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-direct-march-2025.jpg?itok=S1CsocbO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-direct-march-2025.jpg?itok=1slXJ7c2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond&nbsp;</em>is shaping up to be great, but I wish we had a release date for it.</figcaption></figure><p>Next, we got a new look at hotly-anticipated first-person shooter&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>. No release date, sadly, but we did get to see some of the game's combat, which looks like it's in the classic&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime&nbsp;</em>tradition.</p>

<p>We also got to see some of Samus' new psychic abilities, which can be used both to explore the world around you and to enhance combat.</p>

<h2><em>Disney Villains Cursed Cafe</em>&nbsp;is essentially&nbsp;<em>Coffee Talk&nbsp;</em>with added Ursula</h2>

<p>If you thought&nbsp;<em>Coffee Talk&nbsp;</em>could use some extra villainy, this next one is for you.&nbsp;<em>Disney Villains Cursed Cafe&nbsp;</em>lets you brew potions and serve them to Disney villains, and the kinds of potions you brew can even have an effect on the story. You can play it on Switch later today.</p>

<h2><em>Witchbrook&nbsp;</em>looks like the cozy magic school game you've been waiting for</h2>

<p>Next, it's time for a look at Chucklefish's&nbsp;<em>Witchbrook</em>, a cozy magic school game in which you can fly on broomsticks, learn magic spells, and hang out with other witches. This one's heading to Switch sometime this holiday season.</p>

<h2>Action and arcade sizzle reel</h2>

<p>Nintendo showed an action and arcade-focused sizzle reel next, featuring THQ's hand-drawn platformer&nbsp;<em>The Eternal Life of Goldman&nbsp;</em>(coming this holiday), retro collection <i>Gradius Origins&nbsp;</i>(launching in August), and rhythm game&nbsp;<em>Rift of the NecroDancer&nbsp;</em>(coming to Switch today).</p>

<h2><em>Tamagotchi Plaza&nbsp;</em>is a new&nbsp;<em>Tamagotchi Connection&nbsp;</em>game</h2>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Tamagotchi Plaza</em>, twelve stores await your help, and you can do everything from designing eyewear through to, uh, being a dentist. The game features over 100 "new and classic" Tamagotchi and launches on June 27th.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>sure does look fun</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-direct-march-2025.jpg?itok=O-ewIs2x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-direct-march-2025.jpg?itok=pQ-yMcvi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll have to fight a lot of trainers to be the very best in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>We were treated to some more&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>info next, although much of it was already revealed in February's&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>Presents show.</p>

<p>This Nintendo Direct showed off some of the game's Z-A Royale tournament, which will let you face off against fellow Trainers for the chance to "have a wish granted". Still no release date, though.</p>

<h2><em>Rhythm Heaven Groove&nbsp;</em>brings more fun rhythm minigames next year</h2>

<p>Next, we got to see a new entry in the&nbsp;<em>Rhythm Heaven&nbsp;</em>series, which is always welcome. This one will have lots of the franchise's signature quirky, off-the-wall minigames when it comes to Switch next year.</p>

<h2>Nintendo's new Virtual Game Card system looks...odd</h2>

<p>It looks like Nintendo is introducing a new system for game-sharing between Switch consoles. The Virtual Game Card system will render each digital purchase as a Virtual Game Card, which can then be loaded onto second Switch consoles using local communication.</p>

<p>Two systems can share cards freely, and you can also lend cards out to those on your family Switch account for two weeks. Nintendo says this system will make "digital games even easier to use", and it's being added in late April. It'll be used on Switch 2 as well.</p>

<h2>More sizzle reel goodness</h2>

<p>A few more games are making their way to Switch, and we got a sizzle reel for them. Here are the games that were featured in that reel.</p>

<ul><li><em>High on Life&nbsp;</em>(May 6th)</li>
	<li><em>Star Overdrive&nbsp;</em>(April 10th)</li>
	<li><em>The Wandering Village&nbsp;</em>(July 17th)</li>
	<li><em>King of Meat&nbsp;</em>(2025)</li>
	<li><em>Lou's Lagoon&nbsp;</em>(Summer 2025)</li>
	<li><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>(May 21st)</li>
	<li><em>SaGa Frontier 2 Remastered&nbsp;</em>(later today)</li>

The first two games will be available for the system on April 15th, along with all of their DLC, and the third entry is heading to Nintendo's console in summer.</p>

<h2><em>Everybody's Golf: Hot Shots&nbsp;</em>brings wacky golf to Switch this year</h2>

<p>A new&nbsp;<em>Everybody's Golf&nbsp;</em>game is heading to Switch this year, bringing the series' signature cartoony golfing action to Nintendo's console. It'll support local play or online multiplayer for up to 4 players.</p>

<h2><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion&nbsp;</em>calls back to retro beat-'em-ups</h2>

<p>Next, a beat-'em-up right out of the 16-bit era was revealed.&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion&nbsp;</em>is a sidescroller from Dotemu that lets you play as classic Marvel heroes like Spider-Man, Captain America, and Venom, and it supports four-player co-op. It's coming this holiday.</p>

<h2><em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream&nbsp;</em>looks characteristically offbeat</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-nintendo-direct-march-2025.jpg?itok=ripQbsBN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-nintendo-direct-march-2025.jpg?itok=eOqrj2eC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Aaaaargh!</figcaption></figure><p>The first new&nbsp;<em>Tomodachi Life&nbsp;</em>game in over ten years was revealed as Nintendo's final game announcement for this Nintendo Direct. It'll see Mii characters living on an island at sea and interacting with each other in all kinds of fun ways, and it's coming next year.</p>

<h2>A new Nintendo app is being released</h2>

<p>Finally, we got to see a new Nintendo app being released for smart devices. Nintendo Today! will feature all kinds of news and other Nintendo-related goodies, and it'll also bring you new Switch 2 news every single day following the Direct presentation next week. You can download it now!</p>

<hr><p>That about does it for today's Nintendo Direct! Stay tuned for next week's presentation, when we'll have everything Nintendo announces about the Switch 2 ready for your perusal. Until then, you can check out today's full show here.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> publishers and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starbound">Starbound</a> developers Chucklefish have conjured up the first proper trailer for Witchbrook, the magic school life sim some have called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/renomine-wiz-school-rpg-spellbound-now-witchbrook">“isometric Little Witch Academia”</a>, and other, more English people <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stardew-valley-harry-potter-project">“a reworking of The Worst Witch books”</a>. Me, I’m going with “isometric Kiki’s Delivery Service”, given that there appear to be delivery missions and also, you <em>do</em> get to fly on broomsticks. 
</p>
<p>
I italicised that “do” in honour of Alice Bee (RPS in peace), who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/5-things-i-demand-from-witchbrook-chucklefishs-new-magical-stardew-like">threatened in 2020</a> to institute scoring on RPS specifically in order to give Witchbrook 0/10 if it didn’t have flying broomsticks. Nice save, Chucklefish! Here’s that trailer.

<p>
And here’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1846700/Witchbrook/">the Steam page</a>. Witchbrook seems like pretty standard, albeit beautifully presented Stardewlike fare, but it’s glamorised considerably by the fact that you can learn spells and potions, read the stars, and participate in occult rituals while pursuing your education at the titular Witchbrook College.
</p>
<p>
When not hitting the grimoires, you’ll also get to deocrate your very own witch’s cottage and pursue a range of relationships in the town of Mossport, with its many persistent NPCs. The Steam blurb suggests that you can form a coven. I’ve always wanted to form a coven. They sound like unions but you can hex people instead of going on strike.
</p>
<p>
There’s also scope for such non-witchy, extra-curricular and/or entrepreneurial activities as shopping at the boutique, selling goods at the Sunday market, founding a business and playing local photographer. The witch of today loves to diversify, it seems. 
</p>
<p>
Witchbrook will launch in holiday 2025. In her article threatening to give the game a 0/10, Alice also demanded pet options besides dogs and cats, an occult range of things to farm, the ability to get put in detention for skipping classes, and *squints* the right to fuck a ghost. I’m pretty sure 50% of that is in the trailer. 
</p>
<p>
Myself, I will only add that I feel like Witchbrook’s witches could be wickeder. I get that this is another idyll for people who seek relief from reality’s cares in the interminable reaping of pixelart turnips, but I would quite like to build a gingerbread house and start a business catching and roasting small children. I won't give the game a 0/10 if it doesn't meet my needs, but it's definitely not scoring above a 7.

The game is out today, March 27.</p></div><div><p>How about a magic school that doesn’t suck? Well, that’s the dream anyway. <em>Witchbrook</em> features some nice-looking pixel art, magical learnings, and even co-op for up to four players. The game arrives on Switch this holiday season.</p></div><div><p>Billed as a “hand-drawn platforming adventure,” <em>The Eternal Life of Goldman </em>will let you smack the crap out of fools with a cane. Fun! <br></p></div><div><p>Oh hell yeah. Schmup fans will be eating well with this sick-looking collection of the <em>Gradius</em> franchise featuring not only some classics, but also a new adventure with <em>Salamander III</em>.</p></div><div><p>Haven’t you ever wanted to start a band to take on dark forces? Well, you can live out that very dream with <em>Rift of the Necrodancer</em>, available for the Switch today, March 27.</p></div><div><p>With adorable little meeps for dialogue, <em>Tamagotchi Plaza</em> looks like a chill store-management sim where you can explore all of your retail dreams, only cuter. This one arrives on Switch on June 27.</p></div><div><p>What do you mean you still haven’t caught ‘em all? Today we got another look at <em>Pokémon Legends Z-A</em>, in which a corporation is in charge of urban development, you know, to let humans and Pokémon live in peace together. It’s totally not an open air prison for the powerless critters.</p></div><div><p>If you’re looking for a rhythm game that drills timing down to the basics, <em>Rhythm Heaven Groove</em> eschews grand storylines and epic settings for something a bit more focused on timing your button presses to the beat. Past entries have been a delight, so it’s great to see this series make its way to Switch.</p></div><div><p>Hey, there’s a new Switch on the horizon. It’s left many of us wondering what’s gonna happen with our digital games; after all, many of us have dumped a fair bit of coin into that eShop. </p><p>Fortunately, Nintendo is promising us the ability to easily transport digital games via a virtual game card management system across two different Nintendo Switch systems (the trailer seems to indicate that’s the limit). You’ll also be able to share games within your Nintendo family. The feature is coming to both the Switch and the Switch 2, and is expected to arrive in April of this year.</p></div><div><p>Stoner-FPS-fest <em>High On Life</em> is hitting the Nintendo Switch on May 6, perfect for extended periods of couch lock for you troublemakers.</p></div><div><p>Promising speedy action adventure across a strange alien world, <em>Star Overdrive</em> lands on the Switch on April 10.</p></div><div><p>This alien settlement management sim arrives on the Switch on July 17.</p></div><div><p>A sequel to the Nintendo 3DS’ <em>Fantasy Life, The Girl Who Steals</em> <em>Time </em>promises open-world exploration and item crafting when it arrives on the Switch on May 21 of this year.<br></p></div><div><p>1999 PlayStation RPG<em> Saga Frontier II </em>is getting a remaster on the Switch. The original narrative is joined by some new story material and characters. <em>Saga Frontier II</em>’s remaster arrives on Switch today.</p></div><div><p><em>Monument Valley 1 </em>and <em>2 </em>promise chill adventures across geometrically complex environments. This package, which includes all DLC, on April 15, 2025. The third game, which released on Android in December of 2024, will also make its way to the Switch this summer.</p></div><div><p><em>Everybody’s Golf</em>, aka <em>Hot Shots Golf</em>, is making the leap from Sony platforms to the Switch with the appropriately titled <em>Everybody’s Golf: Hot Shots. </em>It arrives on Switch later this year. </p></div><div><p>If you’re craving some retro beat ‘em up action with legendary superheroes like Spider-Man and Wolverine, <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> looks like a pretty swell time, with single and cooperative play. <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion </em>arrives this holiday season.</p></div><div><p>The event’s final game reveal showed off the newest <em>Tomodachi</em> release in 10 years with this strange teaser that is already resulting in memes galore on social media.</p></div><div><p>At the very end of the event, Nintendo announced that they’ll continue the Direct series of video presentations, but they’re also launching a new channel via an app called Nintendo Today. It promises to update you every day with Nintendo news, which will be especially promising for next week’s big Switch 2 reveal. </p><p>The app is available for download today.</p><hr><p><br>And that wraps everything we saw at the original Switch’s final Nintendo Direct!</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ubisoft has announced that Assassin’s Creed Shadows has passed 3 million players in its first 7 days since launch.</p>



<p>The news was shared on the official Assassin’s Creed X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1905268079958904991" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">account</a>, where it was officially confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the 2nd highest day 1 sales</a> (in revenue) in Assassin’s Creed’s franchise history.</p>



<p>It was also announced that the game is the biggest day 1 release on the PlayStation Store, with over 40 million hours of the game already being played.</p>



<p>In addition to the games commercial success, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is one of Ubisoft’s highest-rated Metacritic games in recent history, which currently sits at 82/100.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming’s Grant-Taylor Hill gave Shadow’s a “Buy” verdict, praising the game’s visuals and cinematics but said that the game had “too many niggling flaws for me to consider this a perfect title.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/why-your-next-game-needs-a-babygirl<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Okay for this to make sense, I need you to understand what a "babygirl" is. A babygirl is, as writer and narrative designer Alexa Ray Corriea explained in her 2025 Game Developers Conference talk, a character that everyone can agree is "a little bit traumatized," but secure in their masculinity, attractive, sensitive, and vulnerable, but not weak. He's probably over the age of 25, and may have "soft reasons to make hard decisions." Corriea's example was Clive from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy XVI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Still with me? Good, let's talk about a "woobie." A woobie refers to a villainous or morally grey character who fans are inspired to "care for or comfort" amid all the terrible things happening to them. Do not confuse a woobie with a "meow meow," as a meow meow refers to a more heroic character you might want to just give a big hug. If that one's confusing, think about the difference between Waluigi (woobie) and Luigi (meow meow).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Oh no, there are so many phrases left to cover. A "girl failure" is a female character who seems to have their life together but absolutely does not (Misato Katsuragi from Neon Genesis Evangelion). Then there's the handsome older male characters you'd say are a "daddy" or "zaddy," and last but absolutely not least there's the handsome-but-well-meaning "himbo." These words all describe a new genre of character tropes defined by fans and popularized on platforms like Tumblr and Ao3.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/uc-santa-cruz-professor-roleplays-gig-economy-publisher-negotiation-and-layoffs-with-game-design-students" target="_self" data-discover="true">UC Santa Cruz professor roleplays gig economy, publisher negotiation, and layoffs with game design students</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why should developers care about these magnificent words? Well let's get down to brass tacks. It's common knowledge that if you want players to give a shit about your game's story, you need strong characters. But after 40 or so years of great narrative games, a lot of the classic tropes have been well-worn out and we all get a bit exhausted when a narrative director pulls out his copy of Joseph Campbell's The Hero's Journey again.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Corriea's argument is that these fandom phrases are the secret to juicing up your game. How? Some of it's about the data—and some of it's about freeing your creativity from a box of shame.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Fans. Love. These. Tropes.">Fans. Love. These. Tropes.</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Data-hungry developers deserve a little guidance here. Ao3 (which stands for "Archive Of Our Own"), for the un-indoctrinated, is a successor to fanfiction.net, and is now the de facto home of fanfiction in the world wide web. It is also, it turns out, a useful barometer for assessing which characters are most popular in a beloved video game. Corriea showed a list of the top "shipping" categories of 2024 (shipping, another fandom phrase, refers to pairing characters up in fanfiction whether they're a canon couple or not), and pointed out that five fanfiction romances from Larian Studios' </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> ranked in the top 100 of all submitted projects in 2024. Astarion and the player character clocked in at the fourth-most popular category, while the "Dark Urge" version of the player character and the villain Enver Gortash ranked at number 85, if you want a sense of the spread.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/achieving-creative-sobriety-in-game-design" target="_self" data-discover="true">Achieving 'creative sobriety' in game design</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"These characters are like six years old," she said (referring to the 2019 Early Access launch of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">). "That lasting power really means something," she said. "Looking at how your fan base is consuming your game, or how your players are consuming other games you admire...can help with your own character ideation phase."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She also revealed that an unexpectedly popular entry on the Ao3 2024 shipping rankings was...Soap McTavish and "Ghost" from the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare series. "When I was in the writer's room on Call of Duty, we wanted to make this canon, and they wouldn't let us," she said. "So thanks a lot Activision."</span></p><p>Image via Ash Poprik.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Image via Ash Poprik.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But before you run off and start dumping all of Ao3's data into a spreadsheet to quantify the most potent pairing you could conceive (I know some of you are already trying this don't hide from me), take a quick breather. There is one side effect to this fandom-led phenomenon that has a nasty side effect: the perpetuation of "toxic fandom."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/consume-me-wins-grand-prize-nuovo-award-at-the-2025-igf-awards" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Consume Me' Wins Grand Prize, Nuovo Award at the 2025 IGF Awards</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers are quite familiar with toxic fandom, as it unfortunately drives harassment across the business. But when swimming in these waters, fans sometimes develop unhealthy attachments to characters and may lash out at other players or developers if their favorite character isn't portrayed in the way you like. "I'm not telling you to listen to toxic fandom culture that's still a huge problem across our industry...this is about having a dialogue with your fandom, and not letting yourself being run by it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She also added that with younger generations of developers emerging from the primordial ooze of fandom, there are going to be more game industry professionals who speak this language. "You're going to start having these conversations a lot, hearing this kind of talk in your writer's room, because that's a part of our culture. Those fandoms brought us into this line of work, and it's good form to keep up and know how to meet them halfway."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And pop culture has already nudged the shape of the game industry in small ways. The X (formerly Twitter) account called "Can you pet the dog?" launched hundreds of pettable animal video games in game development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those were the "practical" takeaways from Corriea's talk—the kind you might bring into a big meeting when you have to convince leadership that you've only gone a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>little bit</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> feral in your corner of the office. But if we only limit ourselves to the practical, we risk burying these tropes in the same graveyard as "the grizzled war veteran" or "the talented female sidekick who is somehow shown up by the main character."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you truly want to tap into the power of these tropes, you must learn to set yourself free.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Embrace cringe, be vulnerable">Embrace cringe, be vulnerable</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For an artist to become overly cerebral is to become crippled. This is not to say that artists lack rigor, rather that artistic rigor is grounded differently than intellectual life usually admits."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The above quote comes from Julia Cameron's 1992 book The Artist's Way, and is a quote Corriea said she regularly thinks about. When she thinks about it, she recalls advice from one mentor who told her to "write from the hip," slinging out ideas with the speed of a classic cowboy gunslinger. Another told her to "write the unhinged thing, because you never know who will identify with that." All three quotes are, in one way or another, a call for creatives to write deeply from their instincts. To do that, you need to fight your way past an emotion holding any creative person back: "cringe."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The verb "cringe" has become popularized as a noun and adjective, describing an emotion mixing shame and embarrassment tied to social awkwardness. Lusting publicly for fictional characters can sometimes be "cringe." Telling your development peers about the hours spent making a playlist for your game's protagonist might be "cringe." </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/star-wars-outlaws-shows-the-limits-of-familiar-but-with-a-twist-">Regularly waxing on at length about Star Wars on a B2B website</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> read by game industry professionals might also be "cringe."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bustle.com/wellness/embrace-cringe-tiktok">Embrace cringe</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">," reads one of end of the internet. "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vogue.com/article/please-no-more-embracing-your-cringe">Please, no more embracing your cringe</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">," says another. "Climb cringe mountain," commanded Corriea. Whichever choice you make it's easy to agree that cringe is, one way or another, about emotions or actions someone else may perceive as awkward—or even laugh at you for expressing. If you're uncomfortable with being "cringe," you might revert to safer emotional behavior, something more familiar, something you think will keep people from laughing at you or mocking you.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sometimes that's a business-driven instinct. If you fear you're taking too many risks with a new type of gameplay, you'd be forgiven for thinking you need a conventional plot with conventional characters to not alienate the player.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But that line of thinking can also be your undoing. The fear that no one will resonate with your strange ideas can be what makes your game not very interesting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The beautiful thing about art, and the thing that we so often forget when we're making art, is that people will find meaning in just about anything. When we are creating, what we are creating will resonate with different people on different levels. It's all valid," said Corriea.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And if you can't be vulnerable—or "cringe"—around your collaborators, how will you help them make games that connect with those players? "This is all still fun," Corriea reminded the audience in her closing remarks.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We make games. We need to remember that under all of this capitalism, we are still having fun."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <p>Nintendo may well be releasing its Switch successor sometime this year, but even so, we now know of one game still coming to the company's OG hybrid console in 2026.</p>
<p>And, what game is that? Well, it's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomodachi-life">Tomodachi Life</a>: Living the Dream. Yes, The Tomodachi Life series is back!</p>
<p>This upcoming game will be the first brand new series entry in over a decade, which makes me suddenly very aware of how quickly time is passing. You can check out a trailer below.</p>

<p>"Create your own Mii characters based on yourself, friends, family – anyone! – and watch them live their lives on an island out at sea," reads the official blurb.</p>
<p>"Get involved with their relationships and experience all the weird and wonderful ways these Mii characters interact. You may even drop in on their dreams" (which we saw to haunting effect at the end of the trailer).</p>
<p>Elsewhere today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-new-app-that-will-deliver-you-daily-information-and-content">Nintendo announced a new app which will deliver daily information about games and events to users</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/nintendo-announces-virtual-game-card-overhaul-for-switch-switch-2-digital-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has announced an overhaul for how digital game licenses are handled on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch">Nintendo Switch</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> with the new Virtual Game Card.</p>
<p><iframe title="Virtual Game Card – Nintendo Direct 3.27.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EWwyh74MXXY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The change will make digital game use much more like how you use and share physical game cartridges. When purchasing a digital game, it will be loaded as a Virtual Game Cartridge, giving you access to that game on that particular system.</p>
<p>Using a new dedicated management screen, you can manage those games to load and eject them individually. Ejecting from one Switch system will then let you load it onto a second Switch system – your account is seemingly limited to using this feature through two systems only, and will require local communication in order to bind them together.</p>
<p>That’s a bit of an upheaval when compared to playing your games on any Switch console simply by having an online connection to authenticate your login.</p>

<p>However, this does present new opportunities for families and friends. You will now be able to lend to members within your NIntendo Switch Online family group. This again requires a local wireless connection in order to do so, and you can only lend one game at a time to each person. Additionally, they will only be available for up to 2 weeks before they are automatically returned to you.</p>
<p>This seems like a better system for families to share one copy of a big single player game, perhaps, and certainly when compared to the tricky primary account for game sharing that has been a staple of console gaming since the late aughts. It’s not clear yet if this effectively grants that game license to the whole console (if a primary console for another person’s account), or if it’s user specific.</p>
<p>This system will be implemented in a system update for Nintendo Switch in late April, and will apply to the Nintendo Switch 2 as well.</p>
<p>We’ll hopefully have more details soon with a full FAQ to detail the changes, but there’s seemingly both upsides and downsides to this new system for individual and family uses. However, it does seem appropriate to address this, given the likelihood of a lot of people having two generations of console in the relatively near future…</p>

			<p>A complete overhaul of the Nintendo Switch digital game system will come next month with the launch of the Virtual Game Cards system.</p>
<p>Revealed during today's Nintendo Direct, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWwyh74MXXY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the new system</a>, which will launch in April and will be fully compatible with the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2, will completely change the way digital game purchases are handled across different systems. Upon purchasing a digital game via the eShop, the game will be loaded onto the console as a Virtual Game Card, which can be virtually ejected from one console and inserted into another to allow the same digital game to be used on different systems. Games on a single Virtual Game Card can also be arranged between consoles and can even be lent to be used with other Nintendo Accounts that are part of a family group by transferring games between consoles using a local connection. These games will be playable for two weeks before being returned to the original owner.</p>
<p><iframe title="Virtual Game Card – Nintendo Direct 3.27.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EWwyh74MXXY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As the new Virtual Game Cards system will be fully compatible with the Nintendo Switch 2, it will be interesting to see if it will impact how the console will handle <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-confirmed-to-be-backward-compatible/">backward-compatible digital games</a>. More information on the matter is likely to come next week during the long-anticipated Nintendo Direct focused on the system.</p>

Nintendo unveiled a new trailer for the game that serves as an introduction of sorts, showcasing the alien world you’ll be exploring along with Samus’ various abilities, including new psychic powers that work both in combat and in puzzle solving. While no specific release date was announced, the game is due out in 2025 for the Switch.</p><p><em>Beyond</em> has been in development for a quite a while.

That trailer had some clear <em>Metroid Prime</em> DNA — intense firefights and scanning things! But at the time, the company only provided a vague 2025 release date for the upcoming game.</p><p>The first Switch was actually a great platform for <em>Metroid</em> games, with the thrilling <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22710468/metroid-dread-review-nintendo-switch">2D <em>Metroid Dread</em></a> and a very-good <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/9/23592822/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-best-way-classic">remastered version of the original <em>Metroid Prime</em></a>.

Nintendo says any registered user on the console can play that digital game. </p><p>The real news is that these VGCs can be “digitally ejected” and “digitally loaded”  into another Switch console and freely played on that second device. The original Switch user that bought the game can’t play that VGC anymore as it’s been “ejected” from the console. </p><p>The company promises that you are free to load and trade digital games using VGCs freely between two specific, paired systems. Think an upstairs Switch and downstairs Switch 2.  You will need to locally connect the two consoles the first time you do some digital swapping, but after that it should be easy and hassle free. </p><p>You can also share Virtual Game Cards with members of your Nintendo Account Family Group. However, this is a bit more limited. It must be done over a local wireless connection, and you can only lend one game at a time to each member. And after two weeks, they lose access to the Virtual Game Card and it returns back to original owner. Better hope it’s not a long game!</p><p>Nintendo claims this new system will make digital games even easier to use. And this new system will also work with the Nintendo Switch 2, as confirmed by the company during the Direct. But it does seem like a very Nintendo solution to a problem Xbox and others solved already. Still, I’m happy to see Nintendo doing something to make it easier to play owned digital games on multiple devices as we get closer to the launch of Switch 2. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There’s also plenty of bugs, alien plants, and other local fauna to fight. The psychic powers look they’ll be used to help solve a number of tracing puzzles too, which seems like a good fit for the Switch’s touch and gyro controls. </p><p><em>Metroid Prime 4</em> still has no specific release date but Nintendo reaffirmed it’s coming before the end of 2025. With Switch 2 just around the corner, it’s possible it will have an upgraded version on the new console, similar to<em> The</em> <em>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </em>in 2017, which was cross-gen between Wii U and the original Switch. </p><p>Either way, <em>Metroid Prime 4 </em>seems likely to be the final hurrah for the current hardware, potentially taking it within spitting distance of its nine-year anniversary. Hopefully we still get HD remasters of <em>Metroid Prime 2</em> and<em> 3</em> on Switch before then. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-virtual-game-cards-for-digital-games-on-switch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Nintendo has officially unveiled Virtual Game Cards today: a new, easier way to share digital games between two Switch consoles. With this new feature, Nintendo aims to make games purchased digitally “as flexible and convenient” as physical game cards.</p>







<p>Virtual Game Cards were announced today <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-march-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a Nintendo Direct</a>. In the future, all games purchased on the Nintendo Switch digitally will be loaded onto the system as a Virtual Game Card. These cards can be “loaded” and “ejected” onto a second Nintendo Switch system (under the same account) using an internet connection. The two Switches only need to be linked locally once, and an internet connection is only needed during the load and eject phases. The new feature will also support Virtual Game Card swaps between a Nintendo Switch and a Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>The new Virtual Game Cards also provide enhanced features to family group managers. Virtual Game Cards can be lent out to a Nintendo account’s <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/products/detail/p/989?_gl=1*1dv082h*_gcl_au*MTc5MTU0MzU5LjE3NDMwODcwMzE.*_ga*NzE2NTIxOTAxLjE3NDMwODcwMzU.*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*MTc0MzA4NzAzNC4xLjAuMTc0MzA4NzA2MS4wLjAuMA.." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">family group</a> members, but only for up to two weeks, after which they will return to the original account’s Switch. The Nintendo account can only share one game at a time with one specific family group member, and the Switches also need to be locally linked once before swapping.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>This new feature will be added via a system update in late April. For parents with multi-Switch households, this is welcome news, as they no longer have to manage multiple libraries and purchase games across multiple Switches. All they have to manage is their own library, and they can lend their Virtual Game Cards to members of their family group. </p>



<p>Will you be lending out Virtual Game Cards to Nintendo Switch users when this feature launches in late April? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>Pokémon games are no stranger to innovating gameplay mechanics. The March 2025 Nintendo Direct revealed this to be the case as a new Pokémon Legends Z-A gameplay video showed off new features, including day and night gameplay, and Z-A Royale.</p>



<p>Don’t panic, even though I’ve mentioned the word “Royale,” there’s no emphasis on battle royale here. Z-A Royale ties into the new day and night cycle introduced in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-platforms-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>. Previous games have tinkered with the idea of dynamic daily cycles, but few have changed the gameplay in such a way.</p>



<p>The newest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-march-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Direct</a> showed us what we’re in for, and Legends Z-A looks mouth-watering.</p>



<h2 id="h-day-and-night-gameplay-changes-pokemon-legends-z-a">Day and Night Gameplay Changes Pokémon Legends Z-A</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Better earn those wins. Credit to The Pokémon Company </figcaption></figure>



<p>The March 27 gameplay trailer showed us a lot of what we’ve seen from <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-video-games/pokemon-legends-z-a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> already: The real-time action of Pokémon-catching and Trainer-battling antics. We also know that Pokémon are hiding all over Lumiose City—even on the rooftops.</p>



<p>But now we’ve seen what’s lurking in the city at night. Once the sun goes down, Z-A Royale begins. Trainers come out at night to fight in new Battle Zones.</p>



<p>Trainers are classified with ranks, signifying their status in the new Z-A Royale league system. You need to work your way from Z to A, and you can do so with the newly confirmed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-will-bring-27-new-mega-evolutions-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mega Evolutions</a> we reported a few days ago.</p>



<p>We know <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-reportedly-not-adding-any-new-pokemon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends Z-A reportedly isn’t adding new Pokémon</a>, which is a shame. But the new features make up for this, and it’s still set to launch in 2025.</p>
