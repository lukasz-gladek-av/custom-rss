<p>The Switch 2 once again tops the hardware charts this week, but it's the PS5 that's really surprising us. The base model jumps up to number 2 this week, selling 22,247 units. Altogether, the three PS5 SKUs managed a total of 31,695 units sold, while the original Switch consoles totalled 24,175, so it's a comfortable victory for Sony this week. Sort of... The Switch 2 is still killing it.</p>

			<p>Funcom has <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/chapter-2-free-update-and-lost-harvest-dlc-out-now/">launched</a> the first <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-free-story-update-the-lost-harvest-dlc-free-trial/">major paid and free DLCs</a> for Dune: Awakening, with Chapter 2 of the game's core narrative as the free DLC available for everyone, and a standalone storyline called The Lost Harvest being the paid DLC. Both are live in the game at the time of this writing, making this week an exciting time for players who've been on Arrakis since launch earlier this year. But if you've not begun your journey on Arrakis, you can try it out this weekend with Dune: Awakening's first free weekend that's live from today, September 11, to this Monday, September 15.</p>



<p>The free update that's currently live continues the main campaign of the game, continuing the story beyond the conclusion of Act 3 and revealing more of the dark mystery that brought you to Arrakis. Other elements of the free update include being able to re-customize your character, add new customizations with new hairstyles and tattoos, new contracts, armors, more dynamic encounters, improvements to combat and exploration, and the removal of the quicksand border that blocked players from entering the Deep Desert on foot or ground vehicles.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The Lost Harvest DLC adds a few more tidbits for players who purchase the DLC separately or those who bought the Season Pass or the Deluxe Edition of Dune: Awakening. Players with access to The Lost Harvest DLC get access to new ground vehicles, new building pieces, armor sets, cosmetic customizations for your base and gear, weapon skins, and a new emote.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Funcom has also released the <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/dune-awakening-chapter-2-patch-notes/">patch notes</a> for the Chapter 2 update, which include all the above changes, and a slew of bug fixes and balance tweaks.</p>



<p>Right now, Dune: Awakening remains a PC-exclusive title, but if you're a console player who can't wait to jump into your own journey on Arrakis, then, according to <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-launch-console-cross-play-sony-microsoft/">what Funcom told Wccftech at Gamescom 2025</a>, you can look forward to the game's launch on consoles at its one-year anniversary.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft workers have raised concerns with company management about <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/letonnant-deal-dubisoft-avec-larabie-saoudite-2144626">a deal</a> with Saudi Arabia to create a free DLC for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> set in the country, according to a new report.</p>
<p>Announced with little fanfare - at least, as far as add-ons for pretty prominent games are concerned - on a Saturday morning last month, the free DLC is set to add a new story chapter set in 9th century AlUla later this year. AlUla is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ula">ancient oasis city and governorate in Saudi Arabia</a>, though Ubisoft's <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1959169826619875735">announcement post</a> didn't mention the country by name.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As detailed in this report from <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-assassins-creed-mirage-saudi-arabia">Game File</a>, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot announced the DLC alongside the online reveal during a speech in Riyadh at a conference put on in conjunction with the Esports World Cup, which the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/gaming-esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia-call-of-duty-ronaldo-b2786237.html">Saudi government are funding</a>.</p>
<p>According to an internal Ubisoft Q&amp;A, which Game File's Stephen Totilo has published as part of his report, workers at the publisher have demanded answers from management about this partnership with Saudi Arabia. The question from a staffer about the issue specifically cited the killing of journalist <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45812399">Jamal Khashoggi</a>, asking whether Ubisoft execs believed an association with the authoritarian Saudi state could have a negative effect on the company's image.</p><p>While they've publicly told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-staff-reportedly-raised-concerns-about-saudi-arabia-deal-for-assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-as-company-insists-it-maintains-creative-control">IGN</a> that they have creative control over what goes into this DLC, Ubisoft reportedly wouldn't tell staff anything about how it came to be, simply stating that they don't comment on "rumours". They did however, make a distinction between the Saudi government's Public Investment Fund and Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman, the latter being <a href="https://www.pif.gov.sa/en/who-we-are/">the Public Investment Fund's chairman</a> and the person who allegedly ordered Khashoggi's assassination. "The [PIF]'s money is not MBS's, and talking with partners who do not share our democratic values does not mean abandoning them," Ubisoft management told workers.</p>
<p>The company also defended Guillemot having travelled to Saudi Arabia in late 2024 alongside French president Emmanuel Macron to meet with Saudi politicians. That was just a "classic diplomatic tool for expanding France's influence and reach around the world", according to Ubisoft.</p>
<p>The reported partnership with Ubisoft over Mirage DLC - released at no charge, as is often the case for sizeable add-ons boasting not just new missions, but a totally fresh location to explore - is far from the only gaming-related investment the Saudi government and their associates have made in recent years. Just last week, PIF-backed "giga project" Qiddiya <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saudi-government-backed-firm-and-giga-project-now-co-owns-fighting-game-tournament-evo">bought co-ownership of fighting game tournament Evo</a>.</p>

              <p>Earbuds and headphones are one of the most crowded markets there is. It can be hard to parse through what’s good, especially diving deeper then just the big names like Apple and Samsung. If you’re looking for something with a secure-fit that’s good for working out, with rich sound, and not too expensive, then direct your attention to the AeroFit 2. These are produced by Soundcore, a subsidiary brand of Anker, and are usually priced at $130.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4052/"> However, right now you can get them on sale for $30 off. The 23% discount brings them down to an even $100 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>The AeroFit 2 use an open-ear design that are made for all-day comfort. They’re comprised of soft materials that are non-invasive and curve around your ear. The hook shape allows them to be tailored to the vast majority of ear shapes and sizes out there. The actually speaker part is on a swivel so it can be positioned where it’s gripping perfectly on your ear, securely in place. So if you’re taking these out for a run, you can stay confident they are not going anywhere.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4052/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>These Soundcore earbuds produce a deep bass with clear mids and vivid treble, Adjusting the ear hooks not only can be used to make them more secure, but also to boost the bass output up to double their level.</p>
<p>Battery life is pretty good. You’ll get up to 10 hours of listening time on the buds alone. When including the charging case, you’ll get up to 42 hours. The case also supports wireless charging so you can bring them back up to 100% without dealing with any messy cables.</p>



<h2>Real-Time Translation</h2>
<p>There’s a lot of buzz this week about the new AirPods supporting real-time translation, but these puppies have already been doing it. The Soundcore AeroFit 2 support 100 languages and can translate what you’re hearing on the fly with high accuracy. Reliably travel abroad without even knowing the local language you may need to make sure you update the firmware to its latest version when you take it out of the box. The AI translation is absolutely free, requiring no additional subscription.</p>
<p>Choose between four stylish colors. Soundcore has a selection of either blue, black, green, or white so go with whatever best matches your own personal style. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4052/">All four options are on sale right now for the 23% discount for a limited time. That brings the price down from $130 to just $100.</a></p>

              <p>Another day in the 21st century, another fresh round of frustration and accusations that a company is using artificial intelligence to replace the labor of human beings. This time around, Françoise Cadol, Lara Croft’s French voice actress as heard in the localized version of <i>Tomb Raider IV – VI</i>, has issued a legal notice to Aspyr Media, which is <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-includes-direct-jab-joke-gearbox-former-owner-embracer-bluff-2000624815">owned by the Embracer Group</a>, over accusations that AI was used to touch up her performances.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-includes-direct-jab-joke-gearbox-former-owner-embracer-bluff-2000624815"><i>Borderlands 4</i> Seems To Include A Direct Jab At Gearbox’s Former Owner Embracer</a></p> <p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/french-tomb-raider-actress-takes-legal-action-against-aspyr-for-allegedly-replicating-her-voice-with-ai"><i>Game Developer</i></a>, Cadol, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bsmart_tv/reel/DGQROP5hAwD/">an outspoken critic of AI</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DIyPRKusIg_/">member of the French anti-AI “Touch pas à ma VF” movement</a>, asserts that the alleged AI use came across her radar in August, following a patch pushed by developer Aspyr to the <i>Tomb Raider</i> collection. These patch notes mention restored voice-overs, tweaks to volume, and other audio adjustments that, ordinarily, wouldn’t raise much concern, especially as the Brazilian Portuguese localization is the only version that the notes specifically mention. However, attentive fans spotted some unusual affectations in Cadol’s recorded performance, bringing the concern to her attention. A video from French YouTuber Kingdom of Stott <a href="https://youtu.be/y8YsbC-d0ro?t=577">documents the changes here</a>:</p>

  <p>Starting right around 9:56, you can hear the original performance from Cadol, followed by the alleged AI version (the video is in French, so auto-translate captions help here for some of us). Despite failing French a number of times, I can recognize a clear difference in these two performances, as can many fans in the comments of this very video. Is it proof of AI use? Cadol seems to think so, describing the difference as “metallic” (via Google Translate) to <a href="https://www.leparisien.fr/culture-loisirs/cinema/cest-une-trahison-quand-lia-vole-la-voix-francaise-dangelina-jolie-pour-tomb-raider-10-09-2025-63HIGMNMEZBSFLELCKNN4S5I2M.php">French publication <i>Le Parisien</i></a>. And <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2525380/Tomb_Raider_IVVI_Remastered/">some recent negative reviews on the game’s Steam page</a> are also accusing the developer of pushing AI into the game. Having worked with audio for many years myself, I can think of at least half-a-dozen other things that aren’t AI that could make the audio kinda sorta sound like this, but there’s still an undeniable rigidity that screams AI and, well, look at the times we live in.</p> <p><i>Kotaku</i> has reached out to Aspyr Media for comment.</p> <p>The same video also mentions that fans have speculated AI was used in newly added loading screens a bit earlier. I’m more skeptical of that claim, but AI is getting better at hiding its trademark oddities. (Remember when it couldn’t render fingers well?)</p>

                <p>After seven years between games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/borderlands-4-review-too-much-of-an-overcorrection/1900-6418405/" data-ref-id="1900-6418405">Borderlands 4</a> is just around the corner. In the run up to the game's release, Gearbox President Randy Pitchford has said some off-the-wall things. But his latest remarks about potentially reselling a Borderlands-inspired Fortnite skin sounds like a surefire way to get banned by Epic Games.</p><p>On <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1964487591253966880" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a>, Pitchford recalled that the Psycho Bandit skin became an in-demand item on Fortnite, and suggested that flipping the Mad Moxxi skin on eBay may also prove to be lucrative.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1964487591253966880" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Is it true that the pre-order incentive Psycho Bandit skin in became one of the most valuable skins in Fortnite sometimes fetching over $2k when trading on eBay? What are the odds this bundle becomes worth much more than the price of the game it is promoting? <a href="https://t.co/wQnLrXngfr" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/wQnLrXngfr</a></p>  — Randy Pitchford (@DuvalMagic) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1964487591253966880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 7, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>It's true that the Psycho Bandit Fortnite skin was very popular in 2019, in part because it was only briefly available as a promotion for Borderlands 3. After appearing in the Epic Games Store for a limited time, Psycho Bandit wasn't officially available for purchase in Fortnite until it returned in April 2025.</p><p>Mad Moxxi's Fortnite skin will be available to players who preorder Borderlands 4 on Epic Games Store, and as a standalone purchase for a limited time starting on September 29. However, that skin is unlikely to be as virtually scarce as Psycho Bandit. And since reselling skins on eBay or other third-party outlets is against Epic's terms of service, it's just not a viable strategy.</p><p>Earlier this year, Pitchford said that fans would "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/real-fans-will-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen-if-borderlands-4-costs-80-says-randy-pitchford/1100-6531677/" data-ref-id="1100-6531677">find a way to make it happen</a>" if Borderlands 4 was $80. Those remarks weren't well-received, although Pitchford also stated that the development budget for Borderlands 4 was "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-price-is-a-mystery-even-to-randy-pitchford/1100-6531437/" data-ref-id="1100-6531437">more than twice</a>" what Gearbox had to work with for Borderlands 3.</p><p>Borderlands 4 will officially launch on September 12 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. Switch 2 owners will have to wait until October 3 for the game to arrive.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>No matter how much you might want a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sly-cooper-and-the-thievius-raccoonus/">Sly Cooper</a> game, it doesn't really sound like anyone at the original studio that made it, Sucker Punch Productions, is all that interested. Currently, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/infamous/" data-ref-id="5000-32202">Infamous</a> developer is preparing for the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-yotei/" data-ref-id="5000-645132">Ghost of Yotei</a>, which is due out at the start of next month on October 2. That game's co-creative director Nate Fox recently made an appearance on Minnmax where he was asked 125 rapid-fire questions. On the topic of Sly Cooper, Fox's response makes it pretty clear that right now, there are very few people at Sucker Punch who would want to make it.</p><p dir="ltr">When asked about what percentage of the studio Fox estimated would be excited if he said the next game after Ghost of Yotei would be a new Sly Cooper, he had this to say: "10%." After such a low figure was offered, interviewer Ben Hanson expressed his surprise, to which Fox responded, "It's been a long time, Ben, since Sly Cooper's come out."<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sucker-punch-has-no-plans-to-revisit-sly-cooper-or-infamous-series/1100-6505057/?TheTime=2022-07-01T20%3A37%3A08&amp;PostType=image&amp;UniqueID=9365DB52-F97D-11EC-9B09-5A5C16F31EAE&amp;ServiceType=twitter&amp;ftag=ftag%3DGSS-05-10aab8e/" data-ref-id="1100-6505057">Back in 2022</a>, a blog post from Sucker Punch even outright said there aren't any Sly Cooper games in the works.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffOTS1CkZVg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="460">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ffOTS1CkZVg?start=460" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Fox himself served as a designer on the original game--which came out way back in 2002--reprising this role for the following two games as well. But following the third game's release in 2005, there's only been 2013's Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time, which was made by Sanzaru Games, not Sucker Punch. So it's been two full decades since Sucker Punch made a Sly Cooper game, having released three full games in the Infamous series, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima/" data-ref-id="5000-474583">Ghost of Tsushima</a> and Yotei in the meantime.</p><p dir="ltr">In recent years Sly Cooper has mostly been relegated to cameo fodder, having been referenced in both Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart and Astro Bot. For now, perhaps all you can hope for is a modern-day port of the original trilogy at the very least.</p>

                <p>A new update for Black Myth: Wukong is out now and it addresses a key complaint about the recently launched Xbox version. The new update that arrived on September 10 improves the graphics on Xbox Series X, after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-has-big-downgrade-in-performance-mode-on-xbox/1100-6534395/" data-ref-id="1100-6534395">people and graphics experts said the Series X version didn't deliver the best visuals.</a></p><p>This new patch fixes an issue "where graphics appeared blurry on Xbox Series X," developer Game Science said. The studio said global illumination ghosting for the game's Quality and Balance modes was to blame.</p><p>A report from Digital Foundry said the Series S version of Black Myth: Wukong had even bigger struggles, but this newest patch for the game does not mention the Series S. It was previously rumored that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-developer-says-xbox-port-delay-is-due-to-the-series-s/1100-6528607/" data-ref-id="1100-6528607">technical issues with the Xbox Series S</a> were behind the delay of the game's port, which publisher Game Science denied. The Game Science team has acknowledged that <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=194" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">bringing the game to the Xbox consoles was unexpectedly difficult</a>.</p><p>Beyond that fix, the September 10 update for Black Myth: Wukong fixes various crashes and errors, along with bugs that could make some quests impossible to pass. The update also fixes an issue where some bosses in Mount Huaguo would "sink abnormally" in some specific conditions. You can see the complete patch notes below, as <a href="https://gamesci.cn/wukong/news/detail?id=220" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared by Game Science on its website.</a></p><p>Black Myth: Wukong came to Xbox on August 20, 2025, which was exactly one year after the game debuted on PS5 and PC. This timing fueled ongoing rumors that Game Science and Sony had some kind of timed-exclusive deal.</p><p>Following the huge success of Black Myth: Wukong, Game Science is now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-black-myth-game-zhong-kui-announced-with-teaser-trailer/1100-6534105/" data-ref-id="1100-6534105">making a sequel, Zhong Kui</a>, but it's still very early days for the game.</p><h2>Black Myth: Wukong September 10 patch notes:</h2><ul><li>Fixed an issue where the graphics appeared blurry on Xbox Series X due to global illumination ghosting in Quality and Balance modes.</li><li>Fixed crashes and errors occurring under certain conditions.</li><li>Fixed an issue where certain side quests became unprogressable or triggered errors when a dialogue was exited abnormally.</li><li>Fixed an issue where certain bosses in Mount Huaguo would sink abnormally when the player moved away.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the game responded slowly to controller input in the Text Language dropdown menu within Settings.</li></ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Silksong article" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/71e649992dfee/silksong-article.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, it's not in any way whatsoever radical to have your players follow along a tightly-scripted path in a video game. It's nothing new, it's nothing that hasn't been a constant (in platformers especially) since...well...forever. So why is it, some five or six hours into my time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, that it's the locked-down and <em>relatively</em> linear nature of proceedings that's got me most excited thus far? Why's it that bit that's got me all worked up to keep playing?</p>
<p>Perhaps it's over-exposure to big noisy AAA monstrosities that's done me in. Reviewing new games these days invariably leads to a whole lot of wandering around huge open worlds, you see. And whether they be set in the past or future, from medieval all the way through to post-apocalyptic wasteland 3000, there's usually a recognisable flow, a loop to even the biggest of worlds encountered, that gives you a lot of room to breathe, and purposefully lets you take your foot off the gas.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067qpnwjv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>That loop typically sees you learn the gameplay ropes gently through tutorials in the field - usually somewhere safe in the field, mind, like a training area or castle ramparts full of stuffed-sack bad guys. And then we have our story beats and our collectibles, our side missions and our methods of travel all added in, and all of these aspects are layered on in such a way that there's (usually) space to think and get used to things, nice and comfy, as well as some time-outs to settle into your surroundings. Oh look, what a lovely vista.</p>
<figure><a title="Silksong article" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/749d0b3041011/silksong-article.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, maybe Silksong's grabbed me thanks to too much lollygagging in open worlds of late, alongside a <em>ton</em> of recent roguelike offerings that allow you to navigate in various ways across their maps, honing and swapping so many skills and loadouts, adding/subtracting buffs until it's got your stamp on it. Until it feels like your comfy clothing. Maybe these things have made me a little afraid of a proper beatdown from a proper platformer that's properly bossing me where to go most of the time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a game where every screen is worth your attention - and <em>demands</em> your attention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because Silksong doesn't do any of this nice and friendly stuff. It kicks my ass and it sends me back to bosses beyond lines of baddies. It's still got me scrapping with a tiny needle a few bosses in. I'm stuck on a boss and I can't get out! My jumping skills are also underwhelming starting out, so there are sharp deaths and other ignominious endings to my existence around every bloody corner.</p>
<p>And I am thrilled. Absolutely thrilled. And a bit terrified.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not saying this is some super hard game either, because <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-is-hollow-knight-silksong-too-difficult">that's a discourse that's happening right now</a> - I'm not really finding that it's doing anything unusual for the genre in this regard. It's challenging, but it should be, and it is in all the right ways, but the tension brought about in me by having lost so much of the usual control...it's got me right sweaty, hen.</p>
<figure><a title="Silksong article" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5c41bc5361953/silksong-article.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In this case, with the hugely talented maestros at Team Cherry on the case, the tightness — the claustrophobia of it all, in places — is so beautifully stage-managed that you can't help but be drawn into the thing. And they do an amazing job of making you <em>want</em> to push through battles, because there's always, 100% definitely, something worth seeing or hearing or fighting to the bloody death around the next corner. It's a game where every screen is worth your attention - and <em>demands</em> your attention.</p>
<p>On a broader note, it's also got me feeling a little guilty that perhaps I've been ignoring this part of games in general. I've allowed myself to become a lollygagger. I've become one of those sorts of gamers who sees a challenge in the distance (perhaps an enemy riding around Limgrave on a horse, as an example - I hate him with a passion) and immediately brings up their map to plot the quickest way to return to vibing with picking berries, riding over NPCs on my horse, and other Sunday-driver-styled activities.</p>
<p>Silksong isn't letting me do any of this. It's making me face my fears, like so many great platformers. What would <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Mario</a> be without all the awful falling to your death, so vicious and cruel and repetitive and tough at times? Or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/celeste">Celeste</a>! What good would Silksong be if it weren't constantly killing you with all the sharp things?</p>
<figure><a title="Silksong article" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6529994aa5eda/silksong-article.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Team Cherry's majestic use of level design and atmosphere, its properly challenging boss fights, and the ever-present fear of something awful lurking just around the bend, make for a game that, even just six hours or so in, has got me thinking on all the time I've spent letting my edge dull. I mean, I never actually had a gaming edge, or any edge, really, but you tell yourself these things.</p>
<p>It's also got me thinking I need to download <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dead_cells">Dead Cells</a> again, y'know. I need to get back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/cave_story">Cave Story</a>, and a bunch of other quite challenging platformers that I shrugged and put down because it was easier to stick <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/assassins_creed_the_ezio_collection">Assassin's Creed</a> on and spend two hours avoiding everyone while I tried on new outfits. What a fool I've been.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Shiro Games has announced a new DLC pack for&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>in the form of&nbsp;<em>Contract: The Fief</em>, and, as the name suggests, it'll put you in control of your very own domain when it launches later this month.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the DLC, which was first teased as part of&nbsp;<em>Wartales</em>' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wartales-roadmap-late-2025" rel="nofollow">most recent roadmap</a>, will launch on September 25th, and it'll offer you a domain in which you can "enact laws, oversee industry and tradecraft, and manage state affairs".</p>

<p>As your fiefdom develops, you can construct new buildings, watch as factions emerge and battle one another for dominance, and more. It's up to you whether your domain will become known for diplomacy and scholarship or for brutal militarism (or anything in between!).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wartales-contract-the-fief-dlc-overhead-view.jpg?itok=Cax840UE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wartales-contract-the-fief-dlc-overhead-view.jpg?itok=pM91oZrp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Are you ready to manage your very own domain in&nbsp;<em>Wartales</em>' new&nbsp;<em>Contract: The Fief&nbsp;</em>DLC?</figcaption></figure><p>Shiro says that you'll be able to make decisions in&nbsp;<em>Contract: The Fief&nbsp;</em>that will affect your citizens' lives on a granular level, granting them prosperity or condemning them to "short, brutish lives of violence and starvation".</p>

<p>What's more, the new DLC will integrate seamlessly with&nbsp;<em>Wartales</em>' existing campaigns, so you'll be able to manage your fief and issue commands as you play through one of the other stories on offer.</p>

<p>Game director Quentin Lapeyre says&nbsp;<em>Contract: The Fief&nbsp;</em>will add "a whole new way to interact with the world of&nbsp;<em>Wartales</em>", and that it'll allow you to "expand [your] horizons and rule over [your] own fief" without distracting you from your usual mercenary activities.</p>

<p>You can check out a (very brief) trailer introducing&nbsp;<em>Contract: The Fief&nbsp;</em>and its various gameplay additions right here.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Wartales</em>, it's a gritty medieval mercenary RPG that blends open-world exploration with tactical turn-based combat, pitting you against everything from "petty thieves" to "the land's most notorious figures".</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>right now on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1527950/Wartales/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> or <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/wartales" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>.&nbsp;<em>Contract: The Fief&nbsp;</em>launches for both platforms on September 25th.</p>

It's the same Sapporo beer, but in specially designed packaging to promote the game. And to that end, the packages come with a QR code that players can activate to unlock an in-game reward when Ghost of Yotei launches on October 2 for PS5.</p><p>The in-game reward is "The Charm of Hokkyokusei," which features Sapporo's famous star logo. Hokkyokusei is the Japanese term for the North Star, and this connects back to Sapporo lore, as <a href="https://www.sapporobeer.com/our-history" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the company's original brewmaster</a> was said to have followed the North Star to Germany where he learned how to make beer. In the game, using the charm gives players a "minor chance" to "not consume ranged weapon ammo when equipped," according to the <a href="https://mybeerbuzz.com/sapporo-and-ghost-of-yotei-limited-time-package-now-available/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announcement.</a></p><p>"Sapporo's original brewmaster and the hero in Ghost of Yotei both experience defiance, discovery, and artistry to re-write their fates. These are inspirational stories that connect us to Japan and its remarkable history. We aim to share those stories and bring fans closer to Japan through this partnership," Sapporo boss Zach Keeling said.</p><p>Sucker Punch boss Brian Fleming said when the team visited Japan for scouting trips, the developers knocked back "a few refreshing pints of Sapporo."</p><p>Sucker Punch's Andrew Goldfarb <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/garfep.bsky.social/post/3lyiwd66cck2u" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said in a social media post</a>, "We made one joke about a 'Yotei Six Pack' and a year later we have the perfect partnership. So happy this all came together," he said.</p><p>In other news, the Ghost of Yotei developers recently talked about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delay-was-a-great-day-for-ghost-of-yotei-developers/1100-6534574/" data-ref-id="1100-6534574">how happy they were when GTA 6 was delayed to 2026</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delay-was-a-great-day-for-ghost-of-yotei-developers/1100-6534574/" data-ref-id="1100-6534574">teased that the game may have more than one playable character.</a> It has also been confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delay-was-a-great-day-for-ghost-of-yotei-developers/1100-6534574/" data-ref-id="1100-6534574">Ghost of Yotei will reveal Atsu's butt.</a></p>

                <p>Canadian musician bbno$ is everywhere right now. Pronounced 'baby no money,' and definitely not 'bibinos,' he's collaborated with everyone from the VTuber Ironmouse through to producer Y2K. Several of his tracks have gone viral on social media platforms such as TikTok, including the likes of "Edamame" which was used in the trailer for The Garfield Movie, and "U Mad?" which appeared in CS:GO promotional materials.

It's either a reference to bbno$ or an incredible coincidence, but with the musician's career going from strength to strength and his new album on the horizon, we prefer to believe it's the former.</p><p>Borderlands 4 will be released tomorrow, September 12.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon is not messing around with this new laptop deal, which is only fitting because it’s on a laptop that also does not mess around. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3724/">You can get a fully loaded 17-inch HP Business Laptop with a 12-core Intel Ultra 7 255U processor, supercharged AI power, and 2TB of storage for a 72%-off price of $1,119 — that’s a savings of over $2,800</a>.</p>
<p>Along with this enormously powerful HP touchscreen laptop comes a $200 accessories package including a wireless mouse, USB hub, 128GB flash drive, and 7-in-1 cleaning kit. For additional value, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/windows-11-pro">Windows 11 Pro</a> is preinstalled, and the 12 TOPS (Trillions of Operations Per Second) of AI computational power combined with Microsoft Copilot creates a peak AI device.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3724/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Terrific Touchscreen</h2>
<p>The generously proportioned 17.3-inch touchscreen of this business laptop is not only a perfect interactive device giving the user a rapid-reaction tablet-like experience, but it’s a vivid HD+ (1600 x 900 resolution) display with anti-glare treatment and 250 nits of brightness. The keyboard is also backlit for better accessibility, and the Copilot key is present for one-touch deployment of the powerful AI features.</p>
<p>Whatever you have on that high-performing screen — anything from multiple windows of complex spreadsheets to whatever TV show or movie you’re streaming — will come through without any hesitation or glitching. That’s because the 12-core Intel Ultra 7 255U processor is an absolute beast, able to hit speeds of up to 5.2GHz and bolstered by a maxed-out <strong>64GB of RAM</strong>. The huge<strong> 2TB SSD</strong> reads and writes data with impressive speed, and the huge amount of storage and memory combined with the elite processor makes this HP laptop virtually future-proofed.</p>



<h2>All the Connections</h2>
<p>The Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.4 hookups are just the tip of the connectivity spear. This HP laptop has a 720p HD webcam with a privacy shutter built in, and there are two USB-A, one USB-C, and an HDMI 1.4b port at the ready should you want to connect parallel accessories, including the 128GB USB flash drive and 7-in-1 USB hub that come free with this laptop. The pre-tuned stereo speakers complete this truly impressive package.</p>
<p>While the $4,000 retail price for this 17.3-inch HP Business Laptop with Windows 11 Pro and accessories bundle is a little bloated, to say the least, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3724/">the huge 72% Amazon price cut lands it at an exceptionally competitive $1,119</a>. With the powerful Intel processor, huge cache of memory and storage, and hypercharged AI engine, this will be your everyday productivity laptop for years to come.</p>

However, Sanzaru Games brought the series back in 2013 with the PS3 game </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sly-cooper-thieves-in-time-the-kotaku-review-5981954"><i><span>Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time</span></i></a><span>, and it ended on a devastating cliffhanger, stranding the titular thief in Ancient Egypt thanks to some time travel shenanigans. Sanzaru intended to resolve this with a DLC mission, but Sony </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tbwTiCn16k&amp;t=3215s"><span>pulled the plug</span></a><span> on that, and the studio was acquired by Meta in 2020. So now, one of PlayStation’s mascots has been in time travel limbo for over a decade, with no sign of a fifth game or DLC in sight. Could Sucker Punch go back and make a new game, saving its beloved thief from a fate worse than death? Nope. Apparently, the studio is just not interested in going back.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffOTS1CkZVg"><i><span>Minnmax</span></i></a> <span>had </span><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i><span> co-creative director Nate Fox on its show for 125 rapid-fire questions. Naturally, they talked a lot about the upcoming samurai game, joked about the relief of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-ghost-yotei-cyberpunk-2-keanu-leak-2000624435"><i><span>Grand Theft Auto 6</span></i><span> getting delayed</span></a><span>, and discussed a hypothetical VR game concept set in the </span><i><span>Ghost of Tsushima</span></i><span> world. At roughly the 7:40 mark, </span><i><span>Minnmax</span></i><span> asks Fox what percentage of the studio would be enthused about working on a fifth </span><i><span>Sly Cooper</span></i><span> game. Fox says “10 percent” of the Bellevue studio would be excited. Interviewer Ben Hanson expresses shock at the low number, and Fox says, “It’s been a long time, Ben, since </span><i><span>Sly Cooper</span></i><span>‘s come out.”</span></p>  <p><span>Yeah Nate, it has been a long time. The series just celebrated its 20th anniversary with a series of exclusive merchandise (all of which I bought), and Sly has spent more than half of those years now stranded out of time because Sony left him there. Look, I’m not picky. I just want Sony to get </span><i><span>any Sly Cooper </span></i><span>project off the ground that could potentially save my raccoon son from this terrible fate, I don’t need it to be </span><i><span>Sly Cooper 5</span></i><span>. In the years since </span><i><span>Thieves in Time</span></i><span>, Sony has greenlit and then </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/first-look-at-the-sly-cooper-movie-1510540922"><span>canceled an animated film</span></a><span>, and the </span><a href="https://slycooper.fandom.com/wiki/Sly_Cooper_(TV_series)"><span>animated series</span></a><span> that was in development at Technicolor Animation Productions has vanished without a trace. Hell, Sony could make a short comic series about the rescue mission to get him back to the present day, and I’d shut the fuck up. You will never hear me ask for a fifth </span><i><span>Sly Cooper </span></i><span>game again.</span></p> <p><span>While Sly may not be getting his own game anytime soon, the character continues to make appearances in PlayStation crossover games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-playstation-ps5-references-characters-1851640150"><i><span>Astro Bot</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-the-kotaku-review-1847047303"><i><span>Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart</span></i></a><span>. Should I just consider him showing up in </span><i><span>Rift Apart </span></i><span>as a sign that Ratchet saved him from time travel purgatory?</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clive-barkers-hellraiser-revival">Hellraiser: Revival</a> intend to push its M Rating as far as it can with the upcoming video game adaptation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival is a story-driven, single-player survival horror action game set in the Hellraiser universe. It's developed by Boss Team Games, creator of the recently delisted Evil Dead: The Game, and is due out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC via Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hellraiser, for the uninitiated, is a cult classic horror franchise made up of 11 films and various comic books, all based on The Hellbound Heart novella by English author Clive Barker. The star of the show is Pinhead, a ‘Cenobite’ who harvests human souls to torture in sadistic experiments. And you can see that in action in the trailer, which — content warning! — contains as much sex as it does body horror.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hellraiser: Revival is not for the faint of heart. If you’re wondering just how extreme the game gets, be sure to check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hellraiser-revival-is-resident-evil-for-sickos">hands-on Hellraiser: Revival preview</a> for all the gory details. But in short, expect body horror, sex, no holds barred nudity, nightmarish scenes, and a healthy dose of hell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s 'Resident Evil For Sickos,' we said coming out of our time with Hellraiser, but just how extreme can the developers at Saber Interactive take it? In an interview with IGN, Saber development chief Tim Willits said the studio plans to push Hellraiser as far as the people who make the rules around an M Rating will let them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are going to go as far as we possibly can, as far as the people that make rules will let us go,” Willits insisted. “And I hope that we can make one version, but we are willing to go as far as we possibly can go.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hellraiser: Revival - gamescom 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, what we’ve seen of Hellraiser: Revival so far is in keeping with Clive Barker’s cult classic Hellraiser movies, so tonally, there’s no real difference. But there’s something unique about seeing and doing all this horrific stuff from a first-person perspective that’s a bit more in your face than watching a film in a theater or at home.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We want to be a responsible publisher / developer, but we are going to push it as far as we possibly can in the context of the game and the movie.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clive Barker is working with Saber on Hellraiser: Revival to ensure it fits with his vision for the universe. This back and forth should result in a game fans of the movies will get a real kick out of, Willits added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“He's come back and said, ‘Yeah, Pinhead wouldn't do that,’” Willits explained. “And he's come back and said, ‘Yeah, you got to tweak this a little bit.’ Because this is his world and he knows stuff that we don't even think about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And he's been really fast too. Sometimes when you work with famous people you throw something over and then six months later they come back and they complain about something. No, he’s that on it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Doug Bradley, the original actor behind the Cenobite leader Pinhead, has reprised his role for the game, adding to the authenticity of the project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Discover the tale of Aidan, who must unlock the dark powers of the Genesis Configuration, a mysterious puzzle box, to help his girlfriend from a hellish abyss. As Aidan, you’ll harness the box’s infernal abilities to survive your pact with the sinister Pinhead and battle against the twisted cult that worships him and the Cenobites. Fail, and your suffering will be legendary, even in Hell.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Hellraiser was thrust back into the public consciousness in 2022 with a franchise reboot film. IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hellraiser-review-2022-hulu">Hellraiser review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: “Hellraiser is a reinvigorated reboot that gets the blood pumping, starting with Jamie Clayton’s worthy Pinhead performance that sets a fresh tone with immense reverence paid to Clive Barker's works.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been a big week for Drukhari fans after Games Workshop finally remembered the Dark Eldar exist and announced two new models for the faction as well as a new codex and Combat Patrol. But one of the models in particular has caught the attention of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur’s Gate 3</a> fans, many of whom think she looks very much like God's Favourite Princess.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Drukhari have been biding their time in the depths of Commorragh, but it’s finally time to launch the raid and drink deep of the galaxy’s misery — Codex: Drukhari is on its way!” Games Workshop said in a post on the <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/5jk5xmlb/lady-malys-stands-tall-over-the-new-codex-drukhari/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warhammer Community</a> website earlier this week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“At the fore is a character long known for her quicksilver intellect and violent tendencies, who now steps onto the battlefield with a wicked weave of schemes and strategies to confound her prey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Give it up for the Archon of the Poisoned Tongue — Lady Malys.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/11/image1-1756899954-a9cqxpnbho-1757597029789.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Lady Malys, a brand new model coming to the Dark Eldar. Look familiar? Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Look familiar? If you’re thinking of Shadowheart from Baldur’s Gate 3, then you’re one of many with the same opinion. Ever since Lady Malys was revealed, the conversation around the model has involved comparisons to the much-loved Baldur’s Gate 3 companion, which is as much to do with the similar hairstyle and color and sort of similar facial features as it does her imposing demeanor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb on Lady Malys:</p><blockquote>Lady Malys is as deadly with her wit as she is with her slender blades, fighting with a barbed longsword known as the Lady’s Blade and a fan of razor sharp knives. Her knowledge of poisons can render her unit’s attacks even deadlier than usual, and opponents are always caught off guard when Kabalites they thought they had sussed out are suddenly spirited elsewhere before the battle even begins.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“It legit is Shadowheart,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Drukhari/comments/1nbofea/comment/nd395l8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor Sliversix</a>. “I was just tempted to get her model because of how gorgeous it looks.” “FR.

They should look more like a twisted form of the Eldar, Warhammer 40,000’s space elves, than Eldar in gnarly armor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Am I the only one who feels her face looks wrong for a Drukhari?” asked Perversoris. “Like way too light and closer to Craftworld than Drukhari appearance imho.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Drukhari shouldn’t be cute!!! <a href="https://t.co/STQueb3OQ8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/STQueb3OQ8</a></p>— Marius Gage (@For_Macragge) <a href="https://twitter.com/For_Macragge/status/1965437243721744681?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever your take, Drukhari fans are finally having <em>a moment</em> after years spent in the wilderness, looking on enviously at their Space Marine-loving brethren. It’s fair to say the Dark Eldar haven’t been on top of Games Workshop’s to-do list when it comes to new Warhammer 40,000 models, so whenever Lady Malys and co hit store shelves, the Drukhari fandom will have plenty to sink their teeth into.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And perhaps they’ll bring a few Baldur’s Gate 3 players along for the ride. All we need now is a Karlach World Eater...</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <title><![CDATA[Borderlands 4 Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-review.1294776/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">My passion for looter shooters has burned quite brightly for over 15 years and Borderlands is the flame that lit the fuse. With Borderlands 4, Gearbox proves it still knows how to bring the boom. After fizzling somewhat with Borderlands 3, it felt like this series had begun to fall behind in the genre it pioneered, but breaking away from segmented levels and embracing an honest-to-goodness open world allows 2025’s Borderlands to surprise us again. Drastically improved movement makes it one of the best-feeling first-person shooters out there, the story takes a refreshingly grounded approach that pays off, and the expanded buildcrafting options like healing items, throwing knives, and weapon enhancements are all fantastic ideas. But taking these swings also comes with some unfortunate downsides, like how exploration is quite literally held back by invisible walls and awkward surfaces that refuse to be trod upon, not to mention fairly rocky technical performance (at least on the PC version provided for review) and numerous bugs. But those rough <s>edges</s> borders did little to keep me from once again falling head over heels for my first looter-shooter love, and blasting through hordes of psychos with a friend or three feels as awesome as it ever has.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re new to the absolute insanity that is Borderlands, it’s a series where the weird enemies you mow down drop increasingly bizarre weapons that you then use to mow down even weirder enemies in an endless cycle of looting and shooting. How bizarre? It’s stuff like an assault rifle that shoots tiny rockets, can call in an airstrike, and explodes like a grenade when you reload and toss it. Or maybe you’ll luck into a sniper rifle that fires off ammo like a gatling gun and stops consuming ammo while overheated, or a grenade that screams absurd (and occasionally horny) things as it bounces up and down, spewing acid. Borderlands 4 keeps that feeling fresh by continuing to iterate on the silly weapons it gives you, which can cross-pollinate across different weapon manufacturers for even weirder outcomes.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Borderlands 4 Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The other distinctive bit of style that’s set its best games apart from the crowd is that despite always having been filled with lowbrow dick jokes to match its hand-drawn graphic novel look, Borderlands has never been afraid to surprise with sharp turns toward genuinely touching story moments. (Heck, it’s a universe that’s supported a Telltale-made Tales from the Borderlands game and its Gearbox-developed sequel, so it’s not all about run-and-gun action.) Borderlands 3 notably didn’t have a lot of those, though, so it was a relief when this followup finally ditched the original planet of Pandora and many of its legacy characters who’d started to wear out their welcome to tell a completely new tale on a world called Kairos that’s been dominated by a malevolent, brainwashing dictator named the Timekeeper. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 is much more than just a breath of fresh air, bordering on what almost seems like a soft reboot at times. It immediately adds some memorable characters to its cast, like the fancy and charming Levaine, who has a somewhat messy dating history with your fellow Vault Hunters – but then every once in a while it takes a welcome dip back into the nostalgia pool to have Claptrap rattle off a few jokes. (Yes, the sassy little bot is back; love him or hate him, it wouldn’t be Borderlands without him.) With a few neat twists in store and a compelling plot about trying to free this planet, I ended up liking the story quite a bit, even if it doesn’t hit the highs of Borderlands 2 (especially in terms of its iconic villain).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Borderlands 4 is a proper open-world game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the action itself is what you’d expect from this series, but number four (or six, if you count The Pre-Sequel and Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands) makes a number of pretty huge changes that shake up your vault-hunting expedition. The biggest by far is the fact that Borderlands 4 is a proper open-world game (as opposed to the traditional approach of large zones separated by loading screens) that’s filled with side quests, timed activities, collectibles, and puzzles to seek out. You also have a whole bag of tricks to aid you in the exploration of Kairos’ four diverse regions, like a grapple hook that lets you get to areas normally out of reach, a glider to soar over large swaths of land, and a vehicle you can summon on command to zip over hills and through deserts without having to hoof it to a Catch-A-Ride station first. Aside from a very limited few (such as The Division 2 or Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League), fully open-world games are pretty rare in the looter shooter space – none of which are in first-person.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Borderlands Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That might not seem like a big deal at first, but it’s hard to overstate how different this makes Borderlands 4 from its predecessors, not just because you’ve got so many new ways to get around, but because progressing through the story and leveling up your character is so much less linear now. Sometimes I’d spend a few hours just exploring a new region of the map, clearing the fog of war away and completing any activities I encountered along the way, while other times I’d race from place to place, focusing on one part of the main story quest line before pivoting to another part of it in a different region. That story took me about 40 hours to complete, but that was with plenty of distractions, and I’ve spent another 20+ after the credits rolled with lots still left to do. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also awesome that you don’t have to worry so much about sticking next to your teammates this time. They can be leagues away doing their own thing, and if they need help with something you can just pull up your map and warp to them instantly. Open-world activities are more diverse than I was expecting as well, and range from proper story-focused side quests to an activity where you have to fix a giant crawler to claim a vehicle upgrade to one where you fight loads of madmen at a drill site to earn some badass loot. The fact that you can do all that free-wheeling exploration and discovery alongside a group of friends in a way that’s never inconvenient makes it that much better and impressive.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Some areas are filled with invisible walls that you’ll unsatisfyingly slap into.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There is one major issue with this new open-world philosophy, however, which is that the physical terrain of Kairos doesn’t always rise to the occasion of these free-roaming ambitions. For example, some areas are filled with invisible walls that you’ll unsatisfyingly slap into while you’re trying to glide over a hill or mantle up a ledge. Borderlands has always had issues with its environments being a bit wonky, but it feels so much more noticeable in an open world where you naturally assume you’re meant to explore every nook and cranny, and most games come up with natural barriers like mountains or oceans to make it clear that you can go no farther. Instead, you quickly find the limitations of that exploration and they feel artificial. Although I eventually learned to recognize when a surface was probably not something I was going to be allowed to interact with, it still bums me out that there isn’t just some kind of “out of bounds” warning when going places I wasn’t meant to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One other major area of evolution is combat, which not only has tighter, more responsive gunplay than any Borderlands game before it, but comes packed with a frankly silly number of new movement options that make battles much more dynamic. In addition to the existing ways to get around like running and sliding, you can now double jump, glide, grapple hook, dash in any direction, and even swim (that’s right, water no longer instantly kills you, praise Moxxi). It actually took me quite a while to remember all the new ways I was expected to navigate combat encounters, but with the help of some enemies that smartly push you to make full use of your options, I eventually learned to master them. By the end, I was soaring across the map, dodging attacks like a pro and raining hell down upon my enemies. It became wonderfully satisfying stuff once I got the hang of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox has also heaped an impressively high volume of new things to shoot into this game. While other Borderlands sequels reused many of the same enemy types dating back to the 2009 original, Borderlands 4’s change of planetary venue means it has to significantly expand its menagerie. Sure, the masked psychos that serve as the series’ poster boys (they’re like a disturbing version of the Minions from Despicable Me, and they managed to hitch a ride off of Pandora somehow), but there are also little mechanical spiders that reflect all the bullets you send their way when they to spin their legs rapidly, creatures covered in crystals that are immune to damage until you shoot those crystals off and quickly destroy the floating orbs they turn into, and many others that I hadn’t seen before. Those caused me to stop and adapt to their tactics in interesting ways, and that was always a memorable moment.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Rest assured, the major bosses usually step up their game pretty noticeably.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even better are the boss fights, which have evolved pretty significantly in that they usually involve some special mechanics you have to learn in order to beat them. These are often pretty simple things, like picking up and throwing a toxic bomb onto one boss to peel his armor off, or having to juggle yourself in the air with grappling and gliding after the floor becomes hazardous for a phase of another fight. Granted, they don’t come close to the mechanical complexity of something you’d find in a Destiny raid, but those are often kind of over-the-top and this is a significant step up from some of the basic “dodge and shoot it until it dies” battles we’ve seen in Borderlands past. It’s a happy medium, and that makes these bosses a lot less forgettable. That’s not to say there aren’t any basic fights, but it’s fair to say that those can be an entertaining excuse to turn off your brain and blast something to bits and serve as a contrast to the ones with an extra element to them. Rest assured, the major bosses usually step up their game pretty noticeably.</p><div id="borderlands-vault-hunters-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands' Vault Hunters, Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands' Vault Hunters, Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also neat that you’ll start encountering enemies with various modifiers as you get further into the adventure and unlock higher difficulty settings via the endgame grind. These might be things like Elemental Eater, an effect that means enemies aren’t just resistant to a specific type of attack but healed by it, or Centripetal, which causes a black hole to form where an enemy with this trait dies, pulling everything in range into its center and dealing massive damage. It’s not all new, groundbreaking stuff for Borderlands – these are similar to effects found in Borderlands 3’s Mayhem Mode, for instance – but they’re now a central part of Borderlands 4, and that makes combat more interesting and has you staying a little more aware even of enemies you’ve seen a lot of already. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One huge pain point, though, is that the full descriptions for each of these modifiers’ effects don’t appear to be listed anywhere, so you’ve just gotta figure them out on your own – or look them up on the guide that IGN’s team is already cooking up for you. I can’t tell you how long I spent accidentally healing a bad guy before realizing I was doing something very wrong, and it would have been nice to have a codex somewhere with more info.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Combat has you staying a little more aware even of enemies you’ve seen a lot of already.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If the fact that I’ve gone this long without even getting to discussing the entirely new batch of Vault Hunters in Borderlands 4 doesn’t tell you there’s a lot going on here, I don’t know what will. It mostly sticks to tradition, but puts some pretty neat spins on the series’ existing classes. There’s the Siren, Vex, who uses her space magic to deal elemental damage and has some awesome life-stealing options; Rafa, the Exo-Soldier who can summon all sorts of DigiStructed weapons, from shoulder-mounted turrets to melee arm blades (as though Borderlands didn’t have enough weapons already!); Harlowe, a Gravitar with an assortment of gravity-manipulation abilities that can trap enemies in bubbles, among other things; and Amon, a massive, cybernetically enhanced warrior called a Forgeknight, who has a bunch of melee options at his disposal. Each one feels pretty good, with unique tools that make them all viable choices for endgame activities without feeling especially overpowered. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I’ve been pretty high on it so far, I do have some complaints to lodge as someone who tends to play this kind of game more than once, and with an eye toward making each of those playthroughs feel distinct.  After a few dozen hours with it, it strikes me that Borderlands 4’s buildcrafting hasn’t pushed this series into the realm of something like Diablo or – dare I say it – Path of Exile, given that there are a few branching paths to choose from in each Vault Hunter’s skill trees that you can then can optimize with gear to excel at a handful of specific things like dealing loads of elemental damage or healing yourself when getting kills, but not enough customization options to really go wild.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, the three different trees each character does have each at least add a little bit of variety to how every class can play, meaning more than one person on your team can use the same Vault Hunter while having a different set of buffs and abilities that can make them work well together. For example, for the first half of my playthrough I focused on Vex’s Spectral Summoning tree to deploy ghostly doppelgangers onto the battlefield, but after finding a legendary item that worked well for a different kind of build, I respec’d into the elemental DPS tree that focused on casting powerful spells instead of summoning others to do my bidding. If those two different characters worked together side by side, there’d be little overlap in what they’re bringing to an up-to-four-person team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ah yes, teams! Although Borderlands 4 feels great to play solo as well, for sure the best way to play is when among friends, but those who play together should expect to experience bugs together. The vast majority of my time in Borderlands was spent with friends, and we encountered just about every issue in the online-multiplayer book: lag and desyncing from combat if you’re not the host, enemies sometimes becoming immune to damage or teleporting around the map, and non-host players losing progress or getting locked out of quest lines because something didn’t track properly, just to name a few.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Borderlands 4 is a fairly buggy ride in general.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of this, like the fact that you don’t uncover the map in your own save file while exploring with friends, seems like it might be intentional, but is still deeply annoying and disincentivizes teaming up. Other issues, like equipment-selling vending machines that consistently offered no wares at all for any of us while in co-op, are just head-scratching pains in the neck. There were times when I hit enough issues in succession where it became preferable to just play solo, and others where it created friction when deciding who would be the group’s host because we knew that person would see the fewest problems. That’s definitely not the kind of dynamic you want in your co-op game, and it caused my group no small amount of grief as we discovered the various ways in which things feel not so great when playing together, despite gunplay and synergizing our builds with one another otherwise being really awesome. Granted, some of this is the result of playing a short time before launch and there will certainly be at least a few fixes by the time you play it – but if history is any lesson it will be a minute before all of this is ironed out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Playing solo is smoother, but there’s no escape from all of the problems because Borderlands 4 is a fairly buggy ride in general. It seems like there are as many bugs as there are guns, and the longer you play the more likely you are to see things like infrequent but severe framerate hitching, or your backpack suddenly deciding you have way less space for equipment than you should until you back out to the menu and reload. Two of my crew even found themselves locked out of the endgame grind when different steps in the questline broke, blocking their progression and making it so we couldn’t run the activities we wanted to do together. It’s a testament to just how fun exploring Kairos is that, even with all of that laundry list, I still couldn’t wait to play more even after dozens of hours. You’ve gotta take these complaints in context.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Borderlands Rankings</h3><p>Borderlands is a series that's always been very dear to my heart, and here's my ranking of them all.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of the endgame grind, Borderlands 4 appears to come pre-loaded with one of those (though hey, I said the same thing about Diablo 4 – you can’t call them all right, but I’m feeling optimistic). There are three activities you’re expected to complete weekly: a more challenging version of a story mission that has a bunch of tricky modifiers, like one where all enemies explode into a black hole of damage and another where enemies heal themselves when dealing damage to your team, a repeatable boss fight that mostly just seems like it’s there to give you a straightforward enemy to kill as many times as you’d like for great loot, and a hidden vending machine that moves around each week and sells guaranteed legendary loot. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you grind these activities, you’ll also unlock the more advanced world tier difficulties that offer better loot, but these are gatekept behind incredibly challenging quests with loads of modifiers that are the ultimate test of your loadout and shooting skills. At this point, none of these things are particularly deep or time-consuming since you just run them all each week and then are basically done, but even if that’s not your thing there’s still a massive map that has lots of side activities for you to complete out of the “box.” (Are there still boxes?) Beyond that, we have promises that Gearbox has a fairly good track record of delivering on, courtesy of a post-launch roadmap which includes plenty of content on the way. I have a lot of hope that Borderlands 4 will have legs for quite some time.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Borderlands 4 is a badass open-world evolution of a wonderfully unhinged looter-shooter series that needed to try something new, and it largely nails the biggest swings it takes. Combat is slicker than ever thanks to exciting new movement options and some interesting enemy designs, and the entertaining story takes things in a fresh direction while still tying neatly into existing lore. The transition to an open world isn’t the smoothest, especially when troubling terrain with a few too many invisible walls can make it feel like these environments are all for show, but that’s more than worth putting up with in exchange for being able to chart your own path and freely explore the wacky, violent world of Kairos. The bugs my crew and I encountered were bad enough to occasionally sour our co-op groove, but in between them we had a great time, and my friends and I have found ourselves utterly at the mercy of its loot grind. The Borderlands series feels like it has been a bit stuck in the mud for some time now, and especially after a few patches, Borderlands 4 is exactly the kick in the pants it has needed.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-review]]></content:encoded>

These modifiers, which can help or hinder your progress, include Cadia Stands, which makes Imperial Guard soldiers spawn on levels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have loved seeing Guardsmen help out in Stratagem mode, which not only increases the sense of epic scale for battles, but also leans on the beloved Cadian Shock Troops — perhaps Warhammer 40,000’s best-known human soldier force.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cadia was the setting of one of the most important moments in Warhammer 40,000 history, and the origin of the rousing ‘Cadia Stands’ battle cry. Cadia was destroyed when Abaddon the Despoiler crashed a Blackstone Fortress into the planet during his 13th Black Crusade, causing the planet to tear itself apart, and triggering the expansion of the Eye of Terror into the Great Rift, which split the Imperium. The destruction of the ancient Necron pylons on Cadia, which had kept the Eye of Terror stable, unleashed raw warp energy into real space, dooming the planet and reshaping the galaxy. The Warhammer 40,000 setting has spent recent years dealing with the fallout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so, Warhammer 40,000 fans love a plucky Cadian, especially while stomping around as a Space Marine. Therefore, when patch 10 introduced a quite wonderful bug that saw a Cadian soldier sometimes attract the attention of a monstrous Trygon Prime (one of the toughest Tyranid enemies in the game) to the point of obsession, Space Marine 2 players absolutely loved it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are some wonderful clips showing how Cadians were able to lead the Trygon Prime to its doom simply by attracting its attention, perhaps causing it to fall to its doom as in the clip below. Cadia stands, after all!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, no more. From now on, it’s the Space Marines who will have to deal directly with the Trygon Prime, with the Cadians in their traditional cannon fodder role once more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The massive balls of the guardsmen had a gravitational pull on that nasty worm,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1ne40e5/comment/ndlsyvo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commented redditor Suter_Templar</a>, reacting to the patch. “I love seeing them fight against monsters beyond their comprehension like nobody's business.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ok-but-who-is-inverting-their-horizontal-controls.1294767/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When we talk about inverted controls for video games, we’re usually talking about the way the camera moves vertically, called the y-axis. We talk about how the screen should move when the right thumbstick moves up and down. If you’re an inverted y-axis person, like me, you’re expecting the camera to tilt up when you push the thumbstick down—as if the camera is being controlled from the back. People who <em>don’t</em> invert the y-axis expect the opposite: If you push the thumbstick down, you expect the camera to look down, as if the front of the camera is being controlled. My former Polygon colleague Jeffrey Parkin has a great piece—and survey—about this, called “<a href="https://medium.com/@parkinjc/the-right-and-wrong-of-the-right-thumbstick-3bfea3a95024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The right and wrong of the right thumbstick</a>.”</p><p>As an inverted y-axis person, I’m always digging through video game menus to change the camera settings. I’m also an idiot, and sometimes I forget if the y-axis is vertical or horizontal, and I ended up switching the x-axis inversion instead. It’s always exceptionally jarring; though my brain expects the y-axis to work as if there’s a joystick on the back of a character’s head, I can’t wrap my head around the x-axis inversion. What’s even worse is that I <em>can</em> imagine it if I’m visualizing a joystick on the back of my own head—I “push” the stick to the left and I turn my head right. But when I’m playing a video game, my brain shuts down. When I push the stick to the left in the video game, I expect the game to show me what’s left of my character’s vision.</p><p>It scrambles my brain so much that I simply don’t understand how <em>anyone</em> can use a controller with x-axis controls inverted. I expect that some people may feel this way about me and the y-axis.</p><p>There’s not a ton of research into the x-axis, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12185817/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but researchers are starting to look into why y-axis inversion</a> is a thing for video game players. From MIT researcher Jennifer Corbett and Northeastern University researcher Jaap Munneke’s 2025 paper “<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12185817/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Why axis inversion?</a>:”</p><blockquote><p>The debate over y-axis inversion has persisted, likely due to individual differences and varying gaming experiences. Importantly, multiple literatures in human factors, ergonomics, cognitive science, industry, and medicine all touch on issues relevant to y-axis inversion preferences. However, discrepant or even contradictory terminologies and discordant dissemination methods impede a unified view of the overarching problem space. A clearer cross-disciplinary understanding of the factors underlying inversion preference can serve as a starting point for future empirical investigations in a variety of situations.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>For now, we can simply look to history for a reason for seemingly rare x-axis users. (Corbett and Munneke wrote in their paper that “there were very few participants [in their survey] who inverted the x-axis.” Through my own research, there’s more people online confused by the x-axis inversionists, though they certainly do exist.) It could come down to the sorts of games you play—or grew up playing. A bunch of generational hits, like Kingdom Hearts games, <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>, and <em>Super Mario 64</em>, forced players into using x-axis inverted controls—at least to start. Both <em>The Wind Waker</em> and <em>Super Mario 64</em> use a free camera system, so you can think of the perspective as being filmed through a camera on a tripod or gimbal. When you rotate the camera tripod arm to the left, the camera turns to the right, which can explain the reasoning the developers had for building the games this way. Nintendo even used this sort of reasoning in its game manuals to explain the free camera system. You’re playing the game, yes, but you’re actually “filming” Mario as the Lakitu Bros., who fly around a cloud with a camera attached to a fishing pole. For the Lakitu Bros.’ camera to film something to the right, the fishing pole would be moved to the left. <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em> works this way, too.</p><p>A lot of GameCube games were actually using this method for their cameras, but it seemingly fell off as a standard option by the time Halo was all the rage on Xbox consoles. The first-person perspective made the “camera” perspective feel much too abstract; people expected to push the stick to the left to see to the left, as if they’re pointing their eyes.</p><p>Of course, <em>a lot</em> of people played Nintendo’s early inverted games—and x-axis inverted games from other developers—but my hypothesis for why it didn’t stick around as a default is in how controllers evolved. GameCube controllers controlled the camera by using buttons and not two thumbsticks. Parkin talks about this in his survey piece, as well as about muscle memory: If you play a lot of games, there are just certain things you expect a controller to do. That muscle memory could be easier to override because of the disconnect between the way a camera moves when using buttons or thumbsticks. There could be enough of a gap there to create space for a different expectation, making it easier to "remap" what a button does in your head, regardless of the game's genre.</p><p>I asked people on BlueSky to weigh in, and one person, indeed, responded that they got used to x-axis inversion in <em>Sly</em> and <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em> on the PlayStation 2. “Ended up creating a psychological association with ‘3D platfomer’ and ‘horizontal inversion,’” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scubaprison.bsky.social/post/3lye2bh6if22b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they said</a>. Another person added that the first game they played with x-axis inversion was <em>Super Mario 64</em>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aimelle.bsky.social/post/3lye67meu6k2h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but that they’re able to change their perspective</a> when playing first-person shooters.</p><p>Most games offer y-axis inversion these days, but x-axis inversion has become obscure enough that some games don’t offer the option. <em>Alan Wake 2</em> was released recently with only the option to invert the y-axis, something that was so painful to horizontal invert players that someone permanently <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Controller/comments/1e7iayj/how_to_mod_your_ps5xbox_controller_to_permanently/?share_id=6LmSfGavRnr1-1-qCX2rv&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">modded their PlayStation 5 controller by rewiring the analog stick to be x-axis inverted</a>. However, <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/the-anniversary-update-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Remedy did end up adding the feature in</a>—something it called “one of the most requested” pieces of the Anniversary Update. “Inverting either axis can be a matter of preference, but for a lot of players it also presents a usability and accessibility issue,” it said. Options are good!</p><p>The statement is confusing, because that implies that a lot of people play in the shadows with the x-axis inverted. Where are you folks? Tell me what got you into it. How does your brain see the camera and screen? Let’s figure out the science behind it, and learn why y-axis inversion doesn’t mean x-axis inversion will click.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/unikat-32-33-indie-games-publisher-marketing"><h3>Running A Video Games Publisher AND Marketing Agency Sounds Absolutely Exhausting</h3></a><p>'Seeing all of your different efforts, ones that are synced by the work of many people, all being unveiled at once is a cool feeling'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-author-immortal-image-comics-interview"><h3>The Author Immortal Is A Metanarrative Isekai Comic That Explores The Messiness Of Separating The Art From The Artist</h3></a><p>Amid canceled creators, cultural reckonings, and A.I.’s rise, Frank Barbiere and Morgan Beem’s new Image Comics series invites readers to reclaim fantasy and confront who stories truly serve

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://gamesfray.com/last-week-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-received-a-u-s-patent-on-summoning-a-character-and-letting-it-fight-another/">Gamesfray</a> spotted that as of last week, Nintendo had secured <a href="https://archive.org/details/12403397">US Patent 12,403,397</a>, a patent that protects the game mechanic of "<em>causing a sub-character to appear</em>," or in other words, summoning a character, and "<em>controlling a battle between the sub-character and the enemy character</em>." Which is a long way of describing a classic Pokémon battle. You could also call it another patent in Nintendo's arsenal in its legal battle against <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-developer-outlines-game-changes-caused-by-the-nintendo-lawsuit/">Palworld maker, PocketPair</a>.</p>



<p>It's also not the only patent that Nintendo has acquired, as it also secured <a href="https://archive.org/details/12409387">US Patent 12,409,387</a>, which protects mechanics around player characters riding other in-game "<em>objects</em>," which is another patent that fits right in its fight against PocketPair and Palworld.</p>



<p>No matter who is doing it, whether it's Nintendo, <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/">Warner Bros.</a>, or any other entity, it's never great to see videogame companies patent game mechanics. But according to IP and patent lawyer Kirk Sigmon, these latest patents go beyond the general level of ire that patenting game mechanics causes players. Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/an-embarrassing-failure-of-the-us-patent-system-videogame-ip-lawyer-says-nintendos-latest-patents-on-pokemon-mechanics-should-not-have-happened-full-stop/">PC Gamer</a>, Sigmon doesn't mince words, saying, "<em>Broadly, I don't disagree with the many online complaints about these Nintendo patents</em>. <em>They have been an embarrassing failure of the US patent system</em>."</p>



<p>For Sigmon, it's not just the content of the patents and what they protect, it's how little of a fight the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) put up against Nintendo when it came to questioning and scrutinizing these patents. </p>



<p>"<em>This seems like a situation where the USPTO essentially gave up and just allowed the case, assuming that the claims were narrow or specific enough to be new without evaluating them too closely</em>. <em>I strongly disagree with this result: In my view, these claims were in no way allowable</em>...<em>This allowance should not have happened, full stop.</em>"</p>

				    	<p><span>2 of 9</span>
			    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>An obvious issue with these patents that Sigmon also points out is that they don't just apply to Nintendo's fight with PocketPair. They can apply to scores of other games, and give large companies with deep legal departments too much power to threaten whoever they want whenever they see fit. For Sigmon, it's a warping of the patent system that he still believes in.</p>



<p>"<em>The USPTO dropped the ball big time, and it's going to externalize a lot of uncertainty (and, potentially, litigation cost) onto developers and companies that do not deserve it</em>...<em>They were not made to allow a big player to game the system, get an overly broad patent that they should have never received in the first place, and then go around bullying would-be competition with the threat of a legally questionable lawsuit.</em>"</p>



<p>Securing patents that it could turn around and claim PocketPair is infringing on is right in-line with the 'hail mary' tactics Nintendo has been trying with its lawsuit against PocketPair and Palworld. This past July, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-reportedly-doing-everything-to-make-lawsuit-against-palworld-stick/">reports surfaced of Nintendo adjusting existing patents</a> to better align with its arguments against PocketPair.</p>



<p>As Sigmon points out, the most terrifying aspect of these patents is the precedent they set. It could be that these patents are rolled back if an Inter Partes Review case is successfully heard. But with how easily these patents went through, it doesn't seem worth it to put stock in the USPTO going through patents like this with a fine-tooth comb.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/far-cry-multiplayer-ubisoft</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/future-far-cry-games-will-focus-much-more-on-multiplayer-ubisoft-says.1294746/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has revealed that future&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>games will likely have much more of a multiplayer focus, and he says the shift is to ensure longevity.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-assassins-creed-mirage-saudi-arabia" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game File</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-confirms-far-cry-will-more-predominantly-push-multiplayer-in-future/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>), Guillemot spoke about the future of the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>series during the New Global Sport Conference in Saudi Arabia, at which he was asked about what was next for the first-person shooter franchise.</p>

<p>In response to that question, Guillemot said that the goal for the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>series is to "bring the multiplayer aspects more predominantly pushed" so that the franchise and its games "can also be played for a long time by players".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/far-cry-multiplayer-focus-far-cry-6.jpg?itok=H7i_L6Oq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/far-cry-multiplayer-focus-far-cry-6.jpg?itok=46PqyLwy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Future&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>games will foreground multiplayer to a much greater degree.</figcaption></figure><p>According to VGC, Guillemot's comments echo rumors that&nbsp;<em>Far Cry 7&nbsp;</em>is being developed in conjunction with a standalone multiplayer&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>game, which the publication says will be an "extraction-based shooter set in the Alaskan wilderness".</p>

<p>The last game in the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>series was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/far-cry-6-release-date-revealed-for-late-2021" rel="nofollow">launched almost four years ago</a>. Ubisoft hasn't announced exact sales figures for&nbsp;<em>Far Cry 6</em>, but in its <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/7FRH9Pjch7t9yXb4GMFgi0/db479fa1ae07fc5264f8b16e1d7a15f8/Ubisoft_FY22_Earnings_PR_English_Final.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2021-22 financial report</a>, the studio claimed the game was behind the series' "best year ever".</p>

<p>Of course, given Ubisoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-creative-houses-q1-financials" rel="nofollow">recent</a> financial <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-layoffs-possible" rel="nofollow">woes</a>, it stands to reason that the company would want to shore up sales for its major brands as much as possible, but whether shifting to multiplayer will work that magic for&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>remains to be seen.</p>

<p>The next installment in the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>franchise has yet to be officially announced by Ubisoft, but in December last year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-far-cry-7-and-maverick/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">rumors suggested</a> that the game had been internally pushed from a 2025 release window to 2026, so it may be some time before we hear from the series again.</p>




<p>If Guillemot's comments are to be believed, then it's likely that when&nbsp;<em>Far Cry 7&nbsp;</em>does arrive, it'll push its multiplayer aspect much more prominently, so you might want to grab a friend or two to play it with. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> is out now. Our Borderlands 4 review is not, because we have only just been sent a review code. I fear I was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-is-out-now-on-steam-our-review-is-on-the-way">unduly forgiving of Team Cherry</a> last week for not supplying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a> code before release - they're a cute, tiny indie, after all, albeit a cute, tiny indie with the power to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-has-murdered-steam">break Steam</a> - so let's take a firmer stance this time: bad! Wrong! Don't you know you're suffocating games journalism, Gearbox and 2K Games, you swaggering chancers? Whither accountability and transparency in a time of choosy PR departments? 
</p>
<p>I should teach you all a lesson by diverting your brand power and googlejuice towards some other game instead. I think I will, actually. What else is on sale today. Ah yes, Try To Drive.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Try To Drive (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3621700/Try_To_Drive/">Steam page</a>) is one of those daft multiplayer games that trades on co-op partners repeatedly sabotaging each other. In this case, it's a tandem simulator, a tandem being a bicycle for two people.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Red Core Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Doesn't sound nearly as arduous upfront as, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-tried-to-escape-hell-in-chained-together-and-one-of-us-kept-running-ahead-with-no-warning">climbing out of hell</a> while shackled to Nic "We Can Jump Those Lasers" Reuben and Brendan "My Left Not Your Left" Caldwell, but you will not be cycling down any ordinary roads in Try To Drive. You will be cycling along chains of floating biscuits pooped out by gingerbread men. You will be ponderously T-bogging your way over precarious glass accordions.
</p><p>I actually have some firsthand expertise to bring to bear, here, based on sharing a tandem with my life partner. The trick is to put the one with the biggest bum in front. No, I am not going to tell you whether I have a bigger bum than my partner - don't be uncouth. My other top tip is to put a mirror on your handlebar so you can check whether the other rider is goofing off.
</p>
<p>I have run out of tandem expertise to share, so let's circle grudgingly back to Borderlands 4, the game that murdered journalism. My big takeaway from the previewage so far is that it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-wont-be-making-jokes-every-minute-because-its-set-in-a-totalitarian-world">won't be as jokey as the other Borderlands games</a>, apparently because it's set in a totalitarian world, and they want to set a grimmer tone. 
</p>
<p>As some of you noted at the time of that linked report, the idea that humour isn't seemly in this context seems absurd, given that past Borderlands games have already seen us battling against odious corporate bosses and tyrants, while rattling through gags like ammo belts. That said, I do think Borderlands in general could benefit from being less punchline-driven.
</p>
<p>Beyond that, I can tell you only that they want <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/despite-cutting-the-gags-borderlands-4s-pc-specs-say-it-still-needs-100gb-of-ssd-space">100GB</a> of SSD space for the pleasure, and they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/randy-pitchford-shows-hes-capable-of-not-being-an-idiot-about-borderlands-4-prices-raising-questions-about-previous-insistence-on-being-an-idiot">pondering an $80 price tag</a> at one point. If you're hungry for more, I will grit my teeth and suggest that you cast your eye over <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/borderlands-4-review/">this review from Very Gary Computing</a>. They <em>did</em> get code, possibly because they didn't call the studio boss an idiot in any of their news coverage.
</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 can be found on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/borderlands-4">Epic Games Store</a>.</p>

We want them to fall in love with our content, with our series, with the differentiated offering outside the U.S. and then over time, it’s a little tricky, with the password sharing, we’re going to begin to push on that.”</p> <p>You can tell Zaslav loves his job because he talks about locating the optimal pricing strategy for other people’s creative output like he’s searching for the G-spot on a P&amp;L spreadsheet. Warner Bros. announced last month that it would soon start aggressively monitoring HBO subscribers’ accounts to make sure they weren’t letting friends and family mooch off them. But the password sharing crackdown isn’t the only thing coming to the home of <em>The Last Of Us</em> and<em> Peacemaker</em>.</p>

 <p>He continued, “I think our ability to raise price as people become more and more in love with the quality that we have and the series that we have and the offering that we have will have a real ability because I think the pricing across the board—not only is there too many players, in order to stay alive, a lot of the players have just decided to drop prices aggressively.”</p> <p>HBO Max’s first major price hike came in 2023 when the main plan <a href="https://www.avclub.com/hbo-max-subscription-price-increase-1849980303">went from&nbsp;$15 to $16 a month</a>. The following year prices went up again as the plans splintered, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/max-price-increase-hike-1236024561/">with the Ultimate tier rising to $21 a month</a>. HBO became HBO Max in 2020, then just Max in 2023, and then went back to HBO Max earlier this year. During that same period Zaslav saw the disastrous merger of Warner Bros. and Discovery that led to tons of debt and massive gutting of content at, among other places, HBO. Now Warner Bros. and Discovery will split up again by April 2026 as the stock price hovers below $20, down from a peak in 2021 of over $70.</p>

 <p>Big “my job here is done” energy from the guy awarded $50 million last year in total compensation for shuffling logos around on a whiteboard. Except we now know his job won’t truly be done until he jacks up HBO prices a few more times. Next year sees the arrival of a new <em>Game of Thrones</em> spin-off,<em> A</em> <em>Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</em>, and the <em>Green Lantern</em> detective show, followed by the <em>Harry Potter</em> reboot in 2027.</p> <p>“I think we want a good deal for consumers,” Zaslav said this week, “but I think over time, there’s real opportunity, particularly for us, in that quality area, to raise price.”</p>
