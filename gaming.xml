<p>How does it hold up?</p>

<figure><a title="RE Requiem" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a1042dbc6bf44/re-requiem.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, the latest mainline entry in Capcom's long-running survival horror series, was recently confirmed for Switch 2, launching on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to the game's appearance at Tokyo Game Show 2026, we now have footage of Requiem running on the Switch 2 via handheld mode, as kindly highlighted by <a href="https://x.com/Stealth40k/status/1971153556028977266">Stealth40K</a> on X.</p>
<p>The demo itself may be pretty familiar since it's already been showcase elsewhere on other platforms. As such, some of the visual downgrades might seen quite apparent to you from this new footage. To be honest, though, it looks pretty spectacular otherwise, particularly when you get into the proper gameplay and see just how effective the environmental lighting is.</p>

<p>You'll notice too that, as confirmed by Capcom, Requiem will be playable in either first-person or third-person. So if you're a fan of the developer's recent mainline entries like RE7 and RE: Village, then first-person might be the way to go. For those who prefer RE2 and RE4, then third-person could well be the better option.</p>
<p>It's a relatively short video, but it's nevertheless a really good indication of what Switch 2 owners can expect once the game launches early next year. As confirmed in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POz1-EmLsTY">reveal trailer</a>, Requiem will also take fans back to the ruins of Raccoon City and the R.P.D station, and it's heavily rumoured that veteran Leon S. Kennedy will be making a return either as a playable character or in a supporting role.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-500-piece-lego-brick-box-drops-to-pennies-on-amazon-2x-cheaper-than-lego-store-2000628678</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-500-piece-lego-brick-box-drops-to-pennies-on-amazon-2x-cheaper-than-lego-store.1308477/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s fun to dive into LEGO Star Wars or Harry Potter sets but once they’re built, many people hesitate to actually play with them. They often feel more like display pieces than toys. That’s why every LEGO fan should have a brick box filled with hundreds of colorful pieces: It’s the foundation for pure creativity, letting you build, rebuild, and invent completely new ideas without limits.</p>
<p>Right now, Amazon is offering the LEGO “medium” brick box at its lowest price ever: I<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4299/">nstead of paying the usual $34, you can get it for just $17</a>, which is two times cheaper than on the official LEGO site where it’s still full price. And if you want to go bigger, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4300/">a larger 790‑piece brick box is also on sale at Amazon for just $39 instead of $59</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4299/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See 484-piece box at Amazon</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4300/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See 790-piece box at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Endless Possibilities for Play and Imagination</h2>
<p>What is so special about this brick box is that it gets at the very essence of LEGO: <strong>open-ended building</strong>. With 484 pieces in 35 colors for the medium size and 790 pieces for the large box, you’ve got everything you need to get your imagination going, from windows and toy eyes to tires with wheel rims, perfect for cars, trains, or whatever your imagination comes up with. Even the green baseplate, well over 3 by 6 inches in size, is included, giving young children (and let’s be honest here, adults as well) a firm base upon which to build.</p>



<p>And it’s not all about chucking bricks around willy-nilly. The variety of pieces in this box enables kids to craft small animals like the tiger figure that is provided, motor vehicles with movable wheels, or even small houses with window cutouts. This assortment has been designed by LEGO to be compatible with their other sets so you’re not locked into one theme. You can add these pieces to any LEGO world you currently have, opening up possibilities without limit. That’s a <strong>big reason why this set gets a 4.8 rating out of 5 from more than 53,000 customers repeatedly</strong>.</p>
<p>Once the playtime entertainment is over, the entire set goes into storage <strong>within the durable storage box</strong>. Instead of bricks everywhere on the living room floor or on the way, the box is a great storage system. That small feature makes it so much less trouble for adults but it also increases the chances for kids to put their creations away and transport the box with them wherever they go.</p>
<p>For kids, having a creative brick box at home encourages hours of <strong>screen-free creativity play</strong>. It’s the type of toy that can grow up with children and it’s just as fun for grown-ups who are wanting to sit down and build something stress-free.</p>
<p>Since you’re paying half the amount charged on LEGO’s own site, now is the time to grab them while these record-low deals last.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since their announcement, Switch 2 Game-Key Cards have kindled much discussion and provoked strong opinions from gamers and developers alike. Latest to weigh in on Nintendo’s controversial format is Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy director Naoki Hamaguchi. He implied that developers are choosing Game-Key Cards not necessarily from a cost perspective, but a performance one, as the format enables them to bring smoother-running games to the Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Switch 2 Game-key cards are physical, they only contain a key, which requires the user to download the actual game from Nintendo’s online store. As Morningstar analyst Kazunori Ito recently summed up to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-23/nintendo-s-switch-2-sales-boom-fails-to-ease-game-developers-gloom?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1ODYyOTA2MiwiZXhwIjoxNzU5MjMzODYyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMzFHMDJHUFdDVFowMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJBRDcxOUY5NDBGRTk0MzNBOERCNzI2OEJDOTY3NzY3QyJ9.ZGnG8_5dKGMsGf2fJii9xwn7A_1_oZatFwdPzCAXhjs&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bloomberg</u></a>: “The key card feels rather half-baked as it combines the drawbacks of both the physical and digital versions.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite also attracting criticism from a game preservation standpoint (see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-a-little-disheartening-the-thing-remastered-dev-says"><u>Nightdive CEO Stephen Kick</u></a>’s comments, for example), some developers have recently spoken out in favor of the Game-Key Card format, the latest being Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy director Naoki Hamaguchi.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking through an interpreter during a recent interview with German news site <a href="https://jpgames.de/2025/09/final-fantasy-director-hofft-dass-ihr-game-key-cards-eines-tages-moegen-koennt/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>JP Games</u></a>, Hamaguchi said that he understood why the Switch 2 Game-Key Card format is disliked. “I really get where people are coming from in terms of their negativity towards it, and there are good reasons,” he said. However, discussion between developers on the topic is “perhaps a bit different to what the fans maybe expect.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade will make its Switch 2 debut on January 22, 2026. However, the game will only be released on a Game-key card, and there are reasons for this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hamaguchi explained that the major issues for those who want to release high-end, demanding games like Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade on the Switch 2 is the limited memory of the cards and their slower loading speed (in comparison to consoles with disc-based games, like PS5 and Xbox Series X and S). The smaller memory size of the cards is something that “developers can’t ignore (...) we have to work around that.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Game Boxes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch 2 Game-Key Card, however, helps developers to circumnavigate around these restrictions. Hamaguchi added that Game-Key Cards can make it possible for developers to do “a semi-download version of the game,” utilizing the Switch 2’s internal storage, which can load games faster than if they were being loaded completely from the card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over at Ubisoft, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-developer-defends-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-says-cartridges-that-force-you-to-download-the-game-are-better-for-loading"><u>Star Wars Outlaws’ developer Rob Bantin also recently defended Game-Key Cards</u></a> from a similar standpoint, citing performance as a major reason for going down this route: “(regular) Switch 2 cards simply didn't give the performance we needed at the quality target we were going for."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In defense of the format, Hamaguchi said that he’d like for “Nintendo fans to understand the Game-Key cards and maybe come to accept them as part of the culture of gaming on Switch. (...) From a developer’s perspective, it allows us to bring more high-end experiences to Switch players, and I think that’s a good thing (...) (it lets) us do things that maybe we wouldn’t otherwise.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This echoes previous <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-switch-2-game-key-cards-help-third-party-publishers-bring-deeper-larger-and-more-immersive-content-on-the-platform"><u>remarks from Nintendo of America CEO Doug Bowser</u></a>, who suggested that Game-Key cards help third party publishers to release bigger and more ambitious games on the Switch 2: “Game-Key Cards are a way that our publishing partners are able to bring more content onto the platform- deeper and larger, more immersive content.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

		<p>Saber Interactive has released the Heavy Ordnance update for World War Z today, bringing new perks, mutators, and premium skins for players to get. The main new asset for the Heavy Ordnance update is the introduction of perks for heavy weapons, including the flamethrower, the chainsaw, and rocket launcher. All eight heavy weapons have three unlockable perks, which include explosive bullets, napalm, and strong grip.</p>
<p><iframe title="Heavy Ordnance Update | World War Z" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GrIThGMUgV0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In addition to the heavy weapon perks, there are more weapon perks being added such as flechettes, loner, and shadow step. The six new mutators for challenge horde mode are as follows:</p>
<p>○ <em>Dead Pirate: Zekes stay alive for a bit of time after headshots</em><br>
<em>○ Paralytic Toxin: You slow down after taking damage in close combat</em><br>
<em>○ Ouch!: When you are grabbed, a random grenade, molotov, or masking grenade</em><br>
<em>explodes</em><br>
<em>○ Sharing is Caring: When you use a medkit, its effect applies to all team members</em><br>
<em>○ Arm Weakness: You cannot use heavy weapons during Zeke waves</em><br>
<em>○ Slot Machine (permanent mutator): Purchasable defense kits become random&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>All of this is part of the free content that the Heavy Ordnance update brings, but there are a couple of premium packs being offered too. The first is the Vibrant Halloween weapon skin pack which includes skins for the Mini-21 Scout Rifle, Paladin LMG, Keris V10 Advanced SMG, AUR Universal Bullpup Rifle, and the SchreiTech Forest Warrior Chainsaw. The second pack is the Raging Phoenix weapon skin pack, and that has skins for the Gal9 Compact SMG, ARK-103 Assault Rifle, Thumper GL Grenade Launcher, Taiga-12 Heavy Assault Shotgun and the Flamethrower. Both packs are priced at $4.99 each.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-hades-2-nintendo-switch-2-edition-a-bewitching-sequel-thats-a-spell-off-perfect.1308432/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<p><em>“Can time not be stopped?”</em> That’s the question <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a> asks you every time you clear a run. The stakes are bigger in Supergiant Games’ first-ever sequel: This is no longer <em>just</em> about family drama, it’s about a dysfunctional family defending all they have against the clutches of the Titan of Time. It’s a story of tragedy, of failings, and of the Unseen, headed up by the Princess of the Underworld Melinoë, attempting to save her home.</p>
<p>I love Hades II, though I love just about everything Supergiant Games has ever made. It was the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a> that sent me down the path of checking out the studio’s back catalogue. An Ancient Greek soap opera about Zagreus attempting to defy his father and escape Hell. It’s extremely personal, using Greek myth to expertly spin a yarn around a roguelike structure.</p>
<figure><a title="Hades II - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159137/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Hades II once again showcases a horde of beautifully written characters and stories amidst that roguelike cycle. The writing is the star here, with tons of new characters for the writers to sink their teeth into, and they do it fantastically. Even returning characters have a few surprises up their sleeves, whether in how they conduct themselves during the war, their brand new — and almost always gorgeous — designs, or their impeccably realised voices.</p>
<p>I <em>have</em> to talk to every character after every run, because they always have something different to say and something to react to. Nemesis might chide me for dying too early one run, while the next might be jealous as I managed to conquer Chronos. Hecate, Melinoë’s mentor, is always looking for more from the Princess, but is equally ready to praise.</p>
<p>And, this time around, the Gods and Goddesses are never shy about what they dislike about mortals, even Melinoë. Surprise! It turns out that Greek deities suck, actually, and that leads to some very interesting discussions about greed or misunderstanding of the human need for hope and the like.</p>
<p>I’m glad Supergiant’s character writing is still on form, as the narrative itself fell a little flat for me. The game uses Greek Tragedy as a framework for Melinoë’s plight fantastically, but her war on the Titan of Time began to feel a little rushed towards the end, and I missed that emotive connection. Family is still key here, as with any good tragedy, but it all feels a little more at arm's length.</p>
<figure><a title="Hades II - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159147/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Those little narrative trip-ups are easy to overlook, though, as the game is staggeringly beautiful, particularly on Switch 2. Jen Zee’s character art truly shines, with every portrait featuring little flicker animations to highlight their specialities or traits, and environments that hide secrets where the attention to detail screams at you. It doesn’t matter if you’re playing docked or handheld, either, Hades II is utterly faultless, though the 120fps docked has a slight edge for me (handheld is locked at 60fps).</p>
<p>The gameplay still has magic, too. Initially, everything felt extremely familiar, but after fumbling or getting greedy a few times, I quickly realised that I needed to completely rethink how I approached the sequel. You can’t play it like it’s Hades; that’s been true since Early Access (I transferred my save data over from Steam seamlessly), and it took me time to adjust to Melinoë’s moveset. She’s not just the Princess of the Underworld, she’s also a Witch, and Magick is the key difference between her and her brother.</p>
<p>While almost all of her actions are the same, each one acts differently; the Cast in particular took me <em>forever</em> to nail down. I was so used to firing magic missiles from range or setting up icy laser beams that the idea of getting down-and-dirty with a more fragile, slower-attacking character, before dashing away again, was hard to overcome. But I became obsessed with it; it’s now my favourite part of Melinoë’s kit.</p>
<figure><a title="Hades II - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159143/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I spent hours running different builds focusing just on the Cast - there was one where I stacked different explosive skills from Hephaestus and Apollo with one of the Moonstone Axe’s aspects: I’d drop the ring down on a huge group of enemies, dash away, and charge up a special which would cause the ring to blow up.</p>
<p>Another build let me regenerate Magick all the time I stood in the ring, so I slapped on Zeus’ lightning or Hera’s Hitch effects to do extra damage or enfeeble enemies all so I could dash through and backstab them with the twin blades inside the ring while they’re afflicted. There’s so much flexibility, I keep finding new ways to ensnare foes with <em>just this</em>.</p>
<p>And, this is only one part of Melinoë’s moveset. When you combine everything together, Hades II’s mechanical richness is staggering. Omega attacks (one for Attack, Special, and Cast) are affected by every weapon type, aspect, and every deity has a boon that affects each of these. Magick management becomes a vital part of every encounter that can be managed with Boons and other things. Melinoë can bring a familiar with her that helps gather resources or attack and enhance her own skills. I can even call upon Selene’s moon magic to briefly turn invulnerable or revive dead foes and have them fight for me. Admittedly, this feels like a bit of an afterthought on most builds, and is easily the part of my kit I dug into the least. Sorry, Selene. Your design is beautiful, though.</p>
<figure><a title="Hades II - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159138/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Time and time again, I embarked on a run, tried some new weapons, boons, keepsakes, aspects, and felt the familiarity and comfort of Hades return, just in new wrapping. But this time, there isn’t just one run – there are two different paths: one to the Underworld, the other to the top of Mount Olympus.</p>
<p>The former eventually suffers a bit from that familiar Hades structure — though the Fields of Mourning’s open environments make for a good change of pace — and eventually felt easier than the first game's runs ever did. The Surface, however? Oh boy. I still get my backside handed to me every so often.</p>
<p>Surface runs change things up in a number of ways, such as the City of Ephyra presenting at least ten different doors in one room, allowing you to choose six and strategise your build more carefully early on. The Rift of Thessaly lets you jump between ships and fight multiple waves of enemies in the same location. The last couple of biomes are structured more like Underworld runs, but everything hits a <em>lot</em> harder. There are still times I get caught out by the third big boss of the Surface, and the final one? <em>Ouch</em>.</p>
<figure><a title="Hades II - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159140/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>

<p>If I ever got bored with one run, I’d swap and go for the other. You have to do them both multiple times anyway, and given how differently each boss and encounter can and should be approached, it’s good practice. And with every death, with every failure to stop time, you get a little better. Plus, there’s always the joy of hearing Darren Korb’s outstanding soundtrack wherever you go; I could probably write an entire review about Scylla and her band as she belts out tunes during battles with Melinoë about clawing my eyes out and drowning me to death, but that would be discounting the rest of the music. It’s a must-listen.</p>
<p>After every run, you’ll bring back a handful of resources, some of which you forage along the way, while others are rewards. These are required to cast Incantations (which often help out in your runs or are story-related), buy items or Nectar, decorate the Crossroads, and so on. But there are way too many of these to manage, and some are more scarce; every biome has its own flower, seed, metal, fish, etc. And then there’s excess currency I can sell for another currency. When there’s already so much stuff to play with, I could do with fewer resources or currencies to manage.</p>

<p>So, there’s a <em>lot</em> going on — a little too much — though almost all of it is exceptional. To be honest, I’m amazed that Supergiant has largely managed to live up to the towering heights of Hades with this sequel; there’s no doubt that, mechanically, this is a huge improvement. I was worried about the team continuing with the formula, but there are plenty of fresh ways to approach every run that make the whole game so moreish. I’ve varied my playstyle far more than I ever did with Hades, and I feel like I’ve got so much more to discover beyond the credits.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Supergiant Games is five-for-five with Hades II, a huge, triumphant sequel that manages to diverge mechanically and offer more challenges and variety than its predecessor. It helps that it’s nearly faultless on Switch 2 in particular.</p>
<p>Sometimes there’s a bit <em>too</em> much going on, and in shooting for a bigger, more tragic story, I think it’s lost a bit of heart. But, quite frankly, I don’t want time to stop because if it does, I won’t be able to play Hades II anymore.</p></section>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagate-4tb-hard-drive-selling-for-pennies-only-0-02-per-gb-for-lifetime-safe-storage-2000628672</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seagate-4tb-hard-drive-selling-for-pennies-only-0-02-per-gb-for-lifetime-safe-storage.1308426/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s no argument really: offline storage remains far more reliable and personal than spending month after month on cloud subscriptions. With cloud services such as Google Drive at around $10 a month for 2TB each and every month, the expense adds up quickly.</p>
<p>An external hard drive like this Seagate 4TB HDD does away with that problem at one stroke: Right now,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3869/"> it’s an all-time low price on Amazon for $99 instead of its normal $124, so you’re paying just $0.02 per gigabyte for storage for life</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3869/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Drive Is a Smart Buy</h2>
<p>The Seagate hard drive is simple to describe but does all the right things. Behind the scenes, it <strong>relies on a USB 3.0 port which offers fast transfer speeds, and it’s plug‑and‑play</strong> compatible with Windows laptops and desktops as well as Macs. You don’t have to deal with any time-consuming setup or format processes and it allows you to start dragging and dropping files in mere minutes. Beyond computers, it gets along with gaming consoles like Xbox and PlayStation which gives you an easy way of expanding game storage without needing to replace main drives.</p>



<p>With 4TB capacity, you can store years of photos, home videos, your entire music collection and still have plenty to spare for work documents or even entire game collections. For console players, that might translate to over 100 modern games in a single device without having to erase older games constantly as the new ones are added.</p>
<p><strong>And then consider the long-term cost advantage</strong>: Paying around $10 per month for 2TB of online cloud storage (<a href="https://gizmodo.com/best-cloud-storage">check out a guide here</a>) means within twelve months you’ve paid more than this 4TB Seagate drive costs. <strong>With the physical drive, you’re only paying for it once</strong>. And on top of that, you retain full ownership of your files, with no worry about renewal subscriptions, cost hikes, or company closures.</p>
<p>Saving documents offline on a hard drive keeps sensitive data away from online threats: Your private photos, finances, or personal archives aren’t floating around in a cloud storage facility that you don’t fully control with the Seagate hard drive. And if the drive does fail, Seagate offers a one‑year Rescue Data Recovery Service, so you’ve got another safeguard against mishaps or unexpected failure.</p>
<p>Currently selling for $99, this Seagate 4TB external hard drive is one of those deals the more you consider it. If you’re tired of having to keep free plans restricted or raising the cost of subscriptions, paying only $0.02 per GB for lifetime storage is a great opportunity.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/surface-laptop-256gb-snapdragon-x-plus-just-took-a-big-price-cut-microsoft-is-going-all-in-2000628252</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/surface-laptop-256gb-snapdragon-x-plus-just-took-a-big-price-cut-microsoft-is-going-all-in.1308423/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Microsoft is perhaps best known for its Surface <em>Pro</em> tablets which compete directly with the iPad Pro but its Surface laptop line has been the best way to experience Windows at its finest. If what you need is a thin, light notebook with full Windows 11, current AI-capable Copilot capabilities and good performance, this is an extremely tempting option. The most affordable model with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Plus processor and 256GB storage has now hit an all-time low cost on Amazon: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4298/">It costs $859, a discount from its initial price of $999</a>, which is fantastic considering it was launched less than a year ago.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4298/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Laptop for the AI Era</h2>
<p>The Surface laptop was designed by Microsoft as part of their <strong>new Copilot+ PC series infused with AI functionality</strong> that brings real-world benefits to routine computing. This model currently on sale at Amazon comes with the Snapdragon X Plus 10-core processor at its core, paired with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. This provides it with a speed where productivity applications and creative burdens are easy, and yet still hold up in terms of power efficiency.</p>



<p>One of the real benefits here is in how the Copilot feature affects everyday life: Recall lets you simply locate documents, e-mails or web pages by backtracking through an activity timeline. With video calls or meetings, Windows Studio Effects powered by Copilot help you declutter your room through noise suppression, better lighting, and a blurred background, which is a lifesaver if meetings extend throughout the day. You <strong>can even read real-time subtitles in 44 languages</strong> while streaming or on a call which makes international communication a seamless process.</p>
<p>Battery life is also a department where this Microsoft laptop takes the lead: With <strong>a 20-hour charge time</strong>, it’s designed to last you all day and more without needing to be plugged in. That’s convenient enough to take with you to work or even on a trip without constantly needing to find plugs to recharge. The paper-thin measurements and 13.8-inch touchscreen screen cap it off, giving you a slim and modern design that still gives you plenty of screen space to do your multitasking. Bright HDR technology ensures clarity whether you’re watching shows.</p>
<p>What also makes this deal noteworthy is how early it comes: The Snapdragon X Plus-based Surface Laptop only entered the market in late 2024, yet we’re already seeing its price dip far below the $1,000 mark.</p>

    <p><span>A look at some of the game's Aniimo creatures.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Kingsglory [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/funplus/kingsglory">Kingsglory</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Pawprint Studio [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/pawprint-studio">Pawprint Studio</a> have released the Tokyo Game Show 2025 trailer and new screenshots for <a title="Genres > Free-to-Play [449 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/free-to-play">free-to-play</a> <a title="Genres > Open-World [736 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world</a> creature catching <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,800 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">action RPG</a> <em><a title="Games > Aniimo [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/aniimo">Aniimo</a></em>. <span id="more-996293"></span></p><blockquote><p>The new trailer shows off a variety of the game’s namesake, Aniimo—creatures who inhabit the world of Idyll and can accompany players on their journeys as Pathfinders. As players encounter Aniimo throughout the world, they will discover that Aniimo behave differently when faced with new environments and weather; can be peaceful, provocative, or protective; live in groups or roam by themselves; and other distinguishing factors and behaviors.</p><p>A number of Aniimo took the stage in today’s fresh look at the game to give players an idea of the type of interactions these colorful creatures may have with their environment, as well as with other Aniimo:</p><ul><li><strong>Stellarys</strong> – An evolution of Celestis that can only occur on rainy days, Stellarys uses water to defend and attack and travels alone across Idyll, in stark contrast to Celestis. Because a Celestis that is already owned by a Pathfinder will no longer evolve into Stellarys when in rainy weather, players who want to add a Stellarys to their roster must find and capture one in the wild.</li><li><strong>Helgon and Helmut</strong> – Helgons can exploit Helmuts’ weaknesses in the wild, provoking them to evolve in one of two ways. Most often, Helmut will evolve into Rookguard, which gives them the ability to transform into a metal sphere, thus protecting themselves from Helgon. However, in some rare cases, the bravest Helmuts may instead evolve into Pawney, allowing them to challenge Infregon, the Helgon’s family boss.</li></ul><p>These interactions and evolutions offer just a sneak peek at the variety on display among the Aniimo, with plenty more for Pathfinders to discover when they explore Idyll for themselves. Players eager to get their hands on <em>Aniimo</em> to do so can pre-register at the <a href="https://aniimo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> for all the latest updates and a chance to be included in upcoming beta tests.</p></blockquote><p><em>Aniimo</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,981 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,370 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/aniimo/9pk8phlcqdf6" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a>, iOS, and Android in 2026.</p><!-- AD: content -->

<p>Xbox consoles don't traditionally sell well in Japan, but it's clear Microsoft is aiming to appease players in the country. That's why Forza is moving to Japan, and Call of Duty will feature maps inspired by the country.</p>

<h3>Hold hands in Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly</h3>

<h3>Pokémon wannabe Aniimo</h3>

<h3>Ninja Gaiden 4's difficulty options detailed</h3>
<p>The Ninja Gaiden series is notorious for its difficulty, but this fourth game in the series will expand out in both directions. For newcomers, there's a new Hero Mode with auto-guard and auto-dodge assists you can toggle at will. You can also change difficulty at any point, while the standalone Training Mode will let you practice your combos. For experts, there's Master Ninja which cannot be switched to midgame and will be particularly tricky, requiring deadly precision. Gameplay for this looks very cool! It's out on 21st October across Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.</p>

<h3>Shoot your friends in a cat cafe in Call of Duty Black Ops 7</h3>
<p>The next in the Call of Duty series will get a bunch of multiplayer maps inspired by Japan, so no wonder they were revealed at the Tokyo Game Show. The country is a "major region woven across the entire experience", apparently, and its 2035 setting presents a near-future merging tradition and innovation. Two maps were named: firstly Toshin, a Tokyo-esque metropolis that includes a cat cafe among the neon lights, and Japanese castle Den. It's out on 14th November.</p>
<h3>Forza Horizon 6 will bring Japan to life "like never before"...</h3>
<p>…but it wasn't actually shown. The next in the racing series will be out in 2026, but this was just a quick tease before it's fully unveiled next year.</p>

<p>"Among developers, the discussion about the keycard format is perhaps a bit different"</p>
</section><div><section>
<figure><a title="ff7 remake key cards" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c85095d27f296/ff7-remake-key-cards.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: SQUARE ENIX</em></figcaption></figure><p>As you're doubtless well aware at this point, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> is winging its way onto Switch 2 on 22nd January 2026, and we are super, super (add a few more supers) excited about it. Especially this writer, in fact, because he's managed to start the remake several times on other systems and has yet to actually finish it. Portable play will remedy this.</p>
<p>In the build-up to the release of the Switch 2 version of Square Enix's masterpiece, its director, Naoki Hamaguchi, has been chatting to German site <a href="https://jpgames.de/2025/09/final-fantasy-director-hofft-dass-ihr-game-key-cards-eines-tages-moegen-koennt/">JPGames</a> (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/final-fantasy-7-remake-director-understands-players-qualms-about-switch-2-game-key-cards-but-for-aaa-devs-its-a-way-to-overcome-loading-speed-limitations/">Automaton</a>) about those dreaded Game-Key Cards, and it seems he's of the opinion that they are a necessary evil, thanks to the a speed drawback with Nintendo's Switch 2 carts.</p>
<p>During the interview, Hamaguchi is quoted saying that, “Among developers, the discussion about the keycard format is perhaps a bit different to what fans maybe expect," pointing out that whilst the actual storage size of carts is important, it's the speed of loading high-end, AAA games and their huge assets that's the key issue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I think perhaps the biggest issue for developers, certainly for people like us who make high-end HD games, is the loading speed, because you compare that to the solid-state drive and the speed you can get from loading from that, it’s going to be inferior to that, it just has to be, that’s the way the media works, physically. So that’s the bigger issue, really, in terms of making games, making high-end games for the Switch 2, and what it allows, obviously, by doing a semi-download version of the game, you can then use the SSD and rely on that for that smoother loading. So that’s perhaps the bigger issue in terms of a developer."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hamaguchi is careful to clarify that he understands gamers' reaction to the Game-Key Card solution. "I really get where people are coming from in terms of their negativity towards it," he says, "and there are good reasons and debates to have there."</p>
<p>We recently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/ubisoft-employee-explains-why-star-wars-outlaws-is-a-game-key-card">heard from a Star Wars Outlaws dev</a> about how the use of Game-Key Cards for that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">stellar port</a> helped with streaming assets, loading, and all of the benefits you'd expect from a faster storage and information-streaming system versus having that data transferred from a separate cart.</p>
<p>And so it would seem that, as far as Game-Key Cards go, and as much as Hamaguchi says he can sympathise with how players feel, the controversial 'physical' option will continue to be used as a necessary part of getting big Switch 2 games on store shelves. Be sure to check out the director's entire response at <a href="https://jpgames.de/2025/09/final-fantasy-director-hofft-dass-ihr-game-key-cards-eines-tages-moegen-koennt/">JPGames.de</a>.</p>

<p><em>How do you feel about Game-Key Cards now that devs are airing their thoughts on how running the game off internal memory benefits the porting of AAA games? Has your opinion changed? Let us know below.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Like its predecessors, Ninja Gaiden 4 will feature multiple difficulty settings, such as the accessible Hero mode and the challenging Master Ninja mode, allowing players of all skill levels to enjoy the game's intense and bloody combat.</p>



<p>A new gameplay trailer shown during <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-tokyo-game-show-2025-livestream-forza-horizon-6/">today's Xbox Tokyo Game Show 2025 broadcast</a> provides the first look at these two difficulty modes. Hero mode, created to allow newcomers to the series and character-action games to enjoy the game's challenging experience, features different toggles for Auto Evade, Auto Block, and Auto Assist that allow players to build the foundation needed to switch to Normal or Hard mode without being overwhelmed by enemies. This foundation can also be built using the newly announced Training mode, a first for the series.</p>



<p>Master Ninja mode, on the other hand, will sit at the exact opposite end of the spectrum in terms of difficulty. The most challenging Ninja Gaiden 4 difficulty setting, which cannot be changed in-game once selected at the beginning of a playthrough, will require true skill to complete, with new enemy placements, late game enemies appearing earlier, and more aggressive enemy AI. </p>



<p>Hero difficulty mode and its toggles won't be the only accessibility options featured in Ninja Gaiden 4. On <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/25/how-ninja-gaiden-4-curates-a-challenge-for-each-and-every-player/">Xbox Wire</a>, it was confirmed that the game will feature options such as disabling Hit Lag or Hit Stop, hiding the Lock-on Marker, Highlight Game Elements to free-hand recolor a wide range of objects, multiple controller options, including Left-handed Inverted Controls, and more.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While all of the newly revealed additions are quite welcome, based on <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-gamescom-hands-on-preview-a-promising-return/">my experience with the game during Gamescom 2025</a>, the Master Ninja difficulty changes will be appreciated by fans of the genre looking for a real challenge, as regular enemies in the demo were mostly waiting around to be taken down quickly, instead of taking advantage of their greater numbers as they should have.</p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 launches on October 21 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>Forza Horizon 6, the next entry in the successful racing series, is launching in 2026 on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-tokyo-game-show-2025-japan-setting/">previously teased by a reliable insider</a>, the sixth entry in the series was officially announced with a short announcement trailer shown during today's Xbox Tokyo Game Show 2025 broadcast. In development by both longtime series developer Playground Games and Turn10, the developers of the Forza Motorsport series, Forza Horizon 6 will bring players to Japan, the most-requested location since the series began.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Forza Horizon 6 - Official Teaser Trailer | Tokyo Game Show 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VXedKqX5Wa4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Following the announcement trailer's release, a new post went up on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/25/forza-horizon-6-japan-setting-2026/">Xbox Wire</a>, where Art Director Don Arceta and Cultural Consultant Kyoko Yamashita commented on the choice of setting. Besides being the most requested location from fans of the series, Japan has a unique culture that makes it perfect as a setting for an entry in the Forza Horizon series, thanks to how the country uniquely blends traditional buildings like shrines with modern buildings like workshops. The timing was also right, as current technology finally allows a proper representation of Japan.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 6 will also take advantage of the Japanese setting in other interesting ways. The series' season change mechanics will be brought up to a new level in the game, as different seasons will have a dramatic impact on the landscape and playable world, according to Arceta. The new system will also truly inform the world, subtly changing activities and sound. This attention to detail will be evident in the entirety of the experience, with ambient audio that will instantly tell the player which season they are currently in.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 6 is slated for a 2026 launch on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. More will be revealed in early 2026.</p>

Bruce Lee is in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman</a> now. Unfortunately, you don’t get to play as him. Fortunately, you do not have to fight him. Oh, don’t look at me like that, Agent 47. You might be the last word in swatting people with Wet Floor signs, but I’ve yet to see you perform a credible one-inch punch. Perhaps you’d get the drop on Bruce Lee if you threw up on him after swallowing an irradiated carbon rod, but I don’t fancy your chances in the context of a proper Bangkok martial arts tournament - like the one depicted in Hitman’s latest Elusive Target mission, the Dragon. Here be trailer.

<p>
Available from today, 25th September, until Thursday 20th November, the free Infiltrator Elusive Target update both marks Bruce Lee’s 85th anniversary and reinvents him as an agent of the ICA. Lee is trying to infiltrate the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a> Union crime syndicate by way of a martial arts tournament at the Himmapan Hotel. His job is to flatten a few faces and uncover the Concord Union’s supreme leader. Your job is to stop people sabotaging the tournament. 
</p>
<p>
I imagine this will be stuff like identifying terrain traps and intercepting people who want to spike Bruce Lee’s trademark pre-fight Mai Tai with 14-day-old cat litter. No, I don’t know whether Bruce Lee really drank Mai Tais, but in my defence, I didn’t know he was a secret agent, either. We're blundering in the dark!
</p><p>
The Elusive Target accompanies the time-limited release of a Bruce Lee DLC pack that grants permanent access to the Dragon contract, together with Lee’s yellow tracksuit, some kali sticks, a jade dagger, some golden dragon scissors, and some cosmetics for your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/freelancer">Freelancer</a> Safehouse. All yours for $4.99, €4.99 or £3.99. I would not pay that much for some scissors, not even if they were all yellow and draconic, but you do you. Now, please savour this roadmap of upcoming Hitmen content.

<p>
I’m interested to know how well-received the time-limited nature of these Elusive Targets are. The model makes more sense in Hitman’s universe of shifting allegiances and identities, and doesn’t seem to have roused quite the same opprobrium directed at other developers who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-2-to-stop-removing-old-expansions-starting-with-lightfall-in-february">remove stuff from their games</a>. I’m also keen to know if there’s the option to simply watch the martial arts tournament in the Dragon. It would be a terrible waste of Lee’s charisma if we had to spend the whole time facing away from the arena, tripping over karate students holding sports bottles full of acid.
</p>
<p>Jeet Kune Do legends aside, Io Interactive have just updated the Hitman World of Assassination trilogy on PC with the same VR support previously offered by PSVR2 on console. This allows you to "dual-wield weapons, interact with disguises, and use their environment creatively thanks to intuitive motion controls, full ambidexterity, and room-scale implementation". It's compatible with all campaign locations from all three games, together with the Freelancer strategy roguelike mode.</p>
<p>Io's wider activities include a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-first-proper-footage-reveals-a-posh-blockbuster-with-bubbles-of-hitman">James Bond game</a>. I'm pretty sure Agent 47 could take James Bond.</p>

                <p>On the opening night of Gamescom last month, Capcom and Square Enix revealed a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" data-ref-id="5000-612214">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online-a-realm-reborn/" data-ref-id="5000-148228">Final Fantasy 14</a> collaboration that will touch the worlds of both games. Now, Capcom has revealed that its side of the crossover is starting Monday, September 29 with the arrival of its Free Title Update 3. That news came with a fresh trailer that shows off what happens when the worlds of Monster Hunter Wilds and Final Fantasy 14 collide.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca1iBhq-C90" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ca1iBhq-C90" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As seen in the trailer, FF14's Omega Planetes has found a way into the Monster Hunter world, and it's going to take some teamwork to defeat this mechanical monstrosity. To combat Omega Planetes, two new FF14 jobs are being introduced in Wilds: Dark Knight and Pictomancer. The former gives players Dark Knight-themed armor that can create damage-absorbing barriers and push back against heavy attacks. Pictomancers essentially create images that unleash powerful spells against their enemies.</p><p>Several Final Fantasy 14-inspired cosmetics will be unlockable in this update, including a Chocobo seikret skin and new gestures. The trailer also teases December's Free Title Update 4, which will feature the return of Gogmazios, an elder dragon who hasn't been huntable in the game since Monster Hunters 4 Ultimate in 2015. </p><p>Although Capcom recently released a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-patch-notes-new-update-adds-tougher-endgame-content-weapon-changes-more/1100-6533861/">new patch for Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, the PC port's optimization issues won't be directly addressed by Free Title Update 3. Capcom has previously stated that those issues will be the focus of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-problems-will-be-addressed-in-an-update-this-winter/1100-6534077/" data-ref-id="1100-6534077">an update coming this winter</a>, which doesn't currently have a date tied to it.</p>

            <p>Treyarch has highlighted two of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 7 multiplayer maps set in Japan during today's incredibly dry Xbox Game Showcase during Tokyo Game Show.</p>
<p>The two maps - Toshin and Den - are two of the 18 multiplayer maps available at launch. These two highlighted maps will be playable in the Black Ops 7 open beta, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-open-beta-starts-2nd-october">which kicks off on 2nd October</a>.</p>
<p>The first map highlighted was Toshin, which is set within a Japanese city. Split into two distinct districts, players can fight through the tight alleys of Old Town or the tech-heavy main streets. There's a broken down monorail, and even a cat cafe present here, though thankfully no actual cats to distract from tense firefights from what we can see.</p>

<p>Next up comes Den, a Japanese castle heavily converted with high tech equipment spread throughout its interior.

This beta will feature a new game mode called Overload, in which two teams have to fight over a special overload device and drop it inside each other's zones to score points.</p>
<p>Black Ops 7 has been<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-promises-to-be-most-mind-bending-black-ops-ever"> set up as the "most mind-bending Black Ops ever"</a>, leaning on the more psychological aspects of the series for this latest instalment. Still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-the-best-battlefield-has-ever-done-one-million-in-steam-pre-orders">with Battlefield 6 turning heads and gaining a lot of positive attention</a>, there's a lot of pressure for the upcoming Call of Duty to do well now it's got some sturdy competition.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ninja-gaiden-4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> launched in just under a month on 21st October, Team Ninja and Platinum Games have shared some new gameplay and talked about some key new difficulty features for the game, including an easier “Hero Mode” that adds gameplay assists.</p>
<p><iframe title="NINJA GAIDEN 4 - Difficulty Design | Tokyo Game Show 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N-ccI2SOsD0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Hero Mode is a nice way of saying Easy Mode, and sits below the Normal difficulty. The main difference is that it adds assists like auto-dodge and auto-guard, so that new players can acclimatise themselves to the ninja action. You can fiddle with these assists at any time in the menus, and switch between Hero, Normal and Hard difficulties through a playthrough, as you need.</p>
<p>Master Ninja difficulty, however, cannot be switched to or from mid-run. This means that it will remain the preserve of the ultra skilful diehards of the franchise.</p>
<p>Thankfully you will still have access to the training mode. This, possibly taking inspiration from fighting games – will let you drop into a training room to practice your attack strings and defensive manoeuvres.</p>

<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 is launching across Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC on 21st October 2025, and it will also be day one in Xbox Game Pass.</p>

<p>Plus, Mech Zangie-F returns</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Ahead of her debut on <strong>15th October 2025</strong>, C. Viper gets the spotlight with a brand new gameplay trailer for Street Fighter 6.</p>
<p>Available as part of the <strong>Year 3 Ultimate / Character Pass</strong>, C. Viper (or Crimson Viper) was originally introduced to the series in the 2008 entry <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/super_street_fighter_iv_3d_edition">Street Fighter IV</a>. She retains her signature moves such as Burning Kick, Thunder Dash, Knuckled Pursuit, and Seismic Hammer. A brand new move called Focus Force has also been introduced, allowing you to bring up a protective barrier before launching your counterattack.</p>
<p>In addition to her standard outfit, C. Viper will also boast her Street Fighter IV attire for those who want to inject a bit of nostalgia into their gaming. As for the new outfit, Capcom has provided two pieces of artwork in its recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1364780/view/544495527868235881">blog</a> to give you a good glimpse at Viper in all her glory.</p>
<figure><a title="C. Viper 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9c38f7ff28d0b/c-viper-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>In addition to a brand new character, the Year 3 Pass also introduces an extra outfit for Zangief. This is based directly on Mech Zangie-F from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/marvel_super_heroes_vs_street_fighter">Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter</a>, though its overall design has been updated accordingly for this new release. It looks pretty awesome.</p>

<p>The additional outfit will be available on 15th October alongside C. Viper, but that's not all. Owners of the Year 3 Pass can also look forward to two addition characters in the coming months: Alex and Ingrid.</p>

We also got a look at Call of Duty: Black Ops 7's Japanese maps, Gemma Chan as Dr. Selina Tan in 007: First Light, high-level gameplay from Ninja Gaiden 4, and even Bruce Lee joining Hitman: World of Assassination as 47's partner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There were a ton of big announcements during the show, and you can find all of the biggest ones below in one place. After you check it out, let us know what your favorite part was and what you wish had shown up! </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Forza Horizon 6 Speeds to Japan in 2026</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox's Tokyo Game Show ended with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-6-set-in-japan-launches-2026">our first look at Forza Horizon 6,</a> which is actually located in Japan and will be released in 2026. While we didn't get to see actual cars in the open world, we were given a glimpse of a beautiful vista featuring Mount Fuji after a few fun nods to the series' past.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For a long time, Japan has been top of Horizon fans’ wish lists, so we’re excited to finally be bringing this much-requested location to players in <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>,” explains art director Don Arceta to <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/25/forza-horizon-6-japan-setting-2026/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a>. “Japan has such a unique culture – from cars, to music, to fashion – that make it perfect for the next Horizon setting. As with any Horizon title, we want to make sure we do the country justice in terms of authentic representation and Horizon open world playability – and now is the right time to realize that fully for players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team also shared that the technical side of the equation is now in the right place to bring this vision to life, and they even gave the example of Forza Horizon 5's Hot Wheels DLC, which helped the team develop the elevated roads of Tokyo City.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for where else Forza Horizon 6 will take us, the team isn't quite ready to share any more locations. However, they did give us a small tease.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“While we’re not announcing too much in terms of detail right now, we’re excited to show fans the true breadth of beauty – both natural and urban environments – that Japan has to offer,” explains Arceta. “From the neon lights and towering buildings of Tokyo City – one of our most detailed and layered environments to date – to the serenity and natural beauty of Japan’s rural and mountain areas, we think players will be blown away by the open world of Japan that we have built."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Japan also has a long and storied history with cars, and Playground Games is doing all it can to honor that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In Japanese car culture, the depth and diversity is astonishing,” Cultural consultant Kyoko Yamashita said. “Kei cars and vans with cult followings, precision motorsport, drifting’s roots, and their passion for customization really stands out. It’s welcoming to different levels of enthusiasm and knowledge, which is exactly the kind of layered world I want players to feel.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And of course Forza Horizon 6 will have changing seasons, which will all pay homage to Japan's "sweltering summers, snowy winters and, of course, the iconic Sakura season, those precious weeks where cherry blossoms bloom across the country."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The team has also been able to build a system where seasonal changes truly inform the world – how spring, summer, autumn, and winter subtly shift tone, activity, and sound,” explains Yamashita. “The team is also really proud of the attention to everyday details: ambient audio like station chimes or summer wind bells that instantly place you without a caption. Those are quiet choices, but they carry a lot of truth.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Showcases Multiplayer Maps Set in Japan</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will feature two maps set in Japan and they were both showcased during Xbox's TGS stream. Toshin was first up and it looks to be set in 2035 Tokyo. Furthermore, it will combine "well-defined lanes and some really fun set pieces - including a cat cafe, a karaoke bar, and a crashed train."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Den is the second one and will offer a "different vibe." This map is set in the countryside outside Tokyo and "centers around a Japanese castle that's been repurposed as a Guild base."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will be released on November 14, and the Early Access Beta will start on October 2 before the Open Beta kicks off on October 5.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">007: First Light Casts Eternals' Gemma Chan as Dr. Selina Tan</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">007: First Light not only was featured during the stream with quick looks at gameplay, but we were also introduced to MI6's Head of Tactical Simulation, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/007-first-light-adds-marvel-star-gemma-chan-to-james-bond-game-cast">Gemma Chan's Dr. Selina Tan.</a> For those unfamiliar, Chan has previously been seen in Eternals, Raya and the Last Dragon, and Crazy Rich Asians.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Selina oversees a cutting-edge program designed to test and refine the skills of MI6’s most promising recruits," the official description reads of the brand-new character. "With her background in psychology, strategy, and immersive technologies, she is as formidable as she is innovative."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ninja Gaiden 4 Gameplay Overview Features Master Ninja Difficulty Action and Training Mode</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of its release on October 21, Ninja Gaiden took center stage at Xbox's TGS stream to showcase not only its training mode that will let you practice combos and weapons in a safe place, but also its Master Ninja mode. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlocked after beating Story Mode, Master Ninja will challenge players with feature late-game enemies in earlier chapters, enhanced AI, a greater number of enemies at once, and much more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Microsoft has now formally announced Forza Horizon 6 during <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-microsoft-tokyo-game-show-september-2025-everything-announced">today's big Xbox Tokyo Game Show broadcast</a> and revealed that it will release first for PC and Xbox console, before then arriving on PlayStation 5 "post-launch".</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The teams at Playground Games and Turn 10 have poured their hearts into Forza Horizon 6, bringing Japan to life like never before," said Xbox exec Matt Booty, finally making the game's reveal official.  "This has been the most-requested location since the very first game and we can't wait to share more next year."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s Japan. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ForzaHorizon6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ForzaHorizon6</a> <a href="https://t.co/D6HngHj43g" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/D6HngHj43g</a></p>— Forza Horizon (@ForzaHorizon) <a href="https://twitter.com/ForzaHorizon/status/1971165411119943871?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 25, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">An <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/25/forza-horizon-6-japan-setting-2026/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a> blog post on the game's announcement goes into more detail on why Japan has been chosen now specifically, with art director Don Arceta revealing that recent technical advances had made the game possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The beauty of Horizon games is that each one gives us learnings and ways to make the next even bigger and better," Arceta said. "As well as taking player feedback into account, we’ve also been able to lean into more practical things – for instance, the Forza Horizon 5 Hot Wheels DLC has helped us develop the elevated roads of Tokyo City in FH6.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As evidenced from today's teaser, the game will mix Tokyo's urban environment with a sample of Japan's rural areas, including Mount Fuji. The series' usual seasonal changes will also return, Arceta confirmed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>ORIGINAL STORY:</strong> Forza Horizon 6, the next entry in Microsoft's racing series, will be set in Japan and launch in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft made the announcement via a post on Instagram, which has gone live several hours before today's big Xbox Tokyo Game Show broadcast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The post shows a brief teaser for Forza Horizon 6, confirming its setting and release year. "The Horizon Festival is heading to Japan," reads a caption. "Coming 2026. Wishlist now!" Logos confirm the game will be an Xbox Play Anywhere title, and unsurprisingly also launch on Xbox Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While today's announcement looks to have gone live a little early, nothing from today's announcement comes as much of a surprise.
