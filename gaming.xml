            <p>
One of my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rps-selection-box-edwins-bonus-games-of-the-year-2024">Xmas selection box games</a> last year was <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/withering-rooms">Withering Rooms</a>, a delightfully frightful haunted house action-RPG that balances mazey Metroidvania level design with the ability to be a witch who can supersize herself and gallop around on suits of magic armour. With a quick glance over my shoulder at our dear friend Sir Eugene Optimisation, I dare to describe it as a bit like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a>, if Bloodborne had been made by a tiny independent developer. 
</p>
<p>
Also rather Bloodborney: the recently revealed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/withering-realms">Withering Realms</a>, a sequel of sorts in which you play a ghost girl clinging to the back of a customisable combat doll. Sir Eugene Optimisation requests I add here that the doll conceit reminds him of well-received Soulslike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies Of P</a>. Which is a fair observation, I think, though I would also say the doll’s lipless, one-eyed grimace reminds me of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mouthwashing">Mouthwashing</a>. How’s that, Eugene – three for three? Anyway, here’s a trailer.

As the title suggests, the key change here from Withering Rooms is that you’re no longer confined to a single house and grounds. Instead, you’ll get to “explore the mysterious town of Penwyll and the sprawling graveyards, tombs, caves and rotting estates that surround it”, with combat now unfolding on a full 3D plane. The year is 1926, but not as you may recall it if you happen to be 100 years old. In Withering Realms, the first World War was interrupted by an occult event which has caused the dead to walk and spirits to roam. It’s also given certain people the ability to cast spells.
</p>
<p>
The ghost girl is Clover, who died during the above occult event. She’s able to interact with the world only through the doll, which can thankfully be outfitted with a range of bludgeoning, carving or shooting implements, including a “pivoting greatsword” and a “chain rock”. The doll aside, Clover has an ally in “daring freelance investigator” Althea - one of the few other characters who can see her.
</p>
<p>
I still need to finish Withering Rooms but this looks like more of what I enjoyed about that game. There are some involved-sounding overworld mechanics: you can “expand the world map by defeating massive perimeter guardians”, and return to areas at night “to encounter new, horrifying creatures and secrets”.
</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-details-on-nascar-25-career-mode-released/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>IRacing is deep in development of its first NASCAR console game, NASCAR  25, and it has released a new developer diary going over some of the features of the game’s career mode.</p>



<p>The diary first talks about the previous announcement that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nascar-25-to-feature-four-official-series-including-arca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arca series is coming</a> to a console game for the first time. The series will  be available in career and other modes throughout NASCAR 25.</p>



<p>“So, why having Arca, Trucks, Xfinity and Cup is so important, especially from a design perspective, is we finally get to do what is a realistic career mode that somebody would actually follow in real life,” Director of Development and Production John Schneider said. </p>



<p>Elsewhere in the NASCAR 25 career mode, there will be opportunities to grow your driver’s brand off the track and spend your time. Players will be able to build their reputation by helping clean up a park, helping around the shop, or even have a part in a movie. Your sponsors might also have tasks for you that will help keep you in their good graces. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="NASCAR '25 Dev Diary: Ep 03" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HKZeypm3tIA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>“You’ll have to balance between building your reputation and your brand, and being successful on the race track,” Dale Earnhardt Jr. said.</p>



<p>There will even be decisions on how you spend your money to improve your team and become a top contender in every series you enter. According to Mike Devault, the game’s UX lead, designing the career mode was a “herculean effort”.</p>



<p>“You want to make sure that you have all the right details in there about what makes a NASCAR career really authentic,” he said. “At the same time, you don’t want to make everybody have to go through all the minutia of managing a race team and the finances and the employees.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>“It’s a nice balance, and I think we’ve pulled this off really well in NASCAR 25 where if you want to just concentrate as being a driver, you can do that while mildly being involved in some of the decision making. But, if you want to go in there and manage every last little detail, you’re going to be able to do that as well.”</p>



<p>Devault added that throughout the career, interactions between driver, crew chief, and team will feel more authentic as opposed to being too much “like a UI screen.”</p>



<p>NASCAR 25 launches this fall for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

                <p>Funcom has announced that its MMO survival game, Dune: Awakening, will launch for PC on May 20. The game is also slated for a PS5 and Xbox Series X|S launch, but a release date for those versions hasn't been revealed yet.</p><p>In this iteration of the Dune universe, the main protagonist Paul Atreides was never born. Players assume the role of a prisoner sent to Arrakis to uncover the mystery around the Fremen's disappearance. Along the journey, players will rise from being a nameless survivor to either becoming an agent of the Atreides or the Harkonnen.</p><p>The game will cost $50 and those who preorder will receive a decoration called the Terrarium of Muad'Dib that they can place in their bases.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl6Wi20fSp0" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gl6Wi20fSp0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Players can also download the character creator and benchmark tool to receive a special code to redeem a Frameblade Knife at launch. Characters can be saved and imported to the full game, and the benchmark tool lets players know if their hardware can run it.

There will be server-wide politics in the form of Landsraad decrees, where every player will be impacted whether they're aligned with Altreidas or Harkonnen.</p><p>While the game is multiplayer, players can choose to experience the storyline alone, and PvP is always optional.

			<p>Today, Arc Games and Snapshot Games (the creators of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/phoenix-point-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phoenix Point</a>) have announced a new title from XCOM creator Julian Gollop. The game is called Chip ‘n Clawz vs. The Brainioids and it's a hybrid of action and strategy. Played from third-person view, it also offers the strategic depth of an RTS game, all set in a colorful, comic book-style world.</p>
<p>In Chip ‘n Clawz vs. The Brainioids, players must&nbsp; take the role of the heroes Chip or Clawz (or both characters in coop gameplay) to stop the Brainioid invasion. They will gather resources and collectibles, build bases, boost hero abilities, command minions, and fight alongside them in large-scale battles. The humorous story campaign features both normal and hard difficulty modes. There are also fast-paced, pick-up-and-play missions that, according to Snapshot, bring a modern twist to classic strategy games. There are even boss battles against the most powerful Brainioids.</p>
<p>In multiplayer, Chip ‘n Clawz vs. The Brainioids supports army battles with or against your friends, including two-player couch co-op. There are also various online modes, from the classic online 1v1 to 2v2. Online multiplayer also supports cross-platform play on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>Julian Gollop, CEO of Snapshot Games, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>At Snapshot Games, we recognize how much players really enjoy challenging real time strategy games but from our experience, we know that some players like a strategy game that’s easier to pick up and play, that’s a bit more action-packed and that’s fun to play with friends. With Chip ‘n Clawz vs. The Brainioids, we set out to create a dynamic and accessible action RTS experience that players can dive into together. We can’t wait for players to jump into the action, meet the game’s unique characters and enjoy the heroic adventures that await – starting with the demo in just a couple of days!</em></p>
<p>The game will be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1332430/Chip_N_Clawz_vs_The_Brainioids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">playable</a> on PC in just four days during the upcoming Steam Next Fest. The demo will give players plenty of Chip n' Clawz action, between online and local campaign co-op and PvP multiplayer support, four mission levels, two challenge levels, two PvP maps, and plenty of weapons, mods, collectibles, and base building options.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/delta-force-console-versions-delayed-beyond-q1-to-ensure-input-fairness.1114593/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/delta-force-console-versions-delayed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Team Jade and publisher TiMi Studio Group have announced that the console versions of tactical shooter&nbsp;<em>Delta Force&nbsp;</em>will be delayed beyond 2025's first quarter.</p>

<p>During the sixth volume of the developer's "Ask Shadow Anything" Q&amp;A sessions, game director Shadow Guo provides an update on the PlayStation and Xbox versions of the game, which were originally scheduled to launch sometime early this year.</p>

<p>According to Shadow, although development on&nbsp;<em>Delta Force</em>'s console versions is "going well", the release date has been postponed so that the developer can ensure "input fairness" for players of "different skill levels".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/delta-force-console-delayed-q1-aiming.jpg?itok=iX32dv97 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/delta-force-console-delayed-q1-aiming.jpg?itok=kpkRLXl4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Delta Force&nbsp;</em>isn't coming to consoles in the first quarter of this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Shadow says one of the main challenges of making a tactical shooter for consoles is making sure that players can "have a fair and balanced aiming experience", and that this is a "key issue" the team is currently hoping to solve.</p>

<p>It's not all that's holding the console versions of&nbsp;<em>Delta Force&nbsp;</em>back, though. Shadow also says the team is currently working on "optimizing the UI and overall interactions in the Operations mode", going on to say that adapting the UI for consoles in this regard is "complex".</p>

<p>If you're disappointed in the delay, Shadow says that a detailed roadmap regarding console development for&nbsp;<em>Delta Force&nbsp;</em>will soon be released, giving you a glimpse into "the progress and tasks we complete periodically".</p>

<p>As for the rest of the video, Shadow provides updates on hot-button issues like a kill cam, addressing performance issues, and progression wipes for the Operations mode. You can check out the full Q&amp;A session (don't worry, it's pretty short!) right here.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Delta Force</em>, it's a free-to-play tactical shooter based on the long-running shooter series of the same name.</p>

<p>The game comes complete with a range of multiplayer modes, as well as a campaign that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/delta-force-campaign-january" rel="nofollow">retells the events also depicted in the 2001 movie&nbsp;<em>Black Hawk Down</em></a>. Said campaign launches tomorrow, having been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/delta-force-campaign-delayed" rel="nofollow">delayed from its original release window</a>.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Delta Force&nbsp;</em>right now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2507950/Delta_Force/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">for free on PC</a>. Console versions are also on the way, but as today's Q&amp;A revealed, we don't quite know when yet. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Sandworm-bothering MMO <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> will release on 20th May, developers Funcom have announced, and you can start tailoring your very own Arrakish (I swear it's a canonical term) adventurer by means of the just-released character creator. Any desert delver you produce with said creator can be imported to the full game at launch. 
</p>
<p>
Inspired by Monster Hunter's Hunting Horn, I've recently gotten into the habit of making characters who look like Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson. I'm not sure Dune: Awakening has sufficiently puckish hair to support this - not many big frizzy gingers in the Dune universe, in my experience. But I'm willing to give it a shot, for science. Anyway, here's a trailer.

<p>
And here's some blurb about that character creator: "Fine-tune every aspect of your looks, then choose your home planet, caste, and mentor, be it Swordmaster, Bene Gesserit, Mentat, or Trooper. The final choice determines your starting abilities, but you will gain access to every School eventually, and can even mix and match abilities from any of them."
</p>
<p>
The character creator accompanies a benchmark mode, which "lets you check your hardware performance and system compatibility while being treated to some epic scenes from the game, including soaring with an ornithopter and a dramatic encounter with a colossal sandworm." 
</p>
<p>
In the full game, sandworms are a persistent threat that roam the world and are drawn to the sound of players using thumpers, mining spice melange or just walking around on the bare sand. As I discussed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sandworms-are-the-spice-in-dune-awakenings-otherwise-quite-familiar-survival-simming">in my preview last year</a>, you can lure the worm into attacking rival spice miners. I think this is the part of Dune: Awakening that most has my interest. The idea of building another base and levelling up doesn't really grip me, as much as I like the setting.
</p>
<p>
Read more of Dune: Awakening on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/">Steam</a>. Ah, steam. There isn't a lot of that on Arrakis. Water is scanter here than redhead prog rock musicians.

            <p>Chirpy cockney urchin Strauss Zelnick recently hailed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-publishers-think-pc-is-of-increasing-importance-in-2025-but-still-wont-announce-the-magic-date">the "increasing" importance of the PC market</a> in the lead up to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>'s release this autumn. Could it mean we're getting the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> crimeathon the same time as consoles? Buddy, we don't even get <em>updates</em> the same time as consoles. Things might be speeding up on that front at least, based on an email Colin Rockstar sent us earlier. On March 4th, they're giving us some nice gubbins for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> that they previously saw fit to exclusively roll out on machines that don't even have the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minesweeper">Minesweeper</a>.</p>
<p>The upgrade is free "with a one-time Character Migration flow to bring over your Story Mode and Online progress", and offers new vehicles and vehicle performance upgrades, animal encounters, new graphics options, and faster loading time. There's also a "and much more" in there but Colin loves saying that. You can find the full details on <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/akk98a4o755825/free-upgrade-for-grand-theft-auto-v-on-pc-coming-march-4">Rockstar's website here</a>.</p>

<p>I gave up on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-online">Red Dead Online</a> once it became apparent that Rockstar sneered so hard they tasted their own nostrils every time someone mentioned it, but animal photography feels like a direct transplant from there, no? I haven't touched GTA 5 for years, mind, so I'm not sure if it was already in the game. The update will also feature "recent player experience improvements for GTA Online, including kernel-based anti-cheat protections, and proactive voice chat moderation to help keep GTA Online safe, secure and fun for everyone". Thanks Colin!</p>
<p>In other crime news, Rockstar Games have been reportedly been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-may-let-you-modify-its-own-map-using-roblox-style-user-creation-features-claims-report">thinking about letting GTA 6 players modify the game’s map</a> with Roblox and Fortnite-style creation mechanics.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The upcoming Steam game is essentially a first-person walking sim in an 8x8km open world where you try to get across a map from the cabin you spawn in to a weather tower somewhere off in the distance. You need to worry about food, warmth, and surviving environmental hazards like lightning and snow storms caused by a dynamic weather system.</p><p>So, yes, <em>Prologue</em>’s emergent sandbox is far from the bullet-flying drama of <em>PUBG</em>. Having spent a little time with the beta version, I would even say it’s kind of boring. Imagine the narrative-driven first-person adventure <em>Firewatch</em> but without any of the story, characters, and intrigue. Greene joked that some staff consider <em>Prologue</em> a bit of a horror game because they think they’re hearing noises that aren’t really there. There is certainly plenty of room for more authored mystery in <em>Prologue</em>, but right now it mostly seems like a wilderness sim aimed at self-directed exploration and player-generated anecdotes. </p><p>“Kim [Nordstrom], our CEO, in one of the early builds, he spawned in a broken cabin with no clothing, and it was snowing, and he was like, ‘Damn, I’m going to die,’” Greene recalled. “And there was not much he could do at that point, like he tried to light a fire, but the snow came in and he died of hypothermia, just because that’s the type of the game it is.” He continued, “I’ve heard a bunch of, like, people waiting overnight on top of a mountain, then getting a vista as the sun comes up and not realizing they were there and and these kind of lovely moments, because the worlds are new every time. So every time you play, you get a slightly different experience.”</p><p>Like <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, <em>Prologue </em>uses procedural generation to create billions of possible open-world maps. Machine learning agents trained on satellite data and other sources of real-world terrain info create <em>Prologue</em>’s worlds, and then PlayerUnknown Productions developers go in and fine-tune the results to try to maximize the potential for interesting emergent scenarios as players try to cross rivers and mountains to get to their destination. Currently, a successful playthrough might take one to two hours, but the team is currently looking at ramping up the difficulty to make each hike more of a challenge. </p><p>While <em>Prologue</em> conducted player tests throughout the second half of last year, it’s clear Greene is excited to finally get the game into more people’s hands. He said he wants to build the game “with players,” and all of the new feedback and experimentation will no doubt be invaluable for proving if the map generation tech powering the <em>PUBG</em> creator’s vision, an engine called Project Melba, is robust enough to scale into massively multiplayer games and beyond. </p><p>That includes a second game consisting of millions of square kilometers of open world and millions of players to fill it. Think MMO survival sim <em>Rust </em>but on a completely different scale, the same way battle royale games turned traditional 6v6 deathmatches into sprawling 100-player affairs. And if that ends up working, the ultimate goal is <em>Artemis</em>, a sort of open-source, high-fidelity <em>Roblox</em> in which players build all different kinds of worlds and can move between them seamlessly. This metaverse, a 3D version of the internet as Greene calls it, is the long-term goal, potentially 10-15 years away, guiding <em>Prologue</em>’s development like a north star. </p><p>Even that might be overly ambitious. PlayerUnknown Productions is currently just 60 people split between the game and engine sides. Although Greene announced the team in 2021 (which remains independent), it took years to get anything out the door, like December’s <em>Preface</em>, essentially a demo for <em>Prologue</em>’s map generation tech. Though Greene is a visionary game designer (he was making battle royales long before PUBG blew up), he might not actually be that great at running a game studio.</p><p>“I’ve been trying to get this survival game made for about three and a half years, and I thought it was a simple premise, right?” he said. “It’s a new world every time, and then just a simple survival loop, I’m not asking for a moon and the stars here.” Greene said the core team was great but the leadership level, which he was responsible for, wasn’t working out. </p><p>A couple of years ago, though, a new executive team came in, including CEO Nordstrom (former chief strategy officer at Paradox Interactive), CTO Laurent Gorga (former tech director at Hangar 13), executive producer Petter Sydow (former producer at Massive Entertainment) and creative director Scott Davidson (former art director at Facepunch Studios). Gorga told Greene he wanted something released within a year when he joined, and things finally started moving. “Before was a little bit sort of siloed, and people were working on different things,” Greene said. “Now we’re fully integrated.”</p><p><em>Prologue</em> is being built with Unreal Engine but the goal for future installments, or “stepping stones over a pond” as Greene calls them, is to transition away from proprietary technology and tools to exclusively relying on in-house tech like Melba and open-source solutions. After all, you can’t create the future of the internet with player connection and creativity shackled by licensing agreements. Greene’s vision flies in the face of what Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney is currently doing with <em>Fortnite</em>, whose battle royale mode was once sued by <em>PUBG</em>’s publisher for copying it, and which has also recently tried to become more of a platform for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lego-fortnite-free-minecraft-review-epic-games-1851140950&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lego-fortnite-free-minecraft-review-epic-games-1851140950">world building than just a single game</a></span>. </p><figure id="" data-id="ce03d2039ece13c4360c10c4e92c164b" data-recommend-id="image://ce03d2039ece13c4360c10c4e92c164b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A sun rises over a mountain range.

That it shouldn’t be controlled by large corporations that are essentially IP bubbles, hoping you’ll come and, you know, look at their IP, and then maybe sometime in the future, these two companies, or 10 companies, will talk to each other, and you’ll have interoperability. I don’t get that. I don’t see that as a metaverse.”</p><p>The machine learning powering Melba will be the key to achieving this, which is why <em>Prologue</em> itself doesn’t need to be a great game to succeed. If it proves out the tech, it will still have been worth it. “We want to give you access to the API or to the code so if you want to build your own tools in a different way, you should be free to do that,” Greene said. “But at least at our layer, I want it very much like a holodeck  where you can tell it what you want and [Melba] generates it. Or you can easily draw a map on an in-game mini-map to draw the track for a motocross race you want, because you found a cool location in the world, and the game will do the rest. But that’s why I’m saying 10 to 15, years, because I think that level of tech and ease, it’s still some time off.”</p><p>For now, however, the focus is on Prologue. An Early Access rollout on Steam this year will begin building it into a more fully-fledged game, with new content and mechanics added along the way of the team responding to feedback, bugs, and balancing issues. A current river spawning issue can make it look like the seas parting for Moses on some maps, and one of the jackets players can currently find in the game is overpowered at the moment. But <em>Prologue</em>’s strict survival sim systems and austere presentation are likely to remain at its core. </p><p>“There was originally an idea I had of having a training mode where it sort of highlights all the objects, makes it more like a very basic training mode of ‘this is the world,’” Greene said. “We’ll see if we can add it during early access. But at the moment, I mean, my games are just, as I saw on Reddit, just ‘well fuck you get better,’ right? And I feel it should be continued in this game. It’s like, look, if you like it, great, otherwise, there’s 1,000s of other games out there.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

project. The Warhammer 40K sequel was developed by Saber St. Petersburg, which is one of several subsidiaries owned by the company. As for the IP that Saber will be adapting, that remains a mystery for now, as Hasbro owns multiple brands like Transformers, GI Joe, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Magic the Gathering, My Little Pony, and Peppa Pig.</p><p>This is also one of several video game projects in development, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-magic-the-gathering-and-dungeons-dragons-video-games-are-on-the-way/1100-6527911/">Invoke Studios is working on a new Dungeons &amp; Dragons game</a>, Atomic Arcade is handling a GI Joe spin-off starring Snake Eyes, and Austin-based studio Skeleton Key is working on a mystery project. A Transformers game would likely be a good fit for Saber, as this is one IP that fans of the franchise have been requesting to see more of.</p><p>While Transformers hasn't been dormant in the video game space, recent releases like Galactic Trials and Earthspark Expedition haven't quite managed to scratch the itch for Autobot action in the same way that games like War for Cybertron or Transformers: Devastation did when they were released back in the 2010s.</p><p>Sadly, one promising Transformers game, Transformers: Reactivate, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/transformers-reactivate-canceled/1100-6528693/">was canceled earlier this year</a> after having been in development at British studio Splash Damage.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-devs-hasbro-tentpole-ip</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/space-marine-2-devs-working-on-new-aaa-game-using-tentpole-hasbro-ip.1114551/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-devs-hasbro-tentpole-ip<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hasbro has announced that the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>development team is currently working on an AAA game based on one of the tabletop giant's "tentpole" IPs.</p>

<p>The news comes courtesy of an earnings call to mark Hasbro revealing its fourth-quarter financials earlier today (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/02/saber-interactive-developing-aaa-game-based-on-tentpole-hasbro-ip" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>). In that call, CEO Chris Cocks said the new game, which will be developed by&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>studio Saber, will combine "high-octane single-player action and amazing multiplayer".</p>

<p>Cocks went on to say that the game will utilize Saber's Swarm technology, presumably referring to the Swarm Engine on which&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>runs, alongside games like&nbsp;<em>SnowRunner&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>World War Z</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-marine-2-devs-hasbro-tentpole-ip-shooting.jpg?itok=-4Dr23Sw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-marine-2-devs-hasbro-tentpole-ip-shooting.jpg?itok=V0ZNWTKF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Space Marine 2</em>'s development studio will be working with Hasbro on one of the latter's "tentpole" IPs.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that the Swarm tech to which Cocks refers doesn't necessarily mean we'll be seeing the same kind of massive hordes of enemies present in both&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>World War Z</em>; it's the name for the engine, after all, rather than just that one feature.</p>

<p>As for which IP Cocks is referring to, Hasbro is naturally playing those cards very close to its chest, and I use those words advisedly.</p>

<p>IPs the company controls include&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-movie-is-coming-courtesy-of-hasbro-and-legendary-pictures" rel="nofollow">getting a Legendary Pictures-produced movie</a>, potentially making it a solid candidate for a new AAA video game.</p>

<p>Other potential IPs might include&nbsp;<em>Transformers</em>, although the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/transformers-reactivate-canceled-as-splash-damage-staff-at-risk-of-redundancy" rel="nofollow">cancellation of Splash Damage's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/transformers-reactivate-canceled-as-splash-damage-staff-at-risk-of-redundancy" rel="nofollow">Transformers: Reactivate</a>&nbsp;</em>might put a dent in that theory, as well as&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>,&nbsp;<em>Power Rangers</em>, and, uh,&nbsp;<em>Peppa Pig</em>. Yeah, it's probably that last one.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/power-rangers-ritas-rewind-hasbro-ip.jpg?itok=7s_77ECX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/power-rangers-ritas-rewind-hasbro-ip.jpg?itok=tyaykkAP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could a new AAA&nbsp;<em>Power Rangers&nbsp;</em>game be on the cards?</figcaption></figure><p>If Hasbro and Saber are working on a single-player&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>game, then it'll be in good company, slotting alongside the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-dnd-game-2026" rel="nofollow">live service multiplayer game</a> currently in the works at&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>studio Starbreeze.</p>

<p>Of course, if it is&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-related, Saber and Hasbro will have to make sure they don't repeat the mistakes of the genuinely awful&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance-delisted-february" rel="nofollow">being delisted next week</a>.</p>

<p>It is, however, probably safe to assume that we're not about to see a major AAA game based on&nbsp;<em>Monopoly&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Cluedo</em>, as sad as I am about that. It's also unlikely we'll hear anything more about this one for quite a while, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>Dune: Awakening is releasing for PC on May 20, 2025. Release date for PlayStation and Xbox will be revealed later.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-dune-awakening-pc-release-date-and-price-revealed">Dune: Awakening PC Release Date and Price Revealed </h2>



<p>Dune: Awakening developers revealed their PC release date today, along with details about the pricing and pre-order bonuses for the game. Once the pre-orders start, players can purchase the game for $49.99/€49.99. Pre-ordering Dune: Awakening on PC will also reward players the Terrarium of Muad’Dib, which is an in-base decoration that houses a desert mouse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from Dune: Awakening’s PC release date, the developers revealed that players can start their journey in Arrakis today, with the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">character creator and benchmark mode</a>. Players can download and try out the character creator right now by, where they can customise every aspect of their appearance, along with their home planet, caste and mentor. The benchmark mode will help test your PC performance before the game arrives.</p>



<p>Moreover, using the character creator and benchmark mode in Dune: Awakening will also provide another reward, a free key to unlock the Flameblade knife skin at launch. After their character creator shenanigans are over, players can import their character in the full game once Dune: Awakening releases on March 20.&nbsp;</p>

The already creatures look bigger and badder than ever before, for one thing. This is only the beginning as Capcom has already surprised players by revealing some of Wilds’ forthcoming content via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-roadmap-mizutsune-dlc-update-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap and DLC plans</a>.</p>



<p>Before we get close to this point, we need Monster Hunter Wilds preloaded. Let’s check its file size on different platforms and assist you with this—you’re on your own with monsters though!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-preload-monster-hunter-wilds">How to Preload Monster Hunter Wilds</h2>

<p><strong>You need to pre-purchase any edition of Monster Hunter Wilds, wait until two days before launch, click to download Monster Hunter Wilds, and it should be ready for release.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> preload process is straightforward enough. But if you’ve never done this before or need a little reminder, we’ve got you covered:</p>



<ol>
<li>Choose which platform you want to play Monster Hunter Wilds on.</li>



<li>Go to the storefront and search for <strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong>.</li>



<li>Select one of its several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-editions-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">editions</a>.</li>



<li>Complete your purchase to secure exclusive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-monster-hunter-wilds-pre-order-bonuses-how-to-pre-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order bonuses</a>.</li>

</ol>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1886931557304144111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter Wilds X page</a> has said accurate start times are coming. At the very least, you know you have up to 48 hours before launch to prepare and preload Monster Hunter Wilds to get it installed.</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-file-size-explained">Monster Hunter Wilds File Size Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds is 52.826 GB on PS5, requires at least 75 GB on PC, and Microsoft still hasn’t made it clear how much memory is required on Xbox.</strong></p>



<p>You can read more about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-file-size-how-many-gb-is-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wilds’ file sizes with our handy guide</a>, but this should give you a good idea of what’s required. </p>



<p>The Xbox page has been devoid of accurate memory information for a while now. I can’t imagine it being more than 75 GB, so expect it to be somewhere between the PS5 and PC file size.</p>



<hr>



<p>Will you be jumping on the Monster Hunter Wilds train early? Are the file size requirements quite general compared to many other modern-day sizes?</p>



<p>Even though we don’t have the Xbox file size, we have the latest on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-monster-hunter-wilds-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds appearing on Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> fans concerned about the game's future under new ownership have launched a campaign highlighting the need to protect the app and its community from the addition of predatory monetisation practices.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, a Bloomberg report stated that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-developer-close-to-selling-games-for-35bn-to-saudi-owned-monopoly-go-maker-report">Pokémon Go developer Niantic was looking to sell its gaming portfolio to Scopely</a>, the Saudi-backed mobile publisher behind Monopoly Go.
</p>
<p>
The news sent shockwaves through Pokémon Go's community, and generated fears that the move would be a profoundly negative one for the game's long-term future and its players.
</p>
<p>
Why? Well, while criticising Pokémon Go developer Niantic is a common past-time for many of the game's fans, it didn't take long for players of other Scopely games to sound the alarm that things were likely to get a whole lot worse. 
</p>
<p>
"For those unfamiliar, Scopely is known for games like Marvel Strike Force and Star Trek Fleet Command," reads a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1itre34/write_to_the_pok%C3%A9mon_company_if_youre_concerned/">thread by user Tetrylene on top Pokémon Go fan reddit TheSilphRoad</a>. "Many from those communities have voiced concerns over the overtly aggressive monetisation tactics, including paywalls and pay-to-win mechanics. I know this potential shift personally fills me with dread."
</p>
<p>
"Oh... dear..." wrote Pokémon Go fan misskass, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1ist4dr/pok%C3%A9mon_go_maker_nears_35_billion_deal_to_sell/?sort=confidence">responding to the initial report that Niantic's games were up for sale</a>. "I play another Scopely game (Marvel Strike Force) and the quality is declining year after year. Pokemon Go is effectively free to play, but Strike Force is powerfully pay to win. Like, no access to any of the top characters for 6+ months after they release kind of pay to win. And then when you can access them, they're instantly powercrept."
</p>
<p>
Another fan pointed back to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelStrikeForce/comments/esoh5m/looney_ambassador_moderator_from_scopely_here/?share_id=0T1s0bOj8yB2SnjeE5sbS">post on the Marvel Strike Force reddit</a> from five years ago, similarly warning fans of that game what Scopely would likely change based on how it had previously taken on Looney Tunes: World of Mayhem and tightened the screws of monetisation.
</p>
<p>
"Was coming here to say the exact same thing," agreed reddit user Todd999430. "I played Marvel Strike Force prior to Scopely acquiring the game and then a year or two afterwards. Marvel Strike Force went from a game for light spenders to compete to 'unless you're dropping $500 a month, you can't be in a top alliance'."
</p>
<p>
For Pokémon Go players, many of whom play the game as part of real-world communities made up of friends and acquaintances met over the past nine years, the idea of the game's ownership changing is real concern.
</p>
<p>
"Beyond being the only real game I play anymore, it serves as a major conduit for me and my friends socially to connect and meet-up over," Tetrylene's post continues. "I run a local group with them, and the idea of the group eventually dwindling as people are alienated (instead of slowly and gradually growing as is now) is genuinely bleak to think about. 
</p>
<p>
"I'm sure it's the same for many of you here - the game is a big reason a lot of us have been motivated to exercise, make friends and explore new places. I know I don't want to lose that to a faceless group of investment fund board members."
</p>
<p>
In response, the Pokémon Go community is being encouraged to make its feelings known to The Pokémon Company - the franchise's overall owner, who will undoubtedly have an opinion on which company takes on the still lucrative and high-profile game.
</p>
<p>
"The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> and old school <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/runescape">RuneScape</a> communities have shown several times that it's worth kicking up fuss about negative changes. Those communities have managed to redirect the course of their respective games on several occasions," Tetrylene continued.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, trying to exert some influence on such large-scale business deals between entities like these might seem daunting, but we have to try. Bad press / user complaints will at least be a factor of consideration, however small, it will surely be noted in discussions. If nothing else, it might make TPC more cautious and tighten the reigns of a new representative of their carefully managed brand."
</p>
<p>
Tetrylene's thread encourages Pokémon Go players to <a href="https://support.pokemon.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=17787426192916">message The Pokémon Company</a> to express the need to preserve the game's integrity without additional monetisation features, highlight the community-driven nature of the game, and flag the potential damage to The Pokémon Company's own brand should Scopely be allowed to do to the game what it has already done to others.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted The Pokémon Company for comment on the potential sale, but did not receive a response. A Niantic spokesperson declined comment.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/vanya-national-theatre-scott<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I am, I guess, middle-aged, which is a bit hard to define when you’re queer and single, or in the absence of the milestones that are supposed to mark this time of my life. I feel pretty good about getting older, but I do sometimes have middle-aged thoughts: Have I done the right things with my life? How likely are the things I still want to do? Am I as happy as I could be; am I less happy than I was in the past? Will I be happy in the future, a question both about whether the future will have happiness-creating circumstances and if I have the appropriate capacity for happiness left inside me.</p><p>It’s hard to feel hopeful about the future these days, even though I’m <a href="https://aftermath.site/kennedy-center-nea-trans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">far</a> from giving in to despair. At the protests I’ve been to in recent weeks, the idea of “trans joy” often gets brought up as vital, without much defining of what “joy” is. Is “joy” now something different than it was before 2016, or 2020, or 2024? Is it waking up every day proudly trans despite a government that wants me dead? Is it that I can write the things I want despite a <a href="https://aftermath.site/games-media-journalism-layoffs-gamurs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crumbling industry</a>? Have “simple” things like this become radical acts, and is that a meaningful life lesson about gratitude and change and satisfaction? Or is it a sign of how shortened our horizons are becoming, that “still trans” and “not being humiliated by private equity goons” are now major achievements? Are things going to be this bad, or worse, forever?&nbsp;</p><p>One good thing about being middle-aged is that I’m regularly reminded that I’m not the first person to have any thought or feeling, even if it’s my first time having it. I was reminded of this last night while watching <em>Vanya</em>, a one-man adaptation of Chekhov’s <em>Uncle Vanya</em> by Simon Stephens and starring Andrew Scott of <em>Sherlock </em>and <em>Ripley</em> fame. After running in London, the play is coming to <a href="https://vanyaonstage.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York</a> in March; I was excited about this until I learned that tickets cost over $300. But for a much more reasonable $12 I could watch the show through the <a href="https://www.ntathome.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Theatre’s subscription program</a>, something I’ve been meaning to do for a while but which the absurd price of the in-person tickets finally got me to bite the bullet on.</p><p><em>Uncle Vanya</em> is about a group of people obsessed with age and happiness and whether life has passed them by and why. <em>Vanya</em> sticks to the plot of Chekhov’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Vanya" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1897</a> play, though it modernizes the language and anglicizes the names. The play takes place on a country estate that once belonged to titular character Ivan’s sister Anna, who died. Now, Ivan and his niece Sonya care for the estate to support Anna’s elderly widower Alexander, here a washed-up filmmaker, who has married a much younger second wife, Helena. Ivan is attracted to Helena, as is the country doctor Michael, whom Sonya has long had a crush on. Things come to a head when Alexander declares that he wants to sell the estate and live off the proceeds, threatening to upend the miserable routines everyone’s been trapped in since Anna’s death.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Vanya | Exclusive Clip | National Theatre Live" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5QseI_vdq7s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Everyone in <em>Vanya</em> loves each other, and hates each other, and longs for change, and will do anything to keep staying stuck. Everyone is so anxious about their own happiness and curious about the happiness of others, but only insofar as how that possible happiness might reflect on their own happiness or lack thereof. Frustrated ambition is everywhere: Ivan worships Alexander’s films, despite the fact that he hasn’t made any in nearly two decades, and he also blames Alexander’s success for his own miserly life, feeling like he could have been great if only he hadn’t had to spend his life tending to the estate. Sonya has never told Michael her true feelings; when she makes the overture of a confession, Michael can barely tell what she’s talking about. Michael himself waxes lyrical about his hobby of planting trees to stave off the environmental degradation of the countryside, but the only version of him we see is one who drinks too much and constantly threatens to leave but never seems to. Everyone picks constantly at what it means to be happy, or to be talented, or to be interesting or fulfilled or old or young or pretty or plain, needing someone else to be or not be those things to justify why they are or aren’t those things. Everyone is tremendously complicated, but also so painfully simple, so earnestly full of longing for the love and fulfillment that they think they deserve but can’t have.</p><p>But “everyone” here is just Andrew Scott, who plays all the characters. It’s frankly astonishing to watch him: for a play that feels so deeply concerned with decrepitude and aging, he is inspiringly vital and alive in the roles. It’s never hard to tell who’s talking; characters are sometimes differentiated by a prop like a tennis ball or sunglasses, by playing with a necklace or twisting a dish towel, but they’re just as often portrayed by the slightest change of voice or widening of the eyes. (As jealous as I am of anyone who can afford to see the show live, the filmed version is able to focus on these subtle gestures and facial expressions in a way that would be lost in a theater.) It’s incredible that it’s never goofy to watch Scott have a conversation or fight with himself; at several points he portrays one character holding another back, or sharing an illicit kiss, and it somehow works perfectly even though it absolutely shouldn’t.&nbsp;</p><p>I was intrigued by the idea of the show, but I never quite got why it had to be a one-person cast. Especially with a major star at the helm, it could easily be a vanity project, or the kind of <a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-hamlet-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">twist</a> a revival shoehorns in to justify itself. But here, the solo cast amplifies the way <em>Vanya</em>’s characters are both obsessed with and ignorant of each other’s internal lives, how it feels like they’re fighting over the world’s limited amount of happiness like a game of capture the flag. You could read it, maybe, as a metaphor for our country these days, one body being torn apart by competing desires, the arm blaming the leg for why it can’t reach what it wants. You could see it, as I did in this viewing, as a symbol of how hard it is to follow our desires when we can want so many things, of not becoming bitter over our own choices, of seeing all our possibilities. Real circumstances do conspire against the play’s characters–the nature of peasant life in Chekhov’s Russia, poverty and tragedy–but they have more agency than they think, if only they’d get out of their own ways.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Vanya | 'No light in the trees' | National Theatre at Home" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Vm1hiBroG4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>After Alexander brings up the idea of selling the estate, Ivan tries to shoot him; to his own amazement, he misses, twice. It’s a great bit of theatrical structure that this isn’t the end of the play; there’s another act, where everyone decides to pretend nothing happened, and Alexander and Helena go back to the city, and Ivan and Sonya get back to their work on the estate. Things could, and should, have changed, but nothing does. Near the end, Vanya gives a monologue:</p><blockquote><p>Could you imagine if it was possible to completely change the way you live your life? To look at your life and ask yourself what you would do if it had ended? Your old life, it’s over. And then take what’s left of your real life and live it properly. How do I do that? Where do I start?</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Through Scott as all the characters, asking himself this question, it’s a sad one–if caring for the estate has held him back all these years, he could have let Alexander sell it–but it’s also a reminder that it <em>is</em> possible, at any time, to overcome at least some of the barriers we put in our own ways. I can grudgingly get why <em>Vanya</em> is worth all that money to see, but it was a delight to get to see it for much less due to <a href="https://playbill.com/article/national-theatre-at-home-launches-on-demand-streaming-platform-with-coriolanus-medea-amadeus-more" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">innovations in arts access that came out of covid</a> and somehow still persist. (My list of other plays to watch with my subscription is now very long.) These days, I’ll take my joys where I can get them.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/you-are-error-podcast-twitch-stream-big-book"><h3>Contrary To Popular Belief, Streaming On Twitch Is Work</h3></a><p>"Streaming is more enjoyable in some ways, but work is work no matter what the job is that you’re doing"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gamestop-stonks-shares-closures-store"><h3>GameStop Is A Very 21st Century Company</h3></a><p>And also has the most predictable trajectory</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>An open beta for Steel Hunters, Wargaming’s new multiplayer mech game, is now live on Steam as part of a broader Steam Publisher Weekend for the World of Tanks company.</p>
<p>The Steel Hunters beta is live now and through the weekend, from 20th February until 24th February, with a little competition to find the top players each day and prizes to be won.</p>


<p>Through the weekend, the top 10 players on the daily leaderboard will have a chance to win Steam gift cards and exclusive physical merchandise. All players will be able to compete and unlock a Trenchwalker skin that will carry through to the full game.</p>
<p><iframe title="STEEL HUNTERS - GAMEPLAY REVEAL" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tMtdbfsXiY0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Steel Hunters was announced at the end of last year, a sci-fi break away from Wargaming’s bread and butter historical warfare games. This is a PvPvE game in which six teams of two Hunters drop down to the planet at the start of a match, stomping around in their imposing mechs, doing battle with the drones that patrol the contaminated world, looking to collect enough Starfall resources, and then get out while battling other human players.</p>

<p>There’s seven Hunters to choose from, including the all-rounder Razorside, quadruped&nbsp;Ursus and Fenris, sniper Heartbreaker, combat medic Trenchwalker, and drone-summoning Prophet.</p>
<p>Catch <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/steel-hunters-combines-mech-warfare-and-extraction-in-wargamings-latest/">our preview from December here</a>, or just jump into the game’s open beta to try it out for yourself.</p>

			<p>The PC version of Grand Theft Auto V is getting a free upgrade on PC in a few days that will introduce, among other things, ray-traced global illumination and ambient occlusion and support for NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR.</p>
<p>The new update, which will go live on March 4th, will bring all the latest improvements introduced on consoles, including a range of new vehicles and upgrades at Hao's Special Works, Premium Test Rides, HSW Races, and HSW Time Trails, Ambient Animals that can be photographed to participate in the daily Wildlife Photography Challenge, the ability to obtain special benefits for GTA Online via a GTA+ Membership, a renewed Landing Page, a free GTA$4,000,000 and a few more additional items to get started in GTA Online and more.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, the biggest improvements the Grand Theft Auto V March 4th upgrade will bring are new technical enhancements, such as the PC-exclusive ray-traced global illumination and ambient occlusion, plus the ray-traced shadows and reflections also available on current generation consoles, NVIDIA DLSS 3, AMD FSR 1 and 3 support, faster loading times using an SSD with DirectStorage, DualSense controller support, and enhanced audio. Following the launch of the update, however, Rockstar Games will continue to support the previous version of the game, allowing those with hardware that does not meet the new minimum requirements to keep playing. The updated requirements can be found below.</p>

<p>Lots of recent features added to&nbsp;<em>GTA 5&nbsp;</em>on consoles, like kernel-level anti-cheat for&nbsp;<em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>and "proactive voice chat moderation", will also be available for the PC version, as well as a number of technical enhancements.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dune: Awakening Brings Open-World Survival to Arrakis in May]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dune-awakening-brings-open-world-survival-to-arrakis-in-may.1114491/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Funcom has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>release date, and if you're eager to begin your journey of survival on the desert world of Arrakis, then you can get stuck into the character creation tool right now.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>launches on PC on May 20th. Unfortunately, it won't be landing on consoles at the same time; Funcom says a PS5 and Xbox Series X|S release date for&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>has yet to be revealed.</p>

<p>As a sweetener, however, you can try out the game's character creation tool right now. It also comes complete with a benchmark tool, so you can check whether your PC is beefy enough to run the game in the first place.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dune-awakening-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=1B-mbdvd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dune-awakening-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=fFNP_ldX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>officially lands on PC in May.</figcaption></figure><p>When it launches,&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>will set you back $49.99 or your regional equivalent. Pre-orders aren't live just yet, but when they do go live, pre-ordering the game will net you the Terrarium of Muad'Dib, which you can use to decorate your base with an adorable little desert mouse.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you check out the character creator and benchmark tool for&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>ahead of launch, you'll get a Frameblade knife skin that you'll be able to redeem once you pick up the full game. Of course, you can transfer your created character into&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>when it launches.</p>

<p>Using the tool, you can not only make your character, but also decide which caste, home planet, and mentor you want. Which mentor you pick will determine your starting abilities, but you'll be able to mix and match as well, so you can be a Swordmaster with some Bene Gesserit abilities if you want.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>, it's an open-world survival game with an emphasis on multiplayer. The game takes place on the desert planet of Arrakis and sees you "embark[ing] on a journey from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-reveals-spectacular-gameplay-and-details" rel="nofollow">scavenging and survival to controlling the planet itself</a>".</p>




<p>Funcom says&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>will be perfect for both fans of Frank Herbert's original&nbsp;<em>Dune&nbsp;</em>novels and those who've never picked up one of the books or watched one of the movies.</p>

<p><em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> on May 20th. You can check out our hands-off preview of the game from back in March last year <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dune-awakening-preview-pax-east-2024" rel="nofollow">right here</a>.</p>
