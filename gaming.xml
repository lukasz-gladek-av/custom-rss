		<p>Sony has formed a brand new first party studio to develop new PlayStation games, with this new studio called Dark Outlaw Games. The studio is being headed by Jason Blundell, who spent much of his career at Activision working on Call of Duty games from Call of Duty 3 to Black Ops 4 moving up to game director in the process. Blundell left Treyarch in 2020, formed Deviation Games in 2021, left Deviation Games in 2022, with the studio shuttering in 2024.</p>
<p>In an interview with Jeff Gertsmann, Jason said,<em> “It’s such a privilege to be able to do it with Sony as a new first-party studio. Sony doesn’t set up first-party studios all the time. To have that privilege is humbling, it’s really nice. I’m really excited.”</em></p>


<p>Dark Outlaw Games has been working on a new project, but no details have been released about what that game is going to be. With Jason Blundell’s vast experience with Call of Duty, it would not be surprising if this would be a first person shooter or some kind of action game. We will have to see what the game is when Sony and Dark Outlaw Games are ready to reveal details. There is no release window that we can even begin to guess for when this game will be coming out.</p>

Tarkir: Dragonstorm returns to Magic’s own plane of Tarkir, and we’ve got an exclusive first look at a five cards that I expect we’ll be seeing a lot of at the draft table next month. (The expansion is <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGGk3W?object_uuid=b7479dde-baec-43cd-99b5-321a9dfc140a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">available to preorder</a> now on Amazon).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Flip through the gallery below to see all five cards</strong>, and read on for a word from Wizards of the Coast about their design and the set as a whole.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering - 5 New Cards from Tarkir: Dragonstorm</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These five cards are what’s referred to as a “cycle,” with all of them sharing some common design ground spread across each of Magic’s colors. In this case, all five are cheap, common-rarity creatures with an ability tied to one of Tarkir’s three-color clans, and another that allows you to turn mana into a color from that clan. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Three-color limited environments need quite a bit of mana fixing, at all rarities” explains Wizards of the Coast Senior Game Designer Adam Prosak. “We wanted lots of decks to be able to access mana fixing, so we created quite a few designs dedicated to helping solve mana issues. In particular, these creatures allow you to play to the board while developing your mana at the same time - many other designs (such as tapped lands) only make mana and you tend to fall behind in order to fix your mana.”</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Preorder MTG Tarkir: Dragonstorm Cards</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Senior Worldbuilding Designer Lauren Bond says that while that mechanical side came first with this particular cycle, the team often relies on common cards as a place to showcase the world of a set - in this case, how these clans are different from the last time players saw them. “The passionate action-oriented monks of the Jeskai, the Whispers using Temur magic, Nagas in the Sultai as protectors (and avengers) of the jungle, Mardu military prowess including supporting roles (and that dragons can come in many shapes and sizes!), and Abzan clerics regrowing the lost kin trees.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One criticism of some recent Magic sets has been an overreliance on tropes or thematic gimmicks, even while revisiting previous planes, which makes Dragonstorm standout in its comparatively straightforward return to Tarkir. Senior Worldbuilding Art Director Forrest Schehl says that feedback like that is important to WOTC, but that “top-level pitch for Tarkir was established well before the release of Murders at Karlov Manor” and the sets that followed, and didn’t change after them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We wanted to combine Dragons and Clans in a way that hadn’t been seen on Tarkir in the same set and the Dragonstorms that were a defining feature of the plane were going to play a big role in shaping how we approached this ‘return-to’. The pressure to get it right was something Lauren and I felt from day one, we always wanted to build the next chapter of this beloved plane with authenticity and substance.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-tarkir-dragonstorm-where-to-buy"><u>Tarkir: Dragonstorm is up for preorder now</u></a>, with the set scheduled for release in both paper and digitally on April 11 and in-store prerelease events kicking off on April 4. Read on for the full interview with Wizards of the Coast’s Adam Prosak, Lauren Bond, and Forrest Schehl:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/18/tarkir-3-1742273567820.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: This card cycle seems laser targeted at being much-needed glue for Limited - what were the goals these cards needed to achieve?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Adam Prosak, Senior Game Designer: </strong>Three-color limited environments need quite a bit of mana fixing, at all rarities. We wanted lots of decks to be able to access mana fixing, so we created quite a few designs dedicated to helping solve mana issues. In particular, these creatures allow you to play to the board while developing your mana at the same time - many other designs (such as tapped lands) only make mana and you tend to fall behind in order to fix your mana.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>They also strike me as “lore glue,” if you will, with each providing some insight into their clans. Was that an explicit part of their role in the set?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Lauren Bond, Senior Worldbuilding Designer: </strong>While the mechanics of these cards came first, as worldbuilders we often look to common cards (especially cycles) as a place to showcase key elements of setting as players will see them frequently in drafts. This cycle being anchored in the “returning color” of each clan was an opportunity to show how that color manifests in the new version of the clan. The passionate action-oriented monks of the Jeskai, the Whispers using Temur magic, Nagas in the Sultai as protectors (and avengers) of the jungle, Mardu military prowess including supporting roles (and that dragons can come in many shapes and sizes!), and Abzan clerics regrowing the lost kin trees. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Three-color sets aren’t made very often, can you talk about some of the challenges of doing them and how you tried to address those in Dragonstorm?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>AP:</strong> By their nature, three-color cards go into fewer decks than their monocolor (or two color) counterparts. They are often exciting, as long as they aren’t overdone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Building a sealed/draft environment is the biggest challenge – most constructed formats easily allow for three colors, so it’s not too challenging for three color cards to find a home. On the other hand, we have to provide enough mana fixing to allow players to play their three color cards, without making it so plentiful that there every deck can play all five colors easily.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/18/tarkir-1-1742273567820.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>This will be the first time since 2023's Lost Caverns of Ixalan that a Standard set has returned to an existing plane without some sort of thematic twist like Aetherdrift or Murders at Karlov Manor, and the rest of 2025’s line-up means it will be the last time a set does so for roughly another year after that at least. With that in mind, is there an added pressure here to do justice to what fans are expecting of both Tarkir and a “classic” Magic setting in general? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Forrest Schehl, Senior Worldbuilding Art Director: </strong>Fan feedback is super important to us and is something we take into consideration during early development of every new set we make. That being said, the top-level pitch for Tarkir was established well before the release of Murders at Karlov Manor and remained the same throughout development. We wanted to combine Dragons and Clans in a way that hadn’t been seen on Tarkir in the same set and the Dragonstorms that were a defining feature of the plane were going to play a big role in shaping how we approached this “return-to”. The pressure to get it right was something Lauren and I felt from day one, we always wanted to build the next chapter of this beloved plane with authenticity and substance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Lastly, while it’s one that was previously revealed, I have to ask about </strong><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdm/123/stormscale-scion" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>Stormscale Scion</strong></u></a><strong> - a card that is mocking the </strong><a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/making-magic/storm-scale-throne-of-eldraine-through-strixhaven-part-1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>Storm Scale</strong></u></a><strong> itself! People have had a lot of fun talking about this card and the unexpected return of Storm to Standard, was that a hard decision to make? Is there a bit of an enticing challenge to returning to “risky” mechanics like that, Affinity, or Phyrexian Mana in recent years? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>AP:</strong> I find that making new cards for existing mechanics is often easier than making new mechanics. With existing mechanics, we are able to learn some lessons about what worked well and what pitfalls to avoid. With the Stormscale Scion, we found that the card is fun and powerful even with a few copies, so we leaned into that rather than some of the other storm cards that win you the game, but only if you’ve cast lots of spells.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomrmarks.bsky.social" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Executive Reviews Editor.

                <p>Anyone who has played an online game has probably encountered a bot at some point that may have negatively impacted their gaming experience. To help address gaming's bot problem, Razer and OpenAI founder Sam Altman's company World have <a href="https://press.razer.com/company-news/razer-and-world-team-up-to-combat-third-party-bots-in-online-games-in-the-age-of-ai-gaming/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">teamed up</a> to create what's called "Razer ID verified by World AI."</p><p>It's a new single sign-on (SSO) proof-of-human system that verifies if a player is a human or a bot. If it all goes to plan, it will create a situation where anyone using a Razer ID account will be verified as a human, which could in turn help bolster "trust and security in the digital space," Razer said.</p><p>"Fair play starts with real players, and Razer ID's ability to integrate into games to enable 'human-only' gameplay modes is key to fostering fair competition and a more trusted gaming environment," the company stated.</p><p>Numerous games are negatively impacted by bots, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2-hit-with-thousands-of-negative-steam-reviews-protesting-bot-issues/1100-6523926/" data-ref-id="1100-6523926">including Team Fortress 2</a>. Steps have been taken to address the issues, but on some level, the problems persist in that game and others. </p><p>Players need a verified <a href="https://world.org/faqs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">World ID account</a> for all of this, and that involves scanning their passport or visiting an <a href="https://world.org/find-orb" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Orb location in the real world</a> to have your faced scanned to create a unique iris code.</p><p>The SSO will come to life first in the futuristic blockchain video game Tokyo Beast.

                <p>Baldur's Gate 3 was a colossal hit for Larian Studios, but with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-isnt-making-baldurs-gate-4-next-thats-not-what-we-were-made-for/1100-6522049/" data-ref-id="1100-6522049">Larian walking away from the franchise</a>, toy juggernaut Hasbro is picking up the sword and shield and journeying on. Hasbro, which also owns all things Dungeons and Dragons, announced recently that the future of Baldur's Gate will be announced fairly soon, but not even a hint of what's to come.</p><p>Talking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/well-hear-more-about-baldurs-gates-future-in-pretty-short-order-hasbro-svp-of-games-says" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Hasbro digital games SVP Dan Ayoub confirmed during this week's Game Developers Conference that there are plans for Baldur's Gate and that there's a lot of interest in the potential of the franchise.</p><p>"We're kind of working out our plans for the future and what we're going to be doing with that. And actually, in pretty short order, we're going to have some stuff to talk about around that," he said. Making sure games like Baldur's Gate remain relevant aligns with what Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-magic-the-gathering-and-dungeons-dragons-video-games-are-on-the-way/1100-6527911/" data-ref-id="1100-6527911">back in November</a> of last year.</p><p>At the time, Cocks stated that there will be more Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons and Dragons video games on the way. Could this also mean Baldur's Gate 4 included in the grand scheme of things? Ayoub certainly feels that it's inevitable, but nothing is in the works yet.</p><p>"It's somewhat of an unenviable position," he continued. "I mean, we're not in a hurry. Right? That's the thing, we're going to take a very measured approach. We've got a lot of plans, a lot of different ways to go about it. We're starting to think about, okay, yeah, we're ready to start dipping toes a little bit and talking about a few things. And I think, in really short order, like I said, again, not to over-tease that point, we're going to have some other things to talk about around that."</p><p>The final patch for Baldur's Gate 3 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-is-now-live-will-test-cross-play-and-split-screen-co-op/1100-6529081/" data-ref-id="1100-6529081">arrived in January</a> and included--finally--cross-play and 12 new subclasses. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/631744/assassins-creed-shadows-review-ubisoft<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>brings the franchise to the shores of Japan. After almost 20 years and 13 mainline games, <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> — the series about using flashy gadgets and techniques to murder your enemies undetected — has finally been set in a place famous for assassins who use flashy gadgets and techniques to murder their enemies undetected. I don’t know why Ubisoft waited so long. But I do know Ubisoft is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312584/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-refunds">in</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283677/ubisoft-nft-game-champions-tactics-grimoria-chronicles-sequence">dire</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24314843/keepin-it-all-in-the-family">need</a> of a hit, and <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is poised to be one.</p><p>Ubisoft isn’t out to reinvent the formula with <em>Shadows</em>. In fact, there’s nothing mechanically (or even narratively) that separates this game from its predecessor, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23906187/assassins-creed-mirage-review-ubisoft"><em>Assassin’s Creed</em> <em>Mirage</em></a>. It’s just moved the game to a new location, with new characters and storylines. The strength of the game comes from whether Ubisoft can make those things pop.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24155451/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-trailer-ubisoft"><em>Shadows</em> revives the dual protagonist system</a> introduced with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/23/9602584/assassins-creed-syndicate-review"><em>Assassin’s Creed Syndicate</em></a>. To start the game, you play as Naoe, a young woman from Iga, a province of medieval Japan known for its shinobi. After her village is destroyed and her father is murdered, Naoe swears revenge on the shadowy cabal of masked individuals responsible. Her quest for vengeance brings her into contact with Yasuke, a former enslaved man searching for his place in life as a samurai in the service of Japan’s premier warlord of the time, Oda Nobunaga. </p><p>After about the first 10 hours of the game, which are focused on Naoe, players are allowed to swap freely between Naoe and Yasuke and their wildly different styles of gameplay. Naoe is the stealth character; she’s quick and light on her feet, able to scale buildings with the use of her grappling hook and assassinate her enemies from the shadows (heh) with her hidden blade. Yasuke is the bruiser, able to take a beating and dish one out in turn with massive heavy weapons like the naginata, long katana, and musket-style firearms known as teppo.</p><p>Ubisoft did a good job of tuning both character’s skills and abilities such that both have elements that make them appealing to play. I really liked how Yasuke and Naoe, in addition to being engaging characters with narratives I enjoyed watching develop, are suited for specific jobs and my moment-to-moment moods. If I’m short on patience or I know I’m going up against elite enemies with chunky health bars, I’ll barrel them over with Yasuke, teppo blazing. But if I don’t feel like knock-down, drag-out fights or I’m after a tasty bit of treasure well guarded by a swarm of enemies, that’s a job for Naoe, who can get in and out without rousing any alarm.</p><p>But just because Yasuke and Naoe have their own strengths doesn’t mean they can’t play to their weaknesses. It was just as satisfying, if not more so, to make the burly Yasuke pop out of a bush to stealthily stab a guy (although, with him, it’s less of a light stab and more like an impalement) or have Naoe hold her own against the tough bosses. I had a very hearty laugh when I made Yasuke do his first leap of faith, a well-known <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> staple that has characters trust-fall from high-up observation points into bales of hay or other soft landings.</p><p>For both characters, combat is a simple, standard affair, wherein players can string together light or heavy attacks interspersed with special abilities specific to their character or weapon. In particular, I was surprised by how brutal Yasuke’s combat was. In trying out the naginata for the first time, I was shocked by the violence of his finisher that has him stomp on his enemy’s head, as though running him through the chest the moment before wasn’t enough to get the job done. It was a level of goriness I associate more with <em>Mortal Kombat</em> than <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>. </p><p>There was another jarring moment very early in the game that highlighted the tension between <em>Shadows</em> as a product designed to make money and an artistic endeavor. Within seconds of starting the game, it presented a gallery of assassins from previous titles. I thought each entry would play a cutscene that would summarize the game’s story. Instead, selecting any of the entries kicked me out of <em>Shadows</em> and into the PlayStation Store, where I was prompted to buy the game I wanted to learn about. (Ostensibly, if you own the game, selecting its entry would launch it.) I thought it was a bad omen, setting the tone for a game stuffed with the kind of nickel-and-dime live-service bullshit that Ubisoft is known for.</p><p>But with <em>Shadows</em>, I finally <em>get</em> the franchise. I’ve never liked open-world games. With few exceptions, I find them tedious and overwhelming, especially Ubisoft’s particular flavor of them that are littered with side quests and activities that are little more than busywork. <em>Shadows</em> is similarly constructed. It’s the same kind of gameplay in the same kind of open world — with a map so cluttered with <em>things </em>that looking at it made me anxious.</p><p>Yet, I didn’t mind any of that. Partly, it’s the narrative: I find Yasuke and Naoe’s banter to be sweet and funny, and their story of learning to work together makes for a perfectly fine <em>Odd Couple</em>-style narrative. But even that’s not enough. It’s the world. </p><p>As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/20/17033024/assassins-creed-origins-discovery-tour-educational-mode-release">with previous <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games</a>, Ubisoft has invested time into recreating this era of Japan with exacting detail. Locations are rendered from their real-life counterparts and given codex entries that delve into their stories with a historian’s level of specificity. Quests that touch on cultural elements, such as the tea ceremony, are similarly reconstructed with the same level of gravity. The locations and events are not treated as mere set dressing, but as living, breathing entities invested with the same weight and respect as they are in real life. When you encounter the first torii gate, the game warns you to respect what the structure represents by not climbing all over it, and it feels good honoring that request. That level of care is why, 35 hours in, I haven’t grown tired of what is, on pixel, unforgivable tedium. </p><p>I enjoyed traversing the way-too-big map, finding all the little activities I could get into while on my way to the bigger story quests. I was thrilled every time the seasons changed and I got to see the land transform. Every bit of scenery is rendered with such detail that I felt transported to an era of Japan that, despite being covered to death in media, nevertheless remains endlessly fascinating. I was enthralled by the game’s deep and detailed codex that covered everything from the history of the era and its notable figures to the minutia of daily life as a Japanese peasant. Sure, popping out and killing ninjas is great, and I’m genuinely interested in how Yasuke and Naoe achieve their goals. But more than anything, I wanna visit the top of Mount Hiei and learn about the warrior monks of its Enryakuji Temple. We all watched <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24138469/shogun-finale-review-war-toranaga-explained-episode"><em>Shōgun</em></a> deservedly <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/shogun-wins-best-television-series-drama-2025-golden-globes-1235225689/">carry away all the awards</a>. Playing <em>Shadows</em> felt like experiencing that show all over again. </p><p><sub><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>launches on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on March 20th.</sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rise-of-the-ronin">Rise of the Ronin</a> is just not having a very good time on PC. The game only launched on Steam just last week, where it was quickly discovered that, oh dear, there are a lot of issues. Just a quick look at the game's reviews will let you in on its myriad of problems, but one of the biggest ones that's cropped up is an issue where <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1340990/discussions/0/828204828240984227/">save files are being completely wiped</a>, obviously quite an annoying bug especially if you've put a lot of time into the game.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Yesterday, developer Koei Tecmo shared an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1340990/announcements/detail/616535451664123019">update post on Steam</a> noting that they are aware of the reported save data bug, and that they're "looking into" what's causing the problem. That's all well and good, but they did at least offer a couple of potential temporary solutions to the problem. In one part it could be down to your computer's documents folder being set to file sharing. Turning it off might help, but Koei doesn't guarantee anything. There's also a support page that has more specific details on this particular fix you can check out <a href="https://support.koeitecmo.info/hc/en-us/articles/23580170503193--Steam-Cannot-save-load">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Steam post also includes a way to retrieve your save data by heading to a specific folder on your computer, where you can rename the BACKUP.BIN file to SAVEDATA.BIN to hopefully get it back, but I'll let you read the post rather than explain here and have you complaining at me in the comments that I broke your computer somehow.
</p>
<p>
Steam's Cloud save function might also be able to restore your save, but Koei Tecmo notes that if you're asked which save file to keep, you should rename your local save data and store it somewhere else before using the Cloud data.
</p>
<p>
A proper patch for all of Rise of the Ronin's issues <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1340990/view/507322442554803882">was promised when it launched on PC last week</a>, which is supposedly coming "soon", though it might still be worth holding off on jumping back in until that update arrives.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-assassins-creed-shadows-character-naoe-yasuke/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/which-character-is-best-in-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-yasuke-vs-naoe.1138143/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-assassins-creed-shadows-character-naoe-yasuke/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows offers a dual-protagonist system that presents the player with freedom of choice. Do you want to be the heavy-set warrior, Yasuke, or do you want to be the lithe and agile shinboi, Naoe? Both characters have unique abilities and loadouts, but which of them can be considered <strong>the best character </strong>in Assassin’s Creed Shadows to play as?</p>



<p>Read on to understand these characters and learn which of them is the best protagonist in Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-yasuke-vs-naoe-which-character-is-best">Yasuke vs Naoe – Which Character is Best?</h2>



<p>It’s mostly a subjective debate when it comes to determining which of the two Assassin’s Creed Shadows protagonists is the best.</p>



<p>If you prefer decimating your enemies with heavy attacks, you’ll probably pick Yasuke. If you’re more of a stealthy player who relies on shadows and subterfuge to achieve your goals, you’ll prefer Naoe.</p>



<p>Here are the advantages and disadvantages of both characters in Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p><strong>Yasuke</strong></p>



<p>Advantages:</p>



<ul>
<li>High health pool</li>



<li>Incredibly powerful attacks</li>



<li>Can use a bow and teppo (gun)</li>



<li>Can easily dispatch even the toughest enemies</li>
</ul>



<p>Disadvantages:</p>



<ul>
<li>Very slow, cumbersome parkour abilities</li>



<li>Tougher to remain hidden, almost impossible in some circumstances</li>



<li>No eagle vision or hidden blade</li>



<li>Attacks are typically slower and require more planning</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Naoe</strong></p>



<p>Advantages:</p>



<ul>
<li>Very fast and a fantastic parkour artist</li>



<li>Uses shinobi tools like smoke grenades, grapple hooks, and distraction mechanics to go unseen</li>



<li>Uses a wide range of melee weapons, most of which are designed around speed</li>



<li>Can assassinate enemies and use eagle vision to spot and mark enemies</li>
</ul>



<p>Disadvantages:</p>



<ul>
<li>Low health pool that is a challenge against tough enemies</li>



<li>Limited ranged weapons; can only use Kunai and Shuriken</li>



<li>Less physically dominating and won’t scare enemies as easily</li>
</ul>



<p>In general, I think that Assassin’s Creed fans will gravitate much more readily to Naoe, who represents the creed and what the series stands for. In truth, you’ll be splitting your time between both. However, after around 30 hours in the game at the time of writing, I can honestly and openly say that I’ve preferred my time spent with Naoe.</p>



<p>She’s much faster and more agile, and her parkour abilities are the best the franchise has ever seen. Her skillset makes her incredibly fluid, and the stealth factor with Naoe is off the charts. The only time I actively switch to Yasuke is if I’ve tried to win a fight with Naoe and have lost – if that’s the case, I bring in the hulking samurai to tackle the tougher enemies.</p>



<p>From a cosmetic perspective, I also enjoy Naoe’s outfits more. They’re better suited to the assassin lifestyle, but that’s not to take away from Yasuke’s incredible armour sets.</p>



<p>That’s which character I think is best in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, but feel free to let me know what you think in the comments.</p>

            <p>
Fans of developer Argonaut's warmly remembered 3D platformer Croc: Legend of the Gobbos are in for a blast of nostalgia; after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/90s-platformer-remaster-croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-has-been-delayed-into-next-year">bit of a delay</a>, its previously announced remaster has been given a release date, and is launching for PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch on 2nd April.
</p>
<p>
Croc: Legend of the Gobbos, for the uninitiated (or young), launched for the original PlayStation in 1997, taking players - in the guise of the titular crocodile - on a journey through Gobbo Valley in a bid to free their friends from the evil magician Baron Dante. The resulting adventure wasn't <em>exactly</em> a classic of the genre, but it certainly had fans.
</p>
<p>
And now, Argonaut - which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/90s-platformer-croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-is-being-remastered-by-resurrected-argonaut-games">resurrected last year</a>, 20 years after its original closure - is revisiting Croc's first outing with a nostalgia-tweaking update. It promises "vibrant high-definition graphics, a modern control and camera system, and refined gameplay mechanics" as players venture across "beautifully recrafted" levels.

		<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is sticking with the action RPG gameplay where gear and loot are a key part of your progression through the game. Weapons and gear come in various types and apply to different gameplay styles, but a basic tanto isn’t going to be anywhere near as good as a legendary tanto, and comes without perks.</p>
<p>Alongside levelling up and gaining Mastery points, you’ll need to look out for legendary chests and more. Here’s what to look for to get the best gear and loot in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>.</p>

<li><strong><a href="#section2">How to find legendary gear and legendary chests in AC Shadows</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#section3">Levelling up weapons and gear in AC Shadows</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section1">Assassin’s Creed Shadows loot tiers and perks explained</h2>
<p>Shadows has a loot system that uses the familiar common, uncommon, rare, epic, and legendary item tiers. The higher the tier, the more powerful the piece of equipment, generally speaking, though if you’re particularly lucky and get a good drop, an epic item could be more powerful than a legendary one.</p>


<p>Uncommon items and up come with a perk that can make a big difference, like increaseing armour when health is full, or boosting your damage per adrenaline chunk filled, whilst rare items and better can also be inscribed with another perk of your choice at the forge in your hideout.</p>



<p>Generally speaking the most consistently powerful gear you can count on finding is legendary gear. The stats are betters, the perks are better, and they probably look cooler too. The most consistent way to get it is by opening legendary chests.</p>
<p>There are a few ways to find legendary chests, but most reliably they are found in castles. To open a castle’s legendary chest you first need to defeat all the Samurai Daisho in that castle which can be a little time consuming, but you’ll also find a bunch of resources which you can later use to upgrade your equipment and earn Mastery points, so it’s time well spent!</p>
<p>You can also find legendary chests out in the world, and there are a few things to look out for. First, if you see some soldiers threatening a civilian and kill said soldiers, the civilian will reward you with your choice of either a scout support or some world information. The world information can sometimes give you information about a legendary chest nearby, or a kofun, which is a cave to explore with a legendary chest at the end.</p>
<p>You can also get locations for these chests in kakuregas, which are like outposts where you can fast travel to and restock your equipment. You can get radiant missions from here as well as areas to search for nearby content, such as legendary chests and castles.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Levelling up weapons and gear in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>
<p>Remember to pick up as many resources as possible as you play, as on top of the loot’s tier system, they also have levels. Once you’ve built a forge at your hideout you’ll be able to upgrade your gear’s level to ensure it’s still useful after you’ve levelled up a bit. When you upgrade the forge you’ll also be able to inscribe another perk onto rare or better equipment, giving you another modifier of your choice. These perks can be very useful and can be unlocked by completing certain challenges in-game, such as a certain amount of assassinations, as well as be rewards for completing certain quests.</p>
<p>One of the earlier legendary items I found was a tanto for Naoe that, after using a weak point attack (by holding R1 until charged) against a vulnerable enemy, would trigger another vulnerable state afterwards, allowing me to use another weakpoint attack and deal even more damage. As she’s a character that’s much more focused on speed, a skill like this was very useful, so I’ve focused on upgrading it ever since. Once you find an item with a trait that works well for your playstyle, you can keep upgrading it like this until you find a replacement that works even better, or that is so good that it changes how you play.</p>
<hr>
<p>There you have it. Looting in Assassin’s Creed Shadows comes with the standard item tiers, but you need to keep a look our for Legendary chests to find the best gear, and then keep on top of upgrades to all your weapons and items.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/18/assassins-creed-shadows-do-i-have-to-play-as-naoe-and-yasuke/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, you get to play as not one, but two characters whilst assassin-ing your way around feudal Japan. Joining forces to thwart another evil plot, Naoe and Yasuke are both very different in just about every way, from their backgrounds and motivations to combat style, tools, and weaponry. As you switch between the two of them at will, you’ll need to adjust your playstyle to account for their strengths and weaknesses, and depending on your preferred playstyle you might wonder, can you play Assassin’s Creed Shadows only as Naoe or Yasuke?</p>
<h2>In this guide</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="#section1">Who are Naoe and Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows?</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#section2">Who is better in AC Shadows: Naoe or Yasuke?</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#section3">Can I play as just one character in AC Shadows?</a></strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Naoe – the sneaky Ninja Assassin</h3>
<p>Naoe is a trained shinobi who is out for revenge in typical Assassin’s Creed fashion, which means she’s both stealthy and sneaky, and your go-to for anything involving either of those two things. In addition to being small, quick, and not wearing clunky, loud armour, she also has a grappling hook to help reach rooftops and vantage points, and a set of tools – kunai, shurikens, bells, and smoke bombs. Naturally this combination of things makes her ideal for sneaking into a castle and methodically assassinating every poor guard who happens to be on duty.</p>
<p>She’s not useless in combat either. She doesn’t deal huge amounts of damage and might have a bit of a tough time taking out the implausibly giant guards, but she is capable provided you make full use of parrying and posture attacks on vulnerable enemies. She can equip two of a katana, a kusarigama, and a tanto/hidden blade combo to fight with and will need to be light on her feet to ensure she doesn’t get boxed in by enemies. The kusarigama will help with that, as its upgrades give improved crowd control.</p>



<h3>Yasuke – The towering Samurai</h3>
<p>Yasuke, meanwhile, is an actual samurai. And by actual, I mean he is based on a historical figure. The slave of a Portuguese Jesuit before Lord Oda Nobunaga took an interest in him, he became the first black samurai in history.</p>

<p>Yasuke is built for combat. In addition to being head and shoulders above most other people in the game, he can absorb much more damage than Naoe can, thanks to his full suit of samurai armour, and carries more rations to quickly restore health. He can choose between a long katana, a naginata, a kanabo, a yumi bow, and a teppo, which is a shotgun-like rifle.</p>
<p>Yasuke doesn’t have any tools, not even a grappling hook, and if you want a ranged weapon you’ll have to use one of your two weapon slots for a bow or teppo. The bow itself can be silent, but guards tend to find it a bit suspicious to see a giant pointing a bow at them. Yasuke’s biggest weakness is how profoundly un-sneaky he is – when he moves he makes more noise than Naoe, as he’s wearing a lot of armour, he climbs much more slowly, and when attempting a leap of faith he bounces right out of the haystack, though still without taking damage thankfully. However, Yasuke doesn’t need any of this. Stealth? He just wades into a camp and fights everyone at once. Climbing? Please, Yasuke can literally sprint through closed gates, breaking them into pieces.</p>

<h2 id="section2">Who is better in AC Shadows: Naoe or Yasuke?</h2>
<p>As fun as Yasuke is to play as, rushing right into the thick of the action and battering enemies, his impressive lack of stealth does make Naoe the better fit for the stealthy assassin fantasy of the Assassin’s Creed series. Naoe is the better all-rounder.&nbsp;She can climb quickly, do the leap of faith, attack from range with her tools, and she has a wrist blade so she can assassinate properly as well, whereas Yasuke can only do “his own type of assassination” which usually involves a beheading and lots of noise. More importantly, Naoe can handle herself in a fight far better than Yasuke can handle stealth. It still won’t be easy when you’re fighting off half a castle as her, but at least she can drop a smoke bomb and run away to hide again.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Can I play as just one character in AC Shadows?</h2>
<p>The game is clearly designed to necessitate the use of both characters, as Naoe and Yasuke both have important roles through the game’s story, but if you have a favourite, then you can largely stick to playing as just one or the other.</p>
<p>You can switch at any time when in the open world, and major story missions are broken up with decision points to let you choose which character to play as for the next section, so you can simply pick to play as your favourite of the two at those points. The one sticking point is when you need to talk to specific NPCs as a particular character, forcing you to switch for at least a short time.</p>

<p>In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, there is a dual-protagonist system similar to the one found in 2016’s Assassin’s Creed: Syndicate. It’s just as fluid, and you can switch between characters at the press of a button. However, the hulking samurai figure of Yasuke isn’t immediately available, but this guide will answer when you play as him in Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>Read on to find out when and how to unlock Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, but be prepared to put in the work.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-when-do-you-unlock-yasuke-in-assassin-s-creed-shadows">When Do You Unlock Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows?</h2>



<p>In the opening of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, you get to control Yasuke for just a few minutes – but that’s enough to see what he can do. Naturally, you’d want to return to the role of the masterful warrior as soon as possible, but that’s not how this game works.</p>



<p>You’ll need to play as Naoe for several hours before you can unlock Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows – around 8 to 10 hours into the game. That’s how long it took me to get to a point where I could play as Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and that was by following the campaign and ticking off a few side quests along the way.</p>



<p>There’s a key turning point in the story – which I won’t reveal – that makes Yasuke available for open-world play. Once you’ve unlocked him, he remains around permanently, and you’ll be able to switch between him and Naoe relatively easily.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-yasuke-an-assassin">Is Yasuke an Assassin?</h2>



<p>It’s obvious right off the bat that Yasuke isn’t a traditional assassin. This isn’t a spoiler, as this has been revealed in the run-up to the game’s release, but Yasuke is a samurai warrior with ties to Oda Nobunaga. Naoe is the ‘shinobi’ character with ties to the assassins as we know them, but Yasuke doesn’t fit that bill at all.</p>



<p>He’s clumsy when it comes to parkour, and he doesn’t have eagle vision or a hidden blade, so he’s not a typical assassin.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-2-rtx-remix-developers-respond-to-concern-from-some-fans-that-it-ruins-the-original-games-atmosphere<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The hotly anticipated <a href="https://za.ign.com/half-life-2-rtx-an-rtx-remix-project" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Half-Life 2 RTX</a> launches its demo today, March 18, and IGN sat down with its developers to discuss how they reimagined Valve’s 20-year-old masterpiece using Nvidia's RTX Remix tech, and debate the concern from some fans that it negatively impacts the original’s atmosphere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The modding team Orbifold Studios used RTX Remix to modernize Half-Life 2, adding full ray tracing, remastered assets, and DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation. It is free DLC for Half-Life 2 owners, and its demo is out now on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, not everyone in the Half-Life community believes RTX Remix actually improves upon Half-Life 2. Various complaints based on early gameplay footage revolve around RTX Remix’s new lighting, which some have said “strips away” the original’s atmosphere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The iconic Ravenholm area is dimly lit in the original, but some fans say RTX Remix makes Ravenholm too brightly lit, reducing the effect of its horror ambience. “Ravenholm has gone from ‘moody’ to ‘obvious tech demo’,” one commenter said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The feeling is the pursuit of realism with RTX Remix pulls away from Valve’s original art direction, that artistic choices made by Valve over 20 years ago are negated by RTX Remix’s impact on lighting. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a point IGN put to David Driver-Gomm, co-lead of Half-Life 2 RTX Remix at Orbifold Studios, in our interview, the video version of which is above. In his response, Driver-Gomm said the modders were absorbing the feedback now, and insisted Half-Life 2 RTX was not a finished product by any means, so could be tweaked in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When you have different tools, you make different decisions and you make some that are born of necessity and you make some that are born of art, and we have to try and unpick why they did what they did,” Driver-Gomm explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Did they do this because it was intentional or did they do this because there was a limit, right? That was done because that was what the engine at the time allowed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So then when we come and we remake the zombie to a modern fidelity, we use modern technologies like ‘hair cards’ in order to achieve an end result that we hope would kind of be in the artist's mind's eye at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There are going to be a wide variety of opinions. There's going to be a lot of people who feel like something would be done differently, and a lot of that feedback is stuff that we are taking on board and working with organically.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then to a certain extent, some of it is just, we all love this game, so we all have very different opinions on how it should be treated and how the art should come across.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Driver-Gomm then said that Orbifold Studios’ mod is its interpretation of Half-Life 2, and any mod team is free to have a go at making an alternative using the RTX Remix technology.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s moddable,” Driver-Gomm began. “Remix is out there, Half-Life 2 works with it because we're doing it. There is always room for people to put in their own interpretations, and I feel like that is the healthiest way to approach it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Half-Life 2 RTX is an interpretation, right? We're pretty proud of it. We think we're doing a lot of research to get it pretty on point. If people disagree, which is entirely their right to do so, then they have the tools to go and make that alternative interpretation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The lighting isn’t the only complaint from some Half-Life 2 fans. Others have pointed to perhaps over-eager clouds of smoke emerging from fire and explosions may obscure the player’s vision. At one point in IGN’s demo gameplay, below, at 3:50 mark, Father Grigori’s shotgun blast and reveal is obscured by smoke, potentially causing the player to miss a key story moment in the game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Driver-Gomm said the team is already looking into the smoke issue, and explained their process there: “We have Source particle experts on the team and you can see the result of that with things like our new fires and our new explosions. In places where we haven't yet been able to author something different, we've been working with the base game materials and that's kind of how we've ended up where we are with that smoke.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Again, it's an evolving process. Mods are not a thing that's like one and done and that's it, it's finished, right? That's never been mods. It's never going to be mods. It's always living and breathing. It's always responding to feedback. It's always deciding, does this person have a point or do I feel that my vision is worth pursuing, and hopefully the results will win out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It is a complicated thing. We know we're doing something that a lot of people feel very strongly about here with remastering Half-Life 2, and key moments like that are things we are actively working on to make sure match up with the original.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But this is a demo. This is not the full final game. This is not us saying that this is it always and forever. The point of this demo is to go, we've done a pretty strong foundation here. We've covered a huge amount of assets, we've covered a huge amount of the environment. We want to see what the people think.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the demo for Half-Life 2 RTX Remix now released, thoughts inevitably turn to whether Orbifold Studios will take on Episode 1 and 2 next. Driver-Gomm kept his cards close to his chest, but did say if his team doesn’t continue on, another could.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Episode 1 and 2 have a lot of assets which are shared with Half-Life 2, right?” he said. “Once we finish Half-Life 2, those will already be done by 70% for Episode 1 and about 50% for Episode 2. We'll have to see when we get there, but there's absolutely nothing stopping a community effort, even if we don't, from just picking up where we left off and wrapping up the work to be done.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/well-hear-more-about-baldurs-gates-future-in-pretty-short-order-hasbro-svp-of-games-says<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> is a year-and-a-half old now, and we're still happily muddling through our second, third, seventh, 10th playthroughs. But with developer Larian choosing to step away from the series, that leaves Hasbro to sort out what it's going to do with Baldur's Gate in the future. Fortunately, it sounds like it won't be too long until we hear at least <em>something</em> about what's going on for the franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to IGN at the Game Developers Conference this week, SVP of digital games at Hasbro Dan Ayoub let on that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-started-work-on-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-then-canceled-it-the-studio-was-elated">with Larian moving on</a>, Hasbro has "a lot of people very interested in Baldur's Gate."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're kind of working out our plans for the future and what we're going to be doing with that. And actually, in pretty short order, we're going to have some stuff to talk about around that."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ayoub didn't offer any further information about whether this "stuff" would be a full-blown new Baldur's Gate in the works, or some sort of crossover like the characters had with Magic: The Gathering previously. However, he did acknowledge that he eventually <em>wants</em> a Baldur's Gate 4, but that making one will likely take a while.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's somewhat of an unenviable position," he said. "I mean, we're not in a hurry. Right? That's the thing, we're going to take a very measured approach... We've got a lot of plans, a lot of different ways to go about it. We're starting to think about, okay, yeah, we're ready to start dipping toes a little bit and talking about a few things. And I think, in really short order, like I said, again, not to over-tease that point, we're going to have some other things to talk about around that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ayoub also acknowledged that the pressure to get the next Baldur's Gate right is immense, and even bleeds over into other Dungeons &amp; Dragons-related, non-Baldur's Gate projects, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/another-dungeons-dragons-video-game-in-production-at-hasbro">the game Hasbro announced last year</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN 10 of 2023</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm never one to shy down from a challenge," he said. "And I think anything that forces us to raise our creative bar, and developers love to have a high bar to go after, and I think we've actually seen the team push some really interesting ideas that they're like, 'Okay, we need to raise our bar. We need to go bigger on this.' And things like that. So, I think that's our hope, right? We would keep raising the bar and everyone just tries to go a little higher."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We spoke with Ayoub on a number of other topics, including Magic: The Gathering, its partnership with Saber Interactive, and Hasbro's overall game strategy. Keep an eye out for our full interview sometime next week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-review.1138044/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/18/assassins-creed-shadows-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been a long time coming. Despite the clamouring of their fan base, Ubisoft held off for years on giving the people what they want, an Assassin’s Creed game set in feudal Japan. Then, after finally announcing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, the game was delayed at the last minute… and then delayed again. Thankfully the wait is over, the latest entry in the Assassin’s Creed franchise is finally here, and it is utterly resolutely brilliant. Indeed, it might just be the best game in the storied series to date and Ubisoft’s best game in years.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Launch Cinematic TV Ad" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zxtJFdnMo7k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First off, how do you like your Assassin’s Creed? If you prefer the stealth-focused and closed environment approach of the early games in the franchise, then Shadows is likely not for you. If, on the other hand, your preference is the open-word action RPG approach established by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/26/assassins-creed-origins-review/">Assassin’s Creed Origins</a>, then you’ll find that Shadows is the epic culmination of everything you enjoyed since Bayek’s Ancient Egyptian adventure. Though, after the first eight hours or so of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, you’d be forgiven for thinking that this wasn’t the case.</p>


<p>Shadows is a slow starter, and while the drawn-out opening is full of great emotional beats and outstanding character performances, setting-up protagonist Naoe’s quest for vengeance, it is distinctly lacking in open-world activities and gameplay variety. When you’re not watching its admittedly very beautiful cut scenes, you’ll spend your time travelling from village to village murdering people, with a distinctive lack of tools and abilities to make it interesting to do so. During this opening section of the game, the limited areas of Japan you visit feel sparse, empty, as if something is missing. That something is Yasuke, and by the time the African Samurai strides into the game everything clicks, the open world reveals itself, activities and encounters fill the environment, the gameplay evolves, and finally Assassin’s Creed Shadows kicks into gear.</p>


<p>Yasuke plays in a completely different way to any protagonist in Assassin’s Creed history. He’s an unstoppable tank, like Batman from the Arkham series, as if the Doom Slayer was lifted from Hell and plonked into feudal Japan. Clad in robust armour, Yasuke shrugs off most attacks, smashing through opponent’s defences to complete a strike, even if it means taking some damage on the way. </p>
<p>Later, Yasuke’s extensive skill tree can be harnessed to allow him to reclaim health from attacking, but in the early going you’ll be too busy grinning with glee as the mighty samurai boots an unwitting thug, sending them careening with rag-doll hilarity through the wall of a nearby temple. Combat is punchy and reliably structured around parries and dodges to expose an enemy to counter attack. Nothing groundbreaking here, but eminently satisfying, and I found myself playing as Yasuke far more than I thought I would, just to throw it down with another Daimyo or two.</p>
<p>Of course, many will lean towards playing as Naoe first and foremost, as she fulfils that more traditional role of the Assassin’s Creed avatar with stealth and athleticism. That means all your expected tropes, with free running, flipping, and leap of faith-falling aplenty. The extra time in development has clearly served Shadows well, as, for once, the free-running works perfectly. No more accidentally leaping off cliffs, Naoe goes where you want her to go, when you want her to go there, with smooth and precise animation. </p>
<p>That’s not to say that this Shinobi doesn’t bring anything new to the table. Crawling through low cover is now an option, as is swinging on a grappling hook, allowing for different approaches on a target to be carried out – Yasuke simply can’t access rooftops and vantage points in the same way. More intriguing is that Shadows is the first Assassin’s Creed where light and dark in the environment influences your likelihood to be seen. It now makes complete strategic sense to wait until dark before infiltrating a fortress, snuffing out candles as you making your way past hordes of enemies, practically invisible. To reach your victim unseen is a satisfying thrill, one that is sure to scratch the itch of even the most ardent stealth enthusiast.</p>

<p>Each player character has an enormous amount of differing abilities, weapons, and tools to mess around with. Yasuke’s shotgun-like Teppo is tremendous fun, thanks to the ability to switch weapons mid-attack meaning you can parry attacks from a sword, before spinning the rifle into position and blowing a foes’ face off Meanwhile Naoe’s standout weapon, the dagger-like Tanto, is far more exciting than it sounds, thanks to they way in which the Ninja slams it into to her victim with wanton abandon. Actually, this must be the goriest Assassin’s Creed yet – watching Yasuke slice off both his opponents arms before hacking off their head is quite the sight.</p>
<p>What really makes Assassin’s Creed Shadows tick though, is the option to freely switch between the leads depending on the situation you face and how you want to deal with it. A veritable army of Samurai blocking your way? Yasuke will carve a bloody path through them, but, if you’re not feeling the need for a fight, you can switch to Naoe and creep past them instead. It’s a shame that whilst the game encourages experimentation with its two player characters, offering open combat encounters to play around in, it makes it so darn clunky to swap between them, forcing you to dip into the menus to do so. This is particularly aggravating when you encounter a quest-giver for a specific hero, demanding you switch hero before you can interact with them. This is something they can hopefully refine in an early patch.</p>
<p>It’s in the depiction of feudal Japan that Assassin’s Creed Shadows truly delivers. Frankly, there are moments of jaw-dropping visual beauty here. You can spend ages just soaking in the vistas that stretch many miles into the distance. Blossom trees blow hither and thither in the wind, each branch moving independently of the others as blossoms float down to coat a woodland path. Seasons change and the environments with it, submerging villages in snow, or causing flowers to bloom in the summer. Waves lap against the shore, the sunlight sparkling across the water. Stunning is a word that doesn’t quite do justice to the environmental detail on display here, but it’ll do.</p>

<p>Unusually for Ubisoft, this glorious open world isn’t covered in icons and intrusive HUD nonsense. While you can still scan the surroundings from high-up vantage points, this doesn’t automatically fill your map with navigation points, instead insisting that you mark points of interest for yourself, and only a handful at a time. It’s less immediate, but it means you’re encouraged to explore the world more dynamically, search for your next target, find yourself distracted by an intriguing cave that you decide to explore, discovering an awesome new weapon hidden deep within.</p>
<p>Events occur organically around you, often dictated by the season. A peasant might need rescuing from some thugs, a passing Ronin might challenge you to a duel, or you might spot a lovely dog to pet and bring home to your hideout. There’s a wide range of activities to undertake, delightfully many of them avoiding combat to bring different experiences to the player. A forgotten crumbling temple becoming a free-running playground, a meditation point that brings transport your character into past events, taking the time to paint a playing bunny, clambering to the summit of a big waterfall to try and see if Yasuke can do a leap of faith – you’re definitely going to want to try it. In short, the world of Assassin’s Creed Shadows feel alive, with a historical and cultural authenticity that blew my mind.</p>

<p>The historical plot is smart and well-researched, brilliant evoking a Japanese Samurai cinema vibe with Assassin’s Creed’s own distinctive style. During your adventure, you’ll meet a who’s who of important figures from the period in their adventures, Oda Nobunaga and Hattori Hanzo are two early stand outs, but there are many more infamous characters expertly woven into proceedings. Thankfully, there’s also a minimum of modern-world nonsense here, with the option to explore digital anomalies and AI shenanigans if you want, but mostly letting you stick with the awesome feudal Japan setting. With all that going for the storyline, even a few blatantly obvious plot twists doesn’t change the fact that this is my favourite Assassin’s Creed setting and storyline by far.</p>
