Based on the livestream event created by Anjali Bhimani, the setting will bring players into a world full of furry friends and adventures. In fact, it is available at no additional cost.</p>

<h2>The Puppy Roll D&amp;D 5e Setting Release</h2>

<p>According to the Hitpoint Press <a href="https://hitpointpress.com/products/the-puppy-roll-pdf">store page</a>, <em>The Puppy Roll</em> setting book brings players into the magical land of Doggo. It is a land full of, you guessed it, doggos. Doggos with dreams. With ambitions. With a drive to live their best lives.</p>

It is based off on the livestream actual play event, also called <em>The Puppy Roll</em>, that Bhimani ran to benefit the non-profit charity organization Petco Love.</p>

<p>Bhimani is a prolific voice actress whose voice credits include <em>Starfield</em>, <em>Overwatch 2</em>, the <em>Ms. Marvel</em> TV series, and the upcoming Blizzard game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/sunderfolk-gm-anjali-bhimani-explains-how-she-voices-multiple-characters" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Sunderfolk</em></a>.</p>

<p>In addition, Bhimani has been active in the actual play community. She DM'd <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/lego-ideas-dungeons-dragons-set-fabricates-fun" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Red Dragon's Tale</em></a> <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> one-shot, has been a player in Dimension 20 <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/matthew-mercer-leads-dimension-20-ravening-war-prequel-to-crown-of-candy" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Ravening War</em></a> and Critical Role's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-announces-horror-series-candela-obscura-first-to-use-illuminated-worlds" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Candela Obscura</em></a>.</p>

<p>As for the content in The Puppy Roll, it is a doggo-themed take on the rules of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>.<em> Haste</em> is called <em>Zoomies</em>, <em>Witch Bolt</em> is now <em>Scritch Bolt</em>. Sending Stones are now Sending Bones. The book also contains unique locations and NPCs such as Rosso's Bakery and the The Bark &amp; Bone tavern.</p>

This is bad because without that bone, dogs are vanishing through portals, losing their memory of both who they are and their owners' identities. It is up to the good boys of Doggo to retrieve the golden bone, save the lost puppers, and find the one responsible.</p>

<p><em>The Puppy Roll</em> is available right now on Hitpoint Press for free.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/sega-is-delisting-60-classic-games-from-steam-so-nows-the-time-to-grab-them/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Sega has put dozens of its Master System, Genesis, Saturn, and other console titles onto modern game stores over the years. But, like that Dreamcast controller stashed in your childhood garage, they're about to disappear—and getting them back will cost you a nostalgia tax.</p>
<p>Those who have purchased any of <a href="https://support.sega.com/hc/en-gb/articles/29776767664145-SEGA-Classics-FAQ#h_01JBWBDWT9PXWHVDPMSZB9EB90">the more than 60 games listed by Sega</a> from Steam, Xbox, Nintendo's Switch store, and the PlayStation store will still have them after 11:59 pm Pacific time on Dec. 26. But after that, for reasons that Sega does not make explicit, they will be "delisted and unavailable." Titles <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sega-genesis-nintendo-switch-online-switch/">specific to the Nintendo Switch Online "Expansion Pack" subscription</a> will remain.</p>
<p>As PC Gamer has suggested, and which makes the most sense, this looks like Sega is getting ready to offer up new "classics" collections on these storefronts. Sega previously rearranged its store shelves to pull Sonic games from online stores and then offer up <em>Sonic Origins. </em>The title&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/06/review-sega-we-need-to-talk-about-how-you-messed-up-sonic-origins/">underwhelmed Ars at the time</a> and managed to pack in some DLC pitches.</p>
<p>Sega already offers a few bundles and collections in Steam, like the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/10143/SEGA_Mega_Drive_and_Genesis_Classics/">Mega Drive and Genesis Classics</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/14082/Dreamcast_Collection/">Dreamcast Collection</a>. As with individual titles, buyers will retain access to them, even after Sega comes back around with new bundles.</p>

<p>So if you've felt like you wanted to reclaim some Sega moments now, piecemeal, while you still can, the Ars writers can suggest a few places to look. These are links to the Steam store, and are mostly Windows-only, though they can often work through Proton on Linux or Steam Deck, and some work with older mac OS versions. Xbox has a smaller list, while PlayStation and Nintendo offer only the Mega Drive Classics at the moment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/kotaku-layoffs-go-media<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>G/O Media, a network that owns websites but also knows nothing about running websites, has made further cuts at the already-beleaguered Kotaku, with a number of writers announcing today that they had been laid off.</p><p>Willa Rowe and Moises Taveras, two writers who only joined the site earlier this year, were abruptly laid off by management this afternoon. Also announcing their departure from Kotaku today, albeit on their own terms, was Senior Editor Alyssa Mercante,<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alyssamerc.bsky.social/post/3laevatgogi2l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> who posted</a> that after two years at the site she was moving on.</p><p>The layoffs and the departure of Mercante leave Kotaku with just six full-time staff, including an Editor-in-Chief who only joined a few months ago<a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-eic-resigns-over-new-editorial-edict" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> after his predecessor resigned in protest over G/O Media's management of the site</a>. They follow several rounds of layoffs to have already taken place in 2024, affecting both editorial staff and writers.</p><p>"G/O Media’s management is once again punishing workers for its own bad decisions", Managing Editor Carolyn Petit<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/carolynmichelle.bsky.social/post/3laexmv7nl62g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> wrote</a> on Bluesky. "Management mandated that some writers stick to ‘service’ posts, and now that the numbers aren’t panning out (surprise, surprise!), two of those writers have been laid off. Cruel and misguided."</p><p>Kotaku is one of the last remaining websites in G/O Media's portfolio, following the recent sale of everything from <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/the-onion-sold-global-tetrahedron-1235982383/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Onion</a> to <a href="https://www.axios.com/pro/media-deals/2024/10/21/jalopnik-cars-acquisition-static" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jalopnik</a> to<a href="https://deadspin.com/the-adults-in-the-room-1837487584/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> whatever was left of Deadspin</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/take-two-interactive-strauss-zelnick-ftc-grand-theft-auto<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This week, <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> publisher Take-Two – whose CEO, Strauss Zelnick, six months ago <a href="https://aftermath.site/take-two-zelnick-layoffs-roll7-intercept" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">denied closing two studios</a> for what could best be described as no apparent reason – confirmed that it closed those two studios. <em>Kerbal Space Program 2</em> developer Intercept Games and <em>Rollerdrome </em>creator <a href="https://aftermath.site/kerbal-space-program-2-olliolli-rollerdrome-roll7-take-two" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roll7</a> Studios <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zelnick-on-private-division-sale-those-projects-were-smaller-were-in-the-business-of-big-hits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are no more</a>. This follows new financial results in which Take-Two also announced the sale of its indie-focused Private Division label to an undisclosed buyer. Anyway, you will not be surprised to learn that Zelnick is thrilled that Trump just got reelected.</p><p><a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-sells-tales-of-the-shire-developer-private-division-strauss-zelnick-on-trump-election-1236202964/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to Variety</a>, Zelnick, whose management company <a href="https://www.dealpointdata.com/corp/docf/000130/000130817924000655/index1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received</a> $43,742,000 in fees and stock options from Take-Two this fiscal year, said he anticipates a “more sensible” Federal Trade Commission under incoming President/fascist cosplayer Donald Trump.</p><p>"I think that the President-elect has made it very plain that he believes in reducing regulation,” Zelnick said. “I do believe that the FTC was misguided during President Biden’s term, and I do think that the FTC tried to impede some transactions that were beneficial for both the companies in question and the economy at large, and the FTC lost all those cases since. So I do think that, depending on what the specific topic is, deregulation can be a positive, and I am certainly looking forward to [a] more sensible FTC.”</p><p>That’s one way of putting it. Another might be “a toothless FTC,” or a return to a status quo that allowed gargantuan mergers to soar through unimpeded. Under FTC chair Lina Khan, nominated by Biden in 2021, the regulatory body fought to <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/04/ftc-announces-rule-banning-noncompetes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ban non-compete clauses</a>, launched <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/09/ftc-sues-amazon-illegally-maintaining-monopoly-power" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a lawsuit against Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/09/ftc-sues-prescription-drug-middlemen-artificially-inflating-insulin-drug-prices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued healthcare companies</a> engaging in sketchy behavior, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-18/biden-antitrust-enforcers-set-new-record-for-merger-challenges" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blocked a record number of mergers</a> in an attempt to stem the tide of monopoly power in the United States.</p><p>One such merger – which eventually went through – was Microsoft’s $68.7 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard, which the FTC argued could harm consumers by substantially lessening competition in the gaming space. Regulatory scrutiny from both the FTC and the European Commission forced Microsoft to make several concessions, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23915780/ubisoft-activision-blizzard-microsoft-cloud-gaming-rights-deal-explained" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a cloud gaming deal with Ubisoft</a>. The FTC has since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/18/24201576/ftc-microsoft-xbox-game-pass-price-increases-standard-tier" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">challenged</a> Microsoft on its <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs-survival-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mass layoff of 1,900 employees in early 2024</a> and Game Pass’ <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-game-pass-rot-economy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">horrible, convoluted pricing schemes</a>.</p><p>I doubt Zelnick is the only video game CEO – or any kind of CEO – who is excited to return to the days when stuff like this rarely happened. I’m sure they will all wield this newfound lack of oversight responsibly and definitely not send <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-rot-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the rot economy</a>, already a slippery slope of sludge, into overdrive.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-stalker-2-gameplay-trailer-showcases-weapons-attachments-and-upgrades/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a new gameplay trailer shared by IGN, players get a glimpse at what's to come in STALKER 2 and what weaponry and ammo will be available. It also shows off the gun attachments you'll get access to throughout the game. Since the original STALKER came out, it's been 17 years, and there have been major technological advancements since then. STALKER 2 is set to use Unreal Engine 5, and so far, all teasers and trailers have showcased amazing graphics. However, games using Unreal Engine 5 have been known to be temperamental. Despite this, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-will-keep-a-stable-frame-rate-at-all-times-promises-developer/">the developers have promised</a> that the game will remain stable at all times. If you want to know what weapons and kit you can expect in STALKER 2, make sure to check out the video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl - Exclusive Smoking Barrels Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NAz3_4uvG0k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the video, the graphics and environments shown are absolutely stunning and are extremely detailed. It shows off how you can loot from bodies on the ground, as well as what your inventory will look like, something that can be a huge deterrent in games, depending on how it's handled. In the video, it seems as if each item you pick up is a specific shape or size, and you will be required to do a bit of Tetris to be able to fit items together. This sort of inventory is often seen in survival games and is commonly seen in the Resident Evil franchise. This can be fun but also serves as its own challenge. Each item also has its own weight, which can lead to over-encumbrance if you carry too much, as shown in the video.</p>
<p>The video also shows off some of the combat that you can expect in STALKER 2, as well as methods of self-preservation, which includes quickly bandaging yourself in sticky situations. The video released by GSC Game World shows how the world can go from derelict and barren to chaotic and dangerous in seconds, always showing that you have to be on your guard.</p>
<p>There are a variety of weapons that will be available and a lot of different attachments you can get, including 2x and 4x Scopes if you're someone who likes to use Sniper Rifles or want to be stealthy about your kills and take out your enemies from a vantage point.</p>
<p>The release date for STALKER 2 ebbs ever closer and is set for release on November 20 on Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC via Steam</a>, the Epic Games Store, and GOG.</p>
<p>Will you be diving into STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl?</p>

The Nintendo eShop and the PlayStation Store will “just” lose <em>SEGA Genesis Classics — </em>but that title includes more than 50 old Genesis games, so it still means a lot will be unavailable. You can see the full lists of what’s getting pulled on <a href="https://support.sega.com/hc/en-us/articles/29776767664145-SEGA-Classics-FAQ#h_01JBWBD2TRQDGP79RFEAY1YVBZ">a Sega support page</a>.</p><p>Any games that you have purchased will still be available to download and play after they’re delisted from the storefronts, so if you’ve had your eye on any of them, you might want to buy them before they’re gone.</p><p>The delistings are happening ahead of Sega’s planned reboots for <em>Jet Set Radio</em>,&nbsp;<em>Shinobi</em>, <em>Golden Axe</em>,&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi</em>, but those revivals aren’t expected <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2023/12/7/23992993/sega-is-bringing-back-some-classics">anytime soon</a>. And it wouldn’t be the first time Sega has delisted games ahead of releasing them in a different form: the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/26/23043398/sega-pulls-classic-sonic-the-hedgehog-games-digital-stores-origins">pulled the vast majority of classic <em>Sonic</em> games</a> from digital stores&nbsp;before it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/20/23033583/sonic-origins-sega-hedgehog-ps5-xbox">launched <em>Sonic Origins</em></a>.</p><p>Hopefully, the games getting removed in December will be available to buy again at some point down the line — keeping video game classics alive <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23850347/video-game-preservation">is already hard enough</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roblox">Roblox</a> is making changes in an attempt to keep younger players safe in the online platform. Beginning later this month, children under the age of 13 will no longer be able to search, discover or play unrated experiences within Roblox, and will be unable to access social hangout experiences.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Parents and young users need accurate information about the experiences they are playing. Moving forward, all creators must complete a questionnaire for each experience they want available for users under 13. This means that all unrated experiences will be filtered out of search and any public or recommended sorts for users under 13," says <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/updating-experience-guideline-policies-to-keep-our-younger-users-safe/3249079">the announcement</a>.
</p>
<p>Creators have until December 3rd to fill out the questionnaire if they want their content rated for play for those under the of 13. After that point, the unrated content will be filtered out.
</p>
<p>The changes to social hangouts will take effect earlier, on November 18th.
</p>
<p>"We are also updating our policies to address user behavior that can potentially pose a risk to our youngest users," says the post, desperately trying to avoid using words like 'pedophiles' or 'predators'. "Starting November 18, experiences with certain types of interactive features, specifically social hangouts and free-form 2D user creation, will only be playable to users over the age of 13. Creators will always be able to play their own experience or any experience they have edit access to."
</p><p>Earlier this year, a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/">report by Bloomberg</a> addressed the scale of child safety issues within Roblox, highlighting 13,316 instances of child exploitation reported on the platform in 2023. The following month, Hindenberg Research - an organisation which reports on businesses in order to profit from short-selling - published its own report <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/">labelling Roblox a "pedophile hellscape"</a>. Roblox responded to claims in both reports, saying Bloomberg's coverage featured "glaring mischaracterisations" and that it "rejects" Hindenberg's report.
</p>
<p>It's arguably worth putting that number in context, since Roblox is vastly successful with 78 million daily active users as of earlier this year. It's also worth noting that if you perfectly set the parental controls and dodge the predators, the reward is that your kid gets to safely play some of the worst, most exploitatively-designed video games imaginable. You think the skinner box design, FOMO and gambling tactics are bad in mainstream free-to-play games? Wait until you see what they're like when they're created by companies with no public reputation or licensors to protect.
</p>
<p>My kid's school recently sent home a leaflet about Roblox, explaining what it is and how parents can keep children safe in it. Part of the leaflet explained the concept of "ODers", which apparently stands for "Online Daters", who in this context are adults who use Roblox to find an adult romantic partner. I looked it up and this is apparently a real thing and I've been spiralling ever since. I always thought I'd be the sort of person to keep up with technological and social trends, but I'm sloping into middle age and realising that no, I can't, I won't. They've changed what 'it' is and now what's 'it' seems weird and scary to me. 
</p>
<p>I tell every parent I meet what I'll tell you: under 13 or over 13, safe or not safe, don't let your kids play Roblox. Teach them to have taste.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 1 starts on November 14, and with it comes plenty of additions for players. From weapons to modes to general content, there’s no shortage of new things coming to the game. One area that many fans were excited to learn more about after their tease were the new multiplayer maps for Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>As part of its blog detailing everything for Season 1, Activision gave full details on the new maps coming to the game. In total, there will be four new maps, one remastered map, and one variation coming during Black Ops 6 Season 1. </p>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-weapons-black-ops-6-coming/">Every New Weapon in Black Ops 6 Season One (and How to Get Them)</a></h6>



<p>The four new maps are Hideout, Heirloom, Extraction, Racket. Hacienda&nbsp;returns from Black Ops 4, and Nuketown gets a Holiday season variant. Three of the maps will be available at launch while the other three come mid-season.</p>



<p>You can get full details on the new maps below <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Maps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via Activision</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-1-maps">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 1 Maps</h2>



<h3 id="h-hideout-launch-6v6-medium-sized">Hideout (Launch) – 6v6, Medium-sized</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><em>Sharpen your combat skills in this mid-sized Multiplayer map featuring an extensive training site including target practice, an obstacle course, and a lifelike recreation of a vault and security room to help plan for the next mission to hit the Luttazzi crime family.</em></p>



<p><em>The vault and blueprints buildings offer intense, multi-level indoor combat while the armory and open bus set the stage to ambush passing enemies.&nbsp;</em></p>



<h3 id="h-heirloom-launch-2v2-6v6-medium-sized">Heirloom (Launch) – 2v2, 6v6, Medium-sized</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><em>Crash a private showing of Luttazzi family art to create a diversion for the other Rogue Black Ops team as they execute the real job. Navigate in and around a huge sculptural centerpiece in the main exhibit or branch out into the lobby or a side exhibit for a closer fight.</em></p>







<figure></figure>



<p><em>All hell has broken loose in the aftermath of a Crimson One ambush when the attack on the Luttazzis goes sideways. The burning rubble of a downed helicopter and a dead pilot signal an attack on the Avalon Heliport, a typically peaceful tourist destination where clients can book sky high views of Avalon’s breathtaking landscape.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-racket-mid-season-2v2-6v6-small-sized">Racket (Mid-Season) – 2v2, 6v6, Small-sized</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><em>Time to crack open the heart of the Luttazzi money laundering operation and hit them where it really hurts. Breach the premises in this small-sized underground bank vault, a line of broken tiles marking the path of the center bulldozer placed before the vault of golden bars. Defaced pieces of art and the crossed-out emblem of the Luttazzi family indicate not just greed but malicious intent.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-hacienda-mid-season-6v6-medium-sized">Hacienda&nbsp;(Mid-Season) – 6v6, Medium-sized</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><em>Last seen in&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 4</em>, the iconic competitive map returns, sending Operators back to the infamous vineyard estate. Battle within the open-air, two-story mansion with surrounding views of the pristine courtyard below. From the grand foyer past the lion statue, head toward the showroom garage or move out to the garden to keep the fight outside. On the other end of the estate, marvel at the built-in aquarium above the vault.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-nuketown-holiday-mid-season-6v6-small-sized">Nuketown Holiday (Mid-Season) – 6v6, Small-sized</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><em>A Holiday-themed version of Nuketown with snow, decorations, and more.</em></p>

                <p>Activision has announced what's coming to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 in its upcoming Season 1 update, and there are multiple new melee weapons on the way, including a power drill.</p><p>The two-hit-kill melee weapon is effective at very short range and has a fast attack speed, Activision said. The melee weapon has multiple attack vectors, including sweeps, jabs, uppercuts, and a heavy attack when pressed straight on. "This weapon is ideal for putting a hole in the competition when the going gets tough," Activision said.</p><p>The power drill can be unlocked via en event reward sometime during Season 1, but Activision didn't reveal exactly how it can be unlocked. In any event, the drill itself has 30 levels and mastery badges available, and it can be customized with unique skins. Death by power drill sounds particularly gruesome, but no footage of the drill in action has been released thus far.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4396577-powerdrill.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4396577" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4396577-powerdrill.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4396577"></a><figcaption>Say hello to the power drill. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4396577-powerdrill.jpg"></figure><p>Another new melee weapon in Black Ops 6 Season 1 is the cleaver.

            <p>
With Dragon Age: The Veilguard's one-week anniversary now here, BioWare has released its first big patch for the well-received fantasy action-RPG; and as an added treat, the studio has tossed in some <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> themed armour to mark this year's N7 Day.
</p>
<p>
The Veilguard's first patch isn't admittedly, a particularly sexy one in terms of fixes. Its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1845910/view/4453590197273100466?l=english">release notes</a> suggest an update primarily focussed on massaging away some relatively minor annoyances - but given Digital Foundry called the game's initial release an "attractive, technically solid" one <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-dragon-age-the-veilguards-pc-port-is-polished-performant-and-scales-well-beyond-console-quality">on PC</a>, and "polished [and] performant" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-dragon-age-the-veilguard-on-consoles-is-an-attractive-technically-solid-release">on consoles</a>, there didn't appear to be anything particularly egregious in need of attention.
</p>
<p>
Still, if you're an owner of an Nvidia 40-series GPU who couldn't access Dragon Age: The Veilguard's DLSS options, or were finding Harding and Taash's banter looping endlessly, then those - alongside exactly 43 additional issues - should now be remedied on PC and consoles.

<p>
Perhaps the most exciting part of the patch, then, is the inclusion of the aforementioned Mass Effect-inspired armour - a surprisingly dashing blend of practical chest plate, dinner jacket overcoat, and N7 helmet - that can be acquired via a new chest in the Lighthouse, and which you can see at the top of the page. This, of course, has been released to commemorate the return of BioWare's annual N7 Day - celebrations that have also seen a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-is-officially-getting-a-tv-adaptation-at-amazon">Mass Effect TV show officially announced</a>, plus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-rolling-out-cross-save-support-from-today-as-ps5-pro-enhancements-arrive">returning collaborations with No Man's Sky</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>.
</p><p>
In a <a href="https://x.com/bioware/status/1854577078806429869">message shared on social media</a>, BioWare wrote, "November 7 has arrived once again, and as always, we're grateful for the opportunity to celebrate all things Mass Effect! This year is a little different, as we just launched Dragon Age: The Veilguard as a studio; so we're purposefully keeping things lighter as we celebrate the launch of the game... Although we're a little quieter this year, we couldn't be more excited for what's to come."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Robert Purchese had a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">lot of good things to say about BioWare's latest Dragon Age in his five star review</a>. "From head to toe, wing to wing, The Veilguard is exquisitely realised and full of sophistication across systems and storytelling," he wrote. "It's warm and welcoming, funny and hopeful, gentle when it needs to be, and of course it's epic - epic in a way I think will set a high bar not only for BioWare in years to come but for role-playing games in general."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-enhanced-for-ps5-pro-runs-at-4k60-with-pssr/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Assassin's Creed Mirage is now enhanced for the PS5 Pro, just a year after it was initially released on PS4 and PS5. Ubisoft Bordeaux has been working to release a patch for the game so that it will be enhanced for PS5 Pro when the console officially releases. To make it worth playing on the PS5 Pro, they've made some changes to how the game will run in both Quality and Performance mode on the PS5 Pro. Here is everything you can expect from the Assassin's Creed Mirage Enhanced patch.</p>
<p>Should you be picking up the game for the PS5 Pro, you will be able to play the game in 4K60 with PSSR as the upsampling software to provide "more faithful 4K details at 60 FPS." Quality Mode is now the default setting for the game at 60FPS rather than the 30FPS that it was for the original PS5 version of the game.&nbsp; The improvements have been showcased in a <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1854569510272905389" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short video</a> that was posted by the official Assassin's Creed account on X.</p>
<p>As a whole, graphics are said to be generally improved, with better shadows and reflection fidelity, as well as higher texture resolution and improved draw distance. Whether this will be enough for people to pick up the game for the PS5 Pro remains to be seen.</p>
<p>While the Assassin's Creed franchise is quite expansive, when it comes to recent titles, Assassin's Creed Mirage wasn't as revered compared to other titles in the franchise, like Black Flag and Valhalla, for example. Despite this, Assassin's Creed Mirage was still the third best-selling retail game in Japan when it was released.</p>
<p>The main issue with Assassin's Creed Mirage was that people felt that the game was too short, and it is listed as one of the lowest-rated games in the franchise. Although it received a ton of positive buzz from critics when the game launched, it's tied for the third lowest-rated Assassin's Creed game in the whole series. Mirage tried to return to the stealthy roots of the fan favorites but didn't quite have the sparkle and charm that the original Assassin's Creed games had.&nbsp; You can read the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-mirage/">review by Nathan Birch here</a>.</p>
<p>The latest Assassin's Creed game, named Assassin's Creed Shadows, was due for release on November 15 but has since been pushed back for a release on February 15, 2025. Despite not being out yet, the game has caused a significant stir in the community, and people have been actively trying to push for Ubisoft to either scrap the game or remake it entirely away from the story that they were initially trying to create.</p>
<p>Will you be picking up Assassin's Creed Mirage for the PS5 Pro?</p>

        <p>You've got until December 6th to buy them</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Sega are delisting several bundles of 'classic' games from digital stores, along with "select individual" games. On Steam specifically, this adds up to over 60 games in total, including several actual classics including the original Streets Of Rage trilogy, Crazy Taxi, and Jet Set Radio. 
</p>
<p>The games will be removed on December 6th but will remain playable to those who already own them.
</p>

<p>"We've got some news to share regarding our Classics bundles. As of December 6th, 2024 we'll be saying farewell to new purchases of the SEGA Mega Drive and Genesis Classics &amp; Dreamcast Classics. Both of these great bundles and select individual games will be delisted on Steam December 6th," says <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/205950/announcements/detail/4483990132492337189">the announcement</a>, which seems to rather undersell the number of games being delisted.
</p>
<p>"No worries if you already own a game or bundle. These gems will still live in your Steam library. You can download and play SEGA Classics games whenever you want, as long as you own them before December 6th."
</p>
<p>The full list of games being delisted on Steam is <a href="https://support.sega.com/hc/en-us/articles/29776767664145-SEGA-Classics-FAQ#h_01JBWBCN80ZHHPAEQYX1C1M3M9">listed on a Sega support FAQ</a>, but I'll include it below:

<p>Sega offer no reason for why the games are being removed from sale, but typically delisting happens for one of three reasons: expiring licenses; new exclusivity to a different storefront; or an intent to re-release the games in a new form (eg. an enhanced edition, typically with a higher price).
</p><p>This time last year, Sega announced their intent to make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sega-announce-new-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi-streets-of-rage-golden-axe-and-shinobi">new games based on Jet Set Radio, Crazy Taxi, Streets Of Rage, Golden Axe and Shinobi</a>, and previously signalled their intent to produce <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sega-plan-more-remakes-and-remasters-but-still-aiming-to-create-revolutionary-super-game">more remakes and remasters</a> of their classic games.</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt: delisting is bad and I hate it. Even if these games are to return in an improved format, and even if that new format is universally beloved by all, I still wish the existing versions weren't sent to the attic.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Mass Effect fans know that November 7 has been designated by BioWare as N7 Day to celebrate the franchise. And while a new Mass Effect game is still likely years away, this year's N7 Day includes some Mass Effect content that you can find in BioWare's latest title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>.</p><p>There are three items that can be found, all of which reference Commander Shepard from the original Mass Effect trilogy:</p><ul><li>Command Helmet</li><li>Paragon of Leadership</li><li>Specter of Battles Past</li></ul><p>These N7 pieces are just cosmetic, so don't expect the armor to have any stats. The good news is that it's extremely easy to find this free content drop. After players finish The Singing Blade mission within the main quest, the Mass Effect armor will be waiting in a new chest located beside the Caretaker in the Lighthouse. If you've already beaten The Singing Blade and the chest isn't there, exit the game and make sure it's been updated. The chest should be there when you resume play.</p><p>Unfortunately for Dragon Age fans, BioWare recently confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-not-getting-expansions-team-shifts-to-next-mass-effect/1100-6527554/" data-ref-id="1100-6527554">The Veilguard won't get any story expansion DLC</a> because the team is now focused on the next Mass Effect game. But if <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-streamer-spent-almost-a-whole-day-making-sure-her-rook-was-a-smokeshow/1100-6527593/" data-ref-id="1100-6527593">the numerous create-a-character options in The Veilguard</a> are any indication, Mass Effect's next title will give players even greater control over their character's appearance than before.</p>

			<p>It's been nearly three years since Deadline first <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-deal-nearly-completed-by-amazon-says-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Amazon was closing on a deal to adapt Mass Effect into a TV series for its Prime Video channel. Today, Variety <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/mass-effect-tv-series-amazon-writer-marvel-1236203755/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says</a> that the deal is finally done, featuring Daniel Casey as the writer and executive producer of the show. Casey is known primarily for the screenplay of 2018's Kin, a sci-fi feature film, and 2021's Fast &amp; Furious 9. Neither of which were exactly masterpieces, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Anyway, Variety also reports that Karim Zreik will executive produce under his Cedar Tree Productions banner. Ari Arad and BioWare's Michael Gamble will also executive produce. Zreik has worked on several successful TV series, such as Jericho and a plethora of Marvel shows (Jessica Jones, Daredevil, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, The Defenders, Runaways, The Punisher, The Gifted, Cloak &amp; Dagger, Legion, and Helstrom). Ari Arad has produced several feature film adaptations, such as 2004's The Punisher, 2007's Ghost Rider, 2008's Iron Man, 2017's Ghost in the Shell, 2022's Uncharted, and 2024's Borderlands. Finally, Michael Gamble is a BioWare veteran who has worked on every Mass Effect game since the second. He is also leading the project for the next game installment and recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-next-will-stay-photorealistic-and-mature-confirms-executive-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> that it would retain the photorealistic style and mature tone of the previous entries.</p>
<p>No details are currently available on the plot or on the casting. For Prime Video, this is yet another gaming adaptation. They've had massive success with Bethesda's Fallout, of course, and they also <a href="https://wccftech.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza-is-a-live-action-tv-adaptation-of-the-game-series-due-this-october-on-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> Like a Dragon: Yakuza last month. Amazon has two more heavy hitting gaming TV series on the way: <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-officially-coming-from-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">God of War</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-series-confirmed-to-be-coming-to-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tomb Raider</a>.</p>
<p>As for Mass Effect, today is N7 Day, so it's a good day for fans to get this near-announcement. There won't be much else, given that BioWare has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> Dragon Age: The Veilguard, beyond a return of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-adds-cross-save-brings-back-mass-effects-normandy-on-n7-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collaboration with No Man's Sky</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-177-weapons/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a blog post highlighting everything coming to Warzone and Black Ops 6 in season one, it was revealed that the battle royale platform will have <strong>177 weapons </strong>for players to choose from. The funny thing is that they’re almost entirely useless as a collective, and players will split their time between just a handful of them.</p>



<p>That collection includes a whopping 33 assault rifles and 30 SMGs.</p>



<p>When is enough enough?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-too-many-weps">Too Many Weps</h2>



<p>Warzone needs something of a reset. Over the years, games have fused with the Warzone ecosystem and had their weapons pulled into the fray, but as time has gone on, it has become increasingly ridiculous. Now, with the delivery of season one, Warzone will have 177 weapons to choose from.</p>



<p>That breakdown looks something like this:</p>



<ul>
<li>Assault Rifles – 33</li>



<li>Battle Rifles – 10</li>



<li>SMGs – 30</li>



<li>Shotguns – 13</li>



<li>LMGs – 16</li>



<li>Marksman Rifles – 17</li>



<li>Sniper Rifles – 16</li>



<li>Pistols – 17</li>



<li>Launchers – 9</li>



<li>Melee – 15</li>
</ul>



<p>The split includes 60 weapons from Modern Warfare III, 77 from MW II, and 40 from Black Ops 6. At some point, something has to give, because surely keeping up the balancing and maintenance on all 177 weapons is getting a bit tiresome for Activision’s teams.</p>



<p>On November 14, Warzone will also get a new Resurgence map named Area 99, a small-form map inspired by Nuketown. It’s set in the Nevada desert and replicates a top-secret weapons testing facility that was built in the 1950s. It’s almost post-apocalyptic in how it looks, and it should play pretty nicely as well.</p>



<p>Also in the season one update, Urzkistan and Rebirth Island will be returning to the Warzone ecosystem.</p>



<p>Next year, we should have our first return to Verdansk since 2021, which will be a monumental moment for Warzone fans worldwide.</p>



<p>What weapons do you use in Warzone? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-e-day-dimaggio-and-ferro/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been five months since Gears of War: E-Day was revealed at the Xbox Games Showcase, and not much else has been said about the project. Today, The Coalition revealed that both John DiMaggio (Marcus Fenix) and Carlos Ferro (Dom Santiago) will be returning to reprise their characters in E-Day.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-glory-days">The Glory Days</h2>



<p>Gears of War surfaced in 2006, and since it dropped, it has spawned several follow-up titles, widely becoming known as one of the best Xbox-exclusive franchises ever created. It has been five years since the last major release in the series, and it could still be a while yet until the next one drops, given that Gears of War: E-Day doesn’t have a release window.</p>



<p>In June, the next game in the Gears of War series was revealed:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Gears of War: E-Day | Official Announce Trailer (In-Engine) - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EC20gLfUHeA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>In a post on social media, the team at The Coalition revealed that both John DiMaggio and Carlos Ferro will be reprising their iconic roles in E-Day:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>On today’s 18th anniversary of Gears of War, we’re proud to share that John DiMaggio and Carlos Ferro are reprising their roles as the iconic voices of Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago in Gears of War: E-Day.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It wouldn’t have been right to have anyone else voice them – especially Marcus Fenix. That gravelly, foreboding tone has been instantly recognisable for almost twenty years.</p>



<p>E-Day will be a prequel of sorts, taking players back to the beginning of the storyline that saw the Locust rise up and lay siege to the world of Sera. The first Gears of War game was the closest we got to that part of the timeline, but now we’re going even further back.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Gears of War E-Day? Let us know your expectations in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24290596/mass-effect-tv-show-amazon-fallout<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After its success with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24126474/fallout-review-amazon-prime-video"><em>Fallout</em></a> and the recently released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24278893/amazon-like-a-dragon-yakuza-prime-tv"><em>Like A Dragon: Yakuza</em> show</a>, <em>Mass Effect</em> is the next game Amazon wants to adapt. According to <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/mass-effect-tv-series-amazon-writer-marvel-1236203755/"><em>Variety</em></a>, a show based on BioWare’s military space opera RPG is officially in production at Amazon MGM Studios. <em>Variety</em> has reported that <em>F9: The Fast Saga </em>writer Daniel Casey has signed on to write the show with BioWare producer Mike Gamble serving as executive produce along with Ari Arad.</p><p>Though BioWare released the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22256806/mass-effect-legendary-edition-pc-ps4-xbox-one-mac-walters-release-date"><em>Mass Effect Legendary Edition</em></a> — a collection of the first three games updated for modern consoles — back in 2021, the <em>Mass Effect</em> series hasn’t had an original entry since the release of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/20/14961928/mass-effect-andromeda-review-xbox-ps4-pc"><em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em></a> back in 2017. After <em>Andromeda</em>, BioWare released <em>Anthem</em>, a live-service action game that was significant departure from the studio’s tradition of making single-player, story-driven RPGs. In 2020, BioWare announced that a new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168973/mass-effect-returns-teaser-trailer-game-awards-2020"><em>Mass Effect</em> game was in-development</a>.</p><p>News of a <em>Mass Effec</em>t TV show comes on what is known as N7 Day, a semi-official, fan-created holiday that celebrates all things <em>Mass Effect</em>. On previous N7 Days, BioWare has teased information about the next game in the series including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/7/23951253/mass-effect-5-helmets-confirmed">a trailer that possibly suggested the return of fan-favorite protagonist Commander Shepard</a> whose story ended with the original trilogy. Though no story details have been revealed about the show, it’s a pretty safe bet to guess it’ll focus on the Commander and I personally can’t wait to see <em>her.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
