            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/crysis-4-development-put-on-hold-as-crytek-confirm-layoffs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Crytek has confirmed a round of layoffs that will affect around 15% of its 400 employees – so around 60 people from the team – and stated that development of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/crysis-4">the next Crysis game</a> was put on hold last year.</p>
<p>“Like so many of our peers, we aren’t immune to the complex, unfavourable market dynamics that have hit our industry these past several years,” the company wrote on social media.</p>


<p>“It pains us greatly to share today that we must lay off an estimated 15 percent of our around 400 employees. The layoffs affect development teams and shared services. This has not been an easy decision to make, as we deeply appreciate the hard work of our talented teams.”</p>
<p>A new Crysis game was in development, but put on hold in Q3 of 2024, with Crytek prioritising the work on their extraction game revamp <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hunt-showdown-1896">Hunt: Showdown 1896</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/26/crysis-4-crytek-china-crysis-battleground/">Crysis 4 was announced back in 2022</a> with a short teaser trailer, the company looking to revive the first person shooter series on the heels of the Crysis trilogy remasters that arrived through 2020 and 2021. However, Crytek was also enjoying some success within the burgeoning extraction shooter genre with Hunt: Showdown, an occult and monster-infused take on the genre.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/25/hunt-showdown-1896-will-replace-the-original-in-august-sunsetting-ps4-and-xbox-one/">Hunt: Showdown 1896 has been a big reboot and sequel to that game</a>, bringing a new generation of Cry Engine to bear on the game (shutting the original down in the process), as well as overhauling the game’s core content. It didn’t strike true for us in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/15/hunt-showdown-1896-review/">Hunt: Showdown 1896 review</a>, but has been a solid evolution for the company.</p>
<p>They continue, “While Hunt: Showdown 1896 is still growing, Crytek cannot continue as before and remain financially sustainable. Even after ongoing efforts to reduce costs and cut operating expenses, we have determined that layoffs are inevitable to move forward. Crytek will offer affected employees severance packages and career assistance services.”</p>
<p>Our thoughts go out to those affected by these layoffs, and hopefully they can find their feet again soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-profitable-sales-2m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy Entertainment has announced that&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>is finally profitable, having recouped its development costs and marketing fees by the end of last year.</p>

<p>According to a new financial <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/inderes-widgets-prod-assets/remedy/attachments/6930dba3-2c3f-41a3-a596-8933ce7c454b/remedy-q4-fy-2024-financial-statement-release.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> covering the full 2024 fiscal year, not only is&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>profitable, but it had also exceeded two million sales at the close of 2024, meaning it's picked up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-sales-control-2-action-rpg" rel="nofollow">another 200,000 sales or so since November</a>.</p>

<p>Back in April 2024, Remedy reported that&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-budget-remedy-financials" rel="nofollow">still hadn't earned back its budget</a>, although the studio said it had "recouped a significant part" of its expenses (stopping short of elaborating on exactly how much).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alan-wake-2-profitable-remedy-combat.jpg?itok=EyzyOjnl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alan-wake-2-profitable-remedy-combat.jpg?itok=S5a8nJed 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>is finally profitable for developer Remedy Entertainment. Hurrah!</figcaption></figure><p>The game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-q3-financials-alan-wake-2" rel="nofollow">inching closer towards profitability</a> as of November, at which point Remedy reported that it had earned back "most" of its development and marketing costs. That leads us to the present moment and&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2</em>'s final crossing of that all-important finish line.</p>

<p>In terms of finances, Remedy says its revenue jumped by 49.3% in 2024 when compared to the previous year, although the company hasn't had a profitable year overall.</p>

<p>That could well be down to the fact that Remedy hasn't released any major games this year (although it did launch two DLC packs for&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2</em>), as well as the company's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-control-franchise-rights" rel="nofollow">acquisition of the rights to&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>from former owner 505 Games</a> back in February last year.</p>

<p>With regards to the fourth quarter of 2024, Remedy says its revenue increased compared to last year's fourth quarter, although once again, profits are down compared to the same period the year prior.</p>

<p><em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>is still on track to launch this year, while&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>entered full production earlier this month and the&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes are "making steady progress". Neither of the latter two have release dates yet, unfortunately.</p>

            <p>Well, this is nice. Remedy's exceptionally good <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> is finally making royalties for the studio for the first time since its release in late 2023, after shifting over 2 million copies. The jubilant news comes from <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/">Remedy latest financial report</a>, as spotted <a href="https://www.vg247.com/alan-wake-2-finally-earning-royalties-for-remedy">by VG247</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alan-wake-2-still-hasnt-quite-made-its-money-back-according-to-remedys-latest-financials">As of September last year</a>, the musical-with-guns had "recouped most of its development and marketing expenses", but still wasn't quite in the green. Since then, they've released both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alan-wake-2s-the-lake-house-is-a-dark-brilliant-parable-on-the-devaluation-of-art-and-artists">The Lake House expansion</a> and physical console editions, which appear to have done the trick. "October saw particularly high activity around Alan Wake 2," says the report.</p>

<p>While I can't definitely say that my own personal word of mouth campaign has helped matters, I <em>did</em> use my best carving knife to write 'Play Alan Wake 2' into all those mangoes I chucked at people in Cardiff town centre, so who's to say who the <em>real</em> Sam Lake is here?</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the report, Remedy provided updates on their projects in progress, namely <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>, "Action RPG" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a>, and their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-are-remaking-max-payne-1-2">Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remasters</a>. In short: yep, still cooking. Firebreak should be out this year, and Control 2 is just gearing up to enter full production. There was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/annapurna-interactives-entire-staff-resign-following-dispute-with-owner">some walkout chaos</a> at Annapurna Interactive last year, but this doesn't seem to have slowed down the deal made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-partner-with-annapurna-to-co-finance-control-2-and-explore-control-and-alan-wake-tv-and-film-adaptations">between them and Remedy</a>.</p>
<p>Max is "making steady progress in full production", too. Love a bit of Max. "It's the best blend of goofy and ridiculous," celebrated Alice Bell (RPS in peace) for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/happy-birthday-to-the-original-bullet-time-superstar-max-payne">original's 20th birthday</a>. "The writing also contains lines like, "The sun set with practiced bravado", which is absolutely incredible. And you can listen in to the idle bitching of your enemies before you round the corner and they notice you, at which point someone will yell, "IT'S PAYNE!" just before you drop into slow motion and watch bullets drift gently past you."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC via Steam and the Microsoft Store.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New Game Plus does what it says on the tin: players can now start a new game on any difficulty previously cleared while carrying over weapons and Ninpo obtained on the previous run. All of these weapons and Ninpo will be reverted to Level 1, however, and as noted, players can't jump straight into a higher difficulty using New Game Plus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another quality of life upgrade arrives in the ability to hide the projectile weapon carried on the player's back. By navigating to the Options menu followed by Game Settings, players can now toggle off and on a "Show Projectile Weapon" option.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for balance changes, Team Ninja has lowered the Hit Points of enemies in Chapter 8 and Chapter 11, raised the number of enemies in Chapter 13 and Chapter 14, and raised the damage dealt by "some of Ayane's attacks."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A handful of bug fixes have been made too, including issues that occurred when playing on high power PCs, game breaking bugs in certain chapters, and more. The full patch notes are available below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-2-black-announced-and-its-out-now">Ninja Gaiden Black 2 was a surprise release during the January Xbox Developer Direct</a>.

I always approach From Software titles with a methodical and slow style. When I started playing this game, everything felt like it was in fast-forward so it felt very unnatural for a little while. Is that [impact on longtime fans] something that you thought about when designing the game?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Junya Ishizaki</strong>: One of the initial game concepts for Nightreign stemmed from creating a new sense of battle. I was a battle designer on Elden Ring and previous From titles; I wanted to take that in a new direction and try something new and fresh with the battle. But I wanted to do something new and expand on that. So, taking the battle systems of Elden Ring and expanding on those and changing the tempo was something we put great importance on when creating Nightreign.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What has it been like to have your scope expanded beyond the battle [elements of a game]? Now you are custodian of an entire gameplay experience.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Of course coming from a battle designer to a director of a game brings with it a lot more freedom. I have to make a lot more decisions. I have to look at a lot more of what's going on in other areas of the game. But this new freedom and this new scope is very liberating and very fun, but also quite challenging. Obviously there are many, many staff involved and a lot of people with different opinions that you have to take into account. But that aspect is especially interesting and it helped me to understand this new difficulty in making games. But it's not just about designing the battle, even on Elden Ring, while I was assisting with that. It was intended to make the game more interesting as a whole, so being able to translate that into a directorial role has been really fulfilling and really interesting.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441449-nighreign%282%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4441449" data-ratio="0.61764705882353" data-width="2176" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441449-nighreign%282%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4441449"></a><figcaption>In Nightreign, you take on challenges as a member of a squad of three.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441449-nighreign%282%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>I was trying to pay attention to how core principles or design decisions that are unique to From Software are manifesting in this game. One of the important ones is a sense of self-growth, where you learn and overcome challenges. From your perspective, where in Nightreign's gameplay loop is that found? And how do you account for implementing that when there are randomized elements?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">First of all, thank you for your comments about our games. It sounds like you are quite familiar with them and you understand them to quite a deep degree. And as you say, this kind of self-growth of the player that we sort of put a lot of trust in them to learn and to overcome these challenges. That is a crucial aspect of Nightreign, as well.</p><p dir="ltr">We would say one way in which it differs from previous titles and Elden Ring is the player planning aspect. So in something like Elden Ring, it's a lot more of a long play. You have an extended experience and extended journey which culminates eventually in a boss battle. But for Nightreign, it's something that is a little bit more on the fly--it's a little bit more loose and it's a little bit more ad-lib. Players have to make these decisions and change their build and, maybe even their play style, on the fly while they're going through this gameplay loop. So we feel like this will provide a new way for the player to learn and to grow during their adventure with Nightreign.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Was the battle royale format always the framework that you wanted to work within or was there experimentation and you arrived at that format being the best place for your style of game and the game you wanted to make?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The battle royale-type structure was not considered to be the base of the game. It wasn't a starting point, it was something that sort of took shape, or elements of these games took shape during development of Nightreign. For instance, the Ring of Reign that closes in around the field is definitely something that players will be familiar with, but it wasn't there from the start. It's something that we implemented in order to encourage that movement and to guide the player's route through the map, and encourage their decision-making. That's something that we tried and we thought it worked well, so it stuck.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Many parts of what I experienced in Nightreign were the complete opposite of what I come to From Software games for. I'm one of those people who really loves the feeling of isolation and then I start playing this and immediately I've got two friends next to me. Was there ever a worry that this could impact the tone of the game or how From Software usually present their games in terms of atmosphere?</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4441448-elden-ring-nightreign-trailer-cover.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4441448" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4441448-elden-ring-nightreign-trailer-cover.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4441448"></a><figcaption>You can glide above the world in Nightreign.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4441448-elden-ring-nightreign-trailer-cover.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">We definitely appreciate that players like yourself got into the tone and that sort of sense of isolation when enjoying these games. And we do want to feel like the tone is not too divided from Elden Ring in terms of atmosphere and setting. However, [for] players who might otherwise be intimidated by Elden Ring's structure and facing that deep dark world alone, we feel like this is an opportunity for them to find a more approachable experience and just jump right into the action.</p><p dir="ltr">And also, while it's designed as a multiplayer game and you are likely to find playing among other people, we do feel like this is a game that you can queue up for solo. And in matchmaking, if you have matchmaking set, you can all go your different ways on the map and you can spread out and do your own thing. You don't <em>have</em> to babysit one another, but eventually it will culminate in this shared experience of a cooperative boss battle. While it is a multiplayer game, we want this to feel like a loose and flexible experience that retains some of that feeling of isolation and feeling of going off into the unknown on your own, too.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>One of the things that I thought was interesting was the way that over the course of a run I experienced pretty much every foundational and important aspect of a role-playing game experience and also a From Software experience. There was exploration, character development, a challenge to overcome, for example. I know this is something that you've talked about before but what was the thinking behind that and how difficult was it to achieve that?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">One thing about these games is that there's an awful lot of weapons and equipment and player actions to choose from. And when making Nightreign, we wanted to figure out a new way in which players could have access to these and enjoy these in a different way. Of course, each player has their own preference and maybe they go into the game with a prerequisite of what sort of character they're going to build and what kind of weapon they want to use, so obviously they will have a lot of things that they're unfamiliar with and that they don't necessarily like using or don't necessarily go in with an intent to use. But we wanted players to feel more comfortable and like they were able to approach the things they don't know and aren't familiar with a lot easier in Nightreign. We wanted to keep this large selection of weapons and abilities very open and available to use, and free for players to experiment with and mix and match with. We wanted this to be one of the driving factors of Nightreign's gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, just because of the wealth of parameters in this game, you have to choose your character attributes, you have to choose your weapon, how that weapon performs, that weapon's attributes. One of the challenges involved in implementing this was [how it] creates a whole lot of moving parts. And while we wanted to streamline that in a way, if you streamline and cut back too much that starts to lose the fun and lose the element of interest and surprise. And so it was a difficult balancing act to try to get these two things to live in harmony with one another, the streamlining and this experimentation. But we feel like we've landed in a good place with the final product.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441450-nighreign%283%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4441450" data-ratio="0.61764705882353" data-width="2176" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441450-nighreign%283%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4441450"></a><figcaption>Looking cool is always the number one priority in a Souls-like.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441450-nighreign%283%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>When I was picking a character, it felt like I could identify certain archetypes of characters that I'm familiar with: healer, soldier, tank, and so on. But then when I got into the game and noticed there were very few restrictions on what I could use and how I could craft that build from that point on, it was an interesting experience because then I felt a little more free to experiment. At the same time, I was a little confused about what my role should be on the team. Do you expect people to try and fulfill roles or do you expect people to just build who they want and try to find the synergy?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Yes, this is something we were conscious of during development. Of course, you have some of these character archetypes, like the guardian, who, just from their looks and from their abilities and from the outset, you understand, "Oh, this is probably closest to a tank-type character." Players want to dive in with that mindset and this was, of course, intentional. But we didn't want players to feel restricted by that archetype or by that role. We wanted to keep the essence of these games that allow you to be loose and change up your play style, change up your equipment on the fly, and change as you go through. We wanted to really emphasize that with Nightreign, so we didn't want to restrict that too much. So while players can approach this from a role-playing or a team role aspect, we didn't want to restrict them too much in that sense. We wanted to keep it quite flexible. This was very intentional.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How did you come up with the abilities for the Nightfarers? Some of them are really interesting. Like Duchess, for example, being able to repeat damage. The Recluse has a really cool ability where you siphoning magic from around you and building a spell. Where did that idea come from? And if it's just, "my brain," then silly question on my part.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Yeah. Essentially these ideas came from myself and the team. We tried our best to think up some original and unique abilities for each character. A lot of us, myself included, play a lot of games. We love gaming, we love doing battle with these enemies in different ways [in] different titles. And so when we designed these characters and these abilities our main focus was, "Well, what's fun about using them? Why do we enjoy the feeling of using these abilities?" With the Recluse, they're a magic-oriented character. So what's fun about using magic? It's using your intelligence. It's using your brain, and figuring out the enemy's weak point, and figuring out how to use your magic effectively. So a lot of the characters were designed, and the abilities were designed with this at the forefront; just thinking what's fun about being this role and how we can effectively translate that into game feel.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="2117306062" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

also interesting. I have a one-track mind, so if I know I like great swords, anything that doesn't look like a great sword is getting filtered out of my brain, usually. But with this system, I was forced to pay attention to everything. And, even if I had no intention of using it, I'd still grab things because there was a buff I wanted. What was the thinking behind that?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The passives that you speak of tie back to the aspect of balancing the game between the overwhelming amount of parameters and wanting to have a fun feeling of experimentation and changing on the fly. The passives were something that offered that variety and that ability to experiment. It's something that we landed on quite early in development [and] we wanted to keep that going forward as a solution to that balance problem.</p><p dir="ltr">Also, from a balancing perspective in terms of the meta gameplay, we want players to feel like there was something there that they could tap into, get really crazy combinations, and figure out how they could synergize their build with these passives and their equipment and their abilities. This was just another element that allowed us to really imagine the player possibilities.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Attacking your teammates also heals them when they're downed. I had this moment where I was trying a katana but I had a halberd in my back pocket specifically just to revive my teammate because it has a good sweeping attack and, if I needed to, I could hit them from a distance while also hitting the enemy, which was really cool. How did you come up with the idea of attacking your friends to heal them?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">When designing the revival with this being a multiplayer game and having allies close by in mind, we did consider several traditional methods such as approaching your downed ally and holding a revive button--things like this. But we felt like a lot of these didn't quite maintain that sense of tension and that sense of focus in battle that we wanted to keep; that flow of battle in Nightreign. So when considering this, again, from a character perspective and what feels good, one of the more obvious conclusions we landed on was, well, we have a wide variety of attacks and abilities, why don't we try to leverage those? And this is just something that we tried throughout the course of development and it felt like it was working well. People responded well to it, and so we started to build on that.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1897336102" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

like that. Is there a concrete explanation for why this is happening and is it part of the story or is it just one of those things where it's for gameplay reasons or it's a good use of assets that already exist?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The primary reason for these existing bosses in Nightreign is from a gameplay perspective. Of course, with this new structure and with this new style of game, we needed a lot of different bosses. We needed a lot to add to this mix, so we wanted to leverage what we deemed appropriate from our previous titles.</p><p dir="ltr">We obviously understand that our players have a lot of affection for these characters and they have a lot of fond memories of battling them in these games, so we didn't want to encroach too much on that lore aspect. We wanted them to make sense within the atmosphere and vibe of Elden Ring Nightreign.</p><p dir="ltr">But mainly from a gameplay perspective, we wanted to incorporate these bosses, make adjustments to them to suit the gameplay of Nightreign and to make sure they felt at home. But it was more so from a numbers perspective. And just to add to that quickly, also from a personal standpoint, I thought it'd be kind of fun. So that's one simple reason why we included some of these old bosses.</p>

                <p>Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo have released the biggest update for Ninja Gaiden 2 Black yet. Specifically, the update adds modern features like New Game+ and photo mode, which weren't nearly as prevalent when Ninja Gaiden 2 was originally released.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ninja-gaiden-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-33086">Ninja Gaiden 2</a> launched for Xbox 360 in 2008. In January, an Unreal Engine 5 remake called Ninja Gaiden 2 Black shadow-dropped during Xbox's Developer Direct showcase following the announcement of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4/" data-ref-id="5000-659496">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>. Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is faithful to the game it's a remake of, but did add some more modern features, like easier difficulty modes. Now, the developers are expanding that new feature set further in the latest patch.</p><p>This update, which is Ver 1.003.000 on PS5 and Ver 1.0.7.0 on PC and Xbox Series X|S, adds three new features: New Game+, Photo Mode, and the ability to hide Ryu's projectile weapon. New Game+ allows people to replay Ninja Gaiden 2 Black with all the weapons and Ninpo they obtained during the adventure. They will all be reverted to Level 1, though, so players won't be completely overpowered heading into New Game+.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4442783-ninjagaidenblack2combat.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442783" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4442783-ninjagaidenblack2combat.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442783"></a><figcaption>Players will now be able to hide the bow on Ryu's back during gampelay.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4442783-ninjagaidenblack2combat.jpg"></figure><p>The other two features can be found in the options menu. Photo Mode gives players an easier way to take screenshots of what they are playing, while a "Show Projectile Weapon" option in the Game Settings sub-menu allows players to toggle whether or not they want the weapons to appear on Ryu's back during gameplay, which should be useful if they're using one of the bigger projectile weapons but want better visibility during combat.</p><p>This update makes some other adjustments and bug fixes, so you can check out the <a href="https://teamninja-studio.com/ng2black/us/update/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">full list of patch notes</a> below:</p><h3>Additional Content:</h3><ul><li>New Game+<br>Added the ability to begin a new game on a difficulty level you have previously cleared with the weapons and Ninpo you obtained in your previous playthrough already unlocked. When starting a new game this way, your weapons and Ninpo will be reverted to level 1.</li><li>Photo Mode<br>Added Photo Mode to the in-game Options Menu. You can move the camera around within a set limit to take screenshots.</li><li>Ability to Hide Projectile Weapon<br>Added a "Show Projectile Weapon" option under "Game Settings" in the Options Menu, which allows you to hide your projectile weapon while it is carried on your back.</li></ul><h3>Adjustments:</h3><ul><li>Lowered the HP of enemies in Ch. 8, "City of the Fallen Goddess"</li><li>Lowered the HP of enemies in Ch. 11, "Night in the City of Water"</li><li>Raised the number of enemies in Ch. 13, "The Temple of Sacrifice"</li><li>Raised the number of enemies in Ch. 14, "A Tempered Gravestone"</li><li>Raised the damage dealt by some of Ayane's attacks.</li></ul><h3>Bug Fixes:</h3><ul><li>Fixed control issues that occurred when playing at over 120 FPS or while under high computing load.</li><li>Fixed an issue where controllers would not vibrate based on computing load or FPS settings.</li><li>Fixed bugs that caused the player to go out of bounds during certain chapters.</li><li>Fixed bugs that made it impossible to progress during certain chapters.</li><li>Fixed a bug which caused the game to crash during long play sessions.</li><li>Other minor bug fixes</li></ul><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-2-black-drops-today-included-in-xbox-game-pass/1100-6528989/" data-ref-id="1100-6528989">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a> is is available now for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S and is part of the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate game catalog.</p>

                <p>Finnish game developer Remedy has released its <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=de036915-53b0-4bfc-8564-7ce4872914e5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">latest earnings report</a>, and included in the filing are some key updates for the developer's upcoming games. Perhaps the two biggest takeaways are the confirmation that Control 2 has now entered full production, while Alan Wake 2 has finally recouped its development costs after selling 2 million copies.</p><p>In its filing, Remedy said Control 2 "entered full production" in February 2025. "The project has verified the velocity of asset creation, established production pipelines, and is ready for scaling up for production," the developer said.</p><p>Entering the "full production" phase is a significant milestone for any project. Another high-profile game, CD Projekt Red's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a>, entered the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-is-now-officially-in-production-new-teaser-image-revealed/1100-6528058/" data-ref-id="1100-6528058">full production phase of development</a> at the end of 2024.</p><p>As announced previously, Annapurna is funding 50% of Control 2's budget, and that budget has never been disclosed and likely never will be. Annapurna is co-funding the game as part of a deal that will see Annapurna help bring Remedy's Control and Alan Wake franchises to film and TV. The Chinese gaming giant Tencent is also an investor in Remedy and its upcoming projects.</p><p>These other upcoming games include FBC: Firebreak, a multiplayer game launching in 2025 that is self-published by Remedy, as well as remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2 in partnership with Rockstar Games. Firebreak and the remakes are both now in full production.</p><p>As for Alan Wake 2, the game has now sold 2 million copies and has begun to accrue royalties for Remedy. As recently as November 2024, the game remained unprofitable for Remedy. Epic Games <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/record-year-for-remedy-despite-no-new-game-releases" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">funded Alan Wake 2</a> with the agreement being that once development and publishing costs were made back, further revenue would be split between Epic and Remedy.</p>

<p>Once players survive two nighttime boss fights, they will face one of eight Nightlords.</p>
<p>Since its initial announcement, further details on Nightreign have been revealed such as the inclusion of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-will-feature-enemies-from-dark-souls-director-confirms">bosses from previous Dark Souls games</a> and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-elden-ring-nightreign-will-have-a-poison-swamp-but-in-fortnite-style-map-changes">poisoned swamp area through randomised map changes</a>.</p>
<p>While three players are needed at all times, publisher Bandai Namco has confirmed solo players will be able to play either offline completely alone (without AI companions), or will be matched with others online to form a team of three. Players can queue online solo, as a pair (to be joined by a third), or as an established group of three.</p>
<p>I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush">hands-on with Nightreign</a> recently and despite initial trepidation over a multiplayer-focused <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> game, I came away impressed by its fast pace - thanks to its parkour system and streamlined levelling - and sense of teamwork against classic bosses.</p>
<p>"Nightreign provides a delectable hit of Elden Ring in a repeatable microcosm," I wrote. "It's got the difficulty, the levelling, the boss battles, and the sense of discovery, but all at high speed for a new type of challenge, while its grim enemy selection is like a best-of Souls mixtape I'm itching to replay."</p>
<p>Players can go hands-on with the same build themselves during the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-beta-test-dates-times-register">Nightreign beta test this weekend</a>, at least for those who previously registered. The test will last from Friday 14th February to Monday 17th February as a series of three hour long sessions.</p>
<p>The beta test will include four out of the final eight Nightfarers, set playable heroes each with unique skills: Wylder (all-rounder), The Guardian (tank), The Recluse (mage), and The Duchess (rogue).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crytek-layoffs-hunt-showdown<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Crysis&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown&nbsp;</em>developer Crytek has laid off around 60 employees, citing the same "complex, unfavorable market dynamics" that have claimed jobs across many of the studio's peers in recent months.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/Crytek/status/1889623029723885913" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on X</a>, Crytek says it isn't "immune" to said market conditions, confirming that it's laying off "an estimated 15% of [its] around 400 employees". Layoffs at the studio will, Crytek says, "affect development teams and shared services".</p>

<p>According to Crytek, development on the upcoming next installment in the&nbsp;<em>Crysis&nbsp;</em>series was put on indefinite hold in the third quarter of last year, and since then, the studio has been "trying to shift developers over" to <em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hunt-showdown-sequel-esrb-leak-rumor" rel="nofollow">updated relaunch of PvPvE shooter&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown</em></a>.</p>

The studio says it first explored other avenues for cost reduction before determining that layoffs were "inevitable to move forward".</p>

<p>Affected employees will, according to Crytek, receive "severance packages and career assistance services".</p>

<p>Crytek finishes its statement by reaffirming its belief in&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>, confirming that it remains "fully committed" to the game's continuing "operation". If you're playing&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896&nbsp;</em>right now, it sounds like you don't need to worry about the game being affected by these layoffs.</p>

<p>Crytek's round of layoffs are the latest in a long line of staff cuts, studio closures, and project cancellations in the last year or two. Big companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Sony</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Take-Two</a> have been affected, alongside <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">plenty</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/midnight-society-shutdown-dr-disrespect" rel="nofollow">smaller studios</a>.</p>

            <p>Ex-Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has called a 2021 petition signed by over a thousand Activision Blizzard employees to remove him as CEO "fake", and suggests that harassment claims and legal cases brought against Activision Blizzard were engineered by the Communication Workers of Union in a bid to attract new members. Kotick made the comments during an appearance on <a href="https://youtu.be/D2urSgcuyyo">Grit</a>, a business podcast by American venture capital company <a href="https://www.kleinerperkins.com/">Kleiner Perkins</a>. He appeared on the podcast with former EA CEO Bing Gordon (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-previously-had-the-worst-ceo-in-gaming-ex-activision-boss-says/1100-6529409/">Gamespot</a>), to talk about both their company histories.</p>
<p>Kotick's statements reference widely reported incidents alleging a company culture of harassment, intimidation, and pay inequity around the time - coinciding with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-blizzard-sued-by-california-over-alleged-culture-of-sexual-harassment-and-discrimination">a lawsuit against the company</a> - and the petition referred to appears to be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789679/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-employees-petition-removal">this one to remove him as CEO</a>, which attracted over a thousand signatures.</p>
<p>That <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-blizzard-employees-demand-ceo-bobby-koticks-removal-amid-several-new-abuse-allegations">petition</a> followed a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680">report by the Wall Street Journal</a> (paywalled) that highlighted several alleged incidents of harassment by Activision staff, alongside reports that Kotick was aware of these allegations but did not inform the company's board of directors, and intervened to prevent the firing of an alleged harasser. It wasn't just Activision workers who found these claims alarming: a group of company shareholders <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-activision-blizzard-shareholder-group-want-bobby-kotick-removed">called for Kotick's resignation soon after</a>. Kotick denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>After being prompted "2021" by Kotick, the podcast host Joubin Mirzadega says "peak social activism in the workplace," in reference to that time period. "There was a petition. Like, a thousand people signed it."</p>
<p>"That was fake," says Kotick.</p>
<p>"The board. The independent auditors. Everybody was like: this guy's doing nothing wrong," Mirzadega goes on, confirming that a petition against Kotick is the subject of the conversation.</p>
<p>Kotick then expands the discussion to encompass the wider claims of workplace misconduct at Activision Blizzard. Some background on that first: the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing filed a lawsuit in summer 2021 following two years of investigation by the DFEH. The lawsuit alleged that the company's culture was "a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women". A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-blizzard-will-pay-55m-to-settle-sex-discrimination-lawsuit">$54.875m settlement was eventually reached</a> in December 2023, with the state department saying that "no court or any independent investigation has substantiated any allegations [of] systemic or widespread sexual harassment at Activision Blizzard".</p>
<p>In an additional statement made to RPS at the time, an Activision Blizzard spokesperson commented that "the CRD (previously DFEH) has acknowledged that no court or independent investigation substantiated any allegations that 'Activision Blizzard’s Board of Directors, including its Chief Executive Officer, Robert Kotick, acted improperly with regard to the handling of any instances of workplace misconduct.'”</p>
<p>In this week's Grit podcast, Kotick argues that the harassment claims and legal case against Activision Blizzard were, in fact, engineered by the Communication Workers of Union in a bid to attract new members.</p>
<p>"I can tell you exactly what happened," he says. "The Communication Workers of America Union started looking at technology. They kept losing because they represented the news guild, Comcast, and they realised they were losing members at a really dramatic rate, so they gotta figure out: how do they get new union members? So they targeted a bunch of different businesses. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Workers_Union">Google</a>. Some other tech companies. Tesla, SpaceX and us."</p>
<p>"It's the power of unions," Kotick continues. "I didn't really understand this until we went through this process. They were able to get a government agency, the EEOC and a state employment agency called the Department Of Fair Employment And Housing, to file fake lawsuits against us and Riot Games making allegations about the workplace that weren't true."</p>
<p>Some further context about Riot: in 2022, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-games-to-pay-100-million-in-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-settlement">agreed to pay out $100 million</a> to settle a class-action suit brought against them for "systemic sex discrimination and harassment", after both the DFEH and the California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement objected to an original $10m proposed settlement.</p>
<p>"They're so clever," Kotick continued on the podcast. "They realized that would be a thing where they could come into a company - because we pay well, we have great benefits - and they could say, hey, the culture is bad! People are harassed or they’re retaliated against. There's discrimination. The guy and the lady who ran CWA, they are really smart." Kotick is likely referring to Chris Shelton and Sara Stephens here, the president and secretary-treasurer of the CWA at the time.</p>
<p>"They came up with this plan, hired a PR firm, and they started attacking our company. They got these two agencies to file these lawsuits to claim there was some sexual harassment. We didn't have any of that. Ultimately they had to admit that this was not truthful."</p>
<p>"Did you know this was all happening?" asks Mirzadega.</p>
<p>"I've seen in another company they knew in advance," adds Gordon, without specifying the company in question. "A lot of the press was made up by union activists."</p>
<p>"I didn't know any of it," says Kotick. "I'm one of those people. I think it's probably from my upbringing, but when I heard about things that were inappropriate conduct in the workplace, I just fired people. Like on the spot. My view is: you don't want to have a culture where there was any kind of discrimination, retaliation, misconduct. It's bad for recruiting and its bad for retention."</p>
<p>"I mean, think about it. I dated Sheryl Sandberg," he laughs. "You think we had a problem with pay equity and gender pay at Activision? She literally wouldn't do a<a href="https://leanin.org/circles"> 'lean in circle</a>' at the company until I showed her our pay equity fillings."</p>
<p>If Kotick's suggestion here is that his association with ex-Meta COO Sandberg - who has advocated for equal representation in the workplace - is proof that the allegations against him are unfounded, it's perhaps worth noting that Sandberg herself is the subject of allegations that she worked with Kotick to shut down reports about his treatment of women. According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sandberg-facebook-kotick-activision-blizzard-daily-mail-11650549074">a 2022 report</a> by the Wall Street Journal, Sandberg allegedly pressured UK tabloid The Daily Mail to drop stories about a restraining order against Kotick from an ex-girlfriend, while Kotick and Sandberg were dating.</p>
<p>"Working with a team that included Facebook and Activision employees as well as paid outside advisers," wrote the WSJ, "Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Kotick developed a strategy to persuade the Daily Mail not to report on the restraining order, first when they began dating in 2016 and again around the time they were breaking up in 2019, the people said. Among other concerns, Ms. Sandberg’s legal and public-relations advisers, both inside and outside Facebook, worried that a story would reflect negatively on her reputation as an advocate for women."</p>
<p>Kotick denied the allegations and the ex-girlfriend later retracted some of her claims.</p>
<p>As well as detailing several instances of abuse by employees within Activision Blizzard, the Wall Street Journal article also highlighted other instances where Kotick himself has been sued for alleged misconduct. In 2006, one of his assistants "complained that he had harassed her, including by threatening in a voice mail to have her killed." Kotick reportedly settled the matter out of court. "Mr. Kotick quickly apologized 16 years ago for the obviously hyperbolic and inappropriate voice mail, and he deeply regrets the exaggeration and tone in his voice mail to this day," an Activision spokesperson told the WSJ.</p>
<p>Kotick has also faced suggestions that he considered buying out press to ensure positive coverage for Activision. In 2022, another Wall Street Journal report wrote that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-blizzard-will-pay-55m-to-settle-sex-discrimination-lawsuit">Kotick suggested buying Kotaku or PC Gamer</a> to "change the narrative" around the company. From <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-blizzard-microsoft-deal-11642557922">the WSJ</a>:</p>
<blockquote>"Mr. Kotick has been eager to change the public narrative about the company, and in recent weeks has suggested Activision Blizzard make some kind of acquisition, including of gaming-trade publications like Kotaku and PC Gamer, according to people familiar with him. The Activision spokeswoman, Ms. Klasky, disputed that Mr. Kotick wanted to make the acquisitions. A spokesman for G/O Media, the parent company of Kotaku, declined to comment. PC Gamer didn’t respond to a request for comment."</blockquote>
<p>We've reached out to the CWA for comment on all this.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Directors don’t get better as they get older. Usually the worst films in their filmography are those last four at the end. I am all about my filmography, and one bad film f*cks up three good ones.”</p><p>While the truth of his argument is certainly up for debate and veteran filmmakers like Scorsese and Eastwood are attempting to prove him wrong, Tarantino is apparently sticking to his guns and is now just one film away from retirement. At this point, it would be nearly impossible for one bad film to sully his filmography, one of the most respected of all time. But just because all of his movies have been good, that doesn’t mean they’ve all been movies we’d want to watch again. Here’s every single one of Quentin Tarantino’s movies, ranked by how often we’d want to rewatch them. </p></div></div><div><p><em>Death Proof</em> always felt like the acclaimed director scratching off “make an homage to 1970s grindhouse films” from his bucket list. The sadistic Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) uses his “death-proof” stunt car to kill women, at least until he meets his match in a group of female friends who work on a film crew, including—Kim (Tracie Thoms), Abernathy (Rosario Dawson), and stuntwoman Zoë Bell (as herself). The grainy film effects contribute to the feeling that you’re watching a lost gem, and Bell riding on the hood of Mike’s car is one of the best action sequences in any Tarantino film. But the masterful dialogue Tarantino movies are known for is missing, the short runtime leaves Mike feeling underdeveloped, and the film simply has the unorganized feel of an experiment rather than a coherent thought.</p><p>If you don’t like me calling <em>Death Proof</em> Tarantino’s worst film, take it up with Tarantino yourself because he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://screenrant.com/death-proof-quentin-tarantino-worst-movie/?utm_source=chatgpt.com&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://screenrant.com/death-proof-quentin-tarantino-worst-movie/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feels the exact same way</a></span>.</p></div><div><p>Samuel L. Jackson, the most frequently recurring actor in Tarantino’s films, delivers his best performance in any of them as Major Marquis Warren in <em>The Hateful Eight</em>, a Western packed with Tarantino’s signature shifting character dynamics, sudden massacres, and controversial race commentary. It follows a group of strangers—two bounty hunters, a fugitive, a former Confederate general, and a mysterious executioner—trapped in a Wyoming lodge during a blizzard, where paranoia and hidden agendas lead to betrayal and brutal violence. While Jackson, Kurt Russell, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, and Walton Goggins anchor the star-studded ensemble, the film struggles under its own weight, with an uneven pace  preventing every character from fully shining despite its nearly three-hour runtime. Though <em>The Hateful Eight</em> is a compelling Tarantino experience, it feels more like a film you watch when craving Tarantino’s style, rather than for the movie itself.</p></div><div><p><em>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood </em>might be Tarantino’s most overrated film. It’s inexplicably the only film of his that has ever been nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, and is often ranked way too high on the list of Tarantino’s best films. There’s nothing wrong with a character-driven movie where there’s no real end goal to look towards, but the results of Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt playing a washed-up actor and his stunt double as they adjust to a changing film industry are a bit boring. I understand the film is largely Tarantino’s love letter to 1960s Hollywood, but its replayability is hurt by the fact that if you aren’t entertained by the characters, there’s not enough story to keep your attention. </p></div><div><p>Given Tarantino’s cavalier history with race, including having himself unnecessarily say the N-word in a <em>Pulp Fiction </em>cameo, a movie about a slave enacting revenge on a plantation owner should’ve been oozing with cringe. While <em>Django Unchained</em> has moments of skip-worthy awkwardness, like a bit in which wannabe Klu Klux Klan members are painted as funny idiots for arguing over the quality of their masks, this movie still delivers a stirring story of perseverance and family. Jamie Foxx as Django gives one of the most charismatic performances ever in a Tarantino film, nimbly balancing the stoicism necessary to watch a slave be mauled to death in front of him with the emotional vulnerability to convey the internal struggle of watching that moment without helping. At 165 minutes, <em>Django Unchained </em>is the second longest Tarantino film, and the questionable race commentary makes it a difficult watch at times, but it’s still a fine movie to watch multiple times if you’re in the mood to see slaveowners get their comeuppance. </p></div><div><p><em>Inglorious Basterds </em>isn’t Tarantino’s best film, but it’s his grandest in scope. His revisionist retelling of the end of World War II is centered on two sprawling revenge plots against the Nazis: one on an intimate, personal scale with Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent) avenging the death of her family, and another on a more epic scale, with a ragtag team of American soldiers known as “The Basterds” led by Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt). Tarantino’s knack for personalizing spectacle is one of his greatest talents, and turning fierce Nazi villains into caricatures of themselves offers a fresh perspective on a horrific time. This is one of the Tarantino films with so much to dissect and enjoy that it requires multiple viewings to fully appreciate. </p></div><div><p>Before <em>Kill Bill Vol. 1 </em>and <em>Vol. 2</em>, before <em>Death Proof</em>, and before <em>Inglorious Basterds</em>, <em>Jackie Brown </em>was Tarantino’s first female-led film, and it remains a shining achievement in his undeniable legacy. Pam Grier is as fierce and domineering as she’s ever been in this ‘90s classic about flight attendant/drug smuggler Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) double-crossing everyone from the gunrunner she worked for (Samuel L. Jackson yet again) to the cops she worked with to try and take him down. This is a film you can watch every weekend for the grounded intimacy between Jackie and her bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster), the realistic suspense, and one for the best music choices in any Tarantino film. </p></div><div><p>I’m here to end any and all debates: The undisputed greatest character that has ever materialized from Tarantino’s genius mind is Beatrix “the Bride” Kiddo, played to brutal perfection by Uma Thurman. No Tarantino classic is rooted in one character’s performance quite like <em>Kill Bill Vol. 1</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>aside from its even better sequel. This film has everything you want from a Tarantino film —- visually arresting bloodbaths, smart and snarky dialogue, a stylized revenge story, and a world so thoroughly fleshed out that people are still asking for Tarantino to return to it. </p></div><div><p>Tarantino initially conceptualized <em>Kill Bill Vol. 1 </em>and <em>Kill Bill Vol. 2</em> as one big movie, which would’ve easily been his greatest cinematic achievement. As opposed to <em>Kill Bill Vol. 1</em>'s fast-paced thriller vibe, <em>Vol. 2 </em>is a slower tale of fatal love between Beatrix “the Bride” Kiddo (Uma Thurman) and the center of her revenge plots, Bill (David Carradine). In one climactic scene, Bill delivers one of the most salient observations ever on Superman, and the “Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique” is both a moment of triumph for Beatrix and a heartbreaking end to the painful history of these former lovers. No other Tarantino movie balances near-perfect dialogue with a complicated love story and gripping action quite like <em>Kill Bill Vol. 2</em>, a movie everyone should watch once a year. </p></div><div><p><em>Pulp Fiction</em> might have the second most replay value of any Tarantino film. It’s not just one of his most famous movies, but also the one that made him a household name, influencing countless filmmakers and pop culture moments. <em>Pulp Fiction</em> earns its place because of its perfect balance of humor, violence, and endlessly quotable dialogue. The film’s nonlinear structure makes every viewing feel fresh, as different pieces of the puzzle come together in new ways each time. Even though it’s nearly three hours long, there’s never a dull moment, thanks to iconic scenes like the diner conversation between Jules Winfield (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta),<strong>&nbsp;</strong>the overdose of Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman)<strong>, </strong> and Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) seeking samurai sword revenge after one of the most disturbing scenes in any Tarantino film<strong>.</strong> It’s the kind of movie you can drop in and out of at any point and still enjoy, making it one of the easiest Tarantino films to revisit over and over.</p></div><div><p>Don’t overthink it, <em>Reservoir Dogs</em> has the most replay value of any Tarantino film, no contest. No other movie in his filmography is as tight, raw, and endlessly rewatchable as this stripped-down heist-gone-wrong masterpiece. This film has everything you want from Tarantino—snappy, razor-sharp dialogue, a nonlinear story that reveals new layers with every watch, characters so well-drawn you feel like you’re sitting in that warehouse with them, and tension so thick it never loses its edge. While later Tarantino films grew bigger and bolder, <em>Reservoir Dogs</em> remains pure, undiluted Tarantino<strong>,</strong> proving that sometimes, all you need is a room full of criminals, a bag of stolen diamonds, and a whole lot of betrayal to make a classic.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Remedy Entertainment, the creator of Alan Wake 2, released its financial results today, revealing that the game has sold over 2 million units.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remedy revealed what actions it took in the second half of 2024 to help Alan Wake 2 reach the milestone of 2 million copies sold. The developers first released The Lake House expansion in October, which received a positive reception. In addition, players received a physical retail release for Alan Wake 2 Deluxe Edition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few months later, the developers provided a PlayStation 5 Pro update for the game, alongside other updates to improve the game’s quality across all platforms. Lastly, they released a physical Collectors Edition for enthusiasts in partnership with Limited Run Games. Thanks to these actions, Alan Wake 2 enjoyed long-term sales and recouped the costs incurred. Remedy “has started to accrue royalties” from the game’s sales towards the end of 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remedy also outlined <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=de036915-53b0-4bfc-8564-7ce4872914e5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">its plans</a> for Alan Wake and Control, which are linked through the Remedy Connected Universe. The upcoming games in these franchises will be self-published, and growing and expanding them is the key focus for their future. The developers aim to “be a highly regarded creative studio with sustainable, significant commercial success” by the end of 2030.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>“As always, having ZUN-san make a cover of one of my songs is a dream come true… What!? I have to make a song, too!?” said Toby Fox in a press release. “This time I took the original Megalovania and did bone-lengthening surgery on it to transform it into a cover of Necrofantasia. People might call it lazy, but it is pretty cool. … You know, just like Sans or Yukari. So you can’t complain. By the way, this has nothing to do with the song… But personally, I was really concerned about Sans, a male character, showing up in the female-dominated world of <em>Touhou</em>. Therefore, I made him wear girl’s clothing. Thanks everyone. (Hey! That didn’t fix anything!)”</p><p><em>Undertale</em> lead artist Temmie Chang added, “The song was really cool and gave me a lot of energy and a feeling of nostalgia to a time that’s passed, but meant much to me. It was fun to draw for this while listening to it on loop. I’m really happy I was able to draw each of these illustrations. If you were to tell a baby Tem that she’d get to draw something for ZUN one day, I think her heart would’ve stopped. Thank you for the opportunity! The Yukari Sans drawing is my favorite drawing I’ve ever drawn.”</p><p>Watch a new set of videos below.</p><h2><span>Extra Song Pack Vol. 6 Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Extra Song Pack vol.6 Trailer [Touhou Danmaku Kagura Phantasia Lost]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N3fumIG8oAE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span>Gameplay: “Megalovania of the Empty Corse” by ZUN</span></h2><p><iframe title="ZUN - 空しき骸のメガロヴァニア（Megalovania of the Empty Corse）プレイ動画 【東方ダンマクカグラ ファンタジア・ロスト】" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UtTCbUhNv84?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span>Gameplay: “Necrolovania” by Toby Fox</span></h2><p><iframe title="Toby Fox - Necrolovania（ネクロロヴァニア）プレイ動画 【東方ダンマクカグラ ファンタジア・ロスト】" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gOHY-txkW3g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Crytek has announced that it'll be laying off 15% of its staff, a move that the company has called "inevitable" but necessary to help it move forward. This will affect 60 of the people from the 400-person staff at Crytek, which the company had previously attempted to avoid by putting the development of Crysis 4 on hold near the end of 2024 so that it could focus more on its live-service game Hunt Showdown: 1896.</p><p>"Like so many of our peers, we aren't immune to the complex, unfavorable market dynamics that have hit our industry these past several years," Crytek founder Avni Yerli wrote in a press statement. "It pains us greatly to share today that we must lay off an estimated 15% of our around 400 employees. The layoffs affect development teams and shared services. This has not been an easy decision to make, as we deeply appreciate the hard work of our talented teams. After putting the development of the next Crysis game on hold in Q3 2024, we have been trying to shift developers over to Hunt: Showdown 1896."</p><p>Yerli added that efforts to reduce costs and cut operating expenses weren't enough to avoid layoffs. The studio will offer affected employees severance packages and help in finding new work, and while Crysis 4 is being put on hiatus, Crytek will continue to work on Hunt: Showdown 1896.

		<p>While it’s only actually been a shade over 8 years since the release of Killing Floor 2, you’d be forgiven for thinking it’s the same 70 years that have passed in the story for Killing Floor 3. Time has hop, skipped and jumped decades into the future, and it’s as dystopian as ever, with Horzine creating a new army of Zeds and just a small scrappy bunch of resistance fighters called Nightfall ready to oppose them. I’ve honestly no idea what Horzine could possibly gain from destroying the world, but it does seem fairly on brand for the human race.</p>

<p>We’ve been hands on with a closed beta of the game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/31/killing-floor-3-launches-on-25th-march-25-with-closed-beta-in-february/">ahead of a wider beta test next week</a>, sinking back into the renewed, but familiar horde shooter. The essential format will be familiar to fans of Killing Floor and the genre in general. Your team of up to six allies will drop into a map and face off against increasingly fearsome waves of Zeds, building up to a final boss battle. It’s really a case of picking your battlegrounds, making use of both the map layout to try and funnel enemies into (re)killing zones, and using environmental elements from basic doors to turrets, giant fans and vats of molten metal to your advantage, triggering things at just the right time to do as much damage as possible.</p>



<p>Survive a round, and you can race over to a designated vendor station to spend dosh you’ve just earned on weapon upgrades and gear restocks to help you survive what the next round holds.</p>

<p>There’s a few great quirks here. Visiting a vendor also completely recharges your character’s Gadget, the special ability that comes on a cooldown and generally lets you fire off one, maybe two times per round. With a vendor recharge, there’s no reason not to use the gadget as often as possible, picking those late round moments when the heaviest Zeds are turning up and you need to do as much damage or healing as possible.</p>
<p>The vendor location is also always dragging you off to a new part of the map, aiding in the variety of the battles you’ll face –&nbsp;though obviously you can keep on the move and kite enemies if things start to look a bit desperate. While your chosen class will have a set of weapons designed for them – the medic, for example, has a beam cannon that can heal allies and charge itself from enemies – you’re actually free to purchase any weapon from any class. If a run needs you to have more firepower than healing, then you can grab one of the launchers and lay down additional explosions.</p>

<p>That range of weapons also ties in to the overarching player progression. Each of the six characters has a particular role – Obi is the healer, coming with a pistol that can shoot restorative darts from range, the Sanctum field projector that can heal allies within its bubble, and has purchasable weapons that can also keep your team going. Devlin is the Firebug, who brings fire and explosive weapons intended for crowd control, while Foster has a drone that fires acid attacks, and Nakata is very much a ‘rule of cool’ kind of character, turning up to a zombie apocalypse with a suite of ninja swords, bows and grappling hooks.</p>
<p>Each of them has thirty levels of progression, unlocking boosts and abilities in the categories of Passive, Throwable and Gadget. You’ll likely end up picking one character and role as your main, but it definitely won’t hurt to level up an alternate, even if just for a change of pace.</p>
<p>No matter the character and class, you’ll be fending off the hordes of Zeds that have been giving even more of a sci-fi look, melding horrifying flesh with metal, morphing the human form in frankly gross ways. There’s also returning and reimagined special Zeds, such as the series’ staple Fleshpound and Scrake – both of them big lad with spiky gauntlets or chainsaw hands that will take a lot of killing – or the screaming Siren – now with an extendable neck, for some reason – and then the intimidatingly large bosses that are an violent capstone to any mission. The Impaler rampages around with a giant Rhino-like horn coming out of its forehead, as just one example.</p>

<p>They all still gib, though, and this is better and gorier than ever. Tripwire has leant in on Unreal Engine 5 here, fuelling the moody lighting and atmosphere of each map, while the power of modern machines has allowed them to ramp up the number of Zeds spawned at any one time. Tie this together with the new M.E.A.T. system – I don’t know what it stands for, but it’s a convenient backronym, if ever there was one – and there’s tons of dismemberment and persistent blood and gore that will be splattered across the world.</p>
<p>Killing Floor 3 might not be reinventing the horde shooter wheel, but it is taking that next step with the well-established formula. There’s modern touches like being able to mantle over cover and clamber up to higher vantage points, aiding in how manoeuvrable you are and shifting some of the requirements for the level design. It also seems that Tripwire are in this for the long haul, just as they were before, with plans to support this game for years after its launch on 25th March, just as they did for the earlier games in the series.</p>
<p>If you want to play before then, well, there’s another beta scheduled to take place next week from 20th to 24th February, giving players a chance to sample the co-op action horror for themselves.</p>

			<p>The first look at the Nintendo Switch 2 user interface could be coming very soon, judging from some recent findings.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/post-1614328">Famiiboards forums by user Kysen</a>, the Xiahongshu forums user who obtained last year a CAD model of the system and is now <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-units-out-priced-350/">claiming to have a real unit in their hands</a>, revealed that this supposed real unit can be powered on. As such, there's a very good chance we will not only be able to see the console's user interface soon but possibly also learn more about some of the console's unique features, such as what the new button on the new Joy-Con is for and more.</p>
<p>Speaking about the new Nintendo Switch 2 controllers, it seems like their functionality could have been expanded beyond the inclusion of the new mysterious button. As reported on the console's subreddit, one of the official patents seems to suggest that the new Joy-Con controllers could be attached to the system in more ways than two. This could lead to some interesting applications, as the patent also suggests that the screen rotates depending on how the Joy-Con controllers are attached.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1inh58y/possibly_reversible_joycons_machine_translated/">Possibly Reversible Joy-Cons (Machine Translated)</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Aster______/">u/Aster______</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/">NintendoSwitch2</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While Nintendo is usually pretty good at keeping its future hardware secret before official announcements, this wasn't the case with the Nintendo Switch 2, mostly due to how long it took for the company to announce it. Thanks to the multiple leaks, we have learned quite a lot about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-clock-speeds-8nm-no-dlss/">system's specs</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-specs-comparison/">how they compare to other gaming systems</a>, and what developers will be able to achieve with them.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches worldwide this year. A precise release date has yet to be confirmed.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hunt-showdown-1896-developer-is-laying-off-15-of-its-work-force.1106607/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/hunt-showdown-1896-developer-is-laying-off-employees/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Hunt: Showdown 1896 developer Crytek announced today that the company will be laying off around 15% of its 400 employees.</p>



<p>Crytek revealed in a post on <a href="https://x.com/Crytek/status/1889623029723885913/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> that it is the latest studio in the industry to lay off employees due to “unfavourable market dynamics.” The developer will lay off around 60 employees across the “development teams and shared services.” The developer also revealed that since the next Crysis game was put on hold in Q3 2024, they are trying to move its workforce to Hunt: Showdown 1896.</p>



<p>Crytek stated that layoffs would be “inevitable” if the company had to move forward. They had already tried reducing costs and “cutting operating expenses,” but to no avail. To help the affected employees, the Hunt: Showdown developer will provide them with “severance packages and career assistance services”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crytek believes that Hunt Showdown: 1896 offers a “very strong gaming service.” Therefore, they are “fully committed to its operation” and will continue to “expand and evolve” the game with new content. The focus on their engine, Cryengine, will also continue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crytek is the latest studio to lose employees in 2025. We have already seen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-suffers-more-layoffs-as-suicide-squad-support-winds-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rocksteady</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-holds-more-layoffs-across-multiple-departments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-cuts-entire-behavior-development-team-as-part-of-new-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unity</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-layoffs-memo-to-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a>, and others lay off employees this year, and it seems this trend isn’t going to stop soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What do you think about Crytek’s decision to lay off 15% of its employees?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

The company said it will offer severance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the statement, from Crytek founder Avni Yerli, in full:</p><blockquote>Like so many of our peers, we aren’t immune to the complex, unfavorable market dynamics that have hit our industry these past several years. It pains me greatly to share today that we must lay off an estimated 15% of our around 400 employees. The layoffs affect development teams and shared services.</blockquote><blockquote>This has not been an easy decision to make, as we deeply appreciate the hard work of our talented teams. After putting the development of the next Crysis game on hold in Q3 2024, we have been trying to shift developers over to Hunt: Showdown 1896. </blockquote><blockquote>While Hunt: Showdown 1896 is still growing, Crytek cannot continue as before and remain financially sustainable. Even after ongoing efforts to reduce costs and cut operating expenses, we have determined that layoffs are inevitable to move forward. Crytek will offer affected employees severance packages and career assistance services.</blockquote><blockquote>We firmly believe in the future of Crytek. With Hunt: Showdown 1896, we have a very strong gaming service and remain fully committed to its operation. We will continue to expand and evolve Hunt: Showdown 1896 with great content and drive our strategy for our engine CRYENGINE.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, it emerged that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/very-early-crysis-next-gameplay-reveals-unannounced-battle-royale-project-seemingly-canceled-in-favor-of-crysis-4">Crytek had worked on a battle royale-inspired Crysis project codenamed Crysis Next</a> when very early gameplay hit YouTube.

The first game in the series, released in 2007, was often used as a PC benchmark given the demands it would make of PCs at the time. Crysis was so demanding that it spawned the now infamous catchphrase, “But can it run Crysis?” which was used in the years following the game’s release to deliver a verdict on a PC spec.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last mainline game in the series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/crysis-3"><u>Crysis 3</u></a>, came out in February 2013.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Killing Floor 3 Is Exactly What It Needs To Be (Hands-On Impressions)</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The answers to the other questions are unknowable for this or any game in advance of its release and will require dozens of hours of playtime to determine. But what I've seen so far of Killing Floor 3 is an encouraging and exciting base that I'm eager to spend more time with.</p><p dir="ltr">The most immediate and obvious change, even before getting into a match, concerns how classes work. I'd always found the previous name for these--perks--confusing, since that term evokes individual skills, rather than classes. These are now referred to as specialists as part of a broader change that, not unlike Rainbow Six Siege or the early version of Battlefield 2042, pair a specific character with what would have previously been referred to as a perk. That has the potential downside of forcing you to adopt a particular look you may not care for in order to get the benefits of playing as a particular class. But the real challenge to me in picking a specialist was forgoing the special abilities that others would have access to, because I found every one of them so fun to use.</p><p dir="ltr">These abilities are cooldown-based, allowing you to freely use them over the course of a match; you just need to weigh the right time to deploy them, lest you find yourself in dire need and unable to use it. I initially played as the Firebug character, Devlin, who has access to Wildfire, an ability that slams the ground and deals an area-of-effect attack. The immediate and devastating impact of this, which comes with the benefit of also dealing with enemies behind you, made it incredibly useful, not to mention making me feel like a hero for leaping in and saving my group from being overwhelmed on several occasions.</p><p dir="ltr">The gadget available to the Ninja--one of two brand-new specialist types alongside the Engineer--also proved to be a great deal of fun. It's a grappling hook that pulls you to an enemy to deal a burst of damage and conveniently puts you within range to start slicing away with your katanas. But beyond the inherent utility of rapidly relocating, you'll also annihilate the enemies you make contact with on your way.</p><p dir="ltr">Ninja was initially the specialist I was least interested in trying; I often find melee weapons in gun-centric games to be underwhelming, not to mention the potential difficulty of learning the game while actively putting myself in harm's way. Much to my surprise, Ninja might have been the most entertaining specialist of the bunch; not only does slicing through Zeds with katanas feel great, but having access to bows and shurikens provides enough long-distance options that I felt I could back off at times and still be effective. (You can still also buy any weapon, regardless of which specialist it's associated with.) The shurikens, which can be very rapidly flung at foes, have a satisfying metallic <em>shink</em> to them that encouraged me to back off every now and then just so I could use them.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442467-kf3_ninja_medic_sharpshooter_groupshotlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4442467" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442467-kf3_ninja_medic_sharpshooter_groupshotlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4442467"></a><figcaption>Killing Floor 3's Sharpshooter, Ninja, and Medic specialists</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442467-kf3_ninja_medic_sharpshooter_groupshotlarge.jpeg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442468-kf3_screenshot_01large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442469-kf3_screenshot_04large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442470-specialistsgrouplarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4442468,1300-4442469,1300-4442470" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4442468-kf3_screenshot_01large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4442469-kf3_screenshot_04large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4442470-specialistsgrouplarge.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442468-kf3_screenshot_01large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442469-kf3_screenshot_04large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442470-specialistsgrouplarge.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Much as I enjoyed each specialist's ability, my favorite was easily the Sharpshooter's Death Hand, which is effectively just the homing arrow that Yondu of Marvel fame uses. Deploy it and it begins zipping around, slaying enemies quicker than you'd be able to target them yourself. It's a thrilling display, not just killing enemies but flinging their bodies to the ground through the sheer impact in a way that had me eager for its cooldown to reset so I could do it all again. You can keep firing your weapon as the arrow does its thing, although I found myself instead standing back and admiring its handiwork. It's possible that enjoyment will wane after using it in match after match, but my initial impression was that this is one of the most entertaining attacks I'd ever used in a video game. It's that good.</p><p dir="ltr">Part of what makes Death Hand so much fun to use is the weight behind this and every attack. There's a real heft behind each bullet fired, with Zeds recoiling as they absorb the blows. I've never quite clicked with Call of Duty's Zombies modes in part because shooting its zombies doesn't feel as satisfying as I hope, perhaps because the core mechanic is primarily designed around combat against quick-to-die players.</p><p dir="ltr">Killing Floor 3 feels better than the series ever has. Through great sound design and the way enemies are staggered by attacks, you never feel as though you're firing mushy peas against a cardboard box. Even heavy-duty enemies who are difficult to kill react to your gunfire, and the ability to target weak spots to temporarily stagger them provides momentary reprieves that also help to mitigate any sense that they are bullet sponges.</p><p dir="ltr">Zed Time makes a return in Killing Floor 3 with an added dose of welcome predictability. Rather than being chance-based, a meter at the top of the screen shows your progress toward triggering it. As before, it slows down time for everyone, letting you easily line up headshots or process your surroundings and have a moment to decide your next action. Kills during this time extend the duration of the effect, while there is a brief period after it ends during which your kills don't contribute to your next Zed Time. What makes Zed Time here even better is that all nearby enemies are highlighted in red, including those behind walls and other obstacles. That gives you a real edge in combat, which can become chaotic, as well as the ability to line up headshots before an enemy has even rounded a corner.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond the sheer utility of Zed Time, though, is the fun of seeing the game's gore system, known as MEAT (Massive Evisceration and Trauma), at work in even gorier detail. Moving from less graphically violent shooters like Marvel Rivals or even Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 to Killing Floor 3 is jarring at first, to say the least: Heads go flying off into the distance, blood gets everywhere, Zeds missing their bottom halves desperately crawl toward you, bodies explode. Developer Tripwire clearly isn't holding back here, going over the top with its gore in a way that feels fun and silly, in a classic Evil Dead kind of way. It can just be hard not to waste some of your precious Zed Time beholding the impact that a slice of your katana has on a Zed in slow motion.</p><p dir="ltr">Other positive additions include an execution system, which, much like modern Doom's Glory Kills, allows you to approach low-health enemies and finish them off with a gruesome attack. Doing so means needing to get close, but the upside is the damage these attacks deal to nearby foes, lending a nice risk-and-reward element that provides another strategic consideration in the heat of combat.</p><p dir="ltr">The time between rounds also now affords you more things to do. Rather than simply running to the trader pod to stock up on new weapons or ammo, or physically flinging your excess cash to share with teammates, you'll find objects throughout the environment to destroy, as well as certain doors and devices that can be activated using a Multi-Tool, one of the consumable tool options. Ziplines, sentry guns, and armor lockers are among the things that are inactive until a Multi-Tool brings them online, and all of which can provide life-saving getaways or assistance. While Multi-Tools can be used during a round, quick players can purchase one from the trader, activate some devices, and then swap to another tool for use during the round itself. (There's also now a menu-based way to share cash with teammates, but you can still just chuck cash on the ground, too.)</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442471-kf3_screenshot_02large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4442471" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442471-kf3_screenshot_02large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4442471"></a><figcaption>Killing Floor 3</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4442471-kf3_screenshot_02large.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Also scattered throughout levels are destroyable objects, which grant cash for the current match and crafting materials for use in a new hub area between matches. I do worry that taking out these objects could become a rote objective over time as you memorize their placement and take them out match after match, but the broader attempt to spice up this downtime period is welcome.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether destroying those speakers and other objects eventually becomes boring or not, doing so might prove worthwhile in the long term to provide yourself with more crafting materials, which are also gathered from killing Zeds in various ways. Crafting is a system I didn't get to spend much time with, but you'll be able to create mods to attach to weapons, versions of which you'll then buy during a match. But even without having done any crafting myself, the lineup of weapons available at the trader included versions with randomized mods. The effect of some mods was unclear to me as I rushed to get things done between waves, but it's clear that aside from simply improving their performance, they can have major effects on weapons. They might dramatically alter the size of your magazine in exchange for certain benefits or concessions, change their damage type (thereby altering the types of enemies and armor they're effective against), or add entirely new effects--at one point, I got a grenade launcher with freezing rounds. Suddenly a weapon I'd otherwise only use to attack large groups of enemies had a new utility in temporarily halting the advance of whole groups of Zeds. This one example might overstate the overall impact mods will have on the average match, but the additional diversity they might bring to weapons is very promising.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside mods, the other big progression system involves skill trees for each specialist. Upgrades for Killing Floor 2's perks always struck me as underwhelming--yeah, better reload speeds or higher damage are all well and good, but they're not terribly exciting, nor do they really affect the way you think about a combat engagement. While there remain some simple percentage-based upgrades in Killing Floor 3's skill trees, they seem to often be paired with an additional effect to factor into your playstyle. For instance, a Firebug upgrade that grants faster reload speeds also makes it so that every reload damages nearby enemies and causes them to panic, interrupting their advance. This encourages you to consider your positioning each time you reload, and it's these kinds of possibilities that get me excited about upgrading each specialist. Combine an upgrade like that with a weapon that can be reloaded early and often, plus one of the Ninja's melee weapons, and what does combat look like? I can't wait to play around with all of the potential options.</p><p dir="ltr">With cross-play across all platforms, the promise of weekly mutations that can potentially shake up matches to keep things fresh, great metal music that amps up the intensity, player-specific objectives to attempt alongside slaying Zeds, and a history of great post-launch support, Killing Floor 3 looks like a killer co-op package. Only extensive time will tell if it can sustain itself in the long-term, but right out of the gate, Killing Floor 3 should be a blast. It's set to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/killing-floor-3-has-three-editions-physical-preorders-available-now/1100-6529177/" data-ref-id="1100-6529177">release on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on March 25 for $40</a>.</p>

			<p>A new multiplatform multiplayer project which started development at Bungie is going to be revealed during today's <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-state-of-play-confirmed-for-february-12th/">State of Play show</a>, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Spanish website <a href="https://vandal-elespanol-com.translate.goog/noticia/1350777986/sony-presentara-en-el-state-of-play-un-nuevo-y-curioso-multijugador-nacido-en-bungie-segun-nuestras-fuentes/?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vandal</a>, which proved to be a reliable source of information in the past, shared today that the multiplayer project codenamed Gummy Bears, which managed to survive Bungie's restructuring l<a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-makes-layoff-announcement-in-blog-post/">ast year</a>, will be revealed today. The game, which is being developed by a new studio run by PlayStation Studios but still part of the Destiny series' developer, is said to be a colorful game featuring gameplay inspired by MOBAs with team-based confrontations and characters belonging to different classes, and some other elements inspired by the Super Smash Bros. series. Additionally, it is said that players will be able to interact with one another between games in ways that will allow them to express their personalities.</p>
<p>Judging from the information above, the new Bungie project will clearly be aimed at a younger audience. As such, it isn't surprising to learn that the game is reportedly launching on Nintendo Switch, as well as on PC and PlayStation 5 later this year. Gummy Bears is also reportedly being shown during the rumored Nintendo Direct, which is supposedly scheduled for this month.</p>
<p>Project Gummy Bears may not be the only Bungie project shown during today's State of Play. In an update shared<a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-gets-small-developer-update-from-bungie-confirming-expanded-playtesting-and-upcoming-news-in-2025/"> last year</a>, the studio teased that more information on Marathon would be coming this year, so today's show would be the perfect occasion to show what the studio has been working on for some time.</p>
