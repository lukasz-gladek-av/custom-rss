            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-delayed-once-again-november<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GSC Game World has announced another&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>delay, with the long-awaited post-apocalyptic FPS now set to arrive later this fall.</p>
<p>The new&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>release date is November 20th, per a press release. This will, according to GSC Game World, give the game's developers the time to "address technical issues" and bring the final&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>release "closer to the experience that the fans expect".</p>
<p>GSC game director Yevhen Grygorovych says that although he knows players are "tired of waiting", the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-release-date-revealed-and-pre-orders-available-now">two extra months</a> will give the team the chance to fix more "unexpected anomalies" (hem, hem).</p>

<p>You'll also get a full video walkthrough of one of&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s story quests, so you should be able to get a good idea of what the game will play like on the ground, so to speak.</p>
<p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>has been a very long time coming indeed. It's been in development in one form or another since at least 2010, but the game in its current form was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-heart-of-chernobyl-release-date-announced">introduced at E3 2021</a> and was set to release in April 2022.</p>
<p>Numerous delays then followed, with the game being pushed back <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/post-apocalyptic-shooter-stalker-2-delayed-until-december">first to December</a>, then <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-sequel-has-been-pushed-to-next-year">to 2023</a>, and eventually landing on a release date of September 5th, at least until today.</p>

<p>When&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>does arrive, GSC Game World is promising an "epic nonlinear story" that takes place in a "seamless open world" full of post-apocalyptic sights to see.</p>
<p>You'll fight a range of different mutants, each with "different behavior models", and you'll take advantage of "hundreds of weapon combinations" in order to do so.</p>
<p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>launches on November 20th for PC and Xbox Series X|S. If you want to know what kind of shape the game is in right now, be sure to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-preview-get-in-zone">check out our preview</a>!</p>

            <p>Yet again, some good food. Following the news earlier this week that<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-game-studios-developers-ecstatic-to-announce-a-241-strong-wall-to-wall-union"> 241 Bethesda Games Studios staffers</a> had formed what was at the time the biggest wall-to-wall under Microsoft, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24205366/world-of-warcraft-developers-form-union-blizzard-entertainment">The Verge</a> reports that over 500 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World Of Warcraft</a> developers have voted to form their own union, alongside the Communication Workers of America (CWA).</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The World Of Warcraft GameMakers Guild consists of workers from every department - hence 'wall-to-wall' - including designers, engineers, artists, and producers, across offices in California and Massachusetts. It’s now the second-largest union at Microsoft overall, after 600 Activision Blizzard QA workers<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094602/activision-blizzard-qa-workers-unionizing-microsoft"> formed a union</a> in March, despite the publisher’s history of attempting to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-blizzard-appeal-against-blizzard-albany-qa-union-vote-rejected">shoot down similar efforts</a>.</p>
<p>WOW quest designer Kathryn Friesen told The Verge "You can tell just by talking to people how much they care about one another and the work that they do in the game. I think that that’s where [the unionisation effort] comes from, the desire to stand together to fight for collective bargaining rights at the table."</p>
<p>Senior quest designer Paul Cox told The Verge that staff were encouraged by the company’s response to being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-blizzard-sued-by-california-over-alleged-culture-of-sexual-harassment-and-discrimination">sued by the State of California</a> in 2021, with walkouts leading to eventual unionisation. “A lot of the early responses felt very corporate and didn’t feel like they reflected the values that, as a company, we said we upheld.”</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023%E2%80%932024_video_game_industry_layoffs">an estimated</a> 10,000 people lost their jobs due to games industry layoffs and closures. From January to June of 2024, that number is around 10,800 already. God fucking speed, you beautiful people who make all our lives more fun and interesting. Let’s keep up the momentum.</p>

            <p>
Monster Train, the acclaimed roguelike deckbuilder from developer Shiny Shoe, is making its way to PlayStation 5 today, 25th July, some four years after its original release.
</p>
<p>
Monster Train sees players attempting to restore Hell's inferno after it freezes over - a task requiring them to ride a train carrying a burning pyre deep into the heart of Hell.
</p>
<p>
At first glance, it's all a bit Slay the Spire, with branching pathways providing choices on how to progress and level up each run. But the proper fun comes in combat, where the real-time card battling sees players unleashing their hellish minions against the forces of heaven - gradually moving between multiple floors of the titular train as they try and defend the pyre on top to win.
</p>

<p>
As Eurogamer's Robert Purchese <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-train-brings-a-new-idea-to-a-genre-i-love">explained</a> in 2020, "The skill is... not only [in] surviving those rounds and stopping their fighters reaching the top, but scaling up your damage and survivability, via buffs (spells and the like), for when the boss arrives. When the Final Wave comes, things change. Instead of the usual routine of playing your cards, then everyone trading blows and a new round beginning, you enter Relentless Mode where characters on one row continue to trade blows with a boss, until either they are dead or the boss is."
</p>
<p>
Monster Train's PS5 release features over 280 cards, six unique monster clans, and 25 covenant levels - including everything introduced in the game's The Last Divinity paid expansion, which is bundled into this latest version. It also incorporates the multiplayer Hell Rush mode, which sees competitors battling against the clock in real-time to prove their demonic superiority.
</p>
<p>
And if a blast of infernal card battling sounds like exactly the kind of thing you're looking for, Monster Train's PlayStation release costs $24.99.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arkham-horror-roleplaying-game-review-very-specific-but-good-gateway</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arkham-horror-the-roleplaying-game-review-a-gateway-for-new-players-to-ttrpg.936435/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arkham-horror-roleplaying-game-review-very-specific-but-good-gateway<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's hard to get into any TTRPG if you don't have someone to hold your hand along the way. Picking up a ruleset for the first time and trying to steer a party of new players can be a daunting task but <em>Arkham Horror: The Roleplaying Game</em> starter set goes about it in the most logical way creating a positive to learn in environment.</p>
<p><em>Arkham Horror,</em> a franchise that fans of horror and board gaming might know from the <em>Arkham Horror </em>board game or <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fb14a3b2-6d4a-4518-ad52-9d9652a61fa1" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arkham-horror-card-game-review"><em>Arkham Horror The Card Game</em></a>, has finally taken steps towards a full Tabletop RPG with their release of the<em> Hungering Abyss</em> Starter Set.</p>
<h2>Building The Foundation Of Knowledge</h2>
<p><em>Arkham Horror: The Roleplaying Game Hungering Abyss</em> puts players into the shoes of one of five investigators in the town of Arkham, Massachusetts. From the hardboiled detective investigating missing persons, to the high school track and field star whose friend has gone missing everyone has noticed things going on and has their own leads to provide.</p>
<p>From this launch point players will get to piece together the mysteries of the town, fight off evil cult members, and stop the quaint town for descending into hell.</p>

<p>The campaign for <em>Arkham Horror: The Roleplaying Game</em> was laid out in a unique way that gameplay mechanics were only introduced just as they would become relevant. The first scene of the game, the introduction of the characters, is just prompts for them to interact with one another and a succinct list of what leads each player should be able to infer from their background.</p>
<p>Once characters had met each other and established leads a loud noise in the cellar would alert them to the presence of monsters. As you turn the page to reach the first combat encounter you're met with detailed instructions of what a Structured Scene is (one where the Investigators act, and then the Game Master act) and each of the different actions you can take.</p>
<p>It's in this way that the GM isn't just given every single piece of information of how to run the game without the context of where or when they'd apply, instead the GM is learning as the players encounter scenarios. It's not just 'tell', and it's not as daunting as 'show', but is a very educational 'tell and then show.'</p>

<p>In our game, I particularly enjoyed this because as I was trying to explain to players how using dice from their Character Dossier's would affect the game we could demonstrate on the board, and even on the creature cards how things would be affected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My table was a mix of those who had been playing TTRPG like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> for 40+ years, and another who was having their first experience playing a TTRPG and it was an incredibly positive experience for everyone.</p>
<h2>Action Economy In Dice</h2>
<p>The main engine that drives what you character can do, whether you're in a Narrative Scene (free roleplaying) or in a Structured Scene, is your D6 which work as action points as well as a health tracker.</p>
<p>A healthy character has 6 dice at their disposal, they can use one to perform a simple action like moving or interacting with items, or they can roll one or more to perform a complex action like aiding an ally or making a melee attack with the number on the dice representing a success or failure. Taking damage reduces your pool of dice so it also hinders how many actions you can take.</p>
<p>Doubling down on the horror and uncomfortability of the characters in this world the fastest way to regain all of your health is to suffer an injury, it's a trade-off where you get a permanent effect against your character but can go back to acting. Too many injuries can lead to death though...</p>

<p>In Structured scenes the Investigators turn is over when all players have exhausted their dice, or have opted to pass with some remaining in case they wish to make a reaction. This allows for a party to be collaborative and act as a group, but in any order individually allowing for some fun synergies to happen.</p>
<p>For the GM this level of collaboration does make it harder to be as impactful with any NPC they are running, especially when a number of player abilities have a chance to nearly one-shot the most common creature in the box.</p>
<p>Narrative Scenes also restrict players' actions to how many dice they have available to them. Like in combat, the dice are used up as they perform actions but now when the party has used up their actions they regain them and the story progresses forward in time.</p>
<p>This is helpful for a GM if events are timely, such as a ritual occurring that night, players will know they can only do so much before they need to take action. It's also a good gameplay mechanic to encourage players who might not have a strong voice at the table to speak up.</p>

<p>Proactive players might have used up all of their actions, but a quiet player could still have five dice available to them in their pool. It's also clear for the GM who they can prompt for next steps to take promoting everyone being included.</p>
<h2>What To Play After <em>Arkham Horror: The Roleplaying Game</em>?</h2>
<p>Due to the nature of this being such a heavily curated learning experience it's important to make the distinction that this Starter Set works for this adventure and this adventure alone. You won't find any additional character creation information, prompts for a GM to run another adventure, or items that won't get used immediately in this campaign.</p>
<p>If you're interested in creating your own <em>Arkham Horror: The Roleplaying Game</em> adventure then you may need to wait for additional resources. <em>Hungering Abyss</em> creates a familiar experience to those of the <em>EXIT: The Room</em> escape-room-in-a-box adventures.</p>
<p>Players will have fun over the 6-8 hour experience following the path of the cult, but after that you'll need an entirely new group if you want to play it again.</p>
<p>The upside of the box being so specifically tailored to the adventure isn't just that the game can teach you how to play as you're playing it, but it means that the pieces you'll find in the box include (almost) everything you could need.</p>
<h2>Everything In The <em>Arkham Horror: The Roleplaying Game Box</em></h2>
<p>Inside the box the GM will find the expected pieces like a GM board, Adventure Book, and Character Dossier, but there are also tokens with artwork specific for every encounter in the adventure and double sided maps for each location.</p>

<p>If a character is searching a room and comes across a shotgun then there's an item card to present to your player.</p>
<p>Players can also get further immersed by the different handouts provided, including autopsy and police documents, as well as an encoded message to decipher and multiple sliding block puzzles.</p>
<p>A lot of Starter Kits say they have everything in the box for you to run a session but this is one of the first I've seen to really follow through on that…. Well, almost.</p>
<h2>Some Dice Included</h2>
<p>Each character playing, at full health, requires six dice placed on their character sheet to indicate how many action points they have remaining, let alone d6 for the different NPC that the GM is running. Included in this box is only enough for two players, leaving out the majority of the table.</p>

<p>You could easily get around this by sourcing six-sided dice from elsewhere (like your dice hoarding wife) or other board games you may already own. There are also more than enough spare tokens included in the game to create a proxy but you won't be able to set it up as the adventure book describes.</p>
<h2><em>Arkham Horror: The Roleplaying Game</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>As a way to ease players into the world of <em>Arkham Horror</em> as well as to introduce a new TTRPG I think the <em>Hungering Abyss</em> Starter Set does an incredible job. What's even more impressible than that I think Hungering Abyss has managed to create a Starter Set that new GM and players alike can use to learn about playing TTRPGs in general.</p>
<p>While anyone can pick up any TTRPG and begin playing it's normally an easier experience if someone who is familiar with the game is leading the story. In Arhkam Horror's building block 'show and tell' style of building upon gameplay as the story progresses it offers GMs and players alike the best way to learn how to play the game.</p>
<p>Fans of TTRPG will get to have an enjoyable experience throwing too many d6 across the table trying to crush a cult and new players will get eased into the experience.</p>
<p>If you're looking for the basis to create your own adventures or continue the adventure past what's in the box though you're going to be out of luck. This adventure is so specifically tailored to the experience once you've played it then it's worth keeping around for a new group, or could be passed on to another group you know of.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
Arkham Horror: The Roleplaying Game Hungering Abyss is the perfect idea behind a one-shot in a box aimed at new players. With easy to learn mechanics and a well thought process for teaching players and GMs the game there's no way this game won't run smooth. The only downside is it's 'one and done' nature.

Naturally, I thought it’d be a great idea to spend my free time with a game that demands some serious fortitude and a perpetual cycle of tough challenges that can easily make you feel like you suck: <em>Elden Ring</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,195624,196215" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Regardless of how hard you think <em>Elden Ring</em> is or isn’t, it’s clear that the game demands attentive reaction time and thoughtful investment of time in speccing your character appropriately. Fail to respond to immediate threats and invest Runes poorly, and you’re not really gonna get very far. And as someone whose anxiety centers around not being timely with my responsibilities and failing to prepare for the future, who agonizes over decisions I made 10 years ago, the prospect of playing <em>Elden Ring</em> for any serious amount of time scared me. </p><p>But the spark was lit after I <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/flintlock-game-review-soulslike-ashen-difficult-1851595559&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/flintlock-game-review-soulslike-ashen-difficult-1851595559">finished <em>Flintlock</em></a></span>. Though it doesn’t put up the toughest of challenges, it did remind me of the fun of the Soulslike’s core loop. It also made me feel better prepared for something like <em>Elden Ring</em>. And to be honest, given my anxiety, I started to think a hobby that I took my time with, slowly chipping away at on a path to unlikely victory, might be healthy for me.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/flintlock-game-review-soulslike-ashen-difficult-1851595559&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/flintlock-game-review-soulslike-ashen-difficult-1851595559"><em>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn</em>: The <em>Kotaku</em> Review</a></span></p><p>I also chose <em>Elden Ring</em> because it allows me to do something I’m very fond of: Wander. Many have rightly said that <em>Elden Ring</em>’s open world structure makes the traditionally difficult format of the Soulslike easier as you take it at your pace and venture off to level up on lower-level monsters, and that’s true, but in the dozen or so hours I’ve put into the game recently, I’ve spent a lot of time intentionally wandering around, avoiding conflict. </p><figure id="" data-id="da605424756e26b3b3fc5a39b24c0a1c" data-recommend-id="image://da605424756e26b3b3fc5a39b24c0a1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Tarnished chats with an unexpected guest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Tarnished chats with an unexpected guest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="da605424756e26b3b3fc5a39b24c0a1c" data-recommend-id="image://da605424756e26b3b3fc5a39b24c0a1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Tarnished chats with an unexpected guest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s a serenity to <em>Elden Ring</em>’s environment, with its bleak landscape punctuated by the imposing yet beautiful Erdtree, set to gentle, mournful strings that make up its ambient soundscape. Simply <em>existing </em>in this space, among the birds and other wildlife that too wander about, is appealing to me as the kind of “game” I sometimes like playing (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hellblade-2-senuas-saga-combat-fire-1851493666&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hellblade-2-senuas-saga-combat-fire-1851493666">I do love</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/still-wakes-the-deep-review-the-chinese-room-1851544587&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/still-wakes-the-deep-review-the-chinese-room-1851544587">a walking-sim</a></span>). </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hellblade-2-senuas-saga-combat-fire-1851493666&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hellblade-2-senuas-saga-combat-fire-1851493666"><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em>: The <em>Kotaku</em> Review</a></span></p><p>The wildlife also holds a position in the game’s ecosystem I envy: They, unlike me, aren’t destined to undertake the violent trial that is this game. I envy the rolling sheep, contemplative-looking eagles, frolicking springhares, and gentle deer. Theirs is an existence in this dark fantasy realm without inherent violence, and I won’t bring them into it regardless of what they’ll drop. So too do I give wolves and bears their space. So too do I relent when an enemy cowers in fear. Despite how violent <em>Elden Ring</em> gets, I see the challenge and the strife as an invitation to double down on my commitment to not imitate that where I needn’t. </p><p>In this way, <em>Elden Ring</em> has oddly become a refuge from the complications of my personal life. I find myself going here to “chill” as it were. But I’m still here to <em>finish</em> this game, and that means engaging in the trials of its combat. </p><p><em>Elden Ring</em>’s challenges, many of which may be initially tough, do have the effect of showing you something isn’t impossible, that you can come out of a struggle and succeed. As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505"><em>Kotaku</em>’s Alyssa Mercante said in her review of the game’s expansion</a></span>, it can bestow hope: “This is going to be hard, but I can do this.”</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree </em>Review: Massive, Menacing, And Magnificent</a></span></p><p>I resonate with that sentiment too. And in the face of <em>Elden Ring</em>’s challenges, I find myself also letting go. The challenge isn’t <em>my fault</em>. It’s just <em>what is</em>. I can’t beat myself up over it. I can’t blame myself. I’ll learn what I can from this challenge. I’ll continue to arrive and I’ll endeavor to be better next time. The worst of what faces me still sees me coming back, now knowing what I didn’t before. When I need space and time to recollect myself, learn from the challenge, I can go and wander among the wildlife again and stare out at the horizon. </p><figure id="" data-id="c06c044f0d2879e899de280646f56361" data-recommend-id="image://c06c044f0d2879e899de280646f56361" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Tarnished rides atop Torrent in the Lands Between." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Tarnished rides atop Torrent in the Lands Between." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c06c044f0d2879e899de280646f56361" data-recommend-id="image://c06c044f0d2879e899de280646f56361" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Tarnished rides atop Torrent in the Lands Between." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Elden Ring</em> has so far given me the time <em>away</em> from the stresses of my regular life and the torturous boss of doubt and anxiety that lurks in my own mind. It’s also teaching me the value of patience, of persistence, of acceptance of the way things simply are. I don’t expect to finish it any time soon, either. I’m taking my time with this game, because life so often won’t let me do that elsewhere. The Lands Between are proving to be a more forgiving and accepting place than I previously thought. And maybe other frightening places are, too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Two new LEGO sets based on popular video game series have surfaced this week, including a <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/shadow-the-hedgehog-77000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadow the Hedgehog bust</a> and Super Mario World set. Both sets are expected to release on October 1, 2024. </p>



<p>The Shadow the Hedgehog bust will include over 700 pieces, with a price tag of $69.99. LEGO lists it as a set for adult builders, and it comes with a display stand and nameplate. </p>



<p>It also includes some neat easter eggs “including a Chaos Emerald and 3 Gold Rings, hidden in the build.” Fans can follow a digital version of the building instructions with the LEGO Builder app. </p>



<p>The Super Mario World set is unrelated to the popular and interactive “Adventures” product line. Instead, the new set emulates the 2D pixel art of the classic video game.</p>



<p>Although the official LEGO site doesn’t have pictures and details for the set up yet, those did surface <a href="https://jaysbrickblog.com/news/lego-71438-super-mario-world-mario-yoshi-is-a-16-bit-ode-to-the-super-nes-classic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Jay’s Brick Blog</a>. Twitter user Wario64 also posted their set pictures on X.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>According to details on Jay’s Brick Blog, the “Super Mario World: Mario &amp; Yoshi” set features over 1200 pieces. Although the set is intended for display purposes, there is a small lever that makes Yoshi stick their tongue out.</p>



<p>These sets join a packed October release schedule, as LEGO only just announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-lego-sets-coming-in-october-2024-pre-orders-now-open/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">real-world Fortnite sets</a> for October 2024 too. Those Fortnite sets are already available for pre-order.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-london-out-now</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/surprise-massive-fallout-4-mod-fallout-london-is-available-now.936399/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-london-out-now<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Team FOLON and GOG have announced the&nbsp;<em>Fallout: London&nbsp;</em>release date, and, well, it's today. That's right: the hotly-anticipated&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4&nbsp;</em>mod, which lets you explore post-apocalyptic London, is available right now.</p>
<p>The mod is technically downloadable via GOG; Team FOLON says it's hosted on GOG because the project was "incredibly massive" and "too large for popular mod hosting sites". GOG offered to step in and provide a custom launcher for the experience, so you'll need to download it via GOG if you want to play.</p>
<p>However, you don't need to worry; the mod is compatible with both the GOG and Steam versions of&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4</em>, although if you're playing Bethesda's open-world RPG on Steam, you might have a few more hoops to jump through before you can play.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-4-mod-fallout-london-release-date-city_0.jpg?itok=GX0FUCoi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallout-4-mod-fallout-london-release-date-city_0.jpg?itok=sf0tP8HD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Post-apocalyptic London awaits you in&nbsp;<em>Fallout: London</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're playing the GOG version, you won't need to do anything else, because the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-4-ps5-xbox-series-update-release-date">infamous next-gen update</a>, which broke many&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4&nbsp;</em>mods, hasn't been applied to the GOG version yet. You also won't need to worry if you haven't patched your Steam&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4&nbsp;</em>version beyond v1.10.163.0.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if you have applied the next-gen update, you'll need to follow some pretty detailed steps to get&nbsp;<em>Fallout: London&nbsp;</em>to work with your Steam copy. A next-gen version of the mod is in the works, but its creators haven't revealed a time frame for that version's release yet.</p>
<h2>How to downgrade&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4&nbsp;</em>on Steam so you can play&nbsp;<em>Fallout: London</em></h2>
<p>While the steps to downgrade&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4&nbsp;</em>on Steam are pretty involved, they're not too difficult, and you should be able to achieve them without any kind of external tools. Here's what you need to do.</p>
<p>First, open the Steam console in your browser. You can do this by typing "steam://open/console" (without quotation marks) into your web browser.</p>
<p>After doing this, download&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4: Game of the Year Edition&nbsp;</em>by entering the following commands.</p>
<ul><li>Part A:&nbsp;download_depot 377160 377161 7497069378349273908</li>
<li>Part B:&nbsp;download_depot 377160 377163 5819088023757897745</li>
<li>Executable:&nbsp;download_depot 377160 377162 5847529232406005096</li>
<li>English version:&nbsp;download_depot 377160 377164 2178106366609958945</li>
</ul><p>You can also use the following commands to download any&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4&nbsp;</em>DLC you might own. Bear in mind you'll need these DLCs to play&nbsp;<em>Fallout: London</em>.</p>
<ul><li>HD Texture Pack:&nbsp;download_depot 377160 540810 1558929737289295473</li>
<li><em>Automatron</em>:&nbsp;download_depot 377160 435870 1691678129192680960</li>
<li><em>Automatron&nbsp;</em>English-language pack:&nbsp;download_depot 377160 435871 5106118861901111234</li>
<li><em>Wasteland Workshop</em>:&nbsp;download_depot 377160 435880 1255562923187931216</li>
<li><em>Far Harbor</em>:&nbsp;download_depot 377160 435881 1207717296920736193</li>
<li><em>Far Harbor&nbsp;</em>English-language pack:&nbsp;download_depot 377160 435882 8482181819175811242</li>
<li><em>Contraptions Workshop</em>:&nbsp;download_depot 377160 480630 5527412439359349504</li>
<li><em>Vault-Tec Workshop</em>:&nbsp;download_depot 377160 480631 6588493486198824788</li>
<li><em>Vault-Tec Workshop&nbsp;</em>English-language pack:&nbsp;download_depot 377160 393885 5000262035721758737</li>
<li><em>Nuka World</em>:&nbsp;download_depot 377160 490650 4873048792354485093</li>
<li><em>Nuka World&nbsp;</em>English-language pack:&nbsp;download_depot 377160 393895 7677765994120765493</li>
</ul><p>Whew! That's all the files. These files will be downloaded into your Steam library, which, by default, can be found in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\content\app_377160. You'll find the files in a series of folders numbered after the six-digit strings following "377160" above.</p>
<p>Create a new folder on your desktop, then copy and paste the files from each of the above directories into that folder, replacing files as you go. Once you're done, you'll have downloaded&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4: Game of the Year Edition&nbsp;</em>as it was before the next-gen update.</p>
<p>Now, all you need to do is delete everything in your current&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4&nbsp;</em>installation folder and replace it with what's in the folder you just created. Et voila! You're now ready to play&nbsp;<em>Fallout: London</em>.</p>

<p>This project has been a long time in the making. Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-london-mod-brings-nuclear-war-across-pond">revealed in 2021</a>, it's a huge passion project that aims to recreate the city of London as it would appear in the post-apocalyptic world of&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>.</p>
<p>The mod is such a huge undertaking that one of its lead writers <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/head-writer-for-fallout-london-mod-joins-bethesda">left in August 2021 to join Bethesda</a>, which should give you a good idea of the pedigree behind the mod.&nbsp;<em>Fallout: London&nbsp;</em>is available to <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/fallout_london" rel="sponsored" target="_blank">download right now via GOG</a>.</p>

            <p>A man who sent almost 40 threatening messages to Nintendo, including death threats, has been sentenced to one year in prison and four years of probation by Kyoto District Court.</p>
<p>As reported by Japanese newsite <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/lnews/mito/20240724/1070024657.html">NHK</a>, Kenshin Kazama - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suspect-behind-nintendo-live-tokyo-cancellation-death-threats-arrested-in-japan">a 27-year-old employee of Hitachi City</a> - was accused of forcible obstruction of business after sending 39 threats using the inquiry form on Nintendo's website.</p>
<p>These threats were sent between August and November last year.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-death-threats-suspect-charged-by-japanese-police">As reported in April</a>, the threats sent during this time included messages such as "I'm going to make you regret releasing such a crappy game to the world" and "I'm going to kill everyone involved".</p>
<p>The sender also threatened to "kill the people at the venue" if Nintendo held its Splatoon Koshien 2023 National Finals that December. As a result, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-live-2024-tokyo-event-cancelled-after-threats-to-staff">Nintendo took measures to ensure everyone's safety</a> by cancelling both this Splatoon event and its Nintendo Live Tokyo 2024 event, which was planned to run in January of this year.</p>
<p>At the time of this announcement, Nintendo said it had received "persistent threats targeting our employees" which had also "spread to spectators", but did not share specifics.</p>
<p>In his ruling on the 24th, Judge Hiroshi Kawakami said "the defendant was frustrated by the fact that he continued to lose in online matches of Nintendo games", and that he committed the crime as a way "to relieve stress".</p>
<p>The judge called the crime both "persistent" and "vicious".</p>

            <p>
Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, the long-in-the-works sequel to developer GSC Game World's cult-classic 2007 post-apocalyptic horror shooter, has been delayed again. It's now due to launch on 20th November, giving the studio "breathing room to address technical issues".
</p>
<p>Word of the delay surfaced on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ebrihj/stalker_2_delayed_to_november_20/">reddit</a> today from a user who said they'd been emailed about the date change by GSC Game World. The news has now been publicly confirmed by the developer in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxeGyXSM5Pc">video</a> titled "Really, again?" posted to YouTube, below. </p>
<p>
Stalker 2 has, of course, had quite the journey to release. It was originally set to arrive in 2012, having been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-to-be-multi-platform">announced by GSC Game World two years prior</a>, but those plans were eventually shelved following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-dev-we-will-do-our-best-to-continue">troubles at the studio</a>. It was a bit of a surprise, then, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apparently-stalker-2-is-happening-but-dont-get-too-excited">Stalker 2 re-emerged in 2018</a> with a new release window of 2021.
</p>
<p>
Since then, however, Stalker 2's development has had numerous setbacks. First, its release date moved to April 2022 before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-delayed-until-december">shifting again to December</a>, but the Kyiv-based GSC was then forced to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-on-hold-ukraine-based-developer-confirms">put the game on hold</a> following Russian's invasion of Ukraine. Development resumed in May 2022, with some of the team relocating to Prague, but its release was moved to 2023 then 2024 amid an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-to-include-metaverse-of-nfts">NFT backlash</a>, claims of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-studio-defiant-in-response-to-claimed-russian-hack">Russian hack</a>, and even an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-developer-gsc-game-worlds-servers-have-been-damaged-by-a-fire-at-its-prague-office">office fire</a>.

<p>
When we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-delayed-until-september">last heard from GSC</a>, Stalker 2 was scheduled to launch for PC and Xbox Series X/S on 5th September this year, but that release date has shifted again, this time to 20th November.
</p>
<p>"We know you might be tired of waiting," a statement included in the YouTube video's description reads, "and we truly appreciate your patience. These two additional months will give us the chance to fix more 'unexpected anomalies' (or simply 'bugs', as you call them). We are always grateful for your ongoing support and understanding - it means the world to us. We're just as eager as you are to finally release the game and for you to experience it for yourself."
</p>
<p>
To alleviate the wait a little, GSC has teamed up with Xbox to present a special Stalker 2 Developer Deep Dive on 12th August. This promises a "variety of never-before-seen content", including a video walkthrough of a story quest, plus footage providing a world overview, a look at various locations, new gameplay, and cutscenes.
</p>
<p>
Assuming no further delays, Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl will be available for Xbox Series X/S and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/stalker_2_heart_of_chornobyl_standard_edition">GOG</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl">Epic</a>, and <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/en#editions">GSC's website</a> when it launches on 20th November.

			<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has been delayed again and will now be released around two months later than expected.</p>
<p>The second entry in the series by GSC Game World will now release on November 20th instead of September 5th to give the developers breathing room to address some technical issues with the game and deliver the experience players have eagerly been waiting for. A new trailer was also released, and you can find it below.</p>
<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl — Really, Again?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vxeGyXSM5Pc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Thankfully, it's not all bad news today. The most comprehensive look at STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl will be coming during a Developer Deep Dive in collaboration with Xbox on August 12th. The Deep Dive will feature interviews and behind-the-scenes footage of the development process, as well as new footage, including a world overview, various locations, gameplay, and cutscenes. Lastly, the Deep Dive will also feature a full video walkthrough of one of the story quests.</p>
<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl launches on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on November 20th. You can learn more about the game by checking out Kai's recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-hands-on-impressions-good-hunting/">preview.</a></p>
<p><em>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl feels modernized in ways that AAA games have developed over the years. A minimap has been replaced with a compass permanently affixed to the top of the screen, pointing to nearby points of interest and quest markers. Enemies are also marked with red dots when alive and gray X’s once they fall, giving the player a visual reminder of where to find their backpacks and that sweet low-level loot within. The firing mode indicator located beneath your ammo count indicates whether the weapon is toggled to semi-auto or fully automatic fire. Most of the information that needs to be conveyed to the player is presented in unobtrusive HUD elements shrunk down to the edges of the screen, giving more screen real estate for players to admire the corrupted beauty of the Ukrainian Zone.</em></p>

<p>GSC Game World has just announced that Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl has been delayed <strong>again </strong>by another two months. It will now be released on November 20, 2024. This will come as a blow to the fans who were expecting to get their hands on the post-apocalyptic, open-world epic this coming September. It has been <strong>years </strong>since Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl was revealed, but countless issues have surfaced that prevented GSC from delivering the game according to an original timeline.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-self-awareness">Self-Awareness</h2>



<p>In a brief trailer, GSC Game World revealed the delay with a tongue-in-cheek nod to the fact that it is just the latest in a long line of postponements. The video is even titled ‘Really, Again?’</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl — Really, Again?" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vxeGyXSM5Pc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It’s not all bad news, though. The revelation was accompanied by the promise of a developer-led deep dive into Stalker 2 on August 12. This will give players an unparalleled look at the game behind the scenes and on the surface, with GSC walking through an entire story quest and hosting panels and new development footage.</p>



<p>In a statement, the game director at GSC, Yevhen Grygorovych, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We know you might be tired of waiting, and we truly appreciate your patience. These two additional months will give us the chance to fix more “unexpected anomalies” (or simply “bugs”, as you call them). We are always grateful for your ongoing support and understanding – it means the world to us. We’re just as eager as you are to finally release the game and for you to experience it for yourself.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It has been a long journey, and it has just gotten a little longer. Given how good the game looks, it’s a small price to pay to have any remaining bugs ironed out of it before it hits the market.</p>

		<p>GSC Game Worlds has announced a new release date for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stalker-2">STALKER 2</a>: Heart of Chornobyl. The game will now launch across PC and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> (and certain tiers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pss">Xbox Game Pass</a>) on 20th November 2024, a delay of two and a half months from the previously announced 5th September.</p>
<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl — Really, Again?" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vxeGyXSM5Pc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The team writes, “We know you might be tired of waiting, and we truly appreciate your patience. These two additional months will give us the chance to fix more “unexpected anomalies” (or simply “bugs”, as you call them). […] We are always grateful for your ongoing support and understanding – it means the world to us. We’re just as eager as you are to finally release the game and for you to experience it for yourself.”</p>
<p>Either way, the team is also planning to give a much deeper look at the game in the near future, with a Developer Deep Dive video set for 12th August to look behind the scenes on the game’s creation and explore more of how the game actually plays.</p>
<p>This deep dive video will feature:</p>

<ul>
<li>Interviews and behind-the-scenes of the development process;</li>
<li>Lots of new footage, including world overview, various locations, gameplay and cutscenes;</li>
<li>A full video walkthrough of one of the story quests.</li>
</ul>
<p>This gives a little more time to catch up on the series so far. Console players have been able to visit the twisted world of STALKER for the first time with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/09/stalker-legends-of-the-zone-trilogy-review-ps5-xbox-ps4/">a STALKER trilogy remaster</a> earlier this year. Dipping into those games, Jim said, “the trilogy presents console players with an opportunity to play through these STALKER titles in the same condition that PC players have been able to experience them for the last decade and a half. As someone who struggled to get them running on my own PC back around the time they launched, being able to finally venture into the Zone on console has been immensely satisfying, even if these ageing first person shooters don’t cater for modern gamer sensibilities.”</p>

            <p>Animal caretaking sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/zoochosis">Zoochosis</a> is about being an ordinary zookeeper working in an ordinary zoo. What's that? There are no ordinary zoos? My mistake. Let me start again. Animal caretaking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror game</a> Zoochosis is about being a stressed-out zookeeper in a hideous zoo where the giraffes have tendrils coming out of their chests and the kangaroos have rows of chattering teeth in their marsupial pouch. There, got it right in the end. We've known about the development of this terror-heavy tourist attraction since its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/animal-loving-horror-zoochosis-is-an-open-homage-to-the-thing">announcement early this year</a>. But now the upcoming horror sim has been given an autumn release date in a new trailer.</p>

<p>It's coming out September 23rd, say developers Clapperheads. "Zoochosis", as Edwin informs us, is an actual term for the unusual behaviour exhibited by animals in real life zoos, such as pacing or excessive scratching. But usually the zebras of reality don't grow a set of fully functioning gnashers in their anus. It is these travails you'll be dealing with as the feeder and cleaner of the wildlife in the upcoming horror game.</p>
<p>"Interact with the animals, take care of them, choose and prepare a meal for them, restock and clean up after them in the enclosure," says the game's blurb <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2458560/Zoochosis/">on Steam</a>, while also noting something is deeply wrong with the animals. "But you can save them. You can discover the cause of the infection, create a vaccine and cure them."</p>
<p>I enjoy the creature design on display, and the obligatory suggestion that humanity is responsible for the monstrofication of the animal kingdom and earth's natural bounty as a whole. I'm not sure how deep the sim elements go and how much it will veer off into straight horror. We'll have to wait and see. Either way, I'm certain it'll appeal to a lot of fans of Carpenter-esque nightmares as well as the "fucked-up theme park" aficionados. Some people get their escapism from pretending to be a farmer in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> and petting the nice chickens. Others? Others want to mop up the human viscera from the floor of the bone-hippo enclosure. Let's just be glad there is a place for animal lovers of all stripes in this world.</p>

            <p>
Lego has revealed a 2D-style Super Mario World set featuring Mario and Yoshi.
</p>
<p>
The set is viewable today at San Diego Comic-Con, and official product images of it are already circulating online (thanks, <a href="https://jaysbrickblog.com/news/lego-71438-super-mario-world-mario-yoshi-is-a-16-bit-ode-to-the-super-nes-classic/">Jay's Brick Blog</a>).
</p>
<p>
Reportedly, the set will launch on 1st October and feature 1215 pieces. We'll update again when it's officially announced with details of pricing. 
</p>
<p>
The set is the latest entry into Lego's adult-orientated Super Mario range, following earlier impressive sets such as the fold-out ? Block and Bowser statue. 
</p>
<p>
This time, the focus is firmly on Nintendo's earlier heritage once again - with a design based on 1990 SNES platformer Super Mario World.

<p>
Mario wears his yellow cape from the game, and rides atop Yoshi. A small crank can be seen in imagery for the set, and it looks like this will operate Yoshi's arms and legs, making Mario's loyal steed appear to move. 
</p>
<p>
It's a busy time for Lego sets based upon video games. There's the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-great-deku-tree-lego-set-officially-revealed-by-nintendo">Legend of Zelda: Deku Tree set</a> due to launch on 1st September, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-lego-sets-leak-including-99-battle-bus">Lego's big new Fortnite range</a> kicks off on 1st October.
</p>
<p>
And then there's a new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/enjoy-8-inches-of-lego-shadow-the-hedgehog-this-october">eight-inch Shadow the Hedgehog bust</a>, also revealed today.

            <p>
Forthcoming action-RPG Phantom Blade Zero will have a seamless, non-linear map "just like the Souls games before <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>."
</p>
<p>
That's according to the game's director, who (ironically) goes by the moniker Soulframe, as interviewed by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/dev-behind-action-rpg-phantom-blade-zero-says-its-seamless-non-linear-map-is-just-like-the-souls-games-before-elden-ring/">Games Radar</a> discussing its world design.
</p>
<p>
"It's just like the old Souls games," said Soulframe. "You move around and explore in a seamless map, it's just not a huge open-world map. But every region is connected together seamlessly."
</p>

<p>
"There are certain gates requiring keys, and the keys are obtained from some missions," Soulframe continued. "There's still some process you go through, but it's non-linear. There are always multiple paths you can go through. It's just like the Souls games before Elden Ring."
</p>
<p>
It's an intriguing comparison, considering the developer has continually stated Phantom Blade Zero is not a Soulslike.
</p>
<p>
In the same Games Radar interview, Soulframe described the game as an action-RPG with "combo-driven, heart-pumping combat that is hectic, rewarding, and exhilarating".
</p>
<p>
The developer also stated in a post-Summer Games Fest Q&amp;A the game is not a Soulslike. "It's worth stressing again that 'making another Souslike' was never part of the plan," reads the statement. "We did take inspiration from Soulslike games, such as multi-layered maps, multiple approach paths, and hidden nooks and crevices, but the similarities stop there. There will be difficulty options, and you won't have to face respawned mobs after you die or interact with checkpoints."

<p>
Meanwhile, in an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/phantom-blade-zero/soulslike-interview">PCGamesN</a>, Soulframe discussed difficulty in comparison to the Souls games, adding the studio doesn't have the "privilege of FromSoftware" to make players frustrated.
</p>
<p>
"We want our players to enjoy the pure combat, the story, and the world; that's the point," said Soulframe. "As a new studio, I don't think we have the privilege of FromSoftware to make you frustrated while you're playing. We'd rather keep it accessible to everyone so that everyone can enjoy it."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slick-looking-action-rpg-phantom-blade-zero-blends-chinese-martial-arts-with-punk-spirit">Phantom Blade Zero was first revealed at Sony's PlayStation Showcase in 2023</a>, and was shown once again at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-during-summer-game-fest-2024">this year's Summer Game Fest</a>. The action game is inspired by Chinese martial arts and Wuxia.

			<p>The NVIDIA RTX 4080 GPU is among the most powerful available on the market, but even so, it struggles quite a bit running Unreal Engine 5 games at native 4K resolution with decent performance.</p>
<p>A new comparison video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmarkPC</a> highlights how the NVIDIA GPU has trouble running the vast majority of Unreal Engine 5 games, such as Nobody Wants to Die, Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2, Lords of the Fallen, The First Descendant and Remnant 2, at native 4K resolution at framerates higher than 30 FPS. Only with the help of NVIDIA DLSS, the GPU can reach 60 FPS and above in these games, although in more than a few cases, performance still isn't at the level it should be.</p>
<p><iframe title="RTX 4080 Unreal Engine 5 - How Good Can it Run UE5 Games at 4K? | Test in 12 Unreal Engine 5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y6fjhoA3l34?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The fact that even games that don't use some of the Unreal Engine 5 most taxing features, like Lumen and Nanite, can't run decently at native 4K resolution even on an RTX 4080 isn't particularly surprising, as over and over in the past few weeks we have seen how demanding is the new version of the engine by Epic. Seeing a game powered by the engine run at native 4K resolution with decent performance, in particular, may be something we won't often see, even with more powerful hardware, as the engine has been built around <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-cant-run-native-4k-engine-design/">upscaling.</a></p>
<p>The latest version of Unreal Engine 5 is version 5.4. You can learn more about the changes introduced by it on the engine's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-5-4-is-now-available" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

A next-gen compatible version of the mod is currently in development, but it does not have a release date yet.</p><p>The GOG version is exactly the pre-patched one (1.10.163.0), which the PC storefront maintained "in order to provide time for modding communities to update their mods." This means you’ll be able to launch Fallout London installation right away.</p><p>The Steam version of the game is after the next-gen update, making it non-compatible. This means you’ll have to downgrade your game to the compatible pre-patch version before proceeding with installation.</p><p>To simplify the mod installation itself, GOG worked with Fallout London developer Team FOLON to create a dedicated launcher that installs the mod with one click via GOG Galaxy or offline installers. All you need to do is have a copy of Fallout 4: Game of the Year Edition installed (either on GOG or the downgraded Steam version), grab Fallout London from GOG, run the mod launcher (by clicking 'Play' on Fallout London’s game view in GOG Galaxy or its offline installer), and then play.</p><p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY:</strong> The hotly anticipated <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> mod, Fallout London, finally launches today, July 25, after a series of delays.</p><p>Team FOLON lead project manager Dean Carter told <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/fallout-london-bethesda-mod-tomorrow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inverse</a> that, “unless nuclear war happens, yes,” July 25 is the release date.</p><p>Fallout London is perhaps the most high-profile mod ever created, and lets players engage with everything from “stuffy parliamentary aristocrats to a resurrection of the Knights of the Round Table to an uncompromising cult of revolutionaries" in what amounts to an expansion-sized add-on.</p><p>It has even secured the likes of Baldur's Gate 3's Neil Newbon for its voice cast, with former UK Speaker of the House John Bercow in the game, too.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/25/eastminster-1-1140x641-1721901010340.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The mod was previously due to arrive on April 23, 2024 but actual Fallout developer Bethesda announced a surprise update for Fallout 4, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-london-creators-forced-to-delay-hotly-anticipated-mod-out-of-fear-fallout-4s-next-gen-update-will-break-it"><u>which the mod developer feared would impact its release</u></a>.</p><p>Carter later lamented how Bethesda, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-fallout-london-modders-jobs"><u>which has made clear it's aware of Fallout: London</u></a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-4-next-gen-update-left-fallout-london-dev-feeling-blindsided"><u>failed to inform Team FOLON of its plans</u></a>. "That has, for lack of a better term, sort of screwed us over, somewhat,” Carter said.</p><p>As a result of Bethesda’s Fallout 4 updates, the release of Fallout London is slightly fiddly. If you get the mod on GOG, it’s compatible with Fallout 4: Game of the Year Edition from both GOG and Steam. But the Steam version of the game is after the next-gen update, making it non-compatible, which means you have to downgrade your game.</p><p>Meanwhile, GOG has confirmed that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-london-wont-work-with-epic-games-store-copies-of-fallout-4"><u>Fallout London won't be playable via Epic Games Store-bought copies of Fallout 4</u></a> at launch because the storefront doesn't support update rollbacks.</p><p>Bethesda development chief Todd Howard has confirmed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/todd-howard-bethesda-fallout-5-elder-scrolls-6-starfield"><u>Fallout 5 will arrive after the Elder Scrolls 6</u></a>, which is still years away itself, though massively multiplayer online game <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-76"><u>Fallout 76</u></a> continues to be updated.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

		<p>A new <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/game-of-thrones">Game of Thrones</a> RPG is now available to download and play, just in time for those currently watching House of the Dragon season 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="Game of Thrones: Legends Official Pre-Registration Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ptiMkPE6eRc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>However, if you were hoping to explore the Seven Kingdoms in a <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/skyrim">Skyrim</a> or Witcher style AAA adventure then Game of Thrones: Legends may not be for you. Developed by Farmville creator <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/zynga">Zynga</a> – who also launched new arena shooter, Star Wars Hunters – this is a mobile match 3 puzzler that puts you at the helm of your own warband battling your way through Westeros.</p>
<p>The big draw here is that you can recruit a roster of fan favourite characters from Game of Thrones and the more recent House of the Dragon TV adaptation.</p>
<h3>Game of Thrones: Legends Overview</h3>
<p><em><strong>CREATE A LEGENDARY TEAM OF CHAMPIONS</strong></em></p>

<p><em>Seize the chance to team up Khal Drogo, Arya Stark, the Hound, and more! Build your house and train your team to increase their power, unlock new abilities, and fight for Westeros.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>EPIC PUZZLE-RPG GAMEPLAY</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Make matches and strategically clear puzzles to charge your Champions’ special abilities. Match 3 or more gems to solve puzzles. Set up amazing combos to deal extra damage and savage your enemies in this epic puzzle game. Become the most powerful player in Westeros as you progress deeper in your Westeros story by maxing out your champions’ power and completing key milestones.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>UNLEASH SPECIAL CHARACTER ABILITIES</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Exercise each Champions’ unique powerful ability by charging them up with matches. Strategically customize your team by equipping characters with deadly weapons or iconic items unique to them – such as pairing Jon Snow with Longclaw or Arya with Needle – to defeat your enemies and turn the tide of battle in your favor.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>BATTLE IN NARRATIVE-DRIVEN EVENTS</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Immerse yourself in Game of Thrones lore. Tackle special challenges or fight in limited time events and tournaments based on iconic moments to gain power and progress in your journey. For example, fight The Battle of the Bastards to add Ramsay Bolton or Wun Wun, the Wildling Giant, to your collection.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>FORM A NEW HOUSE &amp; JOIN ALLIANCE WARS</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Partner your noble House of Westeros with Houses commanded by other players to form an Alliance. Work together to fight enemies for bigger rewards, and collectively compete against rival Alliances in Tournaments &amp; Special Events to climb the rungs of power and conquer the Seven Kingdoms.</em></p>
<p>Great video games based on the popular license have been sadly few and far between. Aside from Cyanide’s flawed but fascinating <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2012/06/13/game-of-thrones-review-ps3-xbox-360/">Game of Thrones RPG</a> and Telltale’s star-studded, story-driven adaptation, fans have had to settle for mobile and browser based games, Legends being the latest addition.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Now Announces an Exclusive MrBeast Collaboration]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-now-announces-exclusive-mrbeast-collaboration</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-now-announces-an-exclusive-mrbeast-collaboration.936309/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-now-announces-exclusive-mrbeast-collaboration<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom and developer Niantic are gearing up for even more updates heading to <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> this month. Following a successful release in Japan last year, <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> hit 15 million downloads in six months, promoting a focus on a real-world Monster Hunter experience whilst hunting monsters with simple and authentic gameplay.</p>
<p><br>
Like many mobile games, <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> makes use of a season system, with two – Vernal Invader, and Dancing in the Tempest – under its belt already, it’s time for the next major update centering on group hunts.</p>
<p><br>
Niantic is set to debut a new system called Dimensional Links, which is a sort of evolution from the game’s concept of all of the monsters spawning into our world through Dimensional Rifts. The story here is that some of those monsters got entangled and became Dimensional Link monsters instead.</p>
<p><br>
What this means is that they’re caught between worlds and these monsters can be in multiple places on Earth at the same time.</p>
<p><br>
The way it works is, by tapping on a Dimensional Link monster, players can team up to hunt it with three other faraway hunters. If you’re inclined, you can also fight these monsters with a party of friends, but currently not with a local party and faraway hunters combined. Dimensional Link monsters can also not be captured for later. The whole idea is that this creates more opportunities to play with others, and opens up the game to newcomers as well.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/i3ng5zlg.jpeg?itok=ua4dRX20 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/i3ng5zlg.jpeg?itok=x3u7frfy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br>
On top of this announcement, Niantic revealed that <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> will launch a collaboration with popular YouTube personality MrBeast starting July 27. The team wanted to do something with meaningful integration and do this won’t just be something superficial – there’s a whole custom narrative built around MrBeast, his theming, and in-game items.</p>
<p><br>
“<em>Monster Hunter Now</em> is super fun and also encourages people to go outside, explore, and get active,” said Jimmy Donaldson, aka MrBeast, “Working with Niantic on my very own <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> quest line has been fantastic. I love that they partner with creators and trust them to know how to reach their audience.”</p>
<p><br>
The plot of this event will involve MrBeast asking for help, giving users the ability to slay monsters so that MrBeast and his priorities can be secured. By doing these quests, players can obtain an exclusive custom MrBeast sword and shield.<br>
The weapon set is notable because it’s non-elemental and will be one of the strongest in that class at grade 10.</p>
<p><br>
Niantic developed this partnership exclusively with MrBeast for <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> – it won’t be ported over to any of the other Monster Hunter games, as an example.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mrbeast-collab_0.jpg?itok=KLJq4cn2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mrbeast-collab_0.jpg?itok=BAbuGUTg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br>
As they want it to be newcomer friendly, the first step of the involved quest will have players forging this weapon, with which they can then upgrade and obtain special skills for it known as MrBeast Challenge! You’ll really want to upgrade this one to grade 6, and then after that common materials can get it up to grade 10.</p>
<p><br>
In addition to the weapon, players can collect MrBeast-themed merch for free including a hoodie, face paint, and an exclusive quest medal. There’s also a guild card background to show off Monster Hunter Now’s first entertainment collaboration.</p>
<p><br>
The MrBeast event will run from July 27 to September. <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> is currently available for iOS and Android platforms.</p>

            <p>The team at Double Fine is offering Xbox 360 owners free digital codes for Kinect Party -  the sequel to its eccentric title Happy Action Theater - ahead of the console's digital store closure later this month.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Microsoft is set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-360-digital-store-will-close-next-july">close its Xbox 360 digital store on 29th July</a>, as announced last year. In addition, the Microsoft Movies &amp; TV app on the Xbox 360 will no longer function. Following this date, users will still be able to play Xbox 360 games on Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S consoles via backward compatibility.</p>

<p>To prepare for this closure, developer Double Fine - which is also known for the likes of Psychonauts and Brütal Legend - has asked its Xbox 360 players to make sure they download any games ahead of time, "just to be sure" they can retain access to them after 29th July.</p>
<p>It also noted that while "most" of its games will still be available digitally on Xbox One and upwards, one specific title will not be: Kinect Party - as the Xbox 360 Kinect is not supported by later Xbox hardware.</p>
<p>"Alas, digital preservation evangelists are again proven correct," Double Fine wrote.</p>
<p>In light of this, the studio is offering anyone interested in giving the game a whirl for themselves a Kinect Party code. Codes are limited, Double Fine said, but if you are one such Xbox 360 Kinect player ("It's one of them wavy arm games!") who fancies a shot, you can email <a href="mailto:support@doublefine.com">support@doublefine.com</a> to ask for one.</p>
<p>Other Xbox 360 games, including the Kinect's My Self Defence Coach, are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-360-digital-store-gets-swathe-of-discounts-ahead-of-closure">currently discounted on the console's digital store</a>. Once more, the digital store is set to close down next week, on 29th July.</p> <div>

            <p>
Dragon Quest series creator Yuji Horii believes modern advancements in game graphics make silent protagonists "look like an idiot".
</p>
<p>
Horii recently discussed the topic of RPGs with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atlus-persona-follow-up-metaphor-refantazio-gets-release-date">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> director and producer Katsura Hashino, an excerpt of which was published by <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/240722m">Denfaminicogamer</a> (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/dragon-quest-creator-talks-about-an-unexpected-challenge-the-series-is-facing-due-to-graphics-becoming-more-realistic/">Automaton</a>). 
</p>
<p>
One challenge Horii believes the Dragon Quest franchise is facing is how a protagonist should be depicted now that graphics have become more realistic - allowing for more detailed and expressive designs.
</p>

<a aria-label="DRAGON QUEST III HD 2D Remake – Release Date Trailer – Nintendo Switch" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QSd31mFvOTU?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>

The Dragon Quest games have had silent protagonists, or "the symbolic protagonist" as Horii puts it, which allows players to see themselves as the main character and project their own emotions. This choice was partly due to technological restrictions at the time.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, graphics are more lifelike and detailed. Horii joked: "As game graphics evolve and grow increasingly realistic, if you make a protagonist who just stands there, they will look like an idiot."
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, a speaking protagonist can be hard for players to relate to. "That's why, the type of protagonist featured in Dragon Quest becomes increasingly difficult to depict as games become more realistic," said Horii. "This will be a challenge in the future too."
</p>
<p>
Horii's comments could easily apply to a number of major series, including the likes of The Legend of Zelda and Pokémon, which have historically all had silent protagonists.
</p>
<p>
With Link in particular, Nintendo have found ways to make the character expressive within the confines of the visual aesthetic, without the need for speech. That rings true for the detail of Tears of the Kingdom as much as the minimalist approach for Wind Waker.
</p>
<p>
The forthcoming HD-2D remake of Dragon Quest 3 will allow players to choose between a male or female protagonist (as per the original) and it now includes voiced dialogue for some characters. However, this is all about modernising the pixel graphics of the original game, so Horii's comments instead may hint that Dragon Quest 12 - the next new game in the series - could have a voiced protagonist.
</p>
<p>
The previous game, Dragon Quest 11, does include a voice option for the protagonist but this only adds grunts rather than full dialogue.
</p>
<p>
I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-is-the-excuse-i-need-to-properly-play-this-iconic-series">hands-on with the Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D remake</a> recently, describing it as "a balance of old and new that remains firmly in retro territory, but with tasteful touches to smoothen out the experience."

</p>
<p>
Do you like a silent protagonist, or would you prefer main characters to all speak?

                <p>Cherrypick Games has announced its next project, and it's a stylish-looking survival game called Angst: A Tale of Survival. Cherrypick Games, based in Poland, is known for its <a href="https://cherrypickgames.com/our-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">slate of free mobile games</a>, but Angst is the studio's first major premium game for PC and console.</p><p>The studio says fans can think of the game as "Don't Starve meets Dredge meets Hades" in terms of the genres and tone it's aiming for. The game features roguelite progression and what's described as a "contemplative, quest-driven narrative." Take a look at the cinematic trailer below to get a feel for the game's tone, vibe, and setting.</p>
