<p>Are you excited about Berlin’s VCT Game Changers Championship? The relatively new tournament series has become increasingly popular among Valorant fans. The co-ed series features both women and male players from various esports organizations. Here is the upcoming VCT Game Changers Championship format being used.</p>



<h2 id="h-berlin-s-vct-game-changers-championship-format">Berlin’s VCT Game Changers Championship Format</h2>



<p>The popular event will feature some of the best Valorant players in the world facing off against each other in Berlin. However, no official prize pool has been announced.</p>



<p>Still, fans are gearing up for a legendary event to see who takes home the 2024 Game Changers Championship title.</p>



<p>So, what about the format? Well, Riot Games just released the tournament format today on Twitter, let’s break it down:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>10 Teams Competing</strong></li>



<li><strong>Double-Elimination</strong></li>



<li><strong>Best-of-3 Brackets</strong></li>



<li><strong>Top Seeds From NA and EMEA Will Get a Buy Into 2nd Round</strong></li>



<li><strong>Final Matches: Best-of-5</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The series will feature competitors from the following regions of the world:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>North America</strong></li>



<li><strong>Latin America</strong></li>



<li><strong>EMEA</strong></li>



<li><strong>China</strong></li>



<li><strong>APAC</strong></li>



<li><strong>Brazil</strong></li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>Grand Finals will be streamed live on the <a href="https://x.com/ValorantEsports/status/1850930070640324947">official Valorant Twitch.</a></p>







<h2 id="h-tournament-dates">Tournament Dates</h2>



<p>Here are the official VCT Game Changers Championship dates:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>November 8 – 17, 2024.</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The tournament series is meant to give Valorant fans and competitors the gaming action they need during the official VCT off-season. The actual VCT season ended in South Korea back in August of 2024 when EDward Gaming was awarded first place.</p>



<p>Luckily, Valorant understands that waiting until 2025 for more competitive Valorant action will not go over well with fans and players. </p>

<ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review.1021203/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been a long time since I've played a game that stuck with me in the way that 2015’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/life-is-strange-series-review">Life is Strange</a> has. Its ability to tell a unique coming-of-age story about a rebellious but often shy teen without coming off preachy or overstaying its welcome was refreshing and had me thinking about it long after I discovered everything I could within the confines of Arcadia Bay. While the series has had a few sequels, prequels, and side stories since, none of them seemed to recapture the magic of those first five episodes for me – until now. Life is Strange: Double Exposure not only lives up to the sky-high standard set by the original but also manages to take it in a fresh new direction and improve on nearly every aspect from the previous games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was great to revisit Max Caulfield 10 years after the events of Life is Strange. Even though Max is well into her 20s now, she's still very much the same character she was the last time we saw her: She’ll overanalyze her surroundings, make awkward jokes to herself, and, most importantly, take way too many pictures. But with her transition to adulthood comes a whole new set of issues she needs to deal with. Instead of worrying about fitting in and trying to impress everyone she met in Blackwell Academy, she’s now a grad student and has to act as an authority figure herself. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Life is Strange: Double Exposure Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are moments where she's clearly coming to terms with the fact that she’s no longer young, such as when she questions some of the cringeworthy things she said in the original game or reminisces about when she was an undergrad and had to cram in as much studying and caffeine as possible before finals. It was the little moments like this that stuck with me and really helped make this new chapter in Max’s story even more relatable.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Writing on The Walls</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d expect in a Life is Strange game, you'll need to make some tough decisions. Even though there are only a handful of major choices in each of the five chapters and not all of them will dramatically affect the overall outcome, they do all have consequences because characters will remember how you treat them and act accordingly – to a degree that previous games never managed to nail down. This time, conversations felt like I was talking to an actual person instead of playing a game of guessing the correct answer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, in the first chapter, you are able to ask Amanda, the bartender of a local joint called The Snapping Turtle, out on a date if you play your cards right. On my first playthrough, I did everything I would need to in order to kickstart a romantic relationship with her by learning a handful of awful pick-up lines from other bar patrons. But on my second run, I opted not to ask her out and instead just became friends. While this didn't necessarily change anything major with the story moving forward, I appreciated that there was a stark difference in how Amanda treated Max if they were dating or were just friends. In addition to romancing people, you can be mean, flirty, or even flat-out ignore someone if you want to. Without diving too heavily into spoiler territory, this is one of the few choose-your-own-adventure-style games I’ve played where I didn't stress about making the “wrong decision” because every outcome felt natural and worth exploring rather than some being a consolation prize. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Double Exposure’s chapters each take around two or three hours to complete, which makes them shorter than those in some of the other Life is Strange games. This is actually a good thing, though, because I never felt like I was wasting my time dealing with a filler act or meandering around a party just to pad out the runtime. While there are a few plot points that don't really seem to go anywhere unless you dig through Max’s phone, I never felt like I was missing out on anything too important to the overall story just because I neglected to keep up with my backlog of text messages and social media posts. I like a good epic-scale RPG, too, but the fact that Double Exposure respected my time and told a story that’s tight and concise was refreshing.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That story deals with a number of seriously heavy topics. Everything from divorce to anxiety to the different ways we grieve over the loss of a loved one is covered here in a way that's so expertly written I never felt like any of these subjects were diminished or sensationalized – they just felt real. It would have been easy for Double Exposure to touch on a sensitive topic and then resolve it with a “thing bad” or “thing good” decision at the end, but instead the writing offers nuanced and appropriate approaches to its situations, many of which I’ve had to deal with in my own life. Seeing a video game character struggle to handle something like the anger and frustration one might feel after someone close to them takes their own life was an unexpected and especially well-executed bit of writing.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What really sells the writing is the incredible performances and animations.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It works so well in part because every character in Double Exposure has their own backstory and is written to feel like an actual human being, faults and all. For example, Reggie, a student at the school where Max teaches, will overshare at times because he sees Max as an authority figure, while Gwen, another teacher at Caledon Univeristy, keeps private details to herself because, like in real life, not everyone immediately tells everybody they meet everything about themselves. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What really sells Double Exposure’s writing and story is its absolutely incredible performances and character animations. While this has always been a highlight of the series, this game has more moments where characters would tell me everything they needed to say without speaking a word thanks to their subtle facial expressions. Say something mean and a character may look at you with disgust for a moment before responding. Pull somebody away from a group and you'll see other characters briefly look disappointed that you interrupted them. While this isn't anything new in games, the way in which Double Exposure emphasizes these little touches made me actually care about my actions and how I treated people. Thanks to this attention to detail and directing, Double Exposure’s character interactions are easily the most believable and well-executed I've seen in a Life is Strange game. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Reinventing Your Exit</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Without getting too heavy into spoiler territory here, Double Exposure’s mystery is one full of twists and turns that definitely kept me guessing until I reached the finale. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The decision to give Max different powers was the correct choice because her original time manipulation abilities just wouldn't have worked within the story being told here. If she could rewind time with the turn of her palm then the entire mystery could have been solved in a few moments, and that's just no fun. Instead, those powers have been replaced by a set of interdimensional travel abilities that fit this new tale perfectly. As its title suggests, Max is able to view and travel between two separate realities: one that's vibrant, warm, and full of life, complete with Christmas decorations and a more upbeat soundtrack, and another that's miserable, cold, and marked by death. These realities exist in tandem with each other and are, in many ways, polar opposites. Everything from flyers on the walls of the school halls to the music and even how people interact with Max can be wildly different between the dead and living worlds. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I never found myself getting frustrated or lost on a puzzle.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Puzzles this time around greatly benefit from Max’s abilities, too. I never found myself getting frustrated or lost, and I’m happy to say there were never any sections where I had to dodge a train or perform any sort of frustrating quick time events. Her new abilities instead allow for a slower-pace where I needed to use deductive reasoning and explore both realities in order to find a clue or spy on somebody. Need to find something for someone in the living world? It's probably nearby in the dead world. Need to sneak around an active murder investigation in the dead world? Just hop over to the living world and walk past where the guards are standing, then hop back. It’s not wildly complex stuff, but the way Double Exposure utilizes Max’s powers not only to help you find clues and explore but also to show how the world around you evolves in two separate paths at the same time makes this one of the more interesting uses of a multiverse in gaming.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Double Exposure's smart use of reality hopping also helps with the story in ways that no other power in Life is Strange has before. For example, someone could be dealing with some trouble in one world that informs how you interact with them in the other. Meanwhile, The Snapping Turtle in the living world is warm, people are conversing with each other, and the music is upbeat and welcoming, but its dead world version has aggressive music, there are fewer people around, and the lighting is cold and uninviting. Because I was able to explore freely and instantly see the differences between both realities, I found myself learning about the worlds, their characters, and the results of my actions in a more meaningful way rather than just searching for exposition dumps and waiting for text messages. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Nick's Tough Choices Playlist</h3><p>These are all games that require you to make tough choices.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Caledon University itself is an idealistic-looking Northeastern college campus. The buildings are old and covered in a layer of snow and student art, and the cinematography when you take a moment to reflect on a park bench or overlook shows off how beautiful this location is. Unfortunately, it's also a bit smaller than the areas from the other Life is Strange Games, and while it would have been nice to explore a larger world outside of the few accessible locations on campus, Max’s house, and The Snapping Turtle, every area in Double Exposure is pretty densely packed with things to interact with and explore. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">They are also bolstered by composer Tessa Rose Jackson with some of the best original music I've heard in a video game all year. The soundtrack not only perfectly captures the emotions of each scene but also helps to amplify the tone of the world, making it feel even more alive or dead, depending on which reality you're in. The same can be said about the color grading and cinematography. The series is known for its cinematic look, and Double Exposure is no exception thanks to its rich color palette and smart camera work. Vista shots, snap zooms, and following focus on characters are all artfully executed in a way that would feel at home in a feature film. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The US Copyright Office has confirmed it will not grant video game preservationists exceptions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://gamehistory.org/dmca-2024-statement/">statement</a>, the Video Game History Foundation (VGHF) said that for the last three years, it had been supporting the Software Preservation Network (SPN) in a petition to "allow libraries and archives to remotely share digital access to out-of-print video games in their collections".</p>
<p>However, despite the Copyright Office’s <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/1201/2024/2024_Section_1201_Registers_Recommendation.pdf">decision</a> to prevent licensed game archivists, the VGHF said it had "no regrets about going through this process".</p>

<p>"Over the last three years, working on the petition has helped us generate important research, notably our Survey of the Video Game Reissue Market in the United States report, which proved that around 87 percent of video games released in the United States before 2010 remain out of print," the organisation said.</p>
<p>"Our combined efforts with SPN have raised significant public awareness of these issues and have already made an impact throughout the game industry and preservation communities."</p>
<p>The statement went on to say that the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) "declared that [it] would never support remote game access for research purposes under any conditions", and the game industry's "absolutist position", forces researchers to explore "extra-legal methods to access the vast majority of out-of-print video games that are otherwise unavailable".</p>
<p>"We're not done fighting here," the VGHF concluded. "We will continue our advocacy for greater access and legal allowances for video game preservation and working with members of the game industry to increase internal awareness around these issues.</p>
<p>"We encourage members of the game industry who are disappointed by the Copyright Office’s decision to ask their leadership to push for greater support for the work of libraries and archives within their industry groups."</p>

			<p>Even when it was released in 2017, the Nintendo Switch was never a powerhouse hardware, but with some overclocking, the system is capable of achieving impressive scores in some benchmark tests and even running the Dolphin GameCube emulator reasonably well.</p>
<p>In a new video shared on YouTube a few days ago, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Naga</a> conducted another extreme overclocking test on L4T Ubuntu, effectively putting the Tegra X1 chip on steroids. This made the system achieve some impressive scores in tests such as Membench, Cuda95, and Geekbench 6. The fully overclocked system also runs the Dolphin GameCube/Wii emulator surprisingly well, achieving more than playable framerates at 1080p resolution in Mario Kart Wii.</p>
<p><iframe title="Switch Extreme OC Benchmark on L4T Ubuntu - (Geekbench/glmark2/Dolphin)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fRogKHSt5ro?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the past few months, we got a glimpse of what the Nintendo Switch is capable of doing with overclocking, thanks to a few other tests. One of them proved how an overclocked system modded with<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-8-gb-pro-model-modded/"> 8GB of RAM</a> is capable of running<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-extreme-overclocking-zelda-above-60-fps/"> Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom at above 60 FPS at native resolution and even at 30 FPS at 1440p</a>. If the rumors circulating online are correct, the console's successor shouldn't have much trouble running current games with good performance and great image quality, at least in its first few years of availability, thanks to 12 GB of LPDDR5X RAM, which should allow developers to deliver <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-12-gb-lpddr5x-ram-better-xbox-series-s/">better texture quality than the Xbox Series S</a>, and NVIDIA DLSS support.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/digital-extremes-double-devstream-confirmed-warframe-1999-soulframe-pre-alpha/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Digital Extremes treated the audience to a <a href="https://www.warframe.com/news/devstream-182-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">double Devstream</a> for Warframe and Soulframe, and those interested heard a lot of big news about the titles. The streams provided a lot of information about the franchise and started with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-1999-demo-out-now-on-all-platforms/">huge reveal</a> of Warframe: 1999, being released in December. A 1999 prequel webcomic will be released in November to get fans excited for the upcoming release. Additionally, Xaku Prime Access will begin on November 13.</p>
<p>Xaku is an amalgamation of three forgotten Warframes and is now converging once again. They previously acted as beneficiaries of the Entrati family and were lost to the void. Now they are emerging as Xaku Prime, and two new Prime weapons will also be released alongside them. A Syandana and Operator suit will also be released along with Xaku on November 13.</p>
<p>The comic has been produced in partnership with community artist Karu, and explores the founding of the Hex Syndicate. Additionally, there will be a playable mini-game in the Hollvanian Mall hub, where you can experience a "90s era run n' gun side-scroller," which was developed with Sumo Digital. You'll also be able to customize the Atomicycle with multiple color schemes and 11 upcoming premium skins to make your mode of transport flashy and exciting on the streets of Hollvania.</p>
<p>Trinity and Nyx will be receiving light reworks to make their gameplay experience more enjoyable, with Trinity's passive ability being replaced with other buffs to her other abilities to help make her meta-viable. This comes ahead of their Protoframe appearance in Warframe: 1999.</p>
<p>The team behind Soulframe provided an update, stating that the Preludes testing access will open up widely in 2025, which will give players a look into the pre-Alpha state of the game. The Devstream also provided new insight into the game, stating that the Preludes invites are continuing to be sent out, with the team continuing to provide access to players. Each player that gets invited to the playtest will get four additional codes that they can share with friends and family so that they don't have to experience the game on their own.</p>
<p>Additionally, additional changes to the combat system was mentioned, as well as the ability to acquire skills via weapon usage, changes to player progression, crafting and visual upgrades to the environments that players will get to explore.</p>
<p>During this devstream, they also honored one of the most prominent figures in the Warframe development team, Mike 'Mynki' Brennan. He was the first Art Director for Warframe, and helped provide great designs to the franchise and made Warframe the iconic IP that it is today. You can read his <a href="https://www.digitalextremes.com/news/remembering-mike-mynki-brennan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full obituary</a> on the Digital Extremes website, where they dedicate Warframe: 1999 to him.</p>

<p>Quickscoping is an incredibly popular playstyle in Call of Duty, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/">Black Ops 6</a> players are already testing out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-weapons-every-gun-and-how-to-unlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Snipers</a> to see which gun provides the fast ADS speeds and one-shot capabilities. </p>



<p>If you’re looking for the best quickscoping Sniper loadout in Black Ops 6, look no further, as we have all the attachments, Perks, and Equipment you’ll need to build an accurate and fast one-shot class setup.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-quickscoping-sniper-in-black-ops-6">Best quickscoping Sniper in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-lw3a1-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LW3A1 Frostline</a> is the best Sniper for quickscoping in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/playnow/blackops6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6</a> due to its fast mobility and handling. It’s a bolt-action Sniper  Rifle, so it requires an accurate shot, which is extremely satisfying when it hits. It will one-shot enemies to the head, upper chest, and upper arms, so you’ll need to retain accuracy while quickscoping in order to drop enemies quickly.</p>



<p>The SVD may have better handling and mobility, however, it’s a semi-auto rifle, which means it lacks one-shot capabilities, making it a worse option.</p>



<h3 id="h-is-the-lw3a1-frostline-better-than-the-lr-7-62">Is the LW3A1 Frostline better than the LR 7.62?</h3>



<p>The LW3A1 is better for quickscoping, but the LR 7.62 is the best Sniper in terms of damage and one-shot kill consistency. </p>



<p>The LR 7.62 will drop an enemy in one bullet so long as you hit the arms, chest, or head. The Frostline is less forgiving, as you need to hit the upper chest and arms to secure a one-shot kill. That said, the LR 7.62 is slower and has worse handling, so as far as quickscoping goes, I prefer the fast and weightless feel of the LW3A1.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-attachments-for-quickscoping-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments for quickscoping in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision.</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> Short Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Comb: </strong>Commando Riser</li>



<li><strong>Stock:</strong> Combat Stock</li>



<li><strong>Laser: </strong>Target Laser</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods:</strong> 7.62 Nato FMJ</li>
</ul>



<p>The <strong>Short Barrel </strong>provides a boost to the jumping aim down sight and sprint to fire speeds, which I found incredibly useful with Ominimovement in Black Ops 6, as you’ll often find yourself jumping around to avoid bullets and hit shots.</p>



<p>To increase aim down sight and sprint to fire speeds, the <strong>Commando Riser </strong>Comb is a great choice, while the <strong>Combat Stock</strong> provides some flinch resistance and aim walking movement speed.</p>



<p>Arguably the most important attachment for quickscoping in Black Ops 6 is the <strong>Target Laser</strong>, which drastically reduces aiming idle sway and improves your aim walking steadiness. This means that when you aim in, your aim will be more accurate to where your crosshairs were before aiming down sight, leading to more accurate quickscopes.</p>



<p>Lastly, to add some flair to your shots, the <strong>7.62 Nato FMJ </strong>Fire Mod will allow you to hit wallbangs with an improvement to penetration damage.</p>

<li><strong>Perk 2:</strong> Forward Intel</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3: </strong>Cold Blooded</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard:</strong> Overkill</li>
</ul>



<p>For the best quickscoping loadout in Black Ops 6, you’ll want <strong>Ghost</strong> to keep you off the enemy radar, <strong>Forward Intel </strong>for more information on the enemy team’s position, and <strong>Cold Blooded</strong> to avoid enemy scorestreaks. These combine to give you the <strong>Recon Combat Specialty</strong> too, which will reveal enemies through walls when you spawn, giving you a good idea of where to set up.</p>



<p>As for the Wildcard, <strong>Overkill</strong> is the best option, as you can then run an SMG like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-c9-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">C9</a> or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-ksv-loadout-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KSV</a> as your Secondary to cover those close-range engagements. </p>



<h2 id="h-best-equipment-to-use-with-sniper">Best Equipment to use with Sniper</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Tactical:</strong> Concussion</li>



<li><strong>Lethal:</strong> Combat Axe</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade:</strong> Spring Mine</li>
</ul>



<p>The Concussion is perfect for breaching rooms and stopping enemies from pushing you while you have a Sniper out. It also gives you the time you need to quickscope an enemy while they’re hunting you down, stunning them in their tracks. The Combat Axe is a classic and it should be on every Sniper loadout just for style points. It’s not the easiest to hit, but once you master the COmbat Axe, it can be very useful tool for close-range engagements.</p>



<p>When it comes to the Field Upgrade, whenever you’re set up in a nice spot on any of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maps</a>, you’ll want to cover yourself to prevent any flanker from shooting you in the back, so the <strong>Spring Mine</strong> is a great pick.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-has-drawn-in-most-traffic-ever-for-a-game-launch-in-the-uk/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It isn't a surprise that people would be excited for the new Call of Duty game, as the franchise has been a mainstay in the gaming industry for years. To celebrate the launch, Activision has put a lot of work into the marketing for the game, and it's claimed by the UK network EE and BT that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has drawn the largest traffic ever for a game launch in the country. If this is true, this is a huge milestone for the franchise and for Activision, but it also doesn't come as much of a surprise, considering how much Activision spent on marketing for this game.</p>
<p>What does come as a surprise is the peak for the number of players flocking to their PC and Consoles wasn't on the day of launch for the game; instead, it was October 21, which is when everyone who pre-ordered it would be able to pre-load the game ahead of its release.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is also a huge game, as it's the first game to be available on Xbox Game Pass as a day-one release. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and Warzone are also available to those who have Game Pass Ultimate. <a href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2024/10/black-ops-6-drives-biggest-ever-uk-gaming-traffic-on-ee-and-bt-network.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to ISPreview</a>, EE / BT saw a 144% increase in Xbox Live traffic on the broadband network compared to the week before. This is quite a monumental amount of traffic, but it isn't too surprising, as Call of Duty games are known for having huge download sizes. While there were reports that the game would be a whopping 300 GB, it isn't that big, thankfully. However, the game does still come in at a <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pre-load-details-revealed-102-gb-ssd-needed/">sizable 102 GB</a> for pre-load,&nbsp; which, for a lot of people, will take a lot of time to install. Because of this, it makes perfect sense that the traffic for the game would increase so heavily on the pre-load day, as no one wants to be waiting around on release day trying to install a game at a snail's pace.</p>
<p>At the moment, there haven't been any official figures released on how Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has been performing since release, but it has only been a couple of days thus far. It will be interesting to see the metrics for the number of players who come from Game Pass, as it is a significantly cheaper way to access the game than paying for the title outright, something that isn't an option for many gamers.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-battle-pass-xp-simplified</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-simplifies-fortnite-progression-with-unified-battle-pass-xp.1021137/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-battle-pass-xp-simplified<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has announced changes to the way&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s battle pass progression will work, and if you like to play different&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>experiences outside of the standard battle royale mode, you'll like this one.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/coming-soon-progress-your-fortnite-passes-by-playing-any-experience" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a news post</a> on the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>website, Epic says that by December 1st, all battle passes in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>will progress simultaneously, and you won't need to earn different kinds of XP to make progress along their tracks.</p>

<p>Right now, for instance, to make progress in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival</em>'s battle pass, you'd have to earn Festival Points, while to move along&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite</em>'s battle pass, you'd need Studs. Starting from December, however, that will no longer be the case.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lego-fortnite-battle-pass-xp-epic.jpg?itok=n-vlRSaC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lego-fortnite-battle-pass-xp-epic.jpg?itok=PpwkTkaE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Soon, all of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s battle passes will use the same XP to progress.</figcaption></figure><p>This change also means that whenever you earn XP in any of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s experiences, whether that's the main battle royale mode,&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite</em>,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival</em>, or any number of others, you'll gain XP for all battle passes.</p>

<p>Of course, you will still need to purchase the battle passes in question; Epic hasn't lost its mind, after all. Still, it's nice to know that you can be playing any&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>mode and not miss out on valuable XP elsewhere.</p>

<p>The first pass to get this treatment will be the Music Pass, which will be released as part of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival</em>'s sixth season on November 2nd. After that, on December 1st, the "Brick or Treat"&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>pass will adopt the new system, and all passes from that point on will use the new method.</p>

<p>Additionally, as part of this change, passes in&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Festival&nbsp;</em>will change to a single track with free and premium rewards, which is the same way the battle royale pass currently works.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-festival-battle-pass-xp.jpg?itok=3mUA-Lqt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-festival-battle-pass-xp.jpg?itok=zbEJF1Iw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Even&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival&nbsp;</em>will use Epic's new battle pass progression system.</figcaption></figure><p>Elsewhere in the world of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, the game is currently being used by none other than <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kamala-harris-is-courting-gamers-using-fortnite-in-the-last-week-of-the-us-presidential-campaign" rel="noopener" target="_blank">US presidential hopeful Kamala Harris</a> in order to drum up support for the upcoming election.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hasbro-board-games-fortnite-clue">board games of Hasbro</a> are also making their way to&nbsp;Epic's game<em>&nbsp;</em>in the form of custom maps. The first one's based around <em>Clue</em>-slash-<em>Cluedo</em>, and others will follow in the coming weeks.</p>

However, the game’s handling of trans identity goes beyond just options you can choose in the character creator that may support your own personal headcanon. In <em>The Veilguard</em>, BioWare has given you the option to actively declare in-game that your hero is transgender, in a way that’s reflected in dialogue throughout the game. Historically this has been the kind of thing that players have had to just apply to a game’s hero through their own imaginations, so I was happy to see BioWare went the extra step to codify it for those who want to play a trans Rook.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

Rather, it comes a few hours into the game when you unlock Rook’s quarters in the Lighthouse base. This isn’t something you can miss, so if you’ve started your own playthrough and haven’t seen it yet, don’t worry, you just haven’t gotten to this point in the game. When you’re setting up Rook’s room, one of the items you’ll put down is a handheld mirror. This gives Rook a moment of self reflection and you the opportunity to add some backstory to your character based on things you included in the character creator. Personally, I chose to talk about my tattoos and speak a little lore for my hero into the universe. But there’s one option that allows you to touch on Rook’s gender identity, specifically stating that your character is transgender. This isn’t tied to anything specific in the character creator, so no matter what options you choose while making them, you can still have a trans Rook in your story.</p><figure id="" data-id="953fc0d4a86c3c2f21e1346ae8710ace" data-recommend-id="image://953fc0d4a86c3c2f21e1346ae8710ace" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook looks at something off-screen as the dialogue options to declare your character as transgender appear on-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook looks at something off-screen as the dialogue options to declare your character as transgender appear on-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="953fc0d4a86c3c2f21e1346ae8710ace" data-recommend-id="image://953fc0d4a86c3c2f21e1346ae8710ace" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook looks at something off-screen as the dialogue options to declare your character as transgender appear on-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The three options include “I’m getting there,” “I love who I am,” and “Feels good to see the real me,” so you can designate your trans identity and also color in where you think they are in their personal journey. This will unlock some dialogue options throughout <em>The Veilguard</em> that allow you to discuss this aspect of your identity with other characters, so it’s not just a thing you have to internalize. However, as far as I can tell after finishing the game, if you don’t pick this option when you’re setting up Rook’s room, it doesn’t come up again later. So be sure to go down this dialogue path when you’re examining the mirror if you want to play as a trans Rook and have it be recognized in dialogue. It just might give you a point of common connection with some characters that will enrich your story throughout.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/all-passes-in-fortnite-to-progress-simultaneously-by-earning-xp-coming-december-1/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-passes-in-fortnite-to-progress-simultaneously-by-earning-xp-coming-december-1.1021104/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/all-passes-in-fortnite-to-progress-simultaneously-by-earning-xp-coming-december-1/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Fortnite has taken off on a massive scale, and they are constantly adding new content to the game to keep it fresh and appealing for new and returning players. This includes adding <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-talks-about-disneys-persistent-universe-in-fortnite/">new experiences</a> to the Fortnite universe, such as LEGO Fortnite, Rocket Racing, Fortnite Festival, and a ton of User-Created Content (including Kamala Harris' new Fortnite experience.) This makes the game more accessible and easier to grind. All passes in Fortnite will progress simultaneously by earning XP from playing any experience. This <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/coming-soon-progress-your-fortnite-passes-by-playing-any-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive change</a> will be coming on December 1.</p>
<p>Currently, only the Battle Royale Battle Pass levels up from XP gained in any experience. However, the team will be rolling out the update to include the upcoming Music Pass, which was previously known as the Festival Pass. The Music Pass will be able to level up this way as of November 2, with the change affecting remaining passes and future passes as of December 1.</p>
<p>Much like the current Battle Pass, the Music and LEGO passes released after December 1 will instead change to having just one track, which includes both free and premium rewards. This helps simplify the battle passes significantly. Additionally, to further simplify the process, they are also retiring Festival Points on November 2, which will be followed by Battle Stars and Studs on December 1. This is to simplify the process of earning your passes, and the rewards will instead just be unlocked via earning XP.</p>
<p>Of course, if you want to access the rewards in the Battle Pass, Music Pass, or LEGO Pass, you'll have to purchase them separately to get the premium rewards. However, you will still be able to access the free rewards with no issue.</p>
<p>Fortnite has gained a lot of popularity over the years, but it's now taking off in a somewhat peculiar way, too. In the final week before the U.S. 2024 presidential election, Kamala Harris has been trying to pitch her campaign to gamers. To do this, they launched their Fortnite map, Freedom Town, USA. Exploring the city will show you some of Harris' campaign pledges to try and inspire young people to go out and vote. Those who want to see what has been created can check out the map using this code: 733155366547. It isn't all too surprising that Harris has decided to do this, as we've seen them join Twitch in recent days to talk about politics while playing games, with Tim Walz streaming with AOC and playing the Dreamcast version of Crazy Taxi.</p>
<p>Make sure to keep an eye on your Battle Pass progress so that you aren't missing out on any rewards you may get as they slowly swap over to an XP progress system for all Battle Passes in Fortnite.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steins-gate-reboot-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steins-gate-re-boot-will-revive-a-classic-visual-novel-next-year.1021101/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steins-gate-reboot-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Visual novel developer Mages has announced&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot</em>, which appears to be either a remake or enhanced remaster of the original 2009 visual novel.</p>

<p>As noted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/steinsgate-reboot-to-bring-the-original-time-travel-adventure-to-modern-platforms/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>, details about the game are scarce at the moment; all we've got is a title, previews of some of the character artwork, and a rough release window of 2025.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202410/22274" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Famitsu article</a>&nbsp;(for which we're using machine translation),&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot&nbsp;</em>will feature additional story content, and it'll also have new character design from Huke, the artist who worked on the original game. It looks as though the character art has been redrawn as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steins-gate-reboot-2025-okabe.jpg?itok=ukgVQGlA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steins-gate-reboot-2025-okabe.jpg?itok=JXb1V5Qw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot&nbsp;</em>will seemingly feature redrawn character designs by original artist Huke.</figcaption></figure><p>The Famitsu article also says that&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot&nbsp;</em>is based on the original&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate</em>, so it won't be a new game entirely. You'll have to wait for the tentatively-titled&nbsp;<em>Steins;???&nbsp;</em>if you want to see how the&nbsp;<em>Science Adventure&nbsp;</em>series continues.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated,&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate&nbsp;</em>is a 2009 visual novel that serves as the second entry in Mages'&nbsp;<em>Science Adventure&nbsp;</em>series, which began with 2008's&nbsp;<em>Chaos;Head&nbsp;</em>(later released in enhanced form as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chaoshead-noah-steam-release-goes-ahead-after-all"><em>Chaos;Head Noah</em></a>).</p>

<p>The game revolves around eccentric scientist Okabe Rintaro, otherwise known as Okarin, who, along with a group of his fellow students, learns that he has developed a time machine that can send text messages into the past.</p>

<p>What follows is a typically Mages-esque twisty-turny mystery that incorporates the likes of CERN (yes, that CERN), as well as old-school technology and much more. It's perhaps best to play the game if you want to know just how bonkers it gets.</p>




<p>We don't yet know exactly when&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot&nbsp;</em>will arrive, nor do we know what platforms it will be released for. I'd say PC and PlayStation are safe bets, though, along with the Switch and whatever its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">much-vaunted successor turns out to be</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24281631/dragon-age-the-veilguard-early-review-ps5-xbox-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>I expected to get emotional playing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/15/24220559/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-trailer-gamescom"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a><em>,</em> but I didn’t think it’d happen as early as it did. It’s been nearly 10 years since <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, and the time since has been difficult for BioWare, with the studio beset by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23843096/bioware-layoffs-dragon-age-dreadwolf-mass-effect">layoffs,</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/23/23567676/bioware-mass-effect-mac-walters-dragon-age-dreadwolf">high-profile departures</a>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964">poorly</a> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-is-the-worst-reviewed-game-in-the-franchise/">performing games</a>. This led to speculation, if not outright fear, that <em>Veilguard</em> would be the latest in a string of disappointing releases. I shared those fears. <em>Dragon Age</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-inquisition-saved-my-life-1845717274">is a special franchise for me</a>, so naturally, I hoped<em> Veilguard</em> would live up to such expectations.</p><p>After 40 hours, I can’t say right now if it has. <em>Inquisition</em> became one of my most beloved games over months of digestion, new playthroughs, different choices, multiple romances, and discussions with internet acquaintances who, because of our shared love of <em>Dragon Age</em>, have become my dearest friends. <em>Veilguard</em> deserves similar consideration. But while I can’t definitively say if <em>Veilguard </em>is the RPG that I hoped it would be, I can say that within minutes of starting the game, I experienced a jolt, a spark, an unnamable <em>thing</em> that let me know that <em>Veilguard</em> has the potential to be the same kind of special <em>Inquisition</em> was. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24176102/dragon-age-the-veilguard-preview-summer-game-fest-bioware">It all started with the character creator</a>.</p><p><em><strong>Spoilers for Dragon Age: The Veilguard below.</strong></em></p><p>My avatars in previous <em>Dragon Age </em>games never looked like they did in my imagination. <em>Dragon Age </em>has always been a franchise where your choices inform the world around you. But as a Black player, the choices I could make for my appearance have always been limited, constrained by what the game’s technology could allow or simple developer oversight. But one of <em>Veilguard</em>’s biggest improvements over its predecessors is its enhanced character creator. There’s a wealth of skin colors, hairstyles, body types, facial features, blemishes, birthmarks, tattoos, and even top-surgery scars. I enjoyed picking my way through the choices, crafting a Rook to suit my tastes.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>This is the first time in a</em> Dragon Age<em> game where I can make a character that actually looks like me. I’m astounded.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: BioWare</cite></p></div><p>In <em>Veilguard</em>, Rook isn’t your name but your title, given when you were recruited to track down Solas, a companion from the previous game who was an elven god in disguise. Rook must thwart his plans of tearing down the magical barrier that separates the material world from the magical one. But when Rook and their team do manage to stop him, they unleash worse monsters. Now, Rook and Solas must work together to stop a pair of corrupted gods and their plans to destroy the world.</p><p>None of the <em>Dragon Age</em> games are direct sequels to one another. Each game only vaguely alludes to the events of the previous one, and sometimes major characters return as minor cameos. Both<em> Inquisition</em> and <em>Veilguard</em> use returning protagonists as a way to establish connection and to add drama for longtime fans. Like <em>Inquisition</em>, <em>Veilguard</em>&nbsp;offers the opportunity to customize a second character who you won’t control but will have an impact on the story — the Inquisitor, the main character from the previous game — and creating her knocked the breath out of me. I felt the same spark of recognition one gets from seeing an old friend after a long absence. Even though this person doesn’t exist, I knew this woman. She was the character who got me through some of my darkest days. It sounds so silly, but it meant so much to see my Inquisitor as I always envisioned her, to finally have reality match my imagination.</p><p>The leap in technology from <em>Inquisition</em> to <em>Veilguard</em> is noticeable beyond the character creator. Companions and environments are arresting in their design such that I couldn’t stop gawking. Lace Harding, one of your companions, is so dang pretty, a goodly portion of my screencaps are just of her — and I was tickled to see the game reward my obsession. The first big choice in <em>Veilguard</em> is who to take with you on a dangerous mission to stop a magical ritual. Because I chose Harding, she became grievously injured, with her face covered in bruises. But later, as I continuously visited her as a part of my “squeeze every bit of fun dialogue out of my companions” routine, I noticed that her bruises progressively got better. I could see not only a neat visual representation of the passage of time — something I’ve never seen in a <em>Dragon Age</em> before — but also the progression of our relationship. It felt like I was really checking up on her like I would a real friend. As her bruises healed, our relationship deepened.&nbsp;</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</p><div><figcaption><em>Harding’s bruises heal over time, and also she’s just indescribably beautiful.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: BioWare</cite></p></div></div><p>Locations are richly designed such that they feel like characters in their own right. Arlathan Forest, the game’s first big quest zone, is distractingly gorgeous. Someone on the environment team is very obviously a fan of Alex Garland’s <em>Annihilation</em> because the forest literally shimmers with colorful films of magic and is dotted with the bodies of tree people frozen in time. Because Treviso is under occupation by one of Veilguard’s enemy forces, its citizens are destitute, and the streets are littered with beggar bowls that I always drop a few coins in no matter what.</p><p>With the help of my companions, I really got to know those areas. Neve, my detective companion, took me on a tour of Dock Town, introducing me to her contacts and friends. Lucanis, my assassin companion, did the same for his hometown of Treviso. The game artfully made those places as dear to me as my companions were, to devastating effect.&nbsp;</p><p>I won’t spoil what happens directly, but just know that when the decision wheel popped, I groaned and giggled at the same time. Making impossible choices that have disastrous consequences is what <em>Dragon Age</em> is all about. It’s why I play. I won’t tell you what I chose, only that it hurt to decide, and it felt so good, so ironically comforting that, once again, a choice in a BioWare game caused me pain.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Your roster of companions features quite a few more mages than in previous games.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>In previous <em>Dragon Age</em> games, these decisions usually only resulted in personal consequences that weren’t all that substantial — damaged reputation here or a different type of enemy there. <em>Veilguard</em> is the first time my choice felt consequential to my character, to the world around her, and to me as a player.</p><p>At the start of my time with <em>Veilguard</em>, I was so worried that I wasn’t going to feel what I felt playing <em>Inquisition</em>. I was dazzled by all the pretty, and happy to get to explore all the new locations. But it took getting to that second big decision before the game really clicked.&nbsp;</p><p>These first 40 hours with <em>Veilguard</em> were a slow burn, and I liked the change of pace. Unlike the other games with big, explosive beginnings — literally, in <em>Inquisition</em>’s case — <em>Veilguard</em> took the time to build a world around me before shattering it just as I was getting comfortable. Now, the game <em>really</em> starts.</p><p><small>Dragon Age: The Veilguard <em>launches on October 31st on Xbox, PS5, and PC.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, one genre that you might not immediately think of as a hotbed of good scares is role-playing games. You’d be wrong, though. RPGs of all types have some of the best horror stories in the medium, thanks to the focus on expansive worlds and player freedom that can easily be twisted into a scary situation of your own making. If you’re a fan of thrills as well as lengthy games you can really sink your teeth into, then these seven terrifying RPGs are the perfect treat for Halloween.</p></div><div><p>We all saw this coming. The 2004 vampire RPG basically has the market cornered on horror RPGs even two decades after its release. But there’s good reason for that! <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wit-and-charm-are-powerful-weapons-in-vampire-the-masq-1835701842&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wit-and-charm-are-powerful-weapons-in-vampire-the-masq-1835701842"><em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines</em></a></span> drops you into an incredibly realized world of vampire politics that you get to involve yourself in and change through a slew of wonderful combat and dialogue systems. It’s a great RPG but it’s also deeply rooted in the compelling vampire world it’s set in, so you really can’t do better than this.</p></div><div><p>While <em>The Witcher 3</em> is already a gritty and dark fairytale RPG full of monsters, its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-witcher-3-blood-and-wine-the-kotaku-review-1779646150&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-witcher-3-blood-and-wine-the-kotaku-review-1779646150"><em>Blood and Wine</em></a></span> expansion might be an even better pick for Halloween. Sure, the brown and gray color palette gets a Technicolor update, but that’s just to make all the blood look even more vibrant. <em>Blood and Wine</em> is a vampire story that builds on the solid systems and characters of the base game. You don’t even have to play <em>The Witcher 3</em> first, as you can start <em>Blood and Wine</em> right from the menu.</p></div><div><p>The best parts of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/deciding-whether-to-restart-a-video-game-is-my-latest-d-1835134928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/deciding-whether-to-restart-a-video-game-is-my-latest-d-1835134928"><em>Pathologic 2</em></a></span> only show themselves once you die. The horror RPG is all about managing your resources to stay alive. You need to eat, drink, rest, and heal constantly, on top of managing your reputation across the game’s many towns. But once you do die, a weird meta encounter informs you that the world has gotten worse and so have you. What was already a strange and dangerous world becomes exponentially so through debuffs like less health or more unconventional things such as losing the ability to hug characters. The more you die, the more things change, and there is always a little bit of a pull on your curiosity to find out how bad things can really get.</p></div><div><p>Square Enix’s cult classic answer to <em>Resident Evil </em>will always deserve more attention than it gets. As you’d expect from the makers of <em>Final Fantasy</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/parasite-eve-had-more-in-common-with-final-fantasy-than-1788134625&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/parasite-eve-had-more-in-common-with-final-fantasy-than-1788134625"><em>Parasite Eve</em></a></span> added RPG elements to the survival horror genre to great success. You play as Aya Brea, a rookie NYPD cop who, over the course of a lonely week in late December, works to save the city from a mitochondrial outbreak that threatens to destroy the world. It’s pulpy, it’s scary, it’s fun, and it’s worth playing if only for seeing the jaw-dropping opening cinematic.</p></div><div><p>For my money, no game has done gothic horror better than <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-the-kotaku-review-1695227854&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-the-kotaku-review-1695227854"><em>Bloodborne</em></a></span>. The city of Yharnam, with its constant sense of dread that bears down on you as you explore its cobblestone streets and gothic structures, has one of the most imposing atmospheres in any game ever. Sure, there’s still the tough-as-nails combat and constant retreading of territory we know from the <em>Souls </em>games—this is still FromSoftware—but rather than dark fantasy, <em>Bloodborne </em>evokes true horror. That happens both in the grotesque monster designs you encounter during its difficult fights but also in its story of cosmic dread and humanity’s overambition.</p></div><div><p>Cosmic horror will—for better and worse—always be synonymous with H.P. Lovecraft. One of the author’s most famous creations, Cthulhu, has even spawned a fantastic tabletop RPG, on which the video game <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> is based. That video game is a great translation of Lovecraftian cosmic horror thanks to its emphasis on sanity. As you progress, you’ll slowly lose your mind, but before you do that you’ll be out to work as a detective. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-the-kotaku-review-1695227854&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-the-kotaku-review-1695227854"><em>Call of Cthulhu</em></a></span> lets you choose your background, which then opens up different dialogue options during investigations. This makes each playthrough feel unique, and cultivates the sense that perhaps you aren’t getting the full picture.</p></div><div><p>The secret to horror roguelike <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/darkest-dungeon-the-kotaku-review-1755308882&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/darkest-dungeon-the-kotaku-review-1755308882"><em>Darkest Dungeon</em></a></span>’s success is stressing you the fuck out. Each member of your party, with whom you attempt to navigate the titular dungeons, has a stress level. If they get too stressed they will literally have a heart attack. This will stress you out and that’s great! The system makes you keenly aware of the risk vs reward of every action. If your party members explore without light, don’t eat proper food, or witness deaths, they’ll become increasinglystressed. But what if you can just make it through? It might be worth it! That’s the eternal conundrum of every run of <em>Darkest Dungeon</em>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> brings the iconic FPS franchise back to the forefront, offering players a brand new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-mission-list-every-campaign-mission/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Campaign</a>, Multiplayer, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-terminus-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zombies</a> mode to enjoy.</p>



<p>Treyarch has focused on bringing Call of Duty back to its roots, which has enticed both veteran and new players. With a traditional <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-progression-and-prestige-system-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prestige system</a>, a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-weapons-every-gun-and-how-to-unlock/">arsenal of weapons</a> to unlock, and a variety of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maps and modes</a> to enjoy, players have been flocking to Multiplayer. Those who love the round-based format of Zombies have been satisfied too, while story enjoyers are getting their fix through the Campaign.</p>



<p>That said, how many are actually paying Black Ops 6 and what does the player count look like? Here’s everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-players-are-in-black-ops-6">How many players are in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, there are <strong>no official stats for the Black Ops 6 player count</strong>, but according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1938090/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, there are <strong>143,030 current Steam OC players on Call of Duty </strong>as of October 28, 2024. </p>



<p>The 24 hour peak sits at <strong>306,460</strong> players, but keep in mind this is only the player count for Steam on PC, so if you take console into account too, the figure is likely much higher than this. Call of Duty is extremely popular on Xbox and PlayStation, and so those platforms likely make up a large portion of the player count which isn’t available to the public.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to SteamDB.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Call of Duty HQ app also includes players on COD games such as MW3, MW2, and Warzone. It even takes those playing the Campaign and Zombies into account, so it’s not an accurate number for those playing the Multiplayer.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 is also the first Call of Duty title to release on the Game Pass for both PC and Xbox consoles. Because of this, there a likely a lot of PC players enjoying BO6 via the Game Pass, and the SteamDB numbers don’t track that platform. Thanks to the Game Pass release, successful beta period, and hype prior to release, we expect Black Ops 6’s number to be very healthy, pointing to a successful launch.</p>



<p>There also haven’t been many <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/are-black-ops-6-servers-down-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">server issues</a> or major bugs, so players have been able to grind. Once we know official numbers we’l be sure to update this piece with all the information. However, Call of Duty haven’t released official player count stats for some time now, so it’s unclear whether we will get any insight.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p data-cy="paragraph">As I excitedly slashed, blasted, wooed, looted, and delved my way through the stunning and enthralling world of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, I kept having one thought: "Wait, <em>BioWare</em> made this? 2024 BioWare?” With this game coming in the wake of the debacle that was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/21/anthem-review">Anthem</a>, itself preceded by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/dragon-age-inquisition-review">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-review">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a>, which were both merely alright in hindsight, I wasn't sure these former masters of the roleplaying game craft could make a game like this anymore. But putting together my team of interesting and endearing companions to save the world felt like getting the old band back together, in more ways than one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The scope of this adventure is the whole North of Thedas, sending you from the coasts of Rivain to the blighted wilds of the Anderfels as you attempt to prevent the rise of an ancient and menacing evil. It was thrilling as a long-time fan of the series to finally see so many of the places I'd only read about in a journal entry way back in 2009. And the way BioWare has us go about that exploration is very focused and deliberate.</p><div id="how-do-you-rank-dragon-ages-companion-characters" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">How Do You Rank Dragon Age's Companion Characters?</h3><h3>How Do You Rank Dragon Age's Companion Characters?</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Veilguard’s level design was one of the first things that jumped out at me, reminding me of the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/07/15/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-review-2">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</a> more than anything. The slick, looping corridors with just enough little nooks to discover are cleverly interconnected in a way that proves how a BioWare-style RPG gains a lot and loses almost nothing by ditching the idea of a fully open world. (The exceptions to that are a couple of the more vertical sections of the city of Minrathous, which can be a pain in the ass to navigate.) Across the board, the environment art is really jaw-dropping, from the desolate peaks of Kal-Sharok to the surreal, floating elven ruins in Arlathan Forest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was very pleased with the character designs, too. The armor and outfits are fabulous. I spent more than an hour in the character creator, like I usually do, and came out with a version of our protagonist, Rook, who delighted me every time she was in frame. This might be some of the best-looking hair I've ever seen in a video game.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Veilguard's combat is a refinement of what we saw in Dragon Age 2 and Inquisition.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with all of that visual splendor I was able to get a stable 60 fps at 4k on my RTX 4070 Super with DLSS set to maximum performance, which usually didn't affect the visual quality in very noticeable ways. The one exception to this was in the late game, when there could be so many spell effects going off at once that I’d not only lose frames, it's also difficult to even see what's actually going on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Through the crackle and sparks, though, Veilguard's combat is definitely a refinement of what we saw in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/03/08/dragon-age-ii-review">Dragon Age 2</a> and Inquisition. I’ve always preferred the more tactical style of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/11/04/dragon-age-origins-review">Dragon Age: Origins</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, but that ship sailed so long ago for this studio, not even the Evanuris remember what it looked like. And so, judging this very action-focused combat system for what it is, it's pretty good! BioWare has committed fully to the fast-paced style and refined it to a point that I enjoy it quite a bit. And the ability to pause to issue party members orders, just like in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-legendary-edition-review-part-1-mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, still gives some opportunity for more tactical players like myself to look around the battlefield and consider our next move. It definitely feels better on a controller than mouse and keyboard, though. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was somewhat disappointed that party members are more like extensions of your own character in combat at this point rather than their own entities. They don't even have health bars, for instance. They can't be knocked out in combat, whereas you instantly lose an encounter if Rook goes down. They do have equipment slots and skill trees, though less than what Rook gets. But overall, the amount of customization available for the whole squad through piles and piles of interesting, upgradeable loot was more than enough to satisfy my RPG appetites, if not fulfill my wildest fantasies of intricate battle management.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In my 100-hour near-100 percent, almost obsessively completionist playthrough, I styled Rook as a Spellblade – a mid-ranged melee hybrid mage – and really enjoyed the play style once I'd unlocked all of my core tools. Dancing with a dagger through a lightning storm I summoned, darting out of danger and then back in for a lethal blow, is just a really good time that rewards precise timing and wise target prioritization. This isn't the tactical Dragon Age of my youth, but it is a Dragon Age I can vibe with. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And the highlights of combat are definitely the boss fights, which offer a really satisfying challenge even on the default difficulty. While standard mob fights with Darkspawn or Venatori cultists eventually got a little repetitive after 90-plus hours, going up against a High Dragon never failed to get my blood pumping as I had to carefully study attack patterns and think on my feet.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Your whole squad is made up of complex, memorable, and likable companions.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In the sense that a BioWare RPG is really about your companions, also known as the friends we made along the way, this might be the most BioWare game of all time. Not only is the whole squad made up of complex, memorable, likable, distinct personalities from across Thedas, but they're all treated as the stars of their own story. Veilguard is light on that classic kind of side quest that’s like, "Help Bingo Bongo find some nug grease," and I don’t miss those much because they’ve been replaced by full-length heroic arcs for each companion, with twists, turns, a personal nemesis, major character developments, and a moment of triumph fit for a protagonist rather than a sidekick. It's like the writers took the loyalty missions from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-legendary-edition-review-mass-effect-2-review">Mass Effect 2</a> and blew them up into seven miniature games of their own. Almost every side mission ties into one of these, which obliterates the sense that you’re doing busywork.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Picking a favorite of the seven Veilguard members to talk about genuinely feels like an impossible task. I really want to say all of them are my favorite. But I had a rewarding romance with the stoic Grey Warden, Davrin, and became the mother to his fledgeling griffon pal, Assan, so he’s got to be my pick for this playthrough. Seriously, if anything ever happens to that little guy, I will wash Thedas away in a tide of fire. The Vincent Price-inspired gentleman necromancer Emmerich is also a delightful twist on the usual edgy goth death mage tropes. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And while we've been asked by the devs not to spoil specifically who I'm talking about here, as a non-binary person myself, Veilguard includes some of the most authentic representation of coming to terms with gender stuff – and having to navigate your family's reaction to it – I've seen yet in a game. It doesn't feel like an after school special or like I'm being pandered to. It's quite well-handled, and finding out that the writer for this character is non-binary themselves did not surprise me at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The larger plot that’s threatening the world in the background as we’re doing all of these more personal quests is nothing particularly outstanding in its overall structure. We need to unite some factions to fight some evil gods who are trying to do bad things with tentacles. The major wrinkle that makes that interesting, however, is Solas – also known as the Dread Wolf, elven god of lies and rebellion – waiting in the wings, keeping me guessing about whether he was a friend or foe.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This story feels like both a send-off and a soft reboot, in a way.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As a continuation of the Dragon Age series, Veilguard does feel a little disconnected from where we left off a decade ago. If you were expecting decisions from previous games in the series to carry over, I’m sorry to say they've never mattered less. You only get to import three choices, one of which only comes up in the context of a single letter you may or may not find and read. You do get to recreate your Inquisitor from Dragon Age: Inquisition, the same way Inquisition let you recreate your Hawke if you played Dragon Age 2. And the Inquisitor ends up being a fairly important character, which was cool.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But things like who you chose to make head of the Chantry at the end of Inquisition never come up. There's no sign of the Warden from Origins, even though you visit the stronghold of their order. Hawke gets only a passing mention. There are some other cameos from both Origins and Dragon Age 2, but those characters conspicuously don't reference any important choices you may have made in their presence. This story feels like both a send-off and a soft reboot, in a way, which was paradoxically a bit refreshing and disappointing at the same time.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Len's Top 10 CRPGs</h3><p>The best CRPGs to play in 2024</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The pacing early on is kind of weird, too, and I felt like I could practically smell the rewrites. For example, it’s hilarious that no one ever says the word "Veilguard" out loud across the 100 hours I played of this dialogue-packed campaign, exposing a last-minute marketing pivot for what it was. But it doesn’t take too long for things to get on a good track, story-wise, and when they do, they stay on it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The sacrifices I had to make in the closing hours hurt. The wise decisions I made paid off. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from one huge choice you'll make early on, the most interesting bits of narrative design don't come until the very end of Veilguard’s story. And again, it's hard to dig into this too much without spoiling something, but the finale is also very much in the spirit of Mass Effect 2, which has an ending that, up until now, may have been the best series of complex consequential choices ever featured in an RPG. The sacrifices I had to make in the closing hours hurt. The wise decisions I made paid off. And I even got the chance to dramatically flick an ace out of my sleeve at the last moment, specifically because I took a very thorough and careful approach to everything leading up to it. That felt like the ultimate reward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout all of that, the cinematic flair is off the charts, proving that BioWare is unmatched in the RPG world in that discipline. So much of the best stuff I can't even tell you about, but parts of it felt like watching a big-budget fantasy movie in the best ways. A triumphant and effective – if not quite iconic – score elevates these moments further.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-to-let-animal-crossing-pocket-camp-players-keep-playing-after-servers-shut-off-for-a-price<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A more expensive camp site.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-is-shutting-down-its-animal-crossing-mobile-game-but-its-working-on-a-paid-offline-version-to-replace-it">Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp is shutting down</a>, as Nintendo announced back in August. But this weekend, it revealed the paid offline version that will be replacing it. It's called Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete, it's basically the same as Pocket Camp without the microtransactions, and it will set players back either $10 or $20 depending on when they purchase.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBwJdX8fnfQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a video</a>, Nintendo outlined how Animal Crossing Pocket Camp Complete data transfer and features will work compared to the original Pocket Camp. Transferring data from one game to another is fairly easy, and just requires linking your Nintendo Account with Pocket Camp and then linking that same account with Pocket Camp Complete.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Pocket_camp (@Pocket_Camp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pocket_Camp/status/1850704831616635292?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 28, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Doing this will move almost all important player data from one game to the other, including level, Bells, friendship levels, inventory and warehouse items, layouts of the campsite, cabin, and camper, and current and saved outfits. Keep in mind that this will only work until Pocket Camp shuts down on November 29 - after that, you can't link accounts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The good news is that Pocket Camp Complete largely is just Pocket Camp without the microtransactions. It's missing features tied to payment, like Leaf Tickets and the Pocket Camp Club, but those are being replaced with baked-in versions of the same thing. Pocket Camp Club's features are largely just a part of the game now, and Leaf Tickets are being replaced with Leaf Tokens obtained from completing goals or exchanging Bells that can be used to buy furniture or shorten craft time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Since Pocket Camp Complete is not an online game, the online friend features will also be disappearing, but they're being replaced with a QR code sharing system that will allow you to invite friends to a new area called Whistle Pass, where you can receive gifts from them and enjoy a daily K.K. Slider concert together. You'll also be able to transfer all your old friends from Pocket Camp with the rest of your data, provided those friends also log into the game before it shuts down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, regular seasonal events will continue to happen as before, with some new ones added for Pocket Camp Complete. This means the game will have new items in it all the way until September of 2025, and there will be paths to collect missed seasonal items and complete collections without waiting for that specific event to roll around again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That all sounds pretty great: it's basically Pocket Camp without the online features and the microtransactions, taking some of the sting out of the game's shuttering. The one downside is the up-front cost. Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete costs $9.99 as a one-and-done charge to own the game, which isn't too bad on its own. But if you wait until January 31, 2025 or later to join the game, that price doubles to $19.99. So if you're thinking of starting Pocket Camp for the first time or transferring your data, better do it soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete launches for iOS and Android on December 3, 2024, just a few days after Pocket Camp shuts down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
