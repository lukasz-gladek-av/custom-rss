              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em> is a very big and mostly great game</a> that you’ll likely spend over 50 hours in if you try to do everything it has to offer. It also might be your first <em>Borderlands</em> in a long time, or possibly ever. This all might seem really intimidating. 10 billion guns! A giant open world! What should you do? Well, I’ve got your back. Here are 12 tips to help you get started and kick ass in <em>Borderlands 4.</em> And be not afraid, there are no spoilers below.</p> <h2>Don’t Get Distracted By Side Quests Until You Get Your Hover Bike</h2> <p>Look, I get it. Running around and doing every little side quest is fun, but I’d recommend focusing on the main story until you get your hoverbike. It won’t take more than two hours and it’s worth it. Well, unless you like walking everywhere in a big open-world game. And speaking of side quests and not doing them…</p> <h2>Maybe Don’t Do <em>Every</em> Side Quest Before Finishing The Main Story…</h2> <p>I’m a map cleaner in open-world games. I get it. I love to methodically clear out every piece of content in a big open world. But maybe don’t do that until you complete the main story. That’s because once you do that, regardless of your level, you unlock “Specializations,” which is a new set of passive bonuses and skills that act as an endgame grind. And you level this up with XP. So it might be better to mainline the story and then turn around and do all the side stuff later.</p>

 <h2>But…Focus On Getting SDU Credits To Make Your Backpack Bigger</h2> <p>While I advise not doing every side quest before the credits roll, I do suggest you look out for Propaganda Towers, Bunkers, and other open-world activities that reward you with SDU credits that can be used to upgrade how many items you can hold at once in your backpack. Trust me, you want to upgrade this ASAP. You are going to be grabbing so much random junk to sell and sort through, and running out of space sucks. So prioritize getting that backpack upgraded.</p> <h2>Use The Loot As Junk Button</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-11-best-changes-borderlands-4-junk-loot-menus-legendary-guns-2000624953">New to <em>Borderlands 4</em> is the ability to loot items as junk.</a> This means that you can instantly sell it and every single item you’ve marked as junk with the press of a button just by walking up to a vending machine. It saves a lot of time and is one of the best features in <em>Borderlands 4</em>. Use it. You’ll thank me later.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000624984" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624984"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624984">©Gearbox / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Keep An Eye Open For Elemental Weapons To Help You Kill Quickly</h2> <p>It’s very easy to focus exclusively on getting guns with bigger numbers. But hold up! It’s not all about DPS. You might want to keep that SMG or shotgun because of its elemental damage type. You see, enemies in<em> Borderlands 4</em> all have different weaknesses to different elements. Enemies with red health bars burn fast, baddies with blue health bars are weak to shock, and aliens or robots with yellow health bars get melted quickly with acid.</p> <p>So before you drop that slightly weaker SMG for a cool new one, stop and think. Does the weaker one do acid damage? Is it your only weapon that does acid damage? You might want to keep it, then, so you can fight robots with ease.</p>

 <h2>Don’t Have Four Of The Same Type Of Gun Equipped</h2> <p>I love a good assault rifle in<em> Borderlands 4.</em> I’m always on the lookout for a new Daedalus AR to add to my collection. But I never run around with more than one AR equipped. Why? Because if all your guns are the same type–like all shotguns or whatever–then you’ll burn through that ammo type much faster. Variety is the spice of life, and it also means you don’t use up all your shotgun shells in a matter of minutes.</p> <h2>Look Down Your Character’s Skill Tree Before Unlocking Anything</h2> <p>Simple one, but important: Before you start upgrading your character’s skills, take a moment to look at what you’ll be able to unlock later on. You might see a skill you just desperately want, or you might realize the particular skill tree you are examining features bonuses and abilities you’ll just never use. And sure, the game lets you respec everything, but why waste time earning skills you don’t like when you can take a moment to plan ahead and have a much better time.</p>

 <h2>When Playing Co-op, Use Your Buddies As Fast Travel Stations</h2> <p>Playing with your friends is always better, but in <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-dlss-frame-gen-pitchford-gearbox-steam-2000625765">Borderlands 4</a>,</em> that’s especially true as you can fast-travel to them whenever you want. Tricky platforming section that you don’t want to do? Fast travel to your bud! Get lost and can’t find your way to the next part of the quest? Fast travel to your friend. Want to sell a bunch of stuff in the middle of a big fight? Fast travel to an area with vending machines, sell your junk, and then fast travel back to your friends. This feature is so useful and powerful that it almost feels like cheating.</p> <h2>Use The Newly Added Repkits!</h2> <p>It’s easy to forget about <em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s newly added Rep Kits, which are small items that can heal you during fights. They are brand new to the franchise and the game never warns you to use one when your health gets low. But use your Rep Kits! They can make a challenging ambush much easier.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000624986" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624986"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624986">©Gearbox / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>If Lost, Just Use Echo 4, aka Hit Up On The D-Pad</h2> <p>Remember, you can always ask Echo 4, your new robot companion, to guide you to your next quest objective or your custom marker. This can be really handy when deep in a cave or building filled with multiple rooms and hallways. Just hit up on the D-pad, and Echo 4 will generate an easy-to-follow holographic line in the world pointing to your target location.</p> <h2>Grab Contracts Before Heading Out</h2> <p>Whenever you return to one of the many hub and town areas in <em>Borderlands 4</em>, take a moment to check the bounty board and grab some bounties. Many of these are very easy to complete and just want you to kill a few random enemies. You were going to do that anyway, so why not get some extra XP and rewards for doing so?</p>

 <h2>Hold Onto Gold Keys Until You Level Up</h2> <p>The moment you walk up to your first gold chest in <em>Borderlands 4</em>, you’ll be tempted to use any gold keys you currently have. Don’t do this. I know, it’s fun to open a big shiny box and get new guns, most of which will be pretty good. But if you’re below level 40, I’d avoid using your keys as the loot you get from them at that point will be made worthless in the not-too-distant future. That level 7 legendary sniper ain’t going to be worth using when, a few hours later, you’re level 12 and find a much better one. Save your gold keys for when you’re in the endgame portion of <em>Borderlands 4</em>.</p> <p>And if you need help getting more (or any…) gold keys, don’t you worry,<a href="https://kotaku.com/how-shift-codes-gold-keys-work-borderlands-4-help-get-more-2000626107"> I’ve got a guide just for you</a> that walks you through the process and even includes some codes you can use to get some fancy rewards.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-is-going-nuts-this-15-gaming-portable-monitor-for-xbox-and-switch-is-selling-for-pennies-2000627251</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-is-going-nuts-this-15%E2%80%B3-gaming-portable-monitor-for-xbox-and-switch-is-selling-for-pennies.1303065/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Screens can quickly become a source of frustration. Attempting to work on a small laptop screen is claustrophobic, gaming on the Nintendo Switch isn’t the most immersive gaming experience, and even gaming consoles such as PlayStation or Xbox sometimes leave you wishing for a more delineated or flexible screen setup.</p>
<p>That’s where a portable monitor changes the story. The <em>Forhelp</em> 15.6‑inch portable monitor provides a crisp 1080p display and a thin profile that you can take wherever you go, putting an end to all those screen frustrations at once. Even better, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4202/">Amazon has cut it down to just $59 (from $79), which happens to be its all-time low</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4202/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Portable Screen That Travels With You</h2>
<p>What we love about this monitor is how much it manages to pack into such a compact body: <strong>Measuring only 0.3 inches thin and weighing slightly over 1.5 pounds</strong>, it slides perfectly into a backpack alongside your laptop or console. The aluminum alloy body adds strength and premium feel and the included magnetic smart case also doubles as a durable stand. You can stand it on a desk, an airplane tray table or a hotel nightstand with ease, and you still have some choice of viewing angles thanks to the grooves molded into the cover.</p>



<p>The screen is a Full HD 1920×1080 IPS display with a matte finish, so you have rich and true color, a wide 178‑degree viewing angle and less reflection. It even minimizes blue light emissions and eliminates flicker to make long sessions that much more comfortable on the eyes. Image quality is sufficient for this price to immerse you in movies and games and let you forget that compromised feeling when you’re not on your main display.</p>
<p>The monitor features two fully functional USB‑C ports and a mini HDMI port so you can connect it directly to a laptop, Xbox, PlayStation, or Switch with a single cable. Thunderbolt 3/4 and USB‑C DisplayPort Alt Mode‑enabled devices will also power the monitor without the need for adapters so you’re ready to go in no time when working on the go. It’s designed for work and play and includes a number of modes to match how you’re utilizing it. You can mirror your laptop screen during a meeting, extend your desktop for real productivity gains, or use second screen mode on the move.</p>
<p>Two built‑in speakers add audio on the fly without needing external accessories. They won’t rival a dedicated speaker setup but they handle gaming sessions or movies smoothly enough to make this monitor truly self‑contained.</p>



<p>What makes this deal hard to ignore is how much you’re getting at this price. Most travel monitors with a decent IPS panel, multiple connections, and a sleek aluminum case are more expensive, typically $100 or more. Here, for $59, you have a travel‑friendly second screen that can do double duty for productivity work and gaming rigs. Make sure you don’t miss this opportunity.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Microsoft has <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates">announced plans</a> to increase the prices of its Xbox consoles in the United States for the second time this year, starting on October 5. The company cites “changes in the macroeconomic environment” as the reason for the price adjustments.&nbsp;</p><p>In a time when consoles are becoming more expensive over time rather than cheaper, the five available models of Xbox Series X/S will have their prices raised yet again. Microsoft already increased these prices <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/01/xbox-console-and-accessory-price-increases-begin-today-80-first-party-games-starting">only a few months ago</a>, on May 1.</p><p>Here are the new prices for each Xbox console. For comparison, we've also included the current price (as of May 1) and the original launch price of each piece of hardware.</p><p><u>Xbox Series S 512 GB&nbsp;</u><br><strong>New Price: $399.99</strong><br>Current Price: $379.99&nbsp;<br>Launch Price: $299.99</p><p><u>Xbox Series S 1TB&nbsp;</u><br><strong>New Price: $449.99</strong><br>Current Price: $429.99<br>Launch Price: 349.99</p><p><u>Xbox Series X Digital&nbsp;</u><br><strong>New Price: $599.99</strong><br>Current Price: $549.99<br>Launch Prince: $449.99</p><p><u>Xbox Series X</u><br><strong>New Price: $649.99</strong><br>Current Price: $599.99<br>Launch Price: $499.99</p><p><u>Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition</u><br><strong>New Price: $799.99</strong><br>Current Price: $729.99<br>Launch Price: $599.99</p><p>"We understand that these changes are challenging, and they were made with careful consideration," reads Microsoft's statement. "Looking ahead, we continue to focus on offering more ways to play more games across any screen and providing value for Xbox players."</p><p>This second price hike comes in a year full of them. Sony <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/14/sony-raises-playstation-5-price-in-europe-australia-new-zealand-and-more">raised the prices</a> of the PlayStation 5 in the UK, Europe, and other territories in April, similarly citing the current economic conditions caused by the US tariffs. Sony then raised the price of the PS5 in the US <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/playstation-5-price-changes-in-the-u-s/">last month</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Nintendo, perhaps most famously, delayed pre-orders for the Switch 2 in the US due to the economic conditions before <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/18/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-begin-april-24-in-us-with-updated-pricing-for-certain">raising prices on the console's accessories</a> before launch.&nbsp;Last month, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-switch-pricing-update/?srsltid=AfmBOorllYqkrE8JsNVKW_xi1_3j_JLXXMlNa_BTAxerqdNWRmSI54cq">increased the prices of the original Switch models</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The updated Xbox prices come right before the busy holiday season, which will be more challenging than ever for those looking to purchase game consoles as gifts or for themselves. It's an unfortunate circumstance that, as things currently stand, doesn't appear will be going away in the foreseeable future.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/19/xbox-console-prices-will-increase-again-next-month]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[I Know What’s Going On And So Does Everyone Else]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-fallon-colbert-stewart-trump-kirk-2000627249</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-know-what%E2%80%99s-going-on-and-so-does-everyone-else.1303035/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last night on <em>The Tonight Show</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-latest-chapter-in-jimmy-fallons-ongoing-love-affair-1789194585"><em>Mario Kart</em> superfan</a> Jimmy Fallon did what Jimmy Fallon does best: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Gma4TPZCXg">chuckle at his own jokes, make funny faces, and shrug his shoulders</a>. While he didn’t shy away from dunking on Donald Trump’s trip to the UK, he did pull his punches when talking about late night TV’s other Jimmy getting bullied off the air by a rogue president, his FCC goon squad, and a complicit c-suite. “To be honest with you all, I don’t know what’s going on, and no one does,” Fallon told viewers. That last part, at least, is an obvious lie. Why Jimmy Kimmel was kicked off the air by ABC is not complicated or confusing. Part of what’s so galling about it is just how stupid, craven, and obvious what happened is, and how none of that stopped it from happening.</p> <p>Jimmy Kimmel was kicked off the air for making fun of Trump. Not because he joked about Charlie Kirk’s assassination, which he didn’t do, or because he lied about it, which he didn’t do either. Comments about the “MAGA gang” trying to score political points off Kirk’s murder were just the setup to a punchline about how Trump <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-jimmy-kimmel-said-late-night-show-charlie-kirk-2025-9">can’t even muster a crocodile tear</a> over the right-wing podcaster’s death before gushing about his White House renovations. You can watch the tape. You can read the transcript. There is no ambiguity in what transpired, even as pundits paid to make hay of the controversy try to hedge by condemning something Kimmel didn’t say while advocating for a First Amendment that wasn’t directly violated.</p> <p>That’s because ABC, and it’s corporate owner Disney, rushed to comply before it even got to that point. One of the biggest TV operators in the country, Nexstar Media Group, is trying to buy another operator called Tegna in a deal valued at over $6 billion and that would require the approval of Trump’s Justice Department. Along with conservative network affiliate owner Sinclair, Nexstar announced it would stop carrying <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live! </em>(Nexstar <a href="https://t.co/ghiH7Zo0GP">denies</a> this was the reason.) FCC Chairman Brendan Carr threatened to investigate ABC and pull its broadcast licenses over Kimmel’s monologue. And then Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman Dana Walden and CEO Bob Iger <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/jimmy-kimmel-decision-disney-dana-walden-bob-iger-1236547651/">decided to preemptively pull the plug</a>, provoking a <a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney-boycott-marvel-marisa-tomei-2000627135">celebrity-led boycott in the process</a>.</p>

 <p>Trump has been desperately trying to get Kimmel fired for months. Shortly after Paramount sacrificed Stephen Colbert to get its merger approved with Skydance, the president made this as clear as possible. “Jimmy Kimmel is NEXT to go in the untalented Late Night Sweepstakes and, shortly thereafter, Fallon will be gone,” he posted in July. Anyone who keeps acting surprised by what’s going on, like Fallon, just hasn’t been paying attention or, worse, thinks that they can save themselves by trying to pretend none of it is happening. Even ex-Disney CEO Michael Eisner is going, in so many words, “<a href="https://x.com/Michael_Eisner/status/1969088566098870363">Wait, what the fuck is happening</a>?”</p> <p>Maybe that’s why it felt strangely nostalgic and refreshing to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GXNJ3V9lzg">Jon Stewart</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdGLJly6P7c">Stephen Colbert</a> last night, each tackling Kimmel’s firing in their own ways but in no uncertain terms. Like a lot of people, I watched <em>The Daily Show</em> and <em>The Colbert Report</em> a lot in college. Then I stopped. At some point the formula began to feel not only cringe but aimless. The news was getting grimmer and the stakes less funny. But last night reminded me what worked about them all those years ago. It’s cathartic to watch people call out obvious bullshit, especially when so many others keep running away from it, anxiously looking to their colleagues and bosses to make sure they don’t step out of line, even when the line is drawn by a dangerous buffoon. That’s how the Bush years felt. Nothing’s changed and yet now somehow it’s even worse.</p> <p>“I do know Jimmy Kimmel, and he’s a decent, funny, and loving guy, and I hope he comes back,” Fallon said last night. It is, of course, not up to Kimmel if he comes back. Fallon knows that. He also knows he could be next. And that cynical calculus is what will make sure he’s not the last.</p>

<h2>Here we go again</h2>
<p>Higher than usual inflation can help explain some of the nominal price increases for the oldest Xbox consoles affected by today's price hikes. The $300 for an Xbox Series S at launch in November 2020 is worth roughly $375 in August 2025 dollars, for instance. And the $500 for an Xbox Series X in 2020 is now worth about $625.</p>
<p>But the particularly sharp price increases for more recent Xbox configurations can't really use that inflation excuse. The disc-drive-free Digital Xbox Series X Digital and 2TB "Galaxy Special Edition" are now a whopping 33 percent more expensive than they were at launch in October 2024. A year's worth of inflation would account for only a small fraction of that.</p>
<p>Even accounting for inflation, though, the current spate of nominal console price increases goes against <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/06/are-the-ps4-and-xbox-one-really-that-expensive-historically/">a near-universal, decades-long trend of game console prices dropping significantly</a> in the years following their launch. Those days <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/08/todays-game-consoles-are-historically-overpriced/">seem well and truly gone now</a>, as console makers' costs remain high thanks in part to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/thanks-to-new-tariffs-many-more-physical-game-discs-may-simply-not-get-made/">current tariff uncertainty</a> and in part to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/chips-arent-improving-like-they-used-to-and-its-killing-game-console-price-cuts/">the wider slowdown of Moore's Law</a>.</p>
<p>We'll see just how much the market can bear aging console hardware that increases in price over time rather than decreases. But until and unless consumers start balking, it looks like ever-increasing console prices are here to stay.</p>

              <p>Manufacturers of laptops have been working on making thinner and lighter laptops for years, and the byproduct of that is necessarily diminishing the amount of ports. You no longer need to deal with a string of ports for HDMI, SD cards, etc. That’s why carrying a USB‑C hub is now essentially a requirement, especially if you own a MacBook or a thin Windows laptop. This Acer <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4201/">7‑in‑1 USB‑C hub is the gap filler and now it costs a record low of $17 (down from $24) on Amazon</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4201/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Little Hub That Widens Your Laptop’s World</h2>
<p>What this hub basically does is give your laptop the versatility that’s been taken away from it by manufacturers: Plug it into one USB‑C port and <strong>you’ve got seven handy connections at your fingertips</strong>. There are <strong>two fast USB‑A 3.1 ports</strong> for keyboard and external drives and <strong>two</strong> <strong>further USB‑C data ports</strong> capable of transfer speeds of up to 5Gbps. There’s even a <strong>full-size HDMI output</strong> to feed 4K video at 30Hz or Full HD at 1080p which makes it easy to plug in to monitors, projectors, or even your TV.</p>



<p>Through its Power Delivery port, this<strong> Acer hub can pass through up to 100W of power</strong> which is enough to keep a MacBook Pro charged while you’re running everything else at once. That means no worrying about draining your laptop mid‑presentation or mid‑flight. If you’ve ever been stuck unplugging accessories just to keep your laptop alive, this hub solves that daily frustration.</p>
<p>For photographers, content creators, or anyone who still uses SD cards in cameras and drones,<strong> the MicroSD and SD ports are a lifesaver</strong>. You do not need to carry extra adapters to transfer files directly into your laptop. The hub itself is housed in a rugged aluminum casing which protects it from damage and keeps it cool when used extensively.</p>
<p>It works with MacBooks, Windows laptops, ChromeOS, Linux, and even gaming systems like the Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck. If your tablet supports Samsung’s DeX mode, it turns your portable device into a desktop‑style setup with a display and peripherals connected through this hub. In practice, that means one tiny accessory can unlock a huge boost in productivity whether you’re working from home, commuting, or even gaming on the go.</p>
<p>And for just $17, this Acer 7‑in‑1 hub is like one of those rare upgrades that are worth it the moment you connect it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In the span of about 20 seconds and with just a single Discord ping, Rockstar Games got 65,000+ people, nearly all of whom are waiting for<em> Grand Theft Auto 6</em>‘s launch, very excited and then crushed their hopes, dreams, and happiness.</p> <p>On September 19, at precisely 3:20 p.m. EST, Rockstar Games posted a single message in the <em>GTA Online</em> section of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-game-official-discord-server-launched-1851762536">company’s official Discord server</a>. The message was simply Rockstar Games acknowledging a bug involving a <em>GTA Online</em> weekly challenge that was supposed to unlock a piece of in-game clothing for those who completed it, but wasn’t working properly. Pretty basic <em>GTA Online</em> update. But for some reason, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/618327687701725194/1299025718440759357/1418678232735158292">Rockstar Games followed that message up with an “@here.”</a> They did this in a server with 68,097 members. Uh oh!</p> <figure id="attachment_2000627266" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627266"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627266">©Kotaku / Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure> <p>For those who don’t use Discord, dropping “@here” pings everyone in the server channel unless they specifically opt out of notifications. And most people don’t do that, especially not in Rockstar’s Discord server, where desperate fans cling to the hope that at any time, the studio could drop a new trailer for <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-gta-vi-new-trailer-gameplay-story-1851779368">GTA 6.</a>&nbsp;</em> Rockstar Games has also not really done this before. So that random “@here” instantly caused around 68,000 fans to freak the fuck out. Making matters worse is that for many, myself included, the notification simply appeared as “Rockstar Games – @here” with no further context.</p> <p>I’ll fully admit that when I first saw it, I assumed the company was making some big random announcement about<em> GTA 6</em>. Instead, what I found when I opened Discord was a lot of confused, sad, and angry fans who weren’t sure why Rockstar had done this to them all. “Why!” “Whattt?” “Shut up!” “WTF?!” “No GTA 6??” “Stop it!” and “HOLY SHIT WHY” were just some of the hundreds and hundreds of messages that whizzed by my eyes when I opened Discord shortly after the ping.</p> <p>I’ve reached out to Rockstar Games about the Discord ping and why it decided to do this. But whatever the reason, it won’t change the fact that for a brief and chaotic moment, 65,000+ people went wild thinking they were about to watch a new<em> GTA 6</em> trailer or get news of another delay. Nope. There’s no new trailer or other big announcement, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta6-grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026-1851778799"><em>GTA 6</em> is still set to launch in May of next year</a>.</p>

<p>Just breathtaking</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>It looks like Square Enix is still celebrating <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>'s 30th anniversary — and why shouldn't it? This is one of the most-beloved RPGs of all time.</p>
<p>And today, as a tasty little treat, the company's Japanese YouTube channel has shared a video showcasing close-ups of some of the game's character art and promotional artwork. (thanks to modder and video producer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ohpoorpup.bsky.social/post/3lz7edbj5mc2f">Christa Lee for highlighting</a>!)</p>
<p>The video appears to be a behind-the-scenes look at Square Enix's reproductions of the late, great Akira Toriyama's artwork. Individual characters, the campfire scene, and the battle scene that graces the game's North American box art are among the works shown off.</p>
<p>As for the reason? Well, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/novacrystallis.com/post/3lz5zz4bwxc2s">according to Nova Crystallis</a>, this is all for a social media campaign that Square Enix is holding. If you follow the company's <a href="https://x.com/squareenix_jp/status/1968885383627948195">Japanese account on X</a> (formerly Twitter) and respond with your favourite character along with the appropriate hashtag, you'll be in with a chance of winning a piece of art.</p>

<p>It looks like the competition itself is exclusive to Japan, but honestly, the video itself is also a great way of seeing these pieces of iconic art in 2160p, 4K resolution.</p>
<p>The colour and the linework is absolutely beautiful, and we're honestly jonesing to get a piece of that art for our offices...</p>

<p>Earlier today, Square Enix also announced the 'CHRONO TRIGGER Piano Soundscape Arrangement' album, which launches in Japan on 26th November 2025 for 3,300 yen (plus tax). With 12 newly-arranged songs, largely focusing on character themes, this is a must for fans of the iconic score, we think.</p>
<p>Let's hope even more Chrono Trigger celebrations are on the way.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-series-x-s-consoles-will-go-up-in-price-again-in-the-us-in-two-weeks.1302978/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this year, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">confirmed</a> that the price of the Xbox Series X/S consoles would be increasing globally, though the steepest increases would be hitting the US. Today, Microsoft <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates">announced</a> that, for the second time this year, the price of the Xbox Series X/S consoles will be increased again, with the new prices going into effect in two weeks time on October 3, 2025.</p>



<p>Microsoft didn't specify exactly why prices are going up, instead citing "<em>changes in the macroeconomic environment</em>." It added that understood "<em>that these changes are challenging,</em>" and reassures that they "<em>were made with careful consideration</em>." The price of accessories like controllers and headsets is staying the same for now, and the price of the console in countries outside of the US will also remain the same for now.</p>



<p>To recap, when the price of the consoles and accessories went up in may, the price of the Xbox Series S console went up $80, for both the 512GB and 1TB variants. The price of the Xbox Series X console went up $100, and the price of the 2TB special edition Xbox Series X went up $130. </p>



<p>Thankfully, today's increases aren't as steep, but it's still baffling to hear they're going up at all. While Microsoft doesn't mention the word 'tariffs,' the fact that the increases are isolated to the US points to the current US administration's tariffs as a likely reason behind the two price hikes within the last five months.</p>



<p>Starting October 3, 2025, these are the prices of the Xbox Series line of consoles: </p>



<ul>
<li>Xbox Series X - $649.99 ($50 increase)</li>



<li>Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Special Edition - $799.99 ($70 increase)</li>



<li>Xbox Series S 512GB - $399.99 ($20 increase)</li>



<li>Xbox Series S 1TB - $449.99 ($20 increase)</li>
</ul>



<p>To be fair, Microsoft isn't the only hardware maker to raise the prices on its consoles. Sony raised the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-ps5-pro-price-increases-us-tomorrow/">price of the PS5 by $50 in the US just last month</a>, and while Nintendo has so far only raised the price of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-us-hardware-pricing-stays-the-same-accessories-bump/">Switch 2 accessories</a>, the threat of a console price hike<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-us/"> still looms</a>.</p>



<p>One thing is for sure, though. These price increases won't help Microsoft move more units than they were before. Even if the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-x-sold-less-30-million-units-profitable/">console is reportedly profitable</a>, it's difficult to imagine that the added revenue from these price hikes will have a meaningful impact due to how few units are actually being sold week-to-week.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-140w-laptop-power-bank-is-a-dream-buy-now-that-amazon-has-it-back-at-black-friday-price-2000627209</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-140w-laptop-power-bank-is-a-dream-buy-now-that-amazon-has-it-back-at-black-friday-price.1302972/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are thousands of power banks on Amazon, but most of them fall between 5W and 60W. That is fine if all you do is charge a phone but when it comes to laptops and bigger devices, they are not much use. The <strong>Anker 737 power bank is in a league of its own</strong> and it is able to charge nearly everything you own – the new iPhone or a MacBook. And right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4200/">Amazon has cut it down to $87 (from $109), an all-time low price under the $100 threshold</a>, which is why that it is currently the best-selling product in its category.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4200/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Power Bank That Charges Everything</h2>
<p>At the core of the Anker 737 lies its huge capacity and speed: Carrying a <strong>gargantuan 24,000mAh battery</strong>, it has the juice to charge an iPhone 17 Pro from zero all the way up more than four times. Need to charge an iPad Pro or a MacBook? It can do that too, more than once over so you will not be scrambling to find an outlet on road trips. The difference from an average power bank is noticeable day one, because with them you usually need to ration juice.</p>



<p>And there’s the speed: The 737 model <strong>supports 140W fast charging via Power Delivery 3.1</strong>, something that’s usually reserved for laptop-only charger like devices. This lets you go from nearly dead, empty MacBook to usable in a hurry even when you’ve got other devices along for the ride. To get that kind of speed, you’ll need a 5A USB-C cable and a hefty 140W wall adapter to get the job done. But once you’ve got that, the experience is silky.</p>
<p>Another clever thing is the clever display on the device: Instead of guessing how much battery you have remaining or when you’ll be ready to go again, the digital readout on the screen shows real-time figures like power in and out and an estimate of time remaining to charge. For those who are lugging a number of devices, that sort of openness spares heartache and allows you to plan more effectively.</p>
<p>Yes, portability matters, and despite all its muscle, the Anker 737 still fits into a bag. It’s about 6 inches long and 22 ounces, so it’s easily portable on a vacation and, most importantly, does fit under TSA guidelines for carry-on luggage. That means you can bring it on a plane without any problem, which isn’t the case with most large power banks.</p>



<p><strong>Three charging ports (two USB-C and one USB-A)</strong> mean that you can charge a few devices at once so you charge a laptop, phone, and earbuds at the same time instead of switching between them. That sort of freedom when you’re fully powered is what sets the Anker 737 power bank apart from the sea of tiny batteries that only get to keep one or two devices charged gradually. Add on top of that Anker’s excellent two-year warranty and many-year record of customer service, and there’s reassurance in the box.</p>
<p>Power banks are everywhere, but power banks like this one are not. If your definition of peace of mind is never running out of juice on your most important devices, now is the time to buy one.</p>

			<p>Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-launches-next-year-in-early-access-on-pc-and-xbox-will-also-be-on-game-pass/">October 2024</a>, Krafton and Unknown Worlds announced that Subnautica 2 would be launching in Early Access sometime in 2025. But as we passed the halfway mark of the year, a flurry of unexpected events happened.</p>



<p>It's been some time since we've heard an update regarding this suit, and in between the last update and today, <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a> happened, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-5-million-audience-overlaps-soulslike/">Silksong was released</a>, and SEGA brought back its <a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-calls-out-mario-kart-in-new-trailer-ahead-of-launch/">80s/90s-era tongue-in-cheek ad campaign</a> against Nintendo around its latest <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sonic-racing-crossworlds/">Sonic Racing game</a>, to name a few things. So you'd be forgiven if you need a refresher. There's a recap at the bottom of this article if you need it, but for now, let's jump into what's current.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/founders-of-subnautica-2-studio-unknown-worlds-accuse-parent-company-krafton-of-changing-story-mid-litigation">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, two of Krafton's requests have been denied by the court: a forensic inspection request and a compelling preservation order, with both being deemed "<em>unnecessary</em>." But more importantly, the denial comes largely due to Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire claiming that Krafton has suddenly changed one of its key arguments.</p>



<p>When Krafton fired the three co-founders, one of the reasons cited in the termination notices was the claim that Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire were trying to release Subnautica 2 before it was ready. That makes sense, since Krafton has claimed time and again that the game simply wasn't ready for its early access launch.</p>



<p>Now, Krafton has changed its argument and has "<em>pivoted to a new theory that it admittedly came up with only after the fact: that it terminated the Founders and seized control because the Founders backed up files they were entitled to access in their work for Unknown Worlds</em>," says Fortis Advisors, the group representing the co-founders.</p>



<p>"<em>Krafton's disorganized retreat raises more questions than answers. To say Krafton's new theory is a Hail Mary would be an understatement - both because the downloads were not wrongful and because Krafton claims not to have learned of them until after it had fired the Founders. The downloads cannot have been the actual motivation for termination</em>."</p>



<p>So, suddenly, it seems that according to Krafton, in this lawsuit, which was filed against them around Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire, alleging, among other things, that they were wrongfully terminated, and where Krafton initially claimed they were terminated because they tried to launch Subnautica 2 before it was ready, the subject of Subnautica 2 being ready or not for launch is not relevant. </p>



<p>Adding to that, the question of Subnautica 2's readiness for launch wasn't why Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire were fired. They were fired because of something Krafton learned about after they had already fired them.</p>



<p>Per a report from <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/the-subnautica-2-lawsuit-is-getting-even-messier-with-krafton-doing-a-massive-u-turn-confusing-both-the-ousted-founders-lawyer-and-the-judge-this-is-a-little-bit-bewildering/">PC Gamer</a>, Krafton is now trying to focus on its claim that the co-founders abandoned their roles, and even the judge presiding over this case is confused by Krafton removing its argument that the co-founders tried to release the game early. "<em>Well, that's something that we definitely need to get to the bottom of today, because that is precisely what was cited as the reason in the answer</em>," said Judge Lori W. Will during a meeting between both sides to deliver a ruling on the motions presented.</p>



<p>PC Gamer also reports that Krafton hasn't been entirely cooperative as this suit kicks up, previously refusing to confer with Fortis Advisors, and only offering what Judge Lori W. Will described as a "<em>very narrow</em>" selection of emails for evidence, only offering ones where the words 'termination' and 'earnout' appeared.</p>



<p>The case is moving forward with both parties agreeing to confer, and we're back to waiting for the next major update.</p>



<p>To say that this has been a messy situation is yet another understatement to tack on to Krafton's alleged 'Hail Mary.' As I've mentioned before, it's unlikely we'll learn the whole truth of the situation, as allegations on both sides seem dire even if there's a bit of truth to them.</p>



<p>We'll continue to provide updates when new information is available. If you need a recap of what's happened before this, you can view it below.</p>



<ul>
<li>On July 2, it was reported that the founders of Unknown Worlds, Ted Gill, Max McGuire, and Charlie Cleveland, <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-changes-leadership-krafton/">were fired</a> and replaced by former Striking Distance Studios head Steve Papoutsis. No concrete explanation for their dismissal was offered at the time, with Krafton instead emphasizing its commitment to delivering a game that players deserved.</li>



<li>On July 3, a <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-community-letter">statement from the Unknown Worlds website</a> did its best to calm concerns from fans about the fact that the three original core creatives behind Subnautica were suddenly not at the studio.</li>



<li>The next day, on July 4, the situation began to grow even more confusing, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Cleveland claims</a> Subnautica 2 was "<em>ready for early access release</em>" and that his and his fellow co-founders' dismissals were "<em>quite a shock</em>."</li>



<li>Five days later, on July 9, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/">report from Bloomberg</a> adds a shocking allegation to the mix: that Krafton was delaying Subnautica 2 to avoid paying Unknown Worlds a $250 million bonus the studio would have been owed if they hit particular sales goals, which they would have done with Subnautica 2's launch. The delay was <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-delay-confirmed-krafton-claims-delay-decision-was-not-influenced-by-any-contractual-or-financial-considerations/">confirmed</a> hours after the report went live, and Krafton held that the delay was due to Subnautica 2 not being ready, citing feedback from internal playtesting.</li>



<li>On July 10, Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-blames-founders-subnautica-2-delay/">went on the offensive</a>, blaming co-founders Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire, claiming they had "<em>abandoned</em>" their roles to pursue personal interests. Krafton also clarified that 90% of the aforementioned $250 million bonus would go directly to the co-founders, with the rest to be split among the employees. Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire held that they always intended to distribute the bonus to other employees.</li>



<li>Also on July 10, Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/889109175/Fortis-Advisors-v-Krafton-via-Aftermath">filed a lawsuit</a> against Krafton. </li>



<li>On July 11, an<a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-leaked-document-shows-krafton-delay/"> internal document from a milestone review of Subnautica 2's progress leaked</a> on Reddit, seemingly showing further support to Krafton's claims that the game wasn't ready, citing a lack of content on top of previously mentioned internal playtest feedback.</li>



<li>Over the following weekend on July 13, Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-confirms-subnautica-2-leaked-documents-are-real/">confirmed the documents to be real</a>. </li>



<li>A few days later, on July 17, when the co-founders' suit against Krafton became publicly available, we discovered allegations that Krafton had <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-allegedly-sabotaged-subnautica-2-to-delay-avoid-paying-250-million-bonus/">been sabotaging</a> Subnautica 2 to ensure it would be delayed. There was even a claim that the CEO of Krafton met with the co-founders and admitted that having to pay out the $250 million bonus "<em>could be disastrous financially and hugely embarrassing for Krafton</em>." It also attacks every other claim Krafton had made up to this point, and that the feedback received on Subnautica 2 playtesting "<em>unequivocally proved</em>" the game was ready for an early access launch.</li>



<li>Jumping ahead to August 12, Krafton<a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-fires-back-unknown-worlds-founders-lawsuit-subnautica-2/"> shoots back</a> at Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire's lawsuit, again arguing that the co-founders were absentee leaders who abandoned their roles, and continued to hold that the game wasn't ready for an early access launch.</li>



<li>Eight days later, Unknown Worlds <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-legal-battle-unknown-worlds-files-lawsuit-against-co-founders-krafton/">files its own separate lawsuit</a> against its co-founders, telling Wccftech in an email that this suit "<em>is a direct response to their misconduct, including the theft of confidential information and attempts to pursue personal financial gain to the detriment of the company's interest</em>s<em>."</em></li>
</ul>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-doesnt-want-you-fighting-housework-anymore-its-selling-its-latest-model-with-no-margin-2000627205</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roborock-doesn%E2%80%99t-want-you-struggling-with-housework-it%E2%80%99s-selling-its-latest-model-with-no-margin.1302957/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Budget robot vacuum cleaners have three huge complaints. One, they’re never powerful enough so there’s always still some dust and some crumbs left behind. Two, they usually do mopping not so great so you’re left with streaks or worse still, no way to mop. And three, they need constant maintenance because you have to empty them almost every run. The <strong>Roborock Qrevo S5V</strong>, launched this summer, fixes all of that in one lean machine. Even better, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4199/">Amazon knocked it down to only $549 (from $899), its lowest price yet, which makes it a deal worth paying attention</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4199/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Solves Your Daily Hassles</h2>
<p>The new Roborock Qrevo S5V is all about sheer cleaning power: <strong>Its 12,000Pa HyperForce suction</strong> is several times stronger than many budget models which means it lifts stubborn dirt from rugs, carpets and hard floors. If you’ve struggled with pet hair tangling inside brushes, this model is certified to end that frustration. Roborock uses a floating rubber main brush designed to resist tangles, combined with an arc-shaped side brush that sweeps along edges while avoiding hair buildup.</p>



<p>Mopping is no afterthought here, either. Instead of a single plate scratching the floor, the<strong> FlexiArm design includes two turning mop pads</strong>. They turn around 200 times per minute to buff out stains, down into corners and chair legs. The arm goes so far that the pads can swing into spaces other robots cannot cover. In addition, the mop lifts automatically 10 millimeters when it drives over carpets so you never have soggy rugs. You can control water flow through 30 levels using the companion app to accommodate any floor surfaces, from delicate wood to hard tile.</p>
<p>Then there is the dock which is essentially having an assistant built-in: The device isn’t just dumping the dustbin into a large bin <strong>capable of holding seven weeks’ worth of garbage</strong>. The device also washes the mop pads with clean water and dries them with warm air so that they don’t smell. You won’t have to top it up as frequently either since the dock will charge the water tank in the robot automatically, giving it enough to clean a massive 3,500 square feet on one fill.</p>



<p>Navigation is accomplished by Roborock through LiDAR scanning: It <strong>maps rooms 360 degrees</strong> and then plans effective cleaning routes. If you have a multi-level house, it remembers up to four different floor plans and auto-switches as needed. Structured light sensors have obstacle avoidance, so it won’t chomp toy cars, run into cables, or get stuck under chair legs. In the app, you can even define no-go zones when you know a space is too messy.</p>
<p>For a record-low price of $549, the Qrevo S5V positions itself in a very desirable spot. Numerous competitors within the category either skip better mopping, compromise on suction, or lack a good self-maintenance dock. If you’ve been waiting for a vacuum and mop combo that truly reduces cleaning stress, this is the most convincing deal so far.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has released an Unearthed Arcana update for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. This updated batch of playtest material incorporates player feedback and design revisions to new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-dungeons-dragons-2024-unearthed-arcana-revisits-arcane-subclasses" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Arcane subclasses</a> for the world's most popular fantasy TTRPG.</p>



<p>In a recent post on <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/2061-designer-insights-from-unearthed-arcana-arcane" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D Beyond</a>, Wizards of the Coast released the new Unearthed Arcana update for the new D&amp;D arcane subclasses. The post was accompanied by design insight from the development team. The team cited player feedback from the initial playtest period when the first batch of Unearthed Arcana released in June.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-unearthed-arcana-update-transmuter-text.jpg?itok=HK2wVlz0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-unearthed-arcana-update-transmuter-text.jpg?itok=6pEKTZeY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As a result, the new Unearthed Arcana is packed with design notes explaining the changes to the six different character subclasses. Some of these changes include streamlining or redesigning certain class features, adding more versatility, or even bringing back features from the previous edition.</p>

<p>A good example is the Arcane Archer Fighter. The Curving Shot feature, which lets the Fighter redirect a ranged attack to another target, now uses the same piece of ammunition but lets the Fighter make a new attack roll. As for versatility, the subclass now has Magical Ammunition, which lets the Fighter cover an area in darkness, thick vines, or tactically unlock and unbar doors and gates with a magical AoE Knock.</p>

<p>The Tattooed Monk essentially got redesigned in the new Unearthed Arcana update. Much like the refined Warrior of the Elements subclass in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2024 Player Handbook</a>, the Tattooed Monk features aren't directly tied to spells. The Beast Tattoo feature provides some cantrip utility, and the Celestial Tattoo feature leans more into exploration bonuses. Finally new Monster Tattoos have been added like the Beholder.</p>

<p>Lastly, the the updated material revises the four new Wizard subclasses. The Conjurer can now grant temporary hit points to things summoned and, at later levels, can summon two creatures with a single cast. The Enchanter gets its Instintive Charm ability back as well as Alter Memories.</p>

<p>Necromancers now have more options on summoning and utilizing undead thralls. You can give them temporary hit points, bonus damage, and at later levels you can have them explode with necrotic energy. Lastly, Transmuter features have been streamlined. The Transmuter's Stone now grants Constitution bonuses in addition to any choices you make, and the Shapechanger feature from 5e returns.</p>

<p>The feedback survey for this new Unearthed Arcana will be going live on September 25.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2-online-multiplayer-witcher-4-sequel-cdpr-2000627198</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-experimenting-with-multiplayer-as-cdpr-embraces-online-gameplay.1302924/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Asymmetric mercenary leaderboards? Co-op heists? A full-blown<em> GTA Online</em>-style live-service component? The multiplayer possibilities for <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2-release-date-witcher-4-rpg-cdpr-1851782750">a <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> sequel</a> are easy to imagine, even if they’re hard to implement. A new job posting at CD Projekt Red suggests the studio is at least flirting with some sort of online component for its next sci-fi open-world RPG. It’s a small and noncommittal data point that’s nevertheless part of a larger trend.</p> <p>“Lead your team to develop and optimize multiplayer systems, including matchmaking, and address challenges related to latency, bandwidth usage, and server performance,” reads <a href="https://www.cdprojektred.com/en/jobs/20217-lead-network-engineer">part of the job description</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-looks-set-to-include-multiplayer-years-after-cyberpunk-2077-online-mode-scrapped">first spotted by <em>IGN,</em></a>&nbsp;for a new engineering role at CDPR’s Boston-based satellite studio leading development on <em>Cyberpunk 2</em>. That ambition gestures toward plans the studio originally had for adding multiplayer to the first game. Plans for that content were later set aside or abandoned as CDPR rushed to prioritize the stability and long-term viability of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> after a disastrous 2020 launch.</p> <p>Will history repeat itself, or is multiplayer coming to the world of <em>Cyberpunk </em>for real this time? With the big-budget blockbuster still in pre-production as CDPR focuses on <em>The Witcher 4</em>, it’s impossible to say. But it’s clear the Poland-based company has been looking to experiment with multiplayer for some time now. CDPR told investors it was looking to bring “online gameplay” to more of its franchises in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIAiGI-v6Y8">strategy briefing</a> four years ago, and co-CEO Michał Nowakowski <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-orion-multiplayer-1851190429#:~:text=Kotaku%20reached%20out%20to%20CDPR%20for%20comment.&amp;text=Badowski%20and%20Nowakowski's%20comments%20on,works%20that%20we%20know%20of.">told<em> Reuters</em> last year</a> the team was “considering” bringing multiplayer to the next <em>Cyberpunk</em>.</p>

 <p>CDPR has also already confirmed at least one multiplayer project: a <em>Witcher</em> spin-off codenamed <em>Project</em> <em>Sirius</em>. That game has been in prolonged development at what used to be called The Molasses Flood, with layoffs, departures, and design pivots reportedly all taking their toll. The studio was officially absorbed into the rest of CDPR earlier this year. “Overall, it shows a very bright future for Project Sirius (aka ‘the multiplayer Witcher game,’ of which I was the Design Director for three years),” Molasses Flood co-founder Damian Isla wrote upon leaving <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/damian-isla-815a46_well-its-the-end-of-an-era-tucked-away-activity-7315404560620044288-Qazy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAoO_OkB-VfPR7dhiZ-PZ-9sf_EfWliEy1k">back in March</a>. “It’s going to be an amazing game, one for the books, and I cannot wait until the rest of the world learns about what we’ve been working on.”</p> <p>One does not simply pivot to making an online multiplayer game any more than one simply walks into Mordor. CDPR’s own struggles with going from the third-person perspective of <em>Witcher 3</em> to the first-person<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em> speak to the tech and design difficulties inherent in taking on new development challenges. But it would be cool to see what CDPR can achieve if it takes that next leap. It ultimately worked out in the end for the studio’s last game, even if it took an extra three years after it came out.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-iphone-gimbal-costs-peanuts-amazon-is-clearing-out-djis-budget-model-2000627191</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-iphone-gimbal-costs-peanuts-amazon-is-clearing-out-dji%E2%80%99s-budget-model.1302918/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Smartphones are incredible cameras in our pockets with the capability of capturing crisp snaps and 4K video, but there’s a further issue: <strong>shaky footage</strong>. If you’ve ever tried to film a birthday moment, a journey moment or a TikTok dance, then you’ll know how frustrating shaky video is. So, that’s why gimbals exist.</p>
<p>The DJI Osmo Mobile SE gets rid of that problem and you’re able to turn ordinary recordings into professional-quality videos that look as if they’re shot by pros. And since <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4198/">Amazon has dropped the price to just $58 (down from a previous low of $69)</a> — its lowest price ever — this is the perfect time to pick one up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4198/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Gimbal Is Worth It</h2>
<p>The Osmo Mobile SE is <strong>DJI’s lowest-priced stabilizer</strong> but cheap doesn’t have to mean bare bones. In real life, it’s the category leader simply because it distills pro-level video stabilization into an accessible package. Its folding design means you can shove it neatly into a backpack but when you unfold it and clip your phone onto the magnetic clamp, you’re getting that liquid-smooth footage artists adore right away. It’s <strong>compatible with both iPhones and Androids</strong>, so compatibility issues are out of the question.</p>



<p>One of the real game changers in this regard is ActiveTrack 6.0: In essence, this <strong>permits the gimbal to automatically follow your subject</strong>. If you’re filming your children playing in the park or your dog running around on the beach, the Osmo Mobile SE holds them in frame without you scrambling for controls. It even works well for solo creators: just set the phone up, get in frame and let the gimbal take center stage in your own video. The DJI Mimo app also adds to those capabilities and offers Smart templates and shot ideas that help you get more cinematic with less effort.</p>
<p>Another intelligent aspect is that it allows pairing with an Apple Watch and gives you a remote in your wrist. Tilt, pan, or begin recording without needing to rush back to your phone. For vloggers, that is a real boost for how you record hands‑free. Throw in quick editing using the LightCut app which contains easy-to-use templates and your raw shots start looking like mini-movies to share in minutes.</p>



<p>And then the real magic: <strong>3-axis stabilization</strong>. DJI’s algorithm reacts in real time to eliminate jitters and bumps that ruin handheld video. Walking down urban streets, backpacking a path or merely shooting a travel blog at an airport, the video is stable and watchable. You can even switch between landscape shooting for cinematic use or portrait mode for social media updates with a single click of a button. And if you wish to get creative, the gimbal comes with<strong> various modes including Follow, Tilt Lock, FPV and Spin Shot</strong>&nbsp;which each unlock various artistic possibilities.</p>
<p>For a paltry $58, this deal is hard to hype. Most gimbals with this much stabilization and tracking tech run more, but DJI somehow crammed it all into a lightweight, tiny device for creators. Over 10,000 people bought it last month alone, and <strong>over 10,000 reviewers left it an average 4.5‑star rating</strong>. That should tell you everything you need to know about how dependable and adaptable it is.</p>

Gearbox has promised more fixes are on the way, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-september-18-update-improves-stability-on-pc-and-smooths-out-progression-but-according-to-the-patch-notes-balance-changes-will-have-to-wait">after yesterday’s patch tackled PC crashes</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Borderlands 4 justifies the six-year wait since the last entry with some big technical upgrades via Unreal Engine 5,” Morgan said. “Despite the team's huge ambition here, though, the game's performance at launch is struggling on console if 60fps is the goal, and a patch cannot come soon enough. The gradually worsening framerates on PS5, Pro, and Series X lead to some dire mid-30fps passages of play after a while. And resetting the game every hour should really not be an expected solution for players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This lack in polish at launch also shows in its bugs where broken NPC pathfinding and flickering lighting are just a couple of issues I've experienced. The promise of Borderlands 4 is compelling, but following on from MGS Delta and Oblivion Remastered, we're once again looking at a major UE5 release with framerate issues on every format. And once again, we're having to hang tight for an update to save the day.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what's causing the problem? As Morgan points out, the situation with Borderlands 4 rekindles memories of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tech-experts-say-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastereds-camera-breaks-the-longer-you-play-and-eventually-crashes-when-loading-a-save-call-for-emergency-patch">another Unreal Engine 5 title where performance degraded over time on console and also improved with a fresh boot</a>. It's unconfirmed for now, but the leading theory for Borderlands 4, as with Oblivion, is there's some form of memory leak at play, or, as Morgan put it, "a cache of data not being flushed from system memory that eventually catches up on the player."</p><div id="borderlands-4-all-vault-hunter-skill-trees-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What about the PC version?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Gamescom 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cb741be92b82d/nintendo-gamescom-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ant Dickens / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A new report states that Nintendo of America is cutting loose around 200 long-time contractor jobs as it has decided to outsource its customer support services ahead of the Switch 2's first holiday season.</p>
<p>This report comes from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-customer-support-concern-following-outsourcing-decision-ahead-of-switch-2s-first-holiday-season">IGN's Rebekah Valentine</a>, who spoke to numerous customer support staff and sources under anonymity. Many confirmed to the outlet that they were told back in March 2025 that their contracts were being cut and gradually being phased out. None of the contractors have received direct communication from Nintendo itself, hearing instead through their agencies about the news.</p>
<p>Now these contractors are expected to train their replacements, many of whom are based in South American countries, primarily in Brazil, Argentina, and Nicaragua. These have previously been limited to first-line contacts who act as representatives to send the information and problem on to the main team in the US.</p>
<p>There are concerns from the sources that there will, "in the immediate term" be a drop in quality of support, particularly once the fully-trained agents leave, with the Big N seeming to prioritise saving.</p>
<p>While the new contractors all speak English, some IGN spoke to said there were "a number of communication issues internally" with an "increase in customers becoming irate, belligerent, and even racially abusive".</p>
<p>Nintendo of America, in a response to IGN, has stated that "the claims shared with IGN include inaccurate information" and that "our top priority is to provide excellent customer support, and we are pleased that customer satisfaction with the service provided by all our partners remains positive." The company did not respond to requests on which claims were inaccurate.</p>
<p>Here is NoA's full response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"While we have nothing to announce about our internal business activities, the claims shared with IGN include inaccurate information. At Nintendo of America, we are extremely thankful to have partnered with several companies and their talented contractors over the years to deliver high-quality customer service experiences. We continue to evolve and expand our customer service model with external partners that have deep experience in all the markets we serve across the Americas. This approach allows us to support the full scope of our customer service mission in both North America and our growing Latin American markets, and better scale to seasonal needs for consistent support. As always, our top priority is to provide excellent customer support, and we are pleased that customer satisfaction with the service provided by all our partners remains positive."</em></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>One source told IGN that Nintendo of America normally works with two US-based agencies to fill customer support roles, including fraud, chargebacks, chatlogs, phone and email support, refunds, repair support and more. "There are a few people remaining on-site overseeing it, but essentially it’s all going away.”</p>
<p>A former employee acknowledges the nature of being a contractor and that "there was no guarantee to return after contract breaks", but feels that Nintendo could have approached things differently. "I personally feel as though Nintendo could have easily hired on a bunch of the contractors as FTE and had better results while still saving money from having to use the agencies."</p>
<p>"It's also such a volatile economy to be dumping all of us out into", with others echoing similar concerns, especially with the rise of generative AI in the customer support field: "“A lot of us are feeling betrayed, empty, like almost led-on in a way."</p>
<p>This is sadly not the first time Nintendo has cut contractor jobs suddenly. Back in 2024, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/03/nintendo-of-america-restructuring-testing-department-over-100-contractor-jobs-reportedly-eliminated">NoA downsized and restructured its testing department</a>, with a reported 100+ contractors losing their jobs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During today's Sync Presentation, Shanghai-based VR manufacturer <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/pimax/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pimax</a> has unveiled three new Virtual Reality headsets based on its new Micro-OLED product line.</p>



<p>Micro-OLED technology is considered by some to be the future of virtual reality thanks to its ultra-high pixel density, near-infinite contrast, and deep blacks. However, it has so far presented significant challenges, including heat management, optical compatibility, and scaling to high resolutions. Pimax claims to have overcome these challenges with its proprietary three-element ConcaveView pancake optics, which enable Micro-OLED to deliver clarity and immersion without compromise.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The widest FOV in micro-OLED VR Headsets | Pimax Sync" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vpSIZy_VZrg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The most accessible headset of this trio is the Pimax Dream Air SE, which offers premium clarity with its 2560 x 2560 resolution per eye and ultra-sharp Micro-OLED panels. It is also extremely light at 140 grams, making it one of the lightest VR headsets ever manufactured. Its full-featured package includes built-in 6DOF SLAM tracking, Tobii eye-tracking, dynamic foveated rendering, and integrated spatial audio, making it ideal for everyday VR. The Dream Air SE is priced at $899 and can be pre-ordered <a href="https://pimax.com/products/pimax-dream-air-se" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on this page</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Its larger sibling, the Pimax Dream Air, was presented by the manufacturer as their compact flagship featuring 3,840 x 3,552 resolution per eye — over 27 million pixels combined — with Sony Micro-OLED panels for unrivaled sharpness. Thanks to Pimax's ConcaveView pancake optics, the Dream Air achieves an unprecedented 110° horizontal and 120°+ diagonal field of view (FOV) for such a portable form factor. Weighing under 170 g, it is optimized for both gaming and professional applications with stereo overlap that enhances depth perception. It is far more expensive, though, at $1999. Pre-orders can be submitted <a href="https://pimax.com/products/pimax-dream-air" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Finally, the Pimax Crystal Super goes even further with its 116° horizontal and 128°+ diagonal field of view (FOV) with Sony Micro-OLED panels and ConcaveView optics—the widest FOV ever achieved with Micro-OLED VR technology. As part of the modular Crystal ecosystem, it supports interchangeable optical engines, including Ultrawide, 57 PPD clarity-focused, and Micro-OLED. This gives users the flexibility to switch between maximum immersion and maximum sharpness. The price is $2199 and the VR headset can be purchased <a href="https://pimax.com/products/pimax-crystal-super-sony-8k-micro-oled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Early adopters will receive exclusive bonus accessories from Pimax, including prescription lens frames and a free copy of Le Mans Ultimate. The products are scheduled to be released later in 2025.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-review-underground-excess.1302876/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</em> is less sequel, more spinoff to the original 2018 FPS, and it boldly bursts into a new genre: the "bullet heaven," also known as "walk around while your guy automatically attacks." In a gameplay style that seems be getting increasingly saturated day-by-day, does <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em>'s foray do enough to separate itself from the pack?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>A Survivors Classic...</h2>



<p>As you might expect,&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor&nbsp;</em>plays much like the 2022 smash hit&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-survivors-castlevania-crossover-dlc" rel="nofollow"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a>. You walk around, gain experience, level up, and use those levels to upgrade and acquire new weapons. Enemies swarm around you and with some exceptions for projectile-spitting foes, about the only way to take damage from them is to be overwhelmed by sheer numbers.</p>

<p>The sheer numbers show in the scale of content, too. 300 achievements, for one, as well as a bevy a missions with different mutators and twists to take on. It's a completionist's dream, or nightmare, depending on how you look at it.</p>

<p>You start with one weapon and gain your next three at set levels. This means that you're definitely going to want to be comfortable with your starting weapon, as it and one other random draw may be all you have for a while.</p>

<p>The formula of combat is pretty familiar for this, with weapons offering various upgrades as you level up. The weapon upgrades differ a little bit, thanks to the addition of milestones called "overclocks" at certain levels.</p>

<p>Overclocks give significant boosts to power in many different ways, from something as simple as a damage boost, to an overclock for a grenade that splits into three weaker versions of the same grenade. These upgrades change the already interesting weapons variety, giving even runs with similar weapons the possibility to feel different.</p>

<p>As for traversal, each stage consists of 5 sort of mini-stages, each culminating in a boss fight. After the boss fight, you'll have 30 seconds to get to a drop pod and escape to the next layer, or risk being abandoned.</p>

<p>This mechanic in particular gives a lot of fun risk-reward management, as you debate if it's worth going back for that sweet XP pile before getting to the drop pod. It also contributes to the general fast pace of the game, leading half-hour runs to feel like they're done in the blink of an eye. "One more run" was rarely just one.</p>

<h2>...With Some Miner Changes</h2>



<p>Speaking of risk-reward, the biggest innovation that <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em>'s survivor spin brings is the addition of, of course, mining. In addition to using your weapons to fight off enemies to gain experience points and level up, you can dig for materials, in particular Gold and Nitra, that help you buy upgrades between stages.</p>

<p>The addition of mining is a very welcome one, and gives a lot of incentive to thoroughly explore each layer as you visit it. With how brisk the game moves you along, it's rare that you'll get to see everything in a stage, so it's up to you to decide what's worth mining for, and what's better off ignored.</p>

<p>I found this to be a great addition to the known formula. It's a good compromise, giving me more to do, while also keeping attacks automatic like the titans of the bullet heaven genre.</p>

<p>In addition to mining for Gold and Nitra, you'll be tasked with secondary objectives, tasking you with finding anything from flowers to mushrooms. Collecting your quota of these will reward you with a healthy chunk of Gold and XP, adding a scavenger hunt element to your runs.</p>

<p>I enjoyed hunting for these materials, but wish they also served more of a purpose. Unlike Gold and Nitra, which help purchase upgrades for your run, and other minerals, which unlock permanent upgrades from the main menu, materials like Morokite that secondary objectives request seemingly disappear into the ether after you leave the layer.</p>

<p>These secondary objectives seem like they could have been even better if they helped steer me towards materials that also worked towards permanent unlocks, but as it stands, are just fun temporary distractions for each stage.</p>

<h2>Grinding My Gears</h2>



<p>The headline addition that arrived in the 1.0 version of&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor&nbsp;</em>is the gear system. Gear is equipment that enemies have a chance to drop throughout your run, which you can then equip to your characters before a run, offering stat buffs in a variety of areas.</p>

<p>Despite its headline billing, the gear was one of the more disappointing aspects. The random enemy drops combined with the miniscule benefits led me to mostly just use the handy automatic "smart equip" feature and just go back into another run instead.</p>

<p>This meta progression was the overall weakest part of my time with <em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</em>. Unlocks felt like they came at a slow pace, and first runs with each class especially felt almost scripted with how few options you were able to choose from for your arsenal.</p>

<p>And as for those aforementioned minerals, they serve mostly to gate off certain upgrades. For instance, you'll need pearls to increase your XP gain, but a different kind of gem to increase your critical hit rate.</p>

<p>While I understand the whole system is built to encourage mining, it feels like the whole thing would've been a lot more streamlined if I could've sold the treasure and bought any upgrade with the primary currency, instead of sorting through 7 currencies to see what upgrades I can maybe afford.</p>

<p>Despite my minor meta progression and unlock complaints, it's undeniable that the moment-to-moment gameplay of&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor&nbsp;</em>is an excellent distillation of the bullet heaven genre.</p>

<p>It's come a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-preview" rel="nofollow">long way since early access</a>, and the mining and small-stage format gives it a breakneck pace that makes that intoxicating "one more run" promise that the best of this genre should tempt you with.</p>
