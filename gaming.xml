		<p>Tribute Games has announced that Scott Pilgrim EX will be released on March 3rd, with two more characters also revealed for the brawler’s roster. Those characters are Matthew Patel and Robot-01, who will be joining Scott Pilgrim, Ramona Flowers, Roxie Richter and Lucas Lee as playable characters in this new entry to the Scott Pilgrim universe.</p>
<p><iframe title="Scott Pilgrim EX - Out March 3rd, 2026 - Matthew Patel and Robot-01 Join the Lineup!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iV1izGXgJFQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Scott Pilgrim EX takes us back to Toronto with the city having been taken over by three gangs, with those being The Vegans, The Robots, and The Demons. Oh, and members of the Sex Bob-omb have been kidnapped too. At its heart, Scott Pilgrim EX is a brawler with each character having their own abilities, which can be upgraded, and the game supports four player co-op.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/01/13/scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world-the-game-complete-edition-review/">Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game – Complete Edition Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Scott Pilgrim vs The World: The Game – Complete Edition review, Reuben said, <em>“Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game – Complete Edition remains an excellent game. With the whole game and DLC bundled together, this is the definitive package for fans of the franchise and of beat ’em ups in general. There’s a lot to be in lesbians with here, from the stellar soundtrack to excellent moment to moment gameplay. It’s clearly an utterly unique labour of love from a talented group of people (who happen to work at Ubisoft).”</em></p>

<p>Scott Pilgrim EX will be available on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, and Switch.</p>

Modiphius Entertainment has announced <em>Fallout RPG: Wasteland Wanderer</em>, a standalone book that lets you chart your own journey through the wasteland without a group or a gamemaster.</p><h2>The <em>Fallout RPG: Wasteland Wanderer</em> Announcement</h2><p>According to an official press release, <em>Fallout RPG: Wasteland Wanderer</em> brings the experience of Modiphius' 2d20 RPG system into solo play. The book's rules and mechanics will procedurally generate a story for the player. It will start with them stumbling out of a Vault-Tec Vault, followed by their immersion in the post-atomic wasteland of the United States.</p><picture>

If you own a copy of the Fallout RPG Core Rulebook, the rules, encounters, and monsters found there are compatible with this book.</p><p><em>Fallout RPG: Wasteland Wanderer</em> is a 256-page full-color, royal-sized hardcover book.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-says-no-to-toxic-dong-on-switch-2-as-dispatch-devs-confirm-censored-content-2000663868</link>
            <guid>1419019</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-review-adhoc-studios-all-8-episodes-finale-2000644106"><em>Dispatch</em> is out on Switch 1 and 2</a> as of January 28, but not without some compromises. The original release had the option to censor certain explicit content from the settings menu, but the version on Nintendo platforms will censor content by default with no option to remove it. That seemingly includes brief scenes that show supervillain Toxic’s full appendage.</p> <p>“Different platforms have different content criteria, and submissions are evaluated individually,” developer AdHoc said in a statement to <em>Eurogamer</em> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-switch-switch-2-censored-adhoc-comment">prior to release</a>. “We worked with Nintendo to ensure the content within the title met the criteria to release on their platforms, but the core narrative and gameplay experience remains identical to the original release,” the statement continued.</p>

 <p><em>Dispatch</em> is a four-episode interactive game about reformed villains navigating their emotional baggage and personal hang-ups in a superhero call center. The workplace comedy by ex-Telltale developers also includes some adult moments, like the aforementioned Toxic dong as well as romantic scenes and explicit hand gestures. In fact, some fans have spent the last few months <a href="https://kotaku.com/devs-dispatch-telltale-superhero-game-cut-sex-scenes-romance-2000643646">wishing the game was much raunchier</a>.</p> <p>At one point a character’s areola is exposed as she’s fitting into her new costume. It’s a lighthearted throwaway gag poking fun at the genre’s silly wardrobes, and I’m guessing that moment isn’t in the Switch version either. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/psa-dispatchs-visual-censorship-settings-cant-be-removed-on-switch#:~:text=AdHoc%20Studios'%20superhero%20narrative%20adventure,playing%20solely%20on%20Nintendo%20systems.">According to<em> NintendoLife</em></a>, a late-game sex scene has been nerfed altogether. The game’s profanity made it through, however, so you can still hear the characters swear if you want.</p>

 <p>It’s unclear what exactly Nintendo’s rules are for this kind of stuff. The <em>Dispatch</em> changes are especially weird because the Switch eShop is not otherwise shy about suggestive content. Anime sex game shovelware <a href="https://ntdeals.net/us-store/tag/sexual-content?platforms=switch">remains impossible to escape</a>. Maybe some games rated ESRB 17+ are just built different.</p>

            <guid>1419013</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Last week, following a series of layoffs and cancellations, Ubisoft <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>announced</u></a> a “major organizational, operational and portfolio reset” that… will <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-layoffs-prince-of-persia-remake-canceled/"><u>lead to more layoffs and cancellations</u></a> via a 200€ million cost-cutting plan. This has not been received well by anyone; the stock market and workers, usually the fiercest of foes, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-share-price-crash-prince-of-persia-ai-2000662169?ref=aftermath.site"><u>shared</u></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-stock-restructure-layoffs-cancel-delay-2000662684?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a spit take</u></a> at what seemed to be deep self-inflicted wounds. Now, five French unions representing Ubisoft workers have called for a “massive international strike.”</p><p>The unions – CFE-CGC, CGT, Printemps Écologique, Solidaires Informatique, and STJV – intend for the strike to take place from February 10-12.&nbsp;</p><p>"The announced transformation [at Ubisoft] claims to place games at the heart of its strategy, but without us, these games cannot exist," the unions wrote in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stjv.fr/post/3mdiakqixmj2m?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a joint release</u></a>. "We are told about responsibilities, but those who wield this word so easily do not take any responsibility for the consequences of their catastrophic management, the latest result being the elimination of 200 jobs at Ubisoft's headquarters. We are not fooled: rather than taking financial responsibility for layoffs, they prefer to push us out by making our working conditions unbearable. It's outrageous. Our colleagues carry on, hold fast, endure, out of solidarity, out of love for the industry, and out of passion. But enough is enough!"&nbsp;</p><p>Marc Rutschlé, a Solidaires Informatique union representative at Ubisoft Paris, said that on top of everything else, Ubisoft's plan to require workers to be in office five days per week, effectively eliminating remote work, tramples all over a deal unions made with the company last year.</p><p>“Solidaires, alongside the other unions, spent the better part of 2025 fighting for a hybrid work agreement at Ubisoft's studio in Paris, after management decided, arbitrarily, that we needed to be in the office three days a week,” Rutschlé told Aftermath. “An agreement was reached – painfully I might add – voted on by the employees, and signed in September [2025]. This agreement, while flawed, ensured that employees that lived far away would be allowed to keep their hybrid work model, and that the rest of us could request special adjustments in certain cases (familial obligations, health reasons, etc). The agreement cannot be reneged on for at least a year. However this announcement by Yves Guillemot just blew away a year of negotiations in an instant.”&nbsp;</p><p>Aftermath reached out to Ubisoft for additional details but did not receive a reply as of this publishing.</p><p>Guillemot’s decision, Rutschlé believes, will send ripples through Ubisoft.&nbsp;</p><p>“Hundreds of employees who felt the issue was over with are now put under an enormous amount of stress again, not knowing if their work/life balance will be compatible with Ubisoft a year from now. We do not know at this time if management will feel flexible towards some of us. All we know is that Yves Guillemot has decided, by himself, that working remotely is an issue that needs to be fixed, against the advice of everyone he's asked. And because he needs to find 200€ million for the coming year, any person who has to quit because of this is a net benefit for him.”</p><p>Rutschlé also feels like elimination of remote work is at odds with the central organizing principle of nu-Ubisoft: five “creative houses” that will each focus on specific genres and series.&nbsp;</p><p>“It also contradicts the idea that creative houses are supposed to have greater autonomy from HQ,” he said. “Why then, impose this RTO policy to everyone and not let each creative house decide by themselves?&nbsp; In short, this is a lose-lose situation for every person and every project at Ubisoft, but Yves Guillemot seems to think otherwise.”</p><p>For now, Ubisoft workers find themselves in an uncomfortable holding pattern.</p><p>“No announcement has been made regarding which games are cancelled and which are delayed, and so no one at Ubisoft at the moment knows if they will be affected or not,” Rutschlé said.</p><p>This is not the first time Ubisoft workers in France have gone on strike. In 2024, nearly 700 employees across Paris, Montpellier, Annecy, Lyon, and Bordeaux <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-strike-france-pay-yves-guillemot/"><u>participated in a national strike</u></a> over substandard pay – one of the largest strikes in video game history. More recently, Solidaires Informatique hosted <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/pixels/article/2026/01/23/how-ubisoft-the-french-video-game-giant-reached-breaking-point-after-years-of-turmoil_6749735_13.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a smaller half-day strike</u></a> outside Ubisoft’s Paris office last week following Ubisoft’s reorganization announcement.&nbsp;</p><p>The Ubisoft unions hope that February’s strike will be the largest yet, and they’re coordinating with unions outside France to present a globally united front against the company.</p><p>"We are hoping that, if enough people join us in the strike, Yves Guillemot and his team will realize that they cannot make games without us,” Rutschlé said. “Our goal is to show them that we will not be bullied into submission and that we are willing to fight for better working conditions. Our goal is to make great games again, without having to look over our shoulder constantly, wondering what the next announcement brings, and who will fall. We are sick of seeing our work conditions be degraded to a point where working at Ubisoft will become untenable.”&nbsp;</p><p>“We will not be fooled,” he added. “We see these decisions as a tactic to enact so-called 'soft-layoffs,' and we will not let it happen quietly."</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-layoffs-prince-of-persia-remake-canceled/"><div><p>Following Layoffs And Cancellations, Ubisoft Announces More Layoffs And Cancellations</p><p>Sands of Time remake canceled by company regrettably incapable of rewinding time</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="e69e1dd540cf3"><a title="Ten of the Weirdest Game Over Screens" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e69e1dd540cf3/ten-of-the-weirdest-game-over-screens.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Game over screens — as a professional gamer, you understand — aren't something that I personally have a lot of firsthand experience with. Not through a lack of in-game skill, that's for sure.</p>
<p>However, as I'm also a highly learned and incredibly hirsute scholar of the interactive arts (also a compulsive liar), I <em>have</em> made it my very important business to die on purpose many, many times in order to familiarise myself with the very best and most important ways to come-a-cropper, as they say, in a video game.</p>
<p>Now, as we all know, there are some instant talking points within this particular topic, stuff that everyone is going to bring up immediately: your <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/grand_theft_auto_the_trilogy_-_the_definitive_edition">GTA</a> 'WASTED' screen; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">FromSoftware's 'You Died'</a>; and all of the very many unpleasantly hilarious ways you can be offed in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat</a> series. These are cool, but they're all a little bit obvious.</p>
<p>The same goes for that lovely Bond-styled death animation for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/goldeneye_007">GoldenEye</a> on the N64 (something that got me very excited about life back at the tail end of 1997), and all those very well-written little comments and asides from Arkham's finest criminals when Batman falls in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/batman_arkham_trilogy">Rocksteady's spectacular series</a>. All great ways to go, and all available to enjoy (or rage quit over) from the comfort of a Switch console, no less.</p>
<p>Today, though, instead of going with the more obvious choices, I want to pick out a bunch of the weirdest (or what I consider to be the weirdest) game over screens out there - and available to experience on Nintendo systems, if not your Switch. What are the strangest, darkest, oddest, most confusing, unusually brutal, or just-plain weird Game Overs I've seen with my poor little peepers (for research)?</p>
<p>Let's find out!</p>
<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disco_elysium_the_final_cut">Disco Elysium: The Final Cut (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<figure data-uuid="5759b23e8fa5f"><a title="Ten of the Weirdest Game Over Screens" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5759b23e8fa5f/ten-of-the-weirdest-game-over-screens.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: ZA/UM</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disco_elysium_the_final_cut">Disco Elysium</a> is up first here because it's sort of a cheat for this kind of list, given just how many ridiculous ways there are to get a game over screen, which is represented in-game as a newspaper clipping detailing your demise and/or downfall.</p>
<p>From ending a run because you got your tie stuck in a ceiling fan, or because a street urchin called you a slur, to taking too much psychic damage because of a romantic rejection, there's a lot to choose from. Honestly. Endless ways.</p>
<p>For me, though, the weirdest ending I've had is because I went to sleep in a dumpster. I mean, COME ON. I was tired.</p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/catherine_full_body">Catherine: Full Body (Switch)</a></h2>
<figure data-uuid="b85276161d45a"><a title="Ten of the Weirdest Game Over Screens" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b85276161d45a/ten-of-the-weirdest-game-over-screens.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Atlus</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I think it's fair to say that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/catherine_full_body">Catherine: Full Body</a> is a terrifying game for many reasons. It's a weird one, a real oddball puzzler that had me squirming in my seat during sequences where demons are chasing me though my perverted, sweaty dreams. Or I've when I've suddenly turned into a very evil-looking goat.</p>
<p>However, it's the game over screen — which at a glance is totally unremarkable — that has stayed with me long after wrapping the game up.</p>
<p>Firstly, Vincent is lying in his pants (and they have hearts on them, cringe) in a pool of blood. Nightmarish enough, but then he also proclaims that "now's not the time to be dead" as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDLdwMI8xXU"><strong>Zigeunerweisen</strong></a> plays in the background and he resurrects.</p>
<p>What an absolute torturous nightmare of a scenario for the poor guy, a vicious circle of perverted poverty. Love is over, indeed.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/disneys_tarzan">Disney's Tarzan (N64)</a></h2>
<figure data-uuid="e51b759674685"><a title="Ten of the Weirdest Game Over Screens" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e51b759674685/ten-of-the-weirdest-game-over-screens.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Eurocom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/disneys_tarzan">Disney's Tarzan</a>! Now what on earth is a game like this doing on a list of weird, oddball dark endings? A colourful family jaunt from the good old days that all the kids can play, as Tarzan makes his way through a lovely cartoon jungle full of friendly animaDIEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! DIE TARZAN, DIE! DIEEEEEEEEEEE!</p>
<p>Sorry about that. But this is how it feels to die in this game, because the devs decided (and full marks by the way, it's a blinder of a surprise) to give us <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0L9n89tJCY">a selection of game over screens</a>, the worst of which is your lifeless body being dragged away by a crocodile.</p>
<p>Yes, Tarzan, you are about to be dinner, and then toilet material. Dreadfully sorry, old chap.</p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/we_love_katamari_reroll_plus_royal_reverie">We Love Katamari REROLL + Royal Reverie (Switch)</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/we_love_katamari_reroll_plus_royal_reverie">We Love Katamari REROLL</a> treats us to a wonderfully weird (and shifting) game over when we fail its tasks. No time is wasted before a very angry King of the Cosmos is shooting lasers at us whilst berating everything about us and wishing he'd chosen our stupid cousins for the mission instead.</p>
<p>Oh, and those lasers make you shrink. So be afraid.</p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger (SNES)</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> served up a real eye-opener with a game over screen that displays "...But The Future Refused To Change" upon death at the hands of Lavos.</p>
<p>This stark message conveys, very brutally, that the future is doomed and there's not a damn thing you can do about it now. You are dead and you have failed in the biggest way possible. Ouch!</p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/virtual_bart">Virtual Bart (SNES)</a></h2>

<p>In the classic slice of 90s chaos, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/virtual_bart">Virtual Bart</a>, you play a level as Bart who has turned into pig form. Die as said pig and you'll be treated to a game over screen that sees Homer tucking into a box of corndogs.</p>
<p>He picks out one shaped as Bart, then goes ahead and eats him, quickly followed by another regular one on top. That is cold, man.</p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/final_fight">Final Fight (SNES)</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/final_fight">Final Fight</a> makes the cut here due to the sheer brutality of game over screens that see whatever character you happened to be pummelling everyone with tied to a pole. What's more, they are surrounded by dynamite which is about to explode.</p>
<p>So yeah. Punishment by being exploded. Wow.</p>
</div><div><h2>Friday the 13th (NES)</h2>

<p>This golden oldie was way ahead of its time in terms of cutting directly to the bleeding point (quite literally) by welcoming your demise with a game over screen that reads "You and your friends are dead."</p>
<p>I can tell you that, as a young child having a go at a game you probably shouldn't, that message certainly leaves an imprint.</p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/goemons_great_adventure">Goemon's Great Adventure (N64)</a></h2>

<p>Okay, look. What if I just say, "Small pants muscle man rotating under disco lights, very small pants, sweaty...seems like it's going on in a dingy, smoky room. Please make it stop now."</p>
<p>Does that jog any memories? The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/mystical_ninja_starring_goemon">Mystical Ninja/Goemon</a> games have a tradition. They've got form with these weird game over screens, but they went a step further in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/goemons_great_adventure">Goemon's Great Adventure</a>, getting the game over dancer right down to a very small pair of underpants. And he's dancing.</p>
<p>Why is this happening?</p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_vs_capcom_fighting_collection_arcade_classics">The Punisher</a></h2>

<p>Brutal with a capital B, you can find <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/punisher">The Punisher</a> on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_vs_capcom_fighting_collection_arcade_classics">Marvel vs Capcom Arcade Fighting Classics Collection</a> for Switch, and it's made the cut here because I have genuinely never forgotten it after having witnessed it first time in ye days of yore.</p>
<p>The scene in question involves you having CPR performed on your lifeless body by a desperate doctor as a timer counts down. Fail to continue and the doc is overcome with grief. Fairly dark stuff for a jaunt down the arcade, lads. Jeezo.</p>

<p>On January 12, EA <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/biowares-anthem-will-soon-be-completely-unplayable/">shut down the official servers for <em>Anthem</em></a>, making Bioware’s multiplayer sci-fi adventure completely unplayable for the first time since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/02/anthem-game-review-honestly-its-not-finished/">its troubled 2019 launch</a>. Last week, though, the <em>Anthem</em> community woke up to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPx5SJHFvGM">a new video</a> showing the game at least partially loading on what appears to be a simulated background server.</p>
<p>The people behind that video—and the <em>Anthem</em> revival project that made it possible—told Ars they were optimistic about their efforts to coerce EA’s temperamental Frostbite engine into running the game without access to EA’s servers. That said, the team also wants to temper expectations that may have risen a bit too high in the wake of what is just a proof-of-concept video.</p>

<p>“People are getting excited [about the video], and naturally people are going to get their hopes up,” project administrator Laurie told Ars. “I don’t want to be the person that’s going to have to deal with the aftermath if it turns out that we can’t actually get anywhere.”</p>
<h2>Keep an eye on those packets</h2>
<p>The <em>Anthem</em> revival effort currently centers around <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1qfqe29/the_forts_forge/">The Fort’s Forge</a>, a Discord server where a handful of volunteer engineers and developers have gathered to pick apart the game and its unique architecture. Laurie said they initially set up the group “out of little more than spite for EA and Bioware around the time the shutdown got announced” back in July.</p>
<p>While Laurie has some experience with the community behind <a href="https://1379.tech/the-making-of-side-7-gundam-evolution-private-server-project/"><em>Gundam Evolution</em> revival project Side 7</a>, they knew they’d need help from people with direct experience working on EA’s Frostbite engine games. Luckily, Laurie said they were “able to catch the eyes of people who are familiar with this line of work [without] searching too much.”</p>
<p>One of those people was Ness199X, an experienced Frostbite tinkerer who told Ars he “never really played much <em>Anthem</em>” before the game’s shutdown was announced. When a friend pointed out the impending death of the title, though, Ness said he was motivated to preserve the game for posterity.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Initial efforts to examine what made <em>Anthem</em> tick “came up empty,” Ness said, largely because the game uses EA’s bespoke Frostbite engine differently than other EA titles. To begin mapping out those differences, Ness released a packet logger tool in September that let contributors record their own network traffic between the client and EA’s official servers. In addition to helping with reverse-engineering work, Ness writes on the Fort’s Forge Discord that players who logged their packets should be able to fully recover their characters if and when <em>Anthem</em> comes back in playable form.</p>
<h2>Catching Frostbite</h2>
<p>By analyzing that crowdsourced packet data, Ness said the Fort’s Forge team has been able to break <em>Anthem</em> down into three essential services:</p>
<ol>
<li>EA’s Blaze server: Used for basic player authentication.</li>
<li>Bioware Online Services (aka BIGS): A JSON web server used to track player information like inventory and quest progression.</li>
<li>The Frostbite multiplayer engine: Loads level data and tracks the real-time positions of players and non-player characters in those levels.</li>
</ol>
<p>Early efforts to emulate the Blaze and BIGS portions of that architecture helped lead directly to last week’s proof-of-concept video. Andersson799—who says he’s been tinkering with <em>Battlefield</em> and other Frostbite games since 2015—said he was quickly able to use his own logged <em>Anthem</em> packets to create a “barebones anthem private server” that served as a “quick and dirty” sample that he decided to share via YouTube.</p>
<p>“I basically made the tool to just simply reply with the packet captures that I got,” Andersson told me. That was enough to “get in to the game with player profiles loaded and everything.” And while Ness says there’s still some effort needed “to [make Blaze and BIGS] work well and smoothly in terms of quest progression, etc.,” the path forward on those portions is relatively straightforward.</p>
<p>It’s the Frostbite engine and its odd client-server architecture that forms the biggest barrier to getting <em>Anthem</em> up and running again without EA’s servers. “Due to how Frostbite is designed, all gameplay in a Frostbite game runs in a ‘server’ context,” Ness explained. Even in a single-player game like <em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em>, he said, “the client just creates a separate server thread and pipes all the traffic internally.”</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>“I feel like with <em>Anthem</em>, it heavily relies on online data that was stored in Bioware’s server,” Andersson added. “In my initial testing, the game couldn’t load into the level without that data.”</p>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OLsHdqHR0-E?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p><div>
    
    <p><em>Anthem</em>‘s Fort Tarsis area loads its data from local files, rather than EA’s servers.

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>There’s some hope that this crucial level data is still available and recoverable, though. Ness points out that Fort Tarsis, the game’s lobby area, already runs using offline data piped through a local “server” thread, meaning the rest of the game could theoretically be coerced to run similarly.</p>
<p>Just as important, he says, “as far as we have been able to discern, all the logic for the other levels, which when the game was live ran on a remote server, also exists in the client,” Ness said. “By patching the game we can most likely enable the ability to host these in process as well. That’s what we’re exploring.”</p>

<h2>“To be honest we’re not entirely sure…”</h2>
<p>While all that local level data should be usable in theory, seemingly random differences between <em>Anthem</em> and other Frostbite games are getting in the way of loading the data in practice. <em>Anthem</em> acts like a standard Frostbite game “for the most part,” Ness said, but at times will show unusual behaviors that are hard to pin down.</p>
<p>“For example, when we try to load most maps, no NPCs spawn, but in some maps they do,” he said. “And we have yet to determine why. Ness has some suspicion that the odd behavior is connected to the “fairly extensive amount of player data the game keeps as part of its online RPG nature,” but adds that “to be honest we’re not entirely sure how deep the differences go, other than that the engine didn’t behave how we expected it to.”</p>
<p>Ness said he’s about 75 percent confident that the team will be able to figure out how to fully leverage the Frostbite engine to power a version of the game that runs without EA’s centralized servers. If that effort succeeds, he says a playable version of <em>Anthem</em> could be back up and running in “months, or less even, depending on motivation.” But if the efforts to pick apart <em>Anthem</em>’s take on Frostbite hits a brick wall, Ness says “the amount of work increases fairly exponentially and I’m a lot less confident that we have the motivation for that.”</p>

<p>“I’m fairly confident that we can get this game to be playable again, like how it is supposed to be,” Andersson said. “It’ll just take time as most of us have our own life to manage besides this.”</p>

<p>In the meantime, Laurie is still trying to manage expectations set by the somewhat premature posting of Andersson’s proof-of-concept video. “Please, do not expect frequent updates,” Laurie wrote in the Fort’s Forge Discord. “We had not anticipated releasing anything this early, nor should the expedience of this video’s release serve as any kind of benchmark for how fast we make progress.”</p>
<p>Laurie also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1qfng76/comment/o06gfou/?context=3">took to Reddit</a> to publicly call the video “a really hacky thing so I want to ask people to manage their expectations just a bit. A lot of stuff clearly doesn’t work as ‘intended,’ and definitely needs at minimum, more polish.”</p>
<p>At one point last week, Laurie says they had to stop accepting new members to the Fort’s Forge Discord, “mostly to prevent an influx of people in response to… news coverage.” And while people with Frostbite engine modding experience are encouraged to reach out, the small team is being cautious about growing too large, too fast.</p>
<p>“We’re a little reluctant to add developers right now as we have no real code base to work from,” Ness said, describing their current efforts as “scratch work” maintained in separate forms by multiple people. “But once we firm that up (hopefully in the next weeks), we will look to add more [coders].”</p>

              <p><span>I’m a Japanese RPG fan first, and a Soulslike fan second. Maybe third? Anyway, despite thoroughly enjoying games like </span><i><span>Dark Souls</span></i><span> and the countless other similar games inspired by it, the Souslike genre isn’t one I’ve always gravitated toward. Imagine my surprise when Bandai Namco decided to combine the anime aesthetics of a JRPG with the demanding gameplay of </span><i><span>Dark Souls</span></i><span>. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/code-vein-is-the-chillest-dark-souls-clone-1838481190"><i><span>Code Vein</span></i></a><span> was born. Finally something for </span><i><span>me</span></i><span> specifically.</span></p> <p><span>There aren’t many hybrids like this. Most games in the genre still go for a more realistic art style, like that seen in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nioh-2-the-kotaku-review-1842270420"><i><span>Nioh</span></i></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-surge-2-is-a-bit-of-a-mess-but-i-cant-stop-playing-1838376079"><i><span>The Surge</span></i></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lies-of-p-review-pinocchio-soulslike-bloodborne-sekiro-1850857903"><i><span>Lies of P</span></i></a><span>. Last year’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ai-limit-soulslike-how-long-to-beat-short-hard-1851772663"><i><span>AI Limit</span></i></a><span> and, to a lesser extent, the cel-shaded </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/first-berserker-khazan-review-anime-soulslike-rpg-1851771917"><i><span>Khazan: the Last Berserker</span></i></a><span>, remain isolated examples of the hybrid approach. In this context, </span><i><span>Code Vein</span></i><span> stands out.</span></p>

 <p><span>Its sequel, </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span>, expands on its predecessor by offering more flexible combat options, as well as a new open world to explore. It also oozes classic JRPG tropes about heroes forging bonds and the strength of friendship. Its enticing time-traveling story takes a bit to get going, but its characters are a highlight. Less brutal than its genre contemporaries, </span><i><span>Code Vein II </span></i><span>emerges as a comfy mix between a Soulslike and a JRPG that makes for a satisfying entry point for folks who want to dip their toes into both genres.</span></p> <p><i><span>Code Vein II </span></i><span>is set in a post-apocalyptic future caused by the Resurgence a century before the events of the game. In order to stop the Resurgence, five heroes gave up their lives to seal away this mysterious force. But in the present, those seals are weakening, leading to the sudden emergence of the Luna Rapacis, a moon-like entity hovering in the middle of the city. This has turned human-like vampiric beings called Revenants into monsters called Horrors. And it’s up to you to travel back in time to change the fates of those original five heroes.</span></p>

 <p><span>The here story isn’t cryptic as one might expect from a game in the Soulslike genre. It’s standalone too, so you don’t have to play the first game to understand this one. With your time-traveling partner, Lou, you travel through the open world to search for each of the heroes’ cocoons, where they’ve been slumbering away for the past century. Lou sends you back in time to fight alongside each hero and at the end of their respective arcs, they hand you a sentimental item that you take back to the present to break the cocoon. This then culminates in a big boss fight against the hero themself, which weaves in a satisfying narrative finish to each hero’s storyline. Unlike with games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-fromsoftware-review-hidetaka-miyazaki-dark-s-1848694257"><i><span>Elden Ring</span></i></a><span>, I didn’t need to consult an hour-long YouTube lore essay to figure out what the hell was going on.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I also really enjoyed spending time with </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span>’s characters. Lou starts off as little more than a tool used for her time travel powers. However, as you and she begin changing the heroes’ fates step by step, she begins to wonder if meddling more in the past might ultimately lead to a better future. Tension arises as the towering and voluptuous Lady Dimetescu-like mother figure and group leader Lavinia Voda warns her not to do so, as it could lead to unintended consequences. But by the end of the story, Lou begins to stand up for herself, and it’s exciting to see her come into her own. Many of the heroes and supporting characters go through similar redemption arcs, adding real emotional weight to the story.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000663846" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663846"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663846">©Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p><span>My favorite character has to be Zenon Gryfgote. At first, he’s depicted as some sort of immoral mad scientist. However, when you meet him, you quickly realize he’s just a goofball wife guy. You can even see it in his elaborate gold-plated costume, which is adorned with representations of his deceased wife. His helmet also looks like something you’d wear to an EDM concert, and his cape is layered with lights that help convey his emotions. Despite his hulking frame, his flashy design makes him relatable, funny, and down to earth. </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span>’s larger-than-life cast brings vibrancy to a post-apocalyptic world.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Code Vein II </span></i><span>is noticeably easier than most Soulslike games I’ve played. A large part of that is due to its NPC companion system. Basically, you can bring one character to fight alongside you at all times. Other Soulslike games usually require some sort of consumable to summon an ally, but there’s absolutely no cost here. They’re impervious to all damage, can draw aggro from bosses, and can even deal the killing blow on enemies. When you die, you even get a sort of </span><i><span>Sekiro</span></i><span>-like second wind. </span><i><span>Code Vein II </span></i><span>is practically a Fisher-Price toy compared to a game like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nioh-2-the-kotaku-review-1842270420"><i><span>Nioh 2</span></i></a><span>, but that’s what makes it an entry-level and more approachable Soulslike.</span></p> <h2>Easy mode</h2> <p><span>Don’t get too comfortable, though, as you can’t just run away and let your ally handle bosses all by themselves. Bosses usually have an attack or two that easily closes the distance, so you’ll end up having to confront them directly anyway.</span></p> <p><span>Another way the game forces you to engage with bosses is through its Weapon Formae system. In order to use these flashy special attacks, you expend Ichor, which functions like MP in a JRPG. To recover Ichor, you’ll need to execute Drain Attacks via your equipped Jail. These come in the form of a giant claw, bat wings, and even a scorpion tail. They’re slow to start up, but vital if you want to continue inflicting huge damage. So you also have to strategically pick when to restore Ichor, like when a boss is recovering from finishing a powerful attack. You’re in this rhythmic cycle of attacking, draining, and attacking again, and you need to be up in the enemy’s face in order to do so, making </span><i><span>Code Vein 2</span></i><span> a surprisingly aggressive Soulslike.</span></p>

 <p><span>Unfortunately, sometimes the camera is a pain to deal with in the midst of the game’s bigger boss fights. There were many instances in which my back would be against the wall, and the camera would zoom in so close that I couldn’t decipher the boss’s next attack, leading to a death.</span></p> <p><span>During my playthrough, I switched between my one-handed sword and hammer weapons. For the former, my go-to Forma was Phantom Ambush, which was super helpful for boss fights since I would disappear in a puff of smoke for a second, then slash the enemy twice. When timed right, I could avoid incoming attacks completely while being able to immediately strike back. My favorite hammer Forma was Gaia Impact, which activated a huge AOE shockwave when I slammed my weapon to the ground, perfect for crowd control. The Formae system makes the game feel a lot more like a typical action RPG, something like an </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ys-x-nordics-arpg-review-guide-1851684251"><i><span>Ys</span></i></a><span> game but with Soulslike core mechanics. These attacks added a degree of cinematic flair that’s often missing from Soulslike games.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"Dark Souls for weebs."</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Bandai Namco</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game: </p>                 <p>Soulslike</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Charming cast of characters, plenty of customization, fun combat, great boss design.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p> Performance issues, funky camera, boring normal enemies, repetitive dungeons.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>PC, PS5 (played), Xbox Series X|S.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date: </p>                 <p>January 29, 2026</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>played:</p>                 <p>45 hours. All characters arcs and most sidequests completed. Unlocked all three endings: normal, good, and true. Still have to find all hot springs and healing upgrades in the open world.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>Central to the game’s customization systems are Blood Codes, which act kind of like character classes that you can equip to fit your playstyle. For example, if you like parrying, Lyle’s Blood Code is ideal since its traits include powering up its parry staggering capabilities. If you’re a more careful player, Holly’s Blood Code might suit you, as it restores some HP upon defeating an enemy. What makes Blood Codes flexible is that even though they have specific traits and boost certain stats, you’re free to use whatever weapons you like the most regardless of which one you have equipped.</span></p>

 <p><span>After mastering a Blood Code, you can extract a Booster from it, which are passive skills that you can equip. For example, mastering Zenon’s Blood Code rewards you with Halberd Mastery, which of course increases your attack strength when wielding Halberds. Between Blood Codes, Formae, and Boosters, there’s a large variety of customization options that make fights feel both extravagant and exhilarating.</span></p> <h2>The open road</h2> <p><span>Like many sequels before it, </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span> takes the predictable route in becoming an open-world game. The freedom this shift allows reminded me of </span><i><span>Elden Ring</span></i><span> in which, if I was stuck on a boss, I’d explore more, get stronger, and come back to tackle the boss again. This allowed me to still make progress somewhere else even if my attempts to advance in one direction had hit a wall. And that’s pretty much what I did throughout. Interestingly, this freedom meant that I accidentally skipped over what was intended to be the game’s first hero story, Josee’s, in the Sunken City area. Instead, I veered off a little too far into the northeast towards the Corroded Scar region and started Lyle’s first.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000663847" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663847"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663847">©</figcaption></figure> <p><span>After breaking Lyle’s cocoon, I couldn’t beat his corrupted form to continue the story. So instead, I went back to Josee’s location and finished her story arc. Since I was almost done with Lyle’s arc anyway, I was overpowered for Josee’s, defeating her corrupted form handily. This looser approach of story progression works in the open world’s favor. With side dungeons and mini-bosses to boot, exploration never felt like a waste of time. Every little thing I did made me stronger, which would eventually help me beat the bosses I’d initially had trouble with. Unfortunately, the dungeons grow a bit repetitive, and enemy variety is lacking compared to the extravagantly designed bosses.</span></p>

 <p><span>That said, you get a cool bike to speed exploration up, along with a generous amount of fast-travel points. On the downside, the joys of exploration are marred a bit by performance issues as you speed around the world with foliage constantly popping in and out, at least on PS5 Pro where I played the game.&nbsp; There was also one point at which I made the classic Soulslike runback from a save point to the boss and I skipped so many enemies that when they all started chasing me on the screen, the framerate slowed to a crawl.</span></p> <p><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span> doesn’t just take a superficial anime aesthetic and use it as window dressing on a popular genre. Its story and charming cast elevate it to create a unique middle ground that will appeal to JRPG and Soulslike fans alike. It’s got its fair share of issues, such as the performance woes and boring enemy fodder design. Still, if you’re looking to ease into the Soulslike genre before hitting the big leagues, </span><i><span>Code Vein II</span></i><span> is worth spilling blood over.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has confirmed the line up for the February 2026 PS Plus monthly games, with subscribers getting four games as part of the subscription. These games will be available from February 3rd and there is a decent mix of titles on offer. The games are Undisputed, Subnautica Below Zero, Ultros, and Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown.</p>
<p><iframe title="Undisputed Launch Trailer (ESRB)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s4g44lARkFU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Undisputed is going to be available for PS5. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/undisputed-review/">Undisputed review</a>, I said, “Undisputed is a valiant attempt by Steel City Interactive, bringing back boxing to the fore in video games after a long absence. The in-ring action is generally very good and the roster is well stacked. What is missing is good commentary and there are gameplay issues that need to be addressed, including lag and stuttering. Undisputed is not ready to be a title challenger yet, but updates may see it get there eventually.”</p>
<p><iframe title="Subnautica: Below Zero Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rdix1XxaZyU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Subnautica is going to be available for both PS5 and PS4. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/05/11/subnautica-below-zero-review/">Subnautica: Below Zero review</a>, Jason said, “Subnautica: Below Zero is a masterfully horrific experience that encourages you to push on despite your fears. It’s a fine balancing act of the horrors you’ll face underwater and the rewards you can get for evading them. It’s really very hard, but it’s also really very good.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Ultros – Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iloiRk1k3_U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ultros will be available for PS5 and PS4. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/26/ultros-review/">Ultros review</a>, Steve said, “Ultros is a true labour of love that has a lot to say about the balance between violence and peace, and exploitation and environmentalism, themes which are incredibly important and too often ignored in games, but this theme sometimes feels at odds with the basic game mechanics and can lead to early frustration. The game is quite clear that the first ending is a bad one due to the violence required to reach it, but I couldn’t justify the investment of time and energy to continue past this to complete the more acceptable approach. In a way, this feels appropriate to me as it demonstrates why true change is so difficult to achieve in wider environmental terms. I guess the gap between the message and the mechanics here is not as wide as I initially thought.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown - PS4/XB1/PC - Open Fire (Launch Trailer)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HnU9v1IE1nw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ace Combat 7 will be available for PS4. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/18/ace-combat-7-review/">Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown review</a>, Dom said, “In Ace Combat 7 dogfighting games have a new Top Gun. The VR sadly turned my stomach, but the series’ trademark action is bigger and better than ever, with the spectacular weather effects introducing a level of realism and drama that will win over any wannabe Mavericks.”</p>
<h4>What are the PS Plus January 2026 Monthly Games?</h4>
<p>There were three games made available as the January monthly games and those are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Need For Speed Unbound (PS5)</li>
<li>Disney Epic Mickey Rebrushed (PS5/PS4)</li>
<li>Core Keeper (PS5/PS4)</li>
</ul>

            <guid>1418917</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Warframe</strong>, the free-to-play online action game developed by <strong>Digital Extremes</strong>, came up twice as I asked <strong>MMO</strong> industry veterans what the future of Western MMOs looked like. </p>



<p>Just yesterday, I <a href="https://wccftech.com/jack-emmert-returns-to-cryptic-studios-exclusive-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published an interview with <strong>Jack Emmert</strong></a>, who's returning as CEO of <strong>Cryptic Studios</strong> (he previously held the role from 2011 to 2015, when he left after 15 years at the company). As part of our conversation, I picked up his mind on the difficulties faced by Western developers looking to make a new game in the genre, and Emmert pointed out an example to follow: Warframe.  </p>



<p><em>It would be difficult for anybody to go to a Western publisher and ask for money to develop an MMORPG. The track record with Western publishers and MMORPGs is not very good for a lot of reasons. However, I think there's a lot of opportunity to launch a game that isn't necessarily an MMO at the start, but grows into something. A model like Warframe is a really good one; it is vastly bigger than it ever was when it first launched. That is a direction many games could go. A multiplayer story-based RPG could add an open-world component through an update or expansion. Instead of a hundred-million-dollar investment all upfront, you're making a series of $20 million bets so that at the end of five to seven years you have that big MMO, having paid for it and grown the community along the way.</em></p>



<p><em>I would not be surprised to see someone bootstrap a very small product, get some initial success, and continue to invest in it. Subnautica was like that, too. I think that's where you're going to see the new MMOs. To MMO fans, I'd say be patient; if you support a product and love it, just keep supporting it. It'll get there.</em></p>



<p>Anyone familiar with Warframe knows that the game that launched in March 2013 on PC was <strong>quite barebones</strong>. However, over time and with an ear constantly tuned to the community's feedback, Digital Extremes expertly introduced new content and features on a regular basis, <strong>making it one of the best examples of a live service game in the whole industry</strong> and securing an extremely loyal fanbase.</p>



<p>In 2026, Warframe <strong>is a whole different beast</strong>. It has a ton of content and activities to satisfy different playstyles, and it has also successfully expanded across all available platforms (the final one, Android, will get the game on February 18 <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-the-old-peace-gets-december-10-launch-date-android-cbt-live-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after a couple of months of Closed Beta testing</a>). Of course, someone could argue that Warframe is not quite an MMO in the traditional sense. Even so, the larger point holds: <strong>start with a solid 'minimum viable product' and build on it over time</strong>. The example is doubly fitting because Digital Extremes did everything on its own, developing and self-publishing the game, which is what a developer would have to do in the current absence of investments for MMO games.</p>



<p>Anyway, Emmert was not the only MMO veteran to point out Warframe to me when I inquired about the state of the genre in Western countries. <a href="https://wccftech.com/is-the-mmo-genre-dead-for-western-aaa-developers-we-asked-three-industry-veterans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In an interview I published last month</a>, <strong>Greg Street</strong> (former World of Warcraft and League of Legends designer) told me:</p>



<p><em>The basic problem is that it's hard to start small with an MMO. You have to commit to a lot of systems and content to make it work. There are some notable exceptions, like Warframe, which started small and grew into an MMO.</em></p>



<p>Street and Emmert know each other quite well, so it's possible they spoke about this before and found they shared the same viewpoint. Their insight is particularly interesting because they both bashed their heads against the problems faced when making a new MMO game in the West: their companies, <strong>Jackalyptic</strong> and <strong>Fantastic Pixel Castle</strong>, were working on two new MMO games, one based on Warhammer and another on a new fantasy IP. </p>



<p>In both cases, they were funded by NetEase, which, however, changed its mind a couple of years later and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-warhammer-mmo-is-also-canceled-netease-shuts-down-jackalyptic-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed both studios down</a>. This experience likely contributed to their conviction that <strong>a small game, like Warframe when it launched, can eventually become much larger</strong> and should serve as a model for future titles that do not have the budget to start big.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-remaster-release-date-february-2026/">After a second rumour</a> pointed to a current-gen <strong>PS5 version</strong> of <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</strong> coming from developer <strong>Warhorse Studios</strong> last month, the new version has been all but officially confirmed, with a <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP4062-CUSA07180_00-KCDGAME010000000"><strong>UK</strong> <strong>PlayStation Store </strong>listing</a> (spotted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gematsu.com/post/3mdiqkxbtl225">Gematsu</a>) describing the features this unofficially announced PS5 version would include, like the game getting a resolution boost to <strong>4K</strong>, an <strong>improved framerate</strong>, and more.</p>



<p>This new version of the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-remaster-early-2026/">first rumoured to be in the works back in October 2025</a>, before the aforementioned December 2025 rumour pointed to its imminent arrival, once again pointing to an early 2026 release, though last time the rumour went a step further to add that it would release sometime in <strong>February 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>The updated store page description doesn't include a hint as to when the new version will be available, or if this new version will be made available through a free update or if it'll be a paid upgrade. What it does include is confirmation that Warhorse has given the original release a good once-over, with updates to the graphics, framerate, and textures.</p>



<p>"<em>The PS5 version of Kingdom Come: Deliverance now features graphical updates including 4K resolution, improved framerate, high-resolution textures and many more. Medieval Bohemia has never been so beautiful</em>," the updated description reads.</p>







<p>Hopefully, this means we can expect a reveal from Warhorse Studios soon, and while there's no guarantee that this will be a free update, the fact that we're seeing this reveal come in the form of an updated PS Store listing is probably an indication that it's just a major update, and not a full remaster or a separate release. </p>

            <p>
Last week, Ubisoft announced a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">major restructure</a> that saw multiple games cancelled, including the Prince of Persia: The Sand of Time Remake, and more concerningly prospectively put <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">layoffs on the horizon</a>. Now, following an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">agreement made by a group of organised Ubisoft workers</a> across multiple French unions, a call for an international strike across all studios at the company has been put out.
</p>
<p>
The five unions in question consist of STJV, CGT, Printemps Ecologique, Solidaires Informatique, and CFE-CGC, who through the firstmost put out a statement regarding Ubisoft's recent actions. Namely, the five unions are calling for a "massive international strike by all Ubisoft employees" across the 10th, 11th, and 12th of February next month.
</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-cid="bafyreid3d2fbcx6pbmwso26wm7nmajt5hrrib2bbu3dmdac42ufefytl7q" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system" data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:drkl6rkntt57jub7gghhfjmb/app.bsky.feed.post/3mdiakqixmj2m"><div lang="en"><p>🇬🇧✊🌀 Ubisoft : enough is enough! Faced with the arbitrary decision of the CEO who doesn’t even dare talking to employees anymore, unions are calling for a strike on February 10th, 11th and 12th.</p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:drkl6rkntt57jub7gghhfjmb/post/3mdiakqixmj2m?ref_src=embed">[image or embed]</a></p></div>— Syndicat des Travailleureuses du Jeu Vidéo (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:drkl6rkntt57jub7gghhfjmb?ref_src=embed">@stjv.fr</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:drkl6rkntt57jub7gghhfjmb/post/3mdiakqixmj2m?ref_src=embed">January 28, 2026 at 12:10 PM</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>
This call to action comes in response not just to the recent structuring and prospective layoffs, but because of the return to mandatory in-office work. "These decisions are forcing us to act in order to protect those who keep this company alive," reads the statement. It goes on to note, "We are promised autonomy for Creative Houses, but what about the autonomy for employees? Five days of mandatory in-office work: we are treated like children who need to be supervised, while our management gets away with lies and breaking the law."
</p><p>
It's also worth noting that according to the statement, Ubisoft employees learned about the major restructure not through a private announcement, but at the same time as the public announcement, noting that "none of these changes had been discussed during the mandatory consultations with the works councils a few days earlier."
</p>
<p>
A half-day strike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-is-out-of-the-question-to-let-a-boss-run-rampant-ubisoft-workers-strike-against-disastrous-cutbacks">was held last week</a>, but this was only through Solidaires Informatique in France. According to Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/about-us">about section on their website</a>, the studio currently has roughly 17,000 employees, meaning if international workers take part in the strike, it could feature thousands of staff members across the world. Solidarity to all those involved.

    <p>When people talk glowingly about the heyday of social media being good, what they’re really talking about is riffing. Before Donald Trump became the president and screwed up all posting that isn’t about him, people would iterate on the most absurd joke possible. For the last few days, a handful of people have been riffing on the idea of YouTube thumbnails but from the point of view of babies, and it’s mostly been good. For posterity, it is worth remembering this riff.&nbsp;</p><p>The bit is a riff on something we have all seen a million times: horribly condescending YouTube thumbnails with bait text. The original post comes from an artist called </p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lmaonadestand.bsky.social?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Jamie</u></a>. The first meme, “why I’m switching..…” shows a contemplative baby examining a bead maze next to a “greater than” sign and some toy blocks. From there, the rest was history.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Credit: </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lmaonadestand.bsky.social/post/3md7egs5bus2l?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>@lmaonadestand.bsky.social</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>“At the end of the day it’s been fun to see people enjoying it, especially in a time where [every] headline online has been miserable,” Jamie told me. “If this silly thing was able to brighten people’s day at all then I’m happy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Scott Pilgrim is taking on the world, again, in March. Capcom leans into Leon’s “hot uncle” makeover. And an old Kickstarter for a tabletop game reveals the worst outcome possible. It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. Speaking of fan speculation and rumors, it’s never a good sign when the official franchise account <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/2016531108486095252">responds to you with a GIF from <em>Grand Theft Auto</em></a>. The <em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em> remake was reportedly delayed, but hopefully the <a href="https://x.com/yosp/status/2016446516236562657">next game from indie standout Red Candle Games</a> is coming along smoothly.</p> <h2><em>Scott Pilgrim EX</em> has a release date and a new trailer</h2>  <p>It’s out March 3 and will include League of Evil Exes’ Matthew Patel and Robot-01 as playable characters. This spiritual successor to the 2010 brawler is a bit more RPG-lite with non-linear quests and exploration, according to the devs at Tribute Games. They recently helped launch <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>, another excellent retro throwback with some neat tricks. Hopefully the team has put some cool surprises in <em>Scott Pilgrim EX</em> which, with today’s news, is now handily my most anticipated release of the winter.</p>

 <h2><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> fixes a bizarre DLC bug recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-framerate-dlc-2000660149">unearthed by a modder</a></h2> <p><a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-au/Ver.1.040.03.01.html">The new PC performance patch is out</a> and the notes include the following: “Fixed an issue where system load could increase around the Support Desk at Base Camp or the Grand Hub due to claimed content status checks.” Hopefully it brings the Steam version of the game more in line with the console version and turns things around in a meaningful way heading into the game’s one-year anniversary.</p> <h2><em>RuneScape</em> maker promises no genAI that players can “feel”</h2> <p>“We’ve got a pretty hard line stance with the team, which is a commitment that no generative AI will ever be present in any asset that a player can touch, hear or feel. There will be no generative AI in the game that they experience,” Jagex SVP of product James Dobrowski <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/runescape-maker-jagex-says-it-will-never-use-generative-ai-to-make-in-game-content">told <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em></a>. Tooling efficiency, which seemingly means coding, QA checks, and other process-oriented stuff, is another story.</p>

 <p>“Where we are open to the use of AI is in things like tooling efficiency; how do we make the way we work more efficient in order to make our staff’s lives easier and allow us to produce better content. But we do not want to be using AI to drive creativity,” he said.</p>

 <h2>Capcom talks about Leon’s “hot uncle” makeover</h2> <p>“We’ve spent quite a lot of time polishing Leon’s visuals,” <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> director Koshi Nakanishi <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiems-leon-kennedy-became-a-hot-uncle-thanks-to-hawk-eyed-female-capcom-staff-who-reviewed-even-the-finest-wrinkles-on-his-neck-director/">told <em>Automaton</em></a>. “Leon has many fans among Capcom employees, and women in particular were pretty strict when reviewing his design. They would point out and comment on even the finest details like the wrinkles on his neck. When I mentioned that story in the past, a female fan told me, The women developers at Capcom did a really good job&nbsp;(laughs).”</p> <h2><em>Arc Raiders</em> hit by DDoS attack ahead of next patch</h2> <p>Players who were recently having connection issues now know why. Community lead Julia Ossen told fans on the game’s Discord that the studio has been “under extensive, coordinated DDoS attacks” which the team is addressing. “The strike team has been working hard on mitigations and solutions to fix the problem, and we are making good progress,” she wrote. “But at this point in time the attacks are still ongoing.” The attack happened alongside the game’s new patch which <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qobyp9/here_we_go_slient_nerfs_not_mentioned_in_the/">includes some stealth nerfs</a>.</p>

 <h2>The<em> Darkest Dungeon</em> board game is dead</h2> <p>Over 28,000 backers&nbsp;pledged&nbsp;<span>$5,657,479</span> to help bring this project to life and no more shipments will be going out. “We put our trust in Mythic Games to deliver on their promises and uphold the <em>Darkest Dungeon</em> name,” Red Hook Games <a href="https://www.darkestdungeon.com/news/regarding-mythic-games-and-the-darkest-dungeon-board-game/">announced this week</a>. “We won’t mince words, their collapse and inability to fulfill Wave 2 orders is an enormously disappointing development and we know it deeply affects many <em>Darkest Dungeon</em> fans.” An ex-employee is providing the studio with the source files for all of Mythic’s work so players can make their own versions.</p> <h2>More indies are bailing on Xbox</h2> <p>Xbox versions of the stylish medieval combat game <em>1348 Ex Voto</em> and Nickelodeon’s<em> Splat Pack</em> have both been binned, <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/109896/two-indie-games-have-cancelled-their-xbox-versions/index.html"><em>TweakTown</em> reports</a>. “While we previously announced that the game would be released on Xbox consoles, we have the unfortunate news that this is no longer the case,” the developer behind 1348 Ex Voto <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G_RrTmoWMAACEkw?format=jpg&amp;name=medium">said this week</a>. “As release approaches for the indie team, priorities are constantly evaluated and sometimes must shift to deliver the best experience possible.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/walmart-leak-gamecube-games-switch-online-metroid-pikmin-2000663430">More Switch Online GameCube games leaked</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/mining-crystals-in-highguard-is-so-damn-satisfying-ps5-pc-steam-2000663527">Something <em>Highguard</em> gets right: mining crystals</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/batman-arkham-parody-perfectly-captures-the-horror-and-absurdity-of-living-in-gotham-2000663597">Living inside <em>Batman: Arkham</em> would be terrifying</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

As you might expect, a lot of people aren’t pleased about this, including an artist who works at GOG.</p> <p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2026/01/gog-now-using-ai-generated-images-on-their-store/">As first reported by <em>GamingOnLinux</em></a>, someone on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gog/comments/1qoigy5/ai_in_the_storefront/">Reddit spotted</a> what looks like AI-generated artwork being used to advertise an ongoing 2026 sale on GOG. The biggest giveaway that this art was generated using an AI tool or site is that a SNES-like console in the image seems to be melting. <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/5000_gog_patrons_and_an_ai_banner/page1">GOG users actually spotted this AI artwork last week</a> and began posting about it. For many, it was disappointing to see a company that <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">claims to care about preservation</a> and creators using AI to create a simple store banner.</p> <p>Likely in response to the hubbub surrounding the AI-generated banner, KosmicznaPluskwa, a GOG forums user who appears to be a graphic artist working at the company, <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/5000_gog_patrons_and_an_ai_banner?staff=yes">posted a lengthy response on the store’s forums on January 26.</a> And while KosmicznaPluskwa made it clear they aren’t a spokesperson for GOG, the artist confirmed that the image people were speculating was machine-created was indeed generated completely using AI tools, something that upset the artist.</p>

 <p>“OK, so to clear the air – current sale banner is fully AI. Not my work,” posted KosmicznaPluskwa. “This is all I can say on this. My team is much smaller now than it used to be, and the requirements for the role are completely different than it used to be.”</p> <p><em>Kotaku</em> contacted GOG about the art, but didn’t hear back before publication.</p> <p>KosmicznaPluskwa continued in their lengthy forum post and discussed how AI art is everywhere now and how it makes them sad to see.</p>

 <p>“It’s just miserable to think about how surrounded and how ever-present it all is now,” said KosmicznaPluskwa.</p> <p>“How will it affect us as the humanity. And no, I don’t think it will destroy art altogether but the omnipresence of it will not not go without its effect on us as a whole. Maybe it doesn’t matter some store put out sloppy work on promo banner – in the end everyone is just there to buy the product – but I know I enjoy seeing cool new artworks out there, when I’m out to buy new products as well. When I buy a new cool figure I like to keep the box around if it’s pretty – this is kind of the same, but on digital level. More cool art to see on top of buying art (video games in our case here) is always more cool art in the world and this is what I’m happy to have. So with everyone also feeling strongly in this thread – I’m with you. And continue speaking up – in the face of future we don’t like to see, complacency is not the way.”</p>

But after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/an-overlooked-disney-collection-from-digital-eclipse-has-been-rated-for-switch">an ESRB rating was spotted</a> recently, a listing has now appeared on <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000107124">the Japanese eShop</a> for both Switch 1 and Switch 2.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/disney-afternoon-collection-appears-on-switch-eshop-confirming-its-release-with-two-extra-snes-games/">VGC</a> spotted the listing earlier today and is listed for 2,300 yen (about 11 GBP, or 14 USD, so expect pricing to be a little higher in the West) on Switch 2, with a 10% pre-order discount and a release date of <strong>26th February 2026</strong>. At the time of writing, store pages have not gone up in other regions, but it's only a matter of time at this point.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067szhgup&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Looking at the key art and the game description (via Google Translate), 1993's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/goof_troop">Goof Troop</a> and 1994's <strong>Bonkers</strong> will also be part of the package. Neither of these games have been rereleased before, so that's pretty exciting!</p>
<p>Here's the full line-up of games in their NES or SNES versions for the Switch 1 &amp; 2 versions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bonkers (<strong>NEW</strong>)</li>

			<p><strong>PlayStation</strong> has revealed the <strong>four games</strong> that will be offered to <strong>PS Plus Essential</strong> and higher-tier subscribers for the month of February 2026. The games will be made available on <strong>February 3, 2026,</strong> with the boxing game <strong>Undisputed</strong> and survival game <strong>Subnautica: Below Zero</strong> headlining the monthly offerings after PlayStation kicked off the year with <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-january-2026-need-for-speed-unbound-epic-mickey-core-keeper/"><strong>Need for Speed Unbound</strong>, <strong>Epic Mickey Rebrushed,</strong> and <strong>Core Keeper</strong></a>. </p>



<p>The official announcement was shared <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/28/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-february-undisputed-subnautica-below-zero-ultros-ace-combat-7-skies-unknown/">on the PlayStation Blog</a>, as it usually is, and also, as usual, at least one of the coming games <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-essential-voici-le-titre-phare-de-la-selection-de-fevrier-2026-60911">had already leaked on Dealabs</a>, with Undisputed being the game to leak early this time. </p>



<p>Beyond Undisputed and Subnautica: Below Zero, the monthly offerings for February include two other standout titles: <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown/"><strong>Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</strong>,</a> which is arriving just in time for anyone who hasn't yet played it to prepare themselves for the arrival of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ace-combat-8-wings-of-theve-announced-2026-launch-multiplayer-modes/">Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve</a></strong>, and <strong>Ultros</strong>, the indie metroidvania from developer <strong>Hadoque</strong>, which sees players explore a twisting Sarcophagus.</p>

<p>With the above four titles set to arrive on February 3, that means you have until <strong>February 2, 2026,</strong> to add January's monthly PS Plus Essential games to your library, if you haven't already. If you're a PS Plus Extra or even Premium tier subscriber, then this is unfortunately another month where you're getting games that were already available to you in the Games Catalog, as Ultros entered the PS Plus Extra catalog when it launched back in February 2024.</p>



<p>At least PlayStation players at every tier of a PS Plus subscription and even those not subscribed to the service can <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026/">reportedly look forward to a new <strong>State of Play</strong> event, currently said to be happening sometime during the week of <strong>February 12, 2026</strong></a>, if it's not on the 12th itself.</p>
