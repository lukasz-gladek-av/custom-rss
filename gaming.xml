		<p>11 bit Studios has released a brand new trailer for the console version of Frostpunk 2, which shows how the development team has adapted the game for controller use. The console version of Frostpunk 2 will make use of radial menus for a lot of aspects of the game, including construction of the city, decision making, and exploration. The user interface has been designed so console players can easily navigate the menus and options that make up the gameplay of Frostpunk 2, and you can see it in action below.</p>

<p>Frostpunk 2 is set 30 years after the events of the original Frostpunk, taking players into the age of oil and all of the issues that come with that, both technological as your society moves on from coal and social strife that will divide the inhabitants.</p>
<p>We didn’t review Frostpunk 2 for its PC release, though will look to catch up on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/20/frostpunk-2-wins-polish-game-of-the-year-at-digital-dragons/">Polish Game of the Year</a>&nbsp;game when it hits consoles, but looking back at that original game, Jason wrote in our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/03/frostpunk-review/">Frostpunk review,</a>&nbsp;<em>“Frostpunk is a horrifyingly playable post-apocalyptic survival game that demands more out of you than most games ever could. Each decision and each sacrifice you make is hard on your city and on you. There are so many impossible choices and no win situations that the game is almost hard to play, but it’s so compelling that you will be unable to step away from it. The only real negative is the sheer overwhelming nature of the world the game is set in, and really that is more of a compliment to the designers than anything else.”</em></p>

<p>Frostpunk 2 will launch for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on 18th September,</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>There’s a large storm forming on the horizon. This October, around 40 games across all kinds of genres, franchises, and scales are set to launch on every major platform under the sun. There’s no escaping it. There are likely at least two games (or more!) in October that you’ll want to play, including stuff like <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-closed-weapon-system-better-beta-ea-bf6-2000618282"><em>Battlefield</em> 6</a> and <em>Moonlighter 2</em>. So batten down the hatches and get ready to ride out the video game super storm that is coming in just a few short months.</p> <p>Here’s the full list of planned October releases as of August 20:</p> <ul> <li><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> – October 2</li> <li><em>Gigasword</em> – October 2</li> <li><em>Neon Inferno</em> – October 2</li> <li><em>Borderlands 4</em> on Switch 2 – October 3</li> <li><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> – October 3</li> <li><em>Absolum</em> – October 9</li> <li><em>Barbie Horse Trails</em> – October 10</li> <li><em>Battlefield 6</em> – October 10</li> <li><em>Little Nightmares 3</em> – October 10</li> <li><em>Nascar 25</em> – October 14</li> <li><em>Just Dance 2026</em> – October 14</li> <li><em>Ball x Pit</em> – October 15</li> <li><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em> – October 16</li> <li><em>Keeper</em> – October 17</li> <li><em>The Elf on the Shelf: Christmas Heroes</em> – October 17</li> <li><em>Escape Simulator 2</em> – October 21</li> <li><em>Bloodlines 2</em> – Oct 21</li> <li><em>Jurassic World Evolution 3</em> – October 21</li> <li><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> – October 21</li> <li><em>Double Dragon Revive</em> – October 23</li> <li><em>Moonlighter 2</em> – Oct 23</li> <li><em>Plants Vs. Zombies: Replanted</em> – October 23</li> <li><em>The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles</em> – October 23</li> <li><em>Once Upon a Katamari</em> – October 24</li> <li><em>Ire: A Prologue</em> – October 28</li> <li><em>The Outer Worlds 2 – </em>October 29</li> <li><em>Arc Raiders – </em>October 30</li> <li><em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em> – October 31</li> </ul> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-2025-resident-evil-silent-hill-silksong-2000618460">On Tuesday, during Gamescom Opening Night Live,</a> I noticed a few games received October launch dates. I wondered to myself how many other games were arriving in that same month. Checking online, I discovered a giant list of October releases. This is one of the most jam-packed months I’ve seen in some time. It’s not just that a lot of games are arriving in a short window, but how varied the list is. We have big open-world AAA games, like <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> and, on Switch 2, <em>Borderlands 4.</em>&nbsp;But we also have smaller games like <em>Ball X Pit</em> and <em>Moonlighter 2</em>. There’s a park builder courtesy of <a href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-leak-october-ps5-baby-dinos-1851783878"><em>Jurassic World Evolution 3</em></a> and a massive online shooter in the form of <em>Battlefield 6.</em> New <em>Pokémon</em> and <em>Digimon</em> games, a fresh <em>Ninja Gaiden</em>, a big Obsidian RPG, a creepy horror game, vampires, and even a fucking Christmas game. Heck, the new Double Fine game, <em>Keeper</em>, is out in October, and I’ve been waiting years for that studio’s next project. Now it’s coming, but sandwiched between, like, six other games I want to play.</p> <p>What’s going on here? Well, some of this is just normal video game industry stuff. Studios want to get their games out before the holiday shopping season. But I bet some of these games were holding off until they knew what Rockstar was planning with <em>Grand Theft Auto 6.</em> And once it became clear October and November wouldn’t be dominated by <em>GTA 6, </em><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta6-grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026-1851778799#:~:text=Copied!&amp;text=Rockstar%20has%20announced%20that%20GTA,time%20to%20create%20the%20game.">as Rockstar delayed the open-world game to May 2026</a><em>,</em> some publishers and devs likely committed to launching in the spookiest month of the year.</p> <p>Sure, maybe a few of these get delayed, but I’m not holding my breath. October isn’t that far away, so I’d expect most of these games to be locked in and not budge to November or later. That’s a scary thought as someone who works at a video game website. While I’m excited to have new stuff to play and write about, I wish it were a bit more spread out. Such is life. Good luck out there, folks, and remember: You can’t play it all, so play what you can and enjoy the ride.</p>

In this charming fusion of fantasy adventure, not all heroes wield swords… Some prefer the spoon. And, sometimes to save the world you’ve got to start with a really good meal.</p><p>Palo Pori is a beautiful and peaceful village of artisans and tastemakers. Beyond the village’s protective wall, darkness has begun to stir. Ravenous monsters have claimed the land and threaten to sink their teeth into this final morsel of hope and happiness.</p><p>Play as Panko, a young, talented chef, helping to run the local eatery. When Panko’s teacher goes missing, a mysterious visitor arrives with warnings of the dangers beyond the wall. It’s up to Panko to step up and take over the restaurant and tend to the ingredients and patrons. But that’s not all, Panko also finds himself serving the Caretakers, brave adventurers, sent to save the world. In this adventure, preserving peace starts in the kitchen!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>From Town to Table</strong></p><p>In Palo Pori, fresh is best! Gather ingredients and resources, care for animals and grow your own fruit and veg to build up your very own cozy town to table restaurant. Forage for wild herbs and unlock new seeds to grow to expand your meals.</p><p><strong>Serving Your Community</strong></p><p>Chop, flip, and sizzle your way through mouthwatering mini-games as you whip up delightful dishes for the townsfolk. Good food is always better with company, so work hard to improve your <a title="Genres > Cooking [15 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">cooking</a> and experiment with ingredients, to keep your patrons happy.</p><p>Tailor your restaurant to the tastes of your community, develop new meals, progress your know how through a skill tree and adjust the decor to increase your restaurant’s appeal.</p><p><strong>Feed the Caretakers</strong></p><p>You’ll also need to feed the hungry Caretakers; these brave denizens of the land will venture out into the wilds to fight the ravenous monsters threatening the peace of Palo Pori. Each Caretaker hails from their own flavour region, affecting their own tastes and preferences: some like it bitter, some like it sweet and some are just looking to fulfil their craving of the day! Craft thoughtful meals and balance the flavour profiles to boost their spirits, sharpen their skills, and unlock new abilities. Because let’s face it… Who can save the world on an empty stomach?</p><p><strong>Delicious Deck Building</strong></p><p>Now it’s time to put your meal to the test! This is where taste meets tactics. The dishes you serve will build your Caretaker’s deck – each ingredient unlocking a card. And once they’ve eaten, they’ll venture into the wilds to fight the monsters. Upon their return, they’ll recount their journey and play out their battles through a charming puppet theatre sequence. They might even bring you back some MONSTEROUS ingredients from their ventures.

                <p>Multiplayer in Call of Duty games has become colorful over the last few years, as players have been able to dress up as their favorite celebrities and pop-culture icons before dropping into a match. Between WWE performers and I Know What You Did Last Summer's iconic slasher, there have also been original creations mixed in, and this has been met with a mixed reception by the playerbase. With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> on the way, Activision has spoken about how it's listening to fan feedback and how it will "calibrate" what it has to offer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-release-date-set-for-november-cod-next-coming-in-september/1100-6534015/">when the game launches in November</a>.</p><p>"We have thought about this, and I think if you look at us, we're always looking at community feedback," Black Ops 7 associate creative director Miles Leslie said to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-devs-paying-attention-to-community-feedback-on-goofy-skins" rel="nofollow ">IGN</a>. "We always try to make sure that we are trying to touch the widest audience. I've had the pleasure of working on Call of Duty now for almost 20 years, and we're constantly looking at ways to push into different audiences and fans, and that's what you saw with that; there are fans that really love it. Obviously, there are fans who those may not be their favorite. We're going to try to calibrate that as we move forward, and we take that feedback seriously."</p>

            <p>
El Presidentes assemble! Tropico 7 - the latest entry in Kalypso Media's Caribbean-set city building sim - is official and heading to Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, PC, and Game Pass next year.
</p>
<p>
The original Tropico debuted in 2001, melding elements of city building, resource management, and political wrangling that gave players the freedom to run their tropical island either as a feared dictator or peace-loving statesman. The series has changed hands multiple times since then, with developer Limbic Entertainment taking the reins for 2019's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tropico-6">Tropico 6</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for the newly revealed Tropico 7, it's being helmed by Gaming Minds Studios (Port Royale 4, Railway Empire 2) and features a new story campaign playing out across 5 maps. That's alongside 20 additional sandbox maps, a random map generator, and 10 extra scenarios. There's also talk of new terraforming tools, a new council feature serving as a focal point for your political machinations, a new nemesis in Victoria Guerra, and more.

		<p>Sony has announced that it will be raising the prices of the PlayStation 5 consoles in the US. While Sony does not give the reasons why, it is likely to do with the the tariffs that the US Government has brought in over the past several months, which has caused prices to rise across various goods for consumers in the country. The full statement from Sony is as follows.</p>
<p><em>Similar to many global businesses, we continue to navigate a challenging economic environment. As a result, we’ve made the difficult decision to increase the recommended retail price for PlayStation 5 consoles in the U.S. starting on August 21.</em></p>


<p><em>The updated recommended retail price for PlayStation 5 consoles in the U.S. are as follows:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>PlayStation 5 – $549.99</em></li>
<li><em>PlayStation 5 Digital Edition – $499.99</em></li>
<li><em>PlayStation 5 Pro – $749.99</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The recommended retail prices for PlayStation 5 accessories remain unchanged, and we have no other price changes to announce for additional markets.</em></p>

<p>As stated the price rises come in tomorrow, August 21st so if you are in the US and were waiting to get a PS5 now is probably the best time to get your order in.</p>

It's been a staple in <strong>Mario</strong> games for a long time, so it's pretty natural to assume things would be similar here. Except it isn't, but the change actually makes a lot of sense here. And we have one Shigeru Miyamoto to thank for that.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.ndw.jp/dkbananza-interview-250820/">Nintendo Dream</a> (translated by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social/post/3lwthqxjaqk2c">Nintendo Patents Watch on Blusesky</a>), the game's director, Kazuya Takahashi, revealed that Miyamoto was the one who suggested that 'B' should be Dig, not Jump.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4nthupl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Acknowledging that B has historically been the jump button in many Nintendo platformers, Takahashi said "Miyamoto-san pointed out to me, <em>“'for digging downward, wouldn’t the B button be more intuitive?'</em>" And, given that the B button is the bottom face button... yeah, that makes sense.</p>

<p>Seems like Takahashi agrees, too — "When I actually tried it, this key mapping indeed felt more intuitive. So that was Miyamoto-san’s suggestion." Well, there you go then.</p>
<p>Of course, for those traditionalists who can't get over the B button not being jump, there's the option to assign Jump to the B button. All's right with the world, then.</p>
<p>There are some other fun tidbits in the interview, like how long the team spent balancing the sound of DK's footprints with the sound of destruction. It's worth checking out the whole piece for a real deep dive into DK's latest outing.</p>
<p><em>Are you still enjoying Donkey Kong Bananza? Have you swapped the Jump and Dig buttons around? Let us know in the usual spot.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ps5-ps5-pro-price-increases-us-tomorrow/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-ps5-and-ps5-pro-is-getting-a-50-price-increase-in-the-us-starting-tomorrow.1275807/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Amidst all the craze of <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a>, PlayStation has slipped in the news that the PS5 and PS5 Pro are going up in price in the US starting tomorrow, August 21, 2025, following price increases in <a href="https://wccftech.com/major-ps5-price-increase/">Canada</a> three years ago and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">in Europe and the UK and other regions in the world this past April</a>.</p>



<p>Basically, the price of the consoles is going up $50 across the board.</p>



<ul>
<li>PS5 (with disc drive) - was $499.99, will be <strong>$549.99</strong></li>



<li>PS5 (without disc drive) - was $449.99, will be <strong>$499.99</strong></li>



<li>PS5 Pro - was $699.99, will be <strong>$749.99</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Sony's chief financial officer, Lin Tao, confirmed this past May that the company was looking at a <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-is-considering-a-ps5-price-increase-in-the-us-in-response-to-tariffs/">price increase in the US as part of Sony and PlayStation's response to US tariffs</a>, and today that increase was revealed, though Sony doesn't come out and directly blame the increase on tariffs.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/playstation-5-price-changes-in-the-u-s/">PlayStation Blog post</a>, the vice president of global marketing at Sony, Isabelle Tomatis, writes that the increase is happening as a result of Sony's journey to "<em>continue to navigate a challenging economic environment.</em>"</p>



<p>Pricing around official PlayStation accessories "<em>remain unchanged</em>" for now, and it seems like, at least for the near future, PlayStation fans around the globe don't have to worry about price increases in their regions, as Tomatis writes, "<em>we have no other price changes to announce for additional markets.</em>"</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sword of the Sea is a spirited celebration of movement and the sea]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/762217/sword-of-the-sea-review-ps5-steam</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sword-of-the-sea-is-a-spirited-celebration-of-movement-and-the-sea.1275804/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There’s a persistent belief that in order for sharks to breathe underwater, they must keep on swimming. While this is partly true for a few species, the myth likely stems from how certain types of fishes (bony fish, if you want to know) need to breathe through constant motion, inhaling and pushing a huge amount of water through their gills as they swim. As the misconception goes, for sharks, much like their aquatic peers, to cease movement is to spell certain death — which is exactly how it feels playing <em>Sword of the Sea</em>.</p><p>The new game from Giant Squid scales this idea up by orchestrating movement into a grandiose, stirring symphony. Similar to the studio’s previous work — the underwater adventure <em>Abzû </em>— <em>Sword of the Sea</em> is an eco-fantasy about restoring the sea and its ecosystem in an arid landscape. Perched atop a sword, you surf across shifting dunes, leap toward dilapidated structures swallowed by sand, and unearth remnants of an ancient civilization that met its end in an unknown catastrophe.</p><p>The melody lifts as you backflip and perform ollies through this mural, with the music eventually soaring as you revitalize the landscape. You flit through the undulating contours of the seascape, the shoals now humming with new life. You spin in elegant arcs with the sea creatures that emerge, vaulting among the schools of fishes that make their unceasing journey toward the sky.</p><p>The seamless fluidity of movement in <em>Sword of the Sea</em> is deeply mesmerising. As a figure known only as the Wraith, you skate and flow through dunes and waves in search of ways to repopulate the barren desert with aquatic life. This can be done by completing simple puzzles, such as plunging your sword into craters or lighting up clusters of lanterns, which are typically found on higher grounds that you’ll need to perform acrobatic stunts to reach. That’s when emerald water and lush green grass will burst forth from these craters, with scores of fishes crashing through the dunes and floating jellyfish materializing with a pop, offering you access to previously unreachable heights.</p><p>Gliding through the freshly revitalized lands is even more exhilarating. Subsequent chapters include more ways to boost your movement to a thrilling degree, such as beacons for gliding across and glowing orbs you can collect to ramp up your speed.</p><p>Despite this focus on speed, the game doesn’t rush you to move on, even after restoring an area. Spending a few minutes nailing heel flips off the crests and troughs of the waves, and reveling in motion amid dense schools of fishes, is tantalizing. At the same time, you can seek and collect trinkets used to unlock new skateboarding tricks, like a double jump or kick flip. These are moves that you can string together — and put to the test — through optional timed puzzles.</p><p>This affinity the game has for kinetics, however, never supplants the sense of reverence it holds for the sea. The sea life isn’t just a resource or a means to a utilitarian end; you don’t simply hop on and steer the local fauna, such as orcas and turtles, toward the highest peaks or your next destination, although you can ride on them to enjoy a leisurely swim underwater. Other sea creatures, such as a dolphin and a shark, appear mythical and godlike, and you can later enlist their help in your expedition to traverse even greater distances. Sailing through the choppy waters with the aid of these majestic beings is particularly enchanting, as they jump over crumbling buildings and careen into towering crystals — feats you’ll never manage on your own.</p><p>These moments are accentuated by bright, cel-shaded aesthetics, which makes the ocean appear almost celestial and otherworldly. There’s also a symbiotic relationship between the Wraith and the sea life they’ve helped rehabilitate. Glowing algae, nesting at the edges of once-buried rooftops, helps you to jump higher, while tapestries of giant seaweeds allow you to float upstream, making your travel much more seamless. It’s a necessary reminder of how humanity plays a pivotal role in conservation efforts, and that we, in turn, can only benefit from the ocean’s well-being.</p><p><em>Sword of the Sea</em> ratchets up the tension in its final chapters, leading to a climatic sequence that involves vanquishing the source of its calamity with breathtaking grace. It’s a fitting finale, but it also doesn’t mark the end. Instead, the game extends an invitation to redo your run again from the beginning, this time armed with a speedometer and a proposal to shave off more minutes, or even seconds, off your own record. It wants you to skate faster, jump higher, and plunge harder into the sea.</p><p>Not only is <em>Sword of the Sea</em> a celebration of the ocean, its love for unrestrained motion is also a metaphor for — and an homage to — the sheer vibrancy of underwater life. It’s an adventure I dove right into again, my skateboard surging with the pulse of the sea.</p><p><sub>Sword of the Sea <em>is available now on the PS5, Steam, and Epic Games Store.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTI4Mg=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Khee Hoon Chan</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/762217/sword-of-the-sea-review-ps5-steam]]></content:encoded>

<p>NBA 2K26 launches on August 29 for those who purchase the Superstar or Leave No Doubt Edition of the game, and 2K Sports has given players its first look at what to expect from the game’s MyCareer mode.</p>



<p>In a new trailer for the mode released on Wednesday, NBA 2K26’s career mode is dubbed “Out of Bounds”. In the mode, players start as a hopeful playing in Vermont who then has to make various decisions to achieve the dream of making it to the NBA.</p>



<p>The trailer, which is narrated by Spike Lee—who also lends his voice to the mode throughout—, focuses more on the story and the cinematics than the actual games or how it integrates into The City.</p>



<p>You can check out the trailer for yourself below. More details on NBA 2K26’s MyCareer are expected to be revealed in the coming days ahead of the game’s launch.</p>



<p>NBA 2K26 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nba-2k26-reveal-schedule-released-starting-with-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be available</a> on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch 1 &amp; 2, and PC. Those looking for Gen 9 features of the game can get it on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2, and PC.</p>

<p>Sony has announced that it is raising the price of the PlayStation 5 (PS5) in the United States.</p>



<p>Starting on August 21, the price of the base PS5 will rise to $549.99, the PS5 Digital Edition will jump to $499.99, and the PS5 Pro will cost $749.99. All increases are $50 from their previous prices.</p>



<p><strong>“Similar to many global businesses, we continue to navigate a challenging economic environment,” </strong><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/playstation-5-price-changes-in-the-u-s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sony said</a>. <strong>“As a result, we’ve made the difficult decision to increase the recommended retail price for PlayStation 5 consoles in the U.S. starting on August 21.”</strong></p>



<p>Sony’s move follows price increases of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-to-increase-ps5-price-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">platform in different regions</a> already. It also follows the decisions <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-is-raising-the-price-for-all-xbox-series-consoles-accessories-and-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-to-raise-switch-prices-in-the-united-states/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo to raise</a> the price of their hardware in recent months. </p>



<p><strong>“The recommended retail prices for PlayStation 5 accessories remain unchanged, and we have no other price changes to announce for additional markets,” </strong>Sony added.</p>

The story takes place in a land called Ardemia, a magical world threatened by a returning evil. It can only be saved by uniting the Sword of the Shrine and the eight elements of magic scattered across the world.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/19/3-1755628114233.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You play as two young heroes, Rio and Reima. Rio is heir to the Sword and a descendant of the last hero to banish the ancient evil, while Reima is a mage who’s been desperately seeking the Sword. The two are brought together by the rise of this evil and will go on a journey to find the eight elements before it’s too late.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That journey will take you across an expansive world full of dungeons to explore, puzzles to solve, and secrets to discover. Investigate its nooks and crannies to find crafting materials and magical jewels, and face down treasure-guarding bosses to earn stat-increasing items and learn powerful spells. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/19/2-1755628162405.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a character-focused tale, one that will force its two heroes to deal with pain, tragedy, and loss. Vanquishing an ancient evil isn’t possible without sacrifice, and we won’t go into spoilers here, but you’ll find out just how much Rio and Reima are willing to lose to successfully complete their quest. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can play all of Shrine’s Legacy either solo or in two-player co-op. As you could probably guess from their descriptions, Rio is a melee fighter and Reima is a ranged magic user. If you play solo, you can swap between them at any time, with AI controlling whichever character you’re not actively playing. For co-op, you can go the old-fashioned way and play with a friend on the couch or pair up online via Steam Remote Play Together or Parsec.

In <em>Tropico 7</em>, you step into his shiny boots again to build your archipelago nation and—literally—move mountains.</p><p>With great power comes great responsibility – and even greater opportunity. As the most benevolent leader of your island nation, guide your loyal citizens (and your Swiss Bank Account) through the ages toward untold prosperity. Remember: Control isn’t tyranny, it’s efficiency – and more control means more efficiency (except when Penultimo is involved, but that’s another story).</p><p>Exert your control and shape the landscape you are building on to fit your vision. Plan and construct complex city layouts, fulfil the multifaceted needs of your subjects, give precise directions to your army, and look down on your opponents in the council, all while revelling in your own splendor. See how it all leads to ever greater efficiency? This could be an aspiring dictator’s dream come true indeed… however, sometimes life gives you lemons. Or obstacles in the shape of a very clever and very annoying opponent: Victoria Guerra! You will need all your skills, cunning and presidential ‘grandeur’ to end this latest chapter with a simple truth: ¡Victoria no es la revolucion!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Lead your nation to new heights: <em>Tropico 7</em> tells El Presidente’s continuous success story across five ampaign maps—starring himself, Penultimo and a new nemesis: Victoria Guerra.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>More is More</strong> – Archipelagos, with the biggest islands ever in the series, await your rule, expanded with 10 extra scenarios, more than 20 sandbox maps, and endless possibilities with a random map generator.</li><li><strong>Move Mountains—Literally</strong> – Erase them, create beaches, or even create entirely new islands! The new terraforming feature brings your megalomaniac dreams to life. Start that mammoth project – NOW!</li><li><strong>Bollocks Uhm… Politics</strong> – Navigate the snares and pits of internal politics, when you summon the different factions to your council, a new way to meet them face to face while you pulverize their dreams – or use them for a BIG DEAL to your own advantage.</li><li><strong>Make the World Your Playground</strong> – Elections, election speeches and a vast portfolio of edicts depending on your political standing spice up your daily rule while you juggle foreign affairs and occasionally steal… uhm relocate a landmark to revel in its benefits.</li><li><strong>Built to Prosper</strong> – Strategically place buildings to make use of synergy effects, keep citizen satisfaction high, and fill any unused plots of land with beautiful parks in a freely customized size.</li><li><strong>Generalissimo No. 1</strong> – Eliminate those pesky rebels and fend off foreign threats with a reworked military system enabling more direct control of your military units.</li><li><strong>Always Judge a Book by Its Cover</strong> – Customize the appearance of your palace and El Presidente with new and creative options.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Tropico 7 | Announcement Trailer | US" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V9ZrwBfbALU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/tropico-7-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-pc]]></content:encoded>

Xbox provided the latter today, announcing that its upcoming handheld line, the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X, will hit store shelves on October 16, just two months from now.</p><p>However, while the release date is clear, we don't yet know how much either product will cost.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-still-cant-say-how-much-the-rog-xbox-ally-x-will-cost-due-to-macro-economic-conditions-despite-announcing-release-date-and-availability-details">In a roundtable interview with IGN</a>, Asus senior vice president Shawn Yen said, "I think we will have to... we need more time to figure the macro-economic impact to pricing, and that's why we'll be sharing more later, in September and October." Because the prices aren't yet live, neither are pre-orders.</p>

<p>The handheld is made in partnership with Asus, a company that has been producing the ROG Ally handheld for a few years now. The cheaper models currently retail for around $500 USD, so it's likely that a partnership between Asus and Xbox would go for around that amount or higher.</p><p>Xbox's release date announcement also detailed some of the handheld's new features, including a handheld compatibility program, which helps to indicate which games are best suited for handheld play, similar to the Steam Deck's verification program. On Xbox, games will either be "Handheld Optimized" or "Mostly Compatible," with the latter requiring "minor in-game setting changes for an optimal experience on handheld." There's also a "Windows Performance Fit" rating to judge how well the game will run on your device.</p><p>Stay tuned to our Game Informer coverage to see our hands-on impressions with these devices.

            <p>Sony has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/playstation-5-price-changes-in-the-u-s/">announced</a> that it is raising the price of the PS5 in the US. The price increase of $50 affects all PS5 models and will come into effect from 21st August.</p>
<blockquote><p>Similar to many global businesses, we continue to navigate a challenging economic environment. As a result, we’ve made the difficult decision to increase the recommended retail price for PlayStation 5 consoles in the U.S. starting on August 21.</p>
<p>The updated recommended retail price for PlayStation 5 consoles in the U.S. are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>PlayStation 5 – $549.99</li>
<li>PlayStation 5 Digital Edition – $499.99</li>
<li>PlayStation 5 Pro – $749.99</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Sony stated that its prices for PS54 accessories are unchanged, and that there are no price changes to announce for additional markets.</p>
<p>The PS5 has already seen price rises in other markets, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-raises-ps5-price-yet-again-in-uk-and-mainland-europe">UK getting its own hike back in April</a> this year. Australia and New Zealand also got the news back then that they'd have to pay more to own a PS5.</p>

		<p>Square Enix has released a new Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles gameplay trailer that gives a look at what to expect in this new release of the game.

<p>What a surprise!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>As a part of today's Xbox Gamescom showcase, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dead_cells">Dead Cells</a> dev Evil Empire finally lifted the lid on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a>, revealing that it will be coming to Switch and Switch 2 "later this year".</p>
<p>While every other platform landed the full release of this Prince of Persia roguelike today, we're pleased to see it finally confirmed for Switch. We've had this one on our radar since it was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/04/prince-of-persia-roguelite-from-dead-cells-dev-revealed-switch-not-confirmed">first revealed</a> early last year, and have been following it throughout its early access period ever since. A surprise <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/dead-cells-devs-prince-of-persia-roguelike-has-been-rated-for-switch">Switch age rating</a> for the game popped up earlier this summer, but today's showcase if the first <em>official</em> confirmation that it will be coming our way.</p>
<p>If this is the first you've heard of this one, The Rogue Prince of Persia is a super stylish-looking roguelike, that is all about movement and combat. It packs in a bunch of familiar moves you'll likely recognise from the iconic Ubisoft series (hello, wall running), and shapes it into the 'one more run' format that Evil Empire so brilliantly hit upon in the past with Dead Cells' post-launch content.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of a game's key features and a handful of screenshots from its Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Become the Prince of Persia</strong><br>
Flow seamlessly between platforming and combat, using your acrobatic skill to outmaneuver and outsmart your enemies. Run on the walls to open new routes of attack, avoid traps and explore hard to reach areas, or chain it with kicks, dodges and stomps to fight through swathes of enemies without a scratch.</p>
<p><strong>Save your People</strong><br>
Awakening in an Oasis outside the capital after a furious battle with magic-wielding invaders, you rush to the city to stop the brutal invasion. When you die, your mysterious bola returns you back in time to the Oasis, ready to throw yourself into the fray again and again. Discover new areas, characters and knowledge through non-linear storytelling as you strive to find a way to save Persia.</p>
<p><strong>Choose your Playstyle</strong><br>
Switch between a wide variety of deadly weapons during each run and equip &amp; upgrade medallions to enhance both them and your moveset, unleashing devastating synergies. Change your loadout mid-run to adapt to new challenges or stick with your favourites – the choice is yours!</p>
<p><strong>No Two Runs are the Same</strong><br>
New weapons, medallions, difficulty modifiers &amp; more are unlocked with each run, so there’s always something new to explore. Every level is also procedurally generated - renewing the challenge with each foray into the city.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We'll be keeping an eye out for more information on the Switch and Switch 2 release in the coming months, but let's hope that we don't have to wait too long.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Rogue Prince of Persia, developed by Evil Empire and published by Ubisoft, has surprise-launched on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles today during Gamescom 2025, with a Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 launch to come sometime later this year.</p>



<p>It's also dropped on Xbox Game Pass, so players who have a Game Pass subscription and have yet to check out the game since its Early Access launch last year can jump into the action without making an extra purchase.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Launch Trailer - The Rogue Prince of Persia" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YdJJbvwrAsI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The news was unveiled during Xbox's Gamescom 2025 live stream, and though it is still technically a shadow-drop, it's not that much of a surprise since Ubisoft previously revealed an <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-reveals-release-date-for-anno-117-pax-romana-a-1-0-release-window-for-the-rogue-prince-of-persia-and-showcases-a-new-game-morbid-metal-at-sgf-2025/">"<em>August 2025</em>" launch window for the game's 1.0 version this past June</a>.</p>



<p>The game has come a long way since its early access launch in May 2024, but even at that launch, it already looked like an impressive 2D action game that fans of the roguelite genre wouldn't want to miss. This, again, isn't all that surprising considering it was developed by the same team that worked on Dead Cells.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-early-access-review-the-year-of-the-prince/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo reviewed the early access version</a> of The Rogue Prince of Persia last May, he wrote "<em>Even in its early state, The Rogue Prince of Persia masterfully blends the best of Prince of Persia and Dead Cells in a solid package offering a more involved narrative, excellent platforming, dynamic combat and a lot of death, as is tradition for a proper roguelite."</em></p>

            <p>This week, dozens of Microsoft employees occupied the company's east campus in Redmond, Washington in protest against the use of Azure and generative AI technologies by the Israeli military, during their on-going assault on Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. </p><!--more-->
<p>This follows an announcement from Microsoft that they would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/15/microsoft-launches-inquiry-claims-israel-used-tech-mass-surveillance-palestinians">commission another "external" inquiry</a> into their business relationship with Israel's armed forces, after the Guardian and other papers reported on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-equipped-israels-indiscriminate-palestinian-surveillance-operation-with-azure-cloud-tech-claims-report">an alleged collaboration with one particular intelligence division, Unit 8200</a>, that has seen Israel gather data from phones and store it on Microsoft servers overseas.</p>
<p>Amongst other things, the surveillance data is reportedly being used to target airstrikes in the course of an invasion of Gaza that has claimed the lives of tens of thousands, the majority of them civilians. Microsoft declined to comment on the recent Guardian allegations concerning Unit 8200 when approached by RPS, but have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-confirm-theyve-supplied-ai-tech-to-the-israeli-military-for-use-in-gaza-following-bds-xbox-boycott">previously insisted</a> that their own internal reporting has found "no evidence to date that Microsoft’s Azure and AI technologies have been used to target or harm people in the conflict in Gaza."
</p>
<p>The protest at Microsoft's campus was brief. According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/19/microsoft-workers-protest-washington-israel">the Guardian</a>, current and former staff declared one area a 'Free Zone', and occupied it with placards that read "Join The Worker Intifada - No Labor for Genocide" and "Martyred Palestinian Children's Plaza".</p><p>The protestors have also published <a href="https://noazureforapartheid.com/worker-intifada/">a call to action online</a>, which reads: "the Liberated Zone is born out of radical love for the rich humanity of Palestinian people. Today, we answer Gaza's call to action to mobilize, confront, and escalate to force an end to this genocide powered by Microsoft technology." The protestors were dispersed by police after around two hours, under threat of arrest for trespassing.
</p>
<p>Israel's current attack on Gaza is a response to a Hamas-led militant strike across the border that killed over a thousand people in October 2023. Most of the dead were civilians, with hundreds of others taken hostage.</p>
<p>In amongst ceasefire negotiations with Hamas, Israel's government now <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c7417pl3ddpo">aim to take control of Gaza City</a> after levelling much of the territory and forcibly displacing millions of people, many of whom now <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/08/israel-opt-new-testimonies-provide-compelling-evidence-that-israels-starvation-of-palestinians-in-gaza-is-a-deliberate-policy/">face starvation thanks to Israel's obstruction of aid</a>. All this follows decades of brutal occupation of Palestinian territories, in what a former head of Israel's own intelligence agency has described as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/06/israel-imposing-apartheid-on-palestinians-says-former-mossad-chief">"an apartheid state"</a>.
</p>
<p>Microsoft employees have grown outspoken about the company's subsequent dealings with Israel, as the invasion of Gaza has worn on. Among those demonstrating at Microsoft's east campus this week was Hossam Nasr - one of two former employees <a href="https://mondoweiss.net/2025/05/meet-the-fired-microsoft-employees-challenging-the-companys-complicity-in-the-gaza-genocide/">fired in October 2024</a> for organising a vigil for massacred Palestinians. He and the other fired tech worker, Abdo Mohamed, are part of activist group No Azure For Apartheid, which has called on Microsoft to divest from Israel in a <a href="https://noazureforapartheid.com/petition/">petition signed by hundreds of staff</a>, including members of the Xbox division and subsidiary companies Activision, Bethesda Softworks and Mojang. 
</p><p>Last week, unionised members of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> developers Arkane Studios also <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/arkane-studios-union-publishes-open-letter-to-microsoft-demanding-a-stop-to-israeli-support">threw their weight behind</a> a recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions call</a> for consumers to stop buying Microsoft gaming and Xbox products. "We think that Microsoft has no place being [an] accomplice of a genocide," the Arkane union wrote in an open letter, "and as Microsoft employees, we don't want to be part of this sinister project for Gaza."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> might not be the only massive sci-fi RPG on Switch 2 for long. Could <em>Starfield</em> get ported as well? Why is <em>Dead Space</em>‘s old Creative Director all-in on AI? And How did an AI replica of a real content creator make its way onto the official <em>First Descendent</em> TikTok channel? Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint,<em> Kotaku</em>‘s brief daily roundup of gaming culture and news, where we’re doing a bunch of clean-up from the first day of Gamescom 2025.</p>  <p>Podcaster NateTheHate, who’s quickly developed a reputation for accurate leaks around upcoming Nintendo announcements, now claims Bethesda’s open-world sci-fi RPG is coming to the company’s handheld hybrid next year. “<em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> won’t be the only Bethesda game coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026,” he <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1957886310896796027">posted on X</a> yesterday. “See that planet? You can go there. Aside from landing on PS5…<em>Starfield</em> is planned for release on Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026.” FromSoftware’s <em>The Duskbloods</em> has also been confirmed for Switch 2 in 2026, and Nintendo has yet to reveal any of its expected slate for the console’s second year. <em>Starfield</em> is reportedly coming to PS5 next year as well, <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-ps5-second-expansion-shattered-space-date-2000614380">seemingly closer to whenever the second expansion launches</a>.</p> <h2><em>The First Descendent</em> blames TikTok for AI slop video</h2> <p>Nexon’s free-to-play loot shooter, also known as “Gooner <em>Destiny</em>,” <a href="https://kotaku.com/ai-ads-tiktok-the-first-descendant-nexon-2000618182">accidentally shared an AI-generated ad on TikTok</a> that ripped off another content creator. <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/news/3100882">The publisher now says</a> a TikTok marketing program automatically solicited the ad and linked it to <em>The First Descendants’</em> account with no controls to verify copyright infringement or other content concerns. Sounds bad! “<span lang="EN-US">We will also be committed to continuously being more transparent and responsible to regain the trust of our community and creators,” the company writes. “</span><span lang="EN-US">Once again, we deeply apologize for the disappointment and inconvenience this incident has caused.”</span></p>

 <h2><em>Final Fantasy 14</em> could be coming to Switch 2</h2> <p>Director Naoki Yoshida <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/yoshi-p-reveals-positive-discussions-over-nintendo-switch-2-final-fantasy-14-port/">told <em>VGC</em></a> at Gamescom that Square Enix is in talks with Nintendo about porting the hit MMORPG over. “The discussions have been positive, so I do hope that players will look forward to hopefully good news in the future,” he said. It sounds like <em>Final Fantasy 16</em> isn’t out of the question either. Yoshida added, “For me, it’s just my aim to provide <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> and <em>16</em> to as many players as possible, and I hope that as many players as possible will be able to enjoy those two games.”</p> <h2>The director of <em>Callisto Protocol</em> is going all-in on AI</h2> <p>Glen Schofield <a href="http://AI is going to be fantastic">told<em> The Game Industry</em></a> “AI is going to be fantastic.” He said he’s holding seminars about how AI can make creatives more efficient and thinks the technology will be an inevitable part of game development in 5-10 years, but he’s not sure exactly how it will all shake out. “Is it going to be an engine?” he said. “Right now, it’s a whole bunch of things that just kind of suck it in… and into what? It’s going to have to settle down a bit before we actually use it.” Schofield also claimed<em> Callisto Protocol</em> sold over 5 million copies, but regretted not delaying it. He said AAA games are not dead and is looking for someone to pay him to make another.</p> <h2><em>High on Life 2</em> gets a release date</h2> <p>The sci-fi comedy shooter <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/20/high-on-life-2-demo-hands-on-preview-gamescom/">will arrive</a> on PC and console, including on Game Pass, on February 13, 2026.

<p>The Valve Fremont, which is the long-rumored console running SteamOS, has appeared on popular benchmarking platform Geekbench. The appearance comes as rumors of Valve’s return to Steam consoles continue to swirl.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/13390426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Geekbench listings</a>, the Valve Fremont features a six core/12 thread processor running at 3.2 GHz base frequency. The device tested also has 8GB of DDR5 memory. </p>



<p>It should be noted, however, that just because it appears on Geekbench, it doesn’t mean the specs are 100% locked in. There could be various changes between when the testing appears and when something becomes official or is released. One example is that on the benchmark, it mentions running Windows 11 Pro. The final device would likely have the SteamOS Linux-based operating system.</p>

<h2 id="h-a-long-time-coming">A Long Time Coming?</h2>



<p>Rumors of a new Steam console from Valve have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumors-pointing-to-a-new-steam-console-from-valve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been circulating for months</a>, known Valve insider Brad Lynch has talked about the device for a while, and added some more context after it showed up on Geekbench.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1958024995273068544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According to Lynch</a>, Valve Fremont is a “TV focused PC box/console running SteamOS” that “has [a] dedicated HDMI port.” He addes that it’s a semi-custom CPU based on Hawk Point 2 with the integrated GPU removed. </p>



<p>Lastly, speaking of the GPU, it has a dedicated AMD RX 7600 that will all fit in a custom Valve case.</p>



<p>When it launches, the Valve Fremont is expected, according to Lynch, to release alongside the new “Ibex” controller, “Deckard” VR headset, and it’s “Roy” controllers.</p>



<p>Valve has yet to confirm the existence of the Fremont console. But with official benchmarks appearing online, it could be only a matter of time before things become official.</p>
