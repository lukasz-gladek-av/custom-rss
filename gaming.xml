			<p>The popular Lossless Scaling software surprised everyone earlier in 2024 by <a href="https://wccftech.com/lossless-scaling-adds-universal-frame-generation-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adding</a> frame generation support with any graphics card in any PC game (with certain limitations).</p>
<p>The developer of Lossless Scaling continuously improved the frame generation component via a series of updates. FG 2.0 vastly reduced artifacts; FG 2.1 brought the performance boost from 2x to 3x; and now, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/lossless-scaling-frame-generation-4x-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a>, Lossless Scaling FG 2.3 quadruples the base frame rate. The latest version of the software was just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/993090/view/4324104099036055973?snr=1_5_9_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> on Steam, and the changelog can be found below (it also adds initial support for NVIDIA G-Sync).</p>
<ul>
<li><em>LSFG 2.3 introduces X4 frame generation mode, generating three intermediate frames. The recommended usage scenario starts with the game's base framerate of 60 frames and for monitors with a high refresh rate of 240 and above, but can also be used with lower framerates (where the base mode is expected to give better results compared to "performance").</em></li>
<li><em>X3 mode has been updated to further reduce artifacts on patterned textures and in dark scenes.</em></li>
<li><em>Increased UI detection rate from every 4th frame to 1 for "performance" mode, as it was found that this could cause some artifacts. This led to a slight decrease in performance, so this parameter can now be changed in the config.ini file located in the installation folder.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Initial support for G-Sync. It is recommended to enable it for full screen mode in the driver settings.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Needless to say, the method will never be able to match a native implementation by AMD or NVIDIA. Still, it's a great way to boost performance in some older PC games upon need.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-champs-2024-playoffs-bracket/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valorant-champs-2024-playoffs-bracket-locked-in.950529/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-champs-2024-playoffs-bracket/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Now that the group stage has wrapped up, the remaining eight teams in Seoul have advanced into the playoff round of this year’s Valorant Champions event. More than $2 million is still on the line, and out of those eight teams, <strong>one </strong>will walk away with a staggering prize worth $1 million.</p>



<p>Last year, Evil Geniuses scooped the number-one prize in Los Angeles, with Paper Rex falling into second place. Unfortunately, this won’t be a back-to-back win or a redemption event – EG failed to qualify for this year’s Valorant Champions and Paper Rex <strong>just </strong>got knocked out of the tournament by EDG.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-valorant-champions-playoffs-schedule">Valorant Champions Playoffs Schedule</h2>



<p>Four monumental matches have been scheduled to open up the playoffs. It’s a double elimination bracket, which means every starting team will have the chance to lose twice before they’re removed from the tournament – once in the upper bracket and then again in the lower bracket.</p>



<p>Here are the opening fixtures for the Valorant Champs playoffs stage:</p>



<ul>
<li>DRX vs. Sentinels (August 14)</li>



<li>Trace Esports vs. EDward Gaming (August 14)</li>



<li>G2 Esports vs. Leviatán (August 15)</li>



<li>Team Heretics vs. Fnatic (August 15)</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s anyone’s game, but presently, the frontrunners to win the number-one prize are DRX, closely followed by Sentinels. DRX is playing on home turf, and that advantage gave the squad a considerable boost in the group stage, with the team becoming one of the four to not lose a match. </p>



<p>Many are now backing the underdog side of Trace Esports, a Chinese organisation that pulled off a big win against Leviatán earlier this week to secure the team’s first-ever spot in the Valorant Champs playoffs round.</p>



<p>I’m backing Fnatic, the UK-based organisation that recently celebrated its 20th anniversary. It was just a few weeks ago that the team brought home a $100,000 prize during the EMEA Stage 2 tournament, and last year, the squad grabbed a second-place finish at Valorant Champs 2023 after <strong>winning </strong>VCT Masters Toyko. </p>

<p>As with the original Sonic Generations, the new separate Shadow campaign will reimagine stages from Shadow's past. So far, we've seen the Space Colony level, inspired by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-sa2-dc">Sonic Adventure 2</a>'s Final Chase. Now, in a new teaser video comparing old and new, two more stages have been revealed based on zones from Sonic Heroes and 2006's Sonic the Hedgehog.</p>

These games didn’t concern themselves with Italian plumbers or sad surrogate dads, but with fierce warriors who shirtlessly strode into battle, their muscles on glorious display, to cut down their foes with swords and prove themselves the strongest and manliest of all. I speak, of course, of barbarians. And though, in recent decades, games focused entirely on the heroic exploits of barbarians have been few and far between, we now find ourselves in the midst of a mini-renaissance of barbarian games!

            <p>The Borderlands movie adaptation generated just $4m across 3125 locations on its opening day.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/box-office/it-ends-with-us-opening-day-blake-lively-borderlands-bombing-1236102314/">Variety</a>, even with boosted ticket sales from Imax and "other premium large-format auditoriums", it seems its Hollywood cast isn't enough of a draw for the $115m production.</p>

<p>Variety points out that distributor Lionsgate has "financially shielded itself" and recouped 60 percent of its production costs through international pre-sales, but right now the film has the dubious honour of boasting the worst critical reviews of any movie released this summer.</p>
<p>The Borderlands movie was, of course, in the works for a long time. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-in-the-works">initially announced</a> back in 2015 before vanishing, and just as it looked like the project was dead and buried, Gearbox <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hostel-director-eli-roth-is-helming-the-borderlands-movie">re-announced it</a> in February 2020, this time with Hostel director Eli Roth at the helm.</p>
<p>Then, high-profile actors like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cate-blanchett-cast-in-eli-roths-borderlands-movie-adaptation">Cate Blanchett</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-signs-up-jamie-lee-curtis">Jamie Lee Curtis</a>, Gina Gershiwn, Kevin Hart, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jack-black-joins-borderlands-movie-cast-as-claptrap">Jack Black</a> all signed onto the project.</p>
<p>But then came the reviews and… well, as Matt summarised for us earlier in the week, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/early-borderlands-movie-impressions-brand-it-a-disaster-and-a-huge-misfire">early impressions were not great</a>, with critics lamblasting the live-action film adaptation of Gearbox's looter-shooter as everything from a "huge misfire" to a "disaster".</p>
<p>Since then, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-boss-asks-you-to-give-the-borderlands-movie-a-chance-as-a-lot-of-people-worked-really-hard-on-it">Take-Two Interactive boss Strauss Zelnick has implored fans to give it a chance</a>, and Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford has <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1822415283560005937">"blocked over a dozen accounts"</a> on X for being <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1822410828102226241">"truly nasty"</a> about the movie.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/starfield-land-vehicles-shown-in-leaked-video/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The lack of land vehicles in Starfield was always a bit puzzling for some fans of the sci-fi RPG developed by Bethesda. The confirmation came in June 2023 from Todd Howard himself, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-doesnt-have-land-vehicles-or-fishing-todd-howard-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a>:</p>
<p><em>No. You know, we do design it, I'm sure you've seen this with our other games, where we want to design it so it feels good on foot, but we do have the boost pack. You saw some of that in the video and you have skills for the boost pack, so the boost pack almost acts like this vehicle where you can fly through. It's super fun.</em></p>
<p>Later, the Starfield director added:</p>
<p><em>It's something we considered. Once you do vehicles, that does change the gameplay, so by focusing on foot once you land with your ship, it lets us really make an experience for the players where we know how fast they're seeing things. In one sense, you do have a vehicle. Obviously, you have your spaceship you can go around in space, but then on the surface, you do have a jetpack that you can upgrade, which is super fun, a new experience for us.</em></p>
<p>Eventually, modders tweaked the jetpack in an attempt to offset the lack of land vehicles, but it couldn't possibly be the same thing. Thankfully, Bethesda <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-update-1-11-33-60fps-40fps-uncapped-xbox-series-x-improved-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> earlier this year that it was indeed working on adding land vehicles with a future update.</p>
<p>In late July, we heard some new rumors about this new feature. The buggies will come in two variants and only carry two passengers, with an optional third-passenger slot for Vasco. NPCs from rescue missions will also be able to ride the vehicles. Both buggies will have weapons, a laser mode with slowdown, and a launcher&nbsp;and will scale based on the player's certified skills.</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-next-update-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starfield</a> land vehicles will be easy to obtain and transport, as they will spawn near the ship when purchased from the ship's technicians. Unfortunately, the customization options seem limited to colors, as anything with a new part will essentially be considered a new vehicle. Finally, the leaker said that buggies seem to work well, unlike Skyrim's horse.</p>
<p>Today, actual footage of land vehicles in Starfield leaked on Twitter/X. Its release might be imminent.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/bethesdaarabic/status/1822268537156653172?s=46">https://x.com/bethesdaarabic/status/1822268537156653172?s=46</a></p>
<p>Starfield is also about to get its first expansion, Shattered Space, while a new '<a href="https://wccftech.com/starborn-trademark-could-hint-at-starfields-next-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starborn</a>' trademark suggests the name of the second expansion.</p>

            <p>Fallout: London is the "fastest-redeemed" game of all time on GOG.</p>
<p>The fan-made mod - which is being distributed for free via GOG's platform, hence why the digital games distributor can't use terms like "fastest-selling" - was redeemed more than 500,000 times in its first 24 hours.</p>

<p>"The initial release of Fallout: London quickly turned out to be an incredible success - and a prime example of how work of passion and creativity can bring in a plethora of new, exciting ways to enjoy a game," GOG said.</p>
<p>"Combined with an overwhelming support from the gaming community, we can only congratulate Team Folon on their grand launch and hitting such a groundbreaking record."</p>
<p>It also acknowledged the "issues" some players experienced trying to get the mod to work, adding the volunteers known collectively as Team Folon "personally took the time to provide individual troubleshooting chat, both on social media and their official Discord server".</p>
<p>Yesterday, we reported that Team Folon – the volunteer squad of developers who have released the ambitious <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a> mod, Fallout: London – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-londons-volunteer-modding-team-to-launch-as-a-new-indie-studio">is set to launch itself as a new indie studio</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> will host another Marvel-focused season, this time centering on Doctor Doom, accompanied by yet more superhero faces for Epic Games' evergreen battle royale.
</p>
<p>
Details of Fortnite's next season, named Fortnite x Marvel: Absolute Doom, were announced this morning during Disney's D23 fan event, and livestreamed in Fortnite itself. 
</p>
<p>
Marvel boss Kevin Feige was joined on stage by Star Wars legend Dave Filoni and Pixar head honcho Pete Doctor, who additionally detailed a treasure trove of Disney franchises also set to get crossovers in Fortnite over the coming months, as Epic Games' integration with the Mouse House deepens.

<p>
Fortnite x Marvel: Absolute Doom will kick off this Friday, 16th August, and include Marvel heroes Gwenpool, War Machine, Emma Frost, Mysterio, Shuri and Doctor Doom in its battle pass. Two Fortnite favourites with new Marvel looks are also included: Captain Jonesy, who wears a version of Cap's suit and wields his shield, plus Peelverine, the latest version of Fortnite's favourite banana, now dressed as Logan.
</p>
<p>
A trailer for the new season also featured a furrier look for Fortnite's much-loved muscley cat Meowscles, apparently inspired by Marvel's Sabretooth, while fans at the event report being told that a Fishstick variant of Deadpool, named Fishpool, is also being worked on. Meanwhile, an Epic blog post states the Fantastic Four are also set to be added. All of these skins will likely be sold separately to the battle pass - either via the game's Item Shop or Crew subscription.

The past 24 hours have been busy for Fortnite, which is currently wrapping up its Mad Max-inspired wasteland season. In a mini live event held in-game last night, around a million players were in-game as this season's villain Megalo Don got his comeuppance, when his pipeline of powerful Nitro fuel detonated in spectacular style. The suggestion was that Doctor Doom interfered to cause the explosion, while the aftermath also saw the return of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-begins-teasing-ancient-greek-season">Pandora's Box</a>, a menacing threat that has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-latest-live-event-kicks-off-countdown-to-mad-max-esque-new-season">plagued Fortnite's battle royale Island through the course of its current Chapter 5 storyline</a>.

<p>
More pertinent to all of the announcements last night, perhaps, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disney-acquires-15bn-stake-in-epic-games-making-games-and-entertainment-universe-in-fortnite">Epic Games' real-life $1.5bn deal with Disney to integrate its Fortnite metaverse with the entertainment powerhouse</a>. I can't remember the last time Disney wheeled out such a senior trio of execs to announce more skins for a video game, but such is the importance - and oppurtunity - of Fortnite as a part of popular culture.
</p>
<p>Leaks suggest next season will add a permanent and separate Disney store to Fortnite, alongside its Item Shop, as a way to sell and track your purchased vault of Disney content. This, perhaps, may also be used to mark compatibility with a future Fortnite Disney mode.</p> <div>

As well as adding the many Marvel heroes above, Fortnite will swell its character roster to include IG-88 and Moff Gideon from Star Wars hit show The Mandalorian, as well as a new Grogu back bling, as soon as next week. 
</p>
<p>
Fortnite's first Pixar crossover is also on the way, appropriately with the animation studio's own superheroes, as Frozone, Mr Incredible and Elasticgirl from The Incredibles become available this autumn. Finally, classic Disney villains such as Cruella de Vil, Hook and Maleficient will also be available in the autumn.
</p>
<p>
The announcement of a Fortnite season focusing on Doctor Doom is well-timed with Marvel Studios' own announcement it will pivot to focusing on the character, played by Robert Downey Jr., in the next Avengers film. It's unclear how - if at all - this season will tie into that, or acknowledge <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-marvel-season-is-live-with-iron-man-and-dr-doom-playable">Doctor Doom was already part of Fortnite's storyline several years back</a>, when its first dedicated Marvel season ran. That season featured Thor, She-Hulk, Groot, Storm, Dr. Doom, Mystique, Iron Man and Wolverine, characters Epic Games has clearly steered away from repeating with new skins here, and memorably ended in a spectacular <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-showstopping-marvel-finale-drops-a-huge-cliffhanger">major live event where the Marvel heroes teamed up to take down Galactus</a> - something that will take some beating.

<p>Fortnite has released a new trailer for their upcoming Absolute Doom season. Chapter 5, Season 4 starts on August 16 and will bring beloved Marvel characters back to the island.</p>

<iframe title="Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 5 Season 4 - Absolute Doom | Official Season Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5uE0XFJSVZA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-chapter-5-season-4-s-narrative">Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4’s Narrative</h2>



<p>The new Fortnite trailer features the season’s highlight, Dr. Doom, who seems to be up to no good. We see Jonesy wearing Captain America’s outfit, swinging around his shield to take down enemies. </p>



<p>The trailer showcases the upcoming season’s overarching plot, with Dr. Doom seemingly rescuing Mysterio from a maximum-security prison. The iron-fisted doctor has also erected a full-fledged castle in the middle of the island, which will probably be a new POI in the upcoming season.</p>



<p>To take Dr. Doom’s evil forces down, Jonesy and the other Fortnite characters join hands with the X-Men, as we see Cyclops, Colossus, Jubilee, and others join the fray. Players also glimpse Peely Wolverine (Peelverine) as he reenacts Logan’s iconic escape from the Weapon X facility.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-new-gameplay-features">New Gameplay Features</h2>



<p>Halfway through the trailer, we received a gameplay showcase, revealing all the new toys players can play with in the upcoming Fortnite season. First up was Captain America’s Shield, which players can swing to take down multiple enemies at a time or use to ram into other players and their builds. Next, we got to see Black Panther’s Claws, which seem to be a new melee weapon, perfect for close-ranged combat.</p>



<p>Then, Gwenpool shows up, wearing parts of Tony Stark’s Iron Suit, allowing her to zoom through the map and use the Unibeam to unleash devastating attacks. We also saw War Machine in action; his suit seems like an absolute tank. Last but not least was Dr. Doom, who unleashed a beam of devastating energy at other Marvel characters.</p>



<h2 id="h-battle-pass-details">Battle Pass Details </h2>



<p>Fortnite has revealed in the trailer description that players will receive new items such as Dual Micro SMGs, Captain America’s Shield, or War Machine’s Arsenal in the Absolute Doom Season. Also, next season’s Battle Pass will cost 950 V-Bucks and feature rewards such as Gwenpool, War MachinePeelverine, Emma Frost, Captain Jonesy, Mysterio, and Shuri. Fortnite will also feature Dr Doom’s skin through Battle Pass quests in September.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-future-battle-pass-items-may-no-longer-remain-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest announcement</a>, Fortnite’s battle pass items will no longer be exclusive. Also, their latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-disney-livestream-coming-this-week-with-peelverine-plush-back-bling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live stream with Disney had many reveals</a>.

<p>Recently, clips started surfacing online of content creators playing what <strong>looks like </strong>Modern Warfare 2 Remastered’s multiplayer offering – which never surfaced. It’s actually a full-fledged multiplayer mod for MW Remastered, which was released almost ten years ago. It’s called the H2M Mod, and it has been in development for quite a while.</p>



<p>At first blush, it’s the most faithful recreation of 2009’s Modern Warfare 2 that I’ve ever seen.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-take-me-back">Take Me Back</h2>



<p>For many Call of Duty fans, Modern Warfare 2 represents the pinnacle of the series. It boasted a flawless multiplayer platform that we still remember today, and it was a perfect expansion to the story mode that was kicked off in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. In 2016, Activision released Modern Warfare Remastered, which completely overhauled the original game, and in 2020, MW2’s <strong>campaign </strong>was remastered.</p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://h2m-mod.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a team of talented modders</a> has pulled Modern Warfare 2’s multiplayer platform into 2016’s Modern Warfare Remastered. H2M features the full suite of maps, modes, weapons, and everything you fondly remember from the 2009 title, right down to elements of the UI and the sound palette.</p>



<p>It looks utterly phenomenal:</p>



<figure><figcaption> </figcaption></figure>



<p>Typically, Activision Blizzard comes down hard on these fan-made creations, issuing cease and desist notices or ordering that they be taken offline, but this <strong>shouldn’t </strong>be the case this time. To play H2M, you’ll need to own a copy of Modern Warfare Remastered on Steam (as it’s a PC-only mod), and the team behind the project has stressed they’re not accepting payments for the creation.</p>



<p>It’s truly the next generation of Modern Warfare 2. With redesigned levelling systems, menus, and an overhaul to the killstreak system, players can enjoy the game they know and love from fifteen years ago with a much more modern, up-to-date feel. When H2M is released on August 16, it’ll come with 50 maps, some of which are single-player missions converted into playable multiplayer maps.</p>



<p>It’s insane.</p>

The latest crossover starts next week with Mandalorian characters like Grogu set to show up on August 12. Then, Fortnite’s next season will usher in the age of Doctor Doom with Chapter 5 Season 4: Absolute Doom, bringing more Marvel-themed skins and items for players to toy with on August 16. You can see <a href="https://x.com/MarvelGames/status/1822489174240542897" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a trailer</a> for Absolute Doom below.</p><blockquote data-media-max-width="560" data-theme="light">— Marvel Games (@MarvelGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelGames/status/1822489174240542897?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 11, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Doctor Doom is the latest Marvel centerpiece to worm its way into Fortnite, but Victor Von Doom isn't the only superpowered character to show up in the trailer. X-Men like Cable, Cyclops, Rogue, Jubilee, and Colossus have cameos, too, as does Spider-Man villain Mysterio. Some cosmetics and weapons based on characters like Sabretooth, Captain America, Iron Man, and Black Panther can also be seen in the footage, making it clear that Marvel's relationship with Fortnite still has a lot of life left in it.</p><p>Disney took the opportunity at its latest D23 showcase to prove that it's all in on Fortnite in more ways than one. This fall, Fortnite fans can look forward to appearances from a selection of iconic Disney villains like Maleficent, Cruella de Vil, and Captain Hook. Pixar characters are on the way, too. Specifically, Disney’s superhero family, the Incredibles, will show up in-game, with players able to enjoy content based on heroes like Mr. and Mrs. Incredible and Frozone.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>These announcements follow the news that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-buys-15-billion-stake-in-epic-games-to-create-expansive-universe-within-fortnite">Disney aquired a $1.5 billion stake in Fortnite developer Epic Games</a> in March. At the time, the company stated a desire to bolster its relationship with the studio and make a more significant investment in the games space in general. A laundry list of Fortnite character additions is surely only the beginning of what the partnership will bring. While we wait to see how the two companies will grow together, be sure to read up on some of the other announcements from tonight's Disney Experiences Showcase, which include new attractions based on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-land-at-disneylands-disney-california-adventure-gets-new-attraction-concept-art-and-details-d23-2024">Avatar</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/robert-downey-jr-to-become-tony-stark-again-for-a-new-disneyland-attraction-in-avengers-campus-d23-2024">The Avengers</a>.</p><p><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

The biggest was that Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4, which begins August 16, will be a new Marvel-focused season, dubbed Absolute Doom--with a battle pass filled with Marvel skins, such as a new Peely called Peelverine.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbTbvbZltW8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tbTbvbZltW8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>What we have here in this trailer is the full battle pass reveal, plus looks at some of the new gameplay goodies we're going to get to play with.

While each of them described these collaborations as extensions of their franchise storytelling, these announcements were all about new skins.</p><p>First revealed were several skins based on classic Disney animated villains--Cruella DeVille, Captain Hook, and Maleficent were shown, with the promise of a fall release, which could indicate they'll be part of Fortnitemares in October. Adding to that animated fun is the news that Fortnite will be receiving its first Pixar skins in the form of a collab with The Incredibles.</p><p>And while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-ends-exclusivity-for-future-battle-passes/1100-6525606/" data-ref-id="1100-6525606">the change to battle pass exclusivity</a> won't help you get the old Mandalorian skin and Grogu back bling, on August 12, skins for IG-11 and Moff Gideon will be added to the item shop and there will also be a new Grogu back bling available for those who missed the previous one.</p>

The app is also available for iOS and iPadOS, where it’s a virtually identical experience, minus the 3D effect.</p><p>The first games I played after downloading VirtualFriend were those I owned as a kid: <em>Red Alarm, Wario Land</em>, and <em>Mario’s Tennis. </em>I’m pleased to say that apart from some minor audio glitches in <em>Red Alarm</em>, the games run well — it’s all just as I remember it. </p><div><figcaption><em>The preset “Game Boy” color scheme might be my favorite.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>GIF: VirtualFriend</cite></p></div><p>VirtualFriend supports Bluetooth controllers and keyboard control on the Vision Pro, as well as touchscreen buttons if you’re playing on an iPhone or iPad. Visually, the games look as good as a Virtual Boy game can and have a little help from the app, which lets you customize the console’s two-tone color palette. VirtualFriend also has an eye adjustment slider that helps adjust the image if you find a particular game isn’t working for you. </p><p>The big missing features are controller mapping and the ability to save your game at any point using save states. (Developer Adam Gastineau acknowledged the latter in an <a href="https://github.com/agg23/virtualfriend/issues/7">open issue on the project’s GitHub page</a>.) </p><p>Still, VirtualFriend is easy to recommend if you’re at all curious about playing Virtual Boy games or, like me, you once owned and loved the console. It’s free with the option to tip the developer, doesn’t show ads, and according to its App Store listing, won’t collect your data. It’s just good, clean, mid-90s VR fun.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Most people who buy Pez candy probably aren't thinking about the flavor of the little brick tablets much at all (none taste very good). Pez is all about the iconic plastic dispensers featuring characters from popular media franchises. Pez Dispensers have become collectibles since first debuting in the US in the 1950s (the candy itself is nearly 100 years old). There aren't very many Pez Dispensers themed around video game franchises, but if you're an Animal Crossing fan, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09V1VSC5L?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon has a limited-time deal on a 12-pack featuring Tom Nook, K.K. Slider, and Isabelle Pez Dispensers</a>. So if you need party favors for an Animal Crossing-themed birthday party, check out this Amazon deal before it's gone.</p><div title="6525642 - Animal Crossing Pez Dispensers" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2558" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6525642 - Animal Crossing Pez Dispensers" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09V1VSC5L?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B09V1VSC5L?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09V1VSC5L?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Animal Crossing Pez Dispensers (12-Pack)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09V1VSC5L?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B09V1VSC5L?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09V1VSC5L?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$17 (was $24)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>This 12-pack includes a random mix of Animal Crossing Pez dispensers.
