Now, just a week later, the game is discounted on PC. Head over to Fanatical and use promo code <strong>FANATICAL15</strong> to get a Steam key of the remastered action classic for $42.49 (was $50).</p><p>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black lets you play as Ryu Hayabusa--a ninja who wields the legendary Dragon Sword. The core gameplay has remained the same over the past 15 years, meaning you'll still be treated to a fast-paced and bloody combat system. However, this new version benefits from improved visuals, stages, characters, and lighting effects from Unreal Engine 5 that create a more modern gaming experience.</p><p>Other additions to Ninja Gaiden 2 Black include new characters, new modes for beginners, and a reworked weapon upgrade system. In short, this is the best way to experience the game in 2025.</p><p>While Fanatical is running its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-on-thousands-of-pc-games-and-unlock-free-steam-keys-during-fanaticals-lunar-new-year-sale/1100-6528927/" data-ref-id="1100-6528927">Lunar New Year</a> event, <strong>you’ll also get a free mystery gift with your purchase</strong>. You'll either receive a free Steam game or a coupon to use on your next purchase.</p><p>Alternatively, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is available on Xbox and PC Game Pass. So if you’d rather access it through Microsoft’s popular service, you can pick up an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate 3-Month Membership</a> for $50. Ninja Gaiden 2 Black has Xbox Cloud Gaming support, so you can play it on Xbox Series X|S, PC, and your mobile device while on the go.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4436366-ninjagaiden2black.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4436366" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4436366-ninjagaiden2black.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4436366"></a><figcaption>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4436366-ninjagaiden2black.jpg"></figure><p>Fanatical also has a deal on the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fninja-gaiden-master-collection-ninja-gaiden-2&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fninja-gaiden-2-black-steam-keys-are-discounted-for-a-limited-time%2F1100-6529155%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ninja Gaiden Master Collection</a>, dropping the price to $34.79 (was $40).

Sigma 2 released on PS3 in 2009, one year after the Ninja Gaiden 2's release on Xbox 360. Team Ninja told the same story in Sigma 2, but the gameplay, level design, boss battles, and other features were markedly different. Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is more of an amalgamation of the two previous releases.</p><p>The general consensus among longtime fans is that Ninja Gaiden Black--<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/ninja-gaiden-black/c17kks83s9gs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available for $5 on the Xbox Store</a>--is better than Ninja Gaiden Sigma. So far, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/ninja-gaiden-2-black/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fan and critic reactions to Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a> have been generally aligned with the reception of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/ninja-gaiden-sigma-2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sigma 2</a>.</p><p>During the Developer Direct, Koei Tecmo announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-from-team-ninja-and-platinum-games-revealed-at-xbox-developer-direct/1100-6528986/" data-ref-id="1100-6528986">Ninja Gaiden 4 will drop sometime in 2025</a>--so whether you’re a fan or just experiencing the gory action for the first time, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is worth checking out ahead of the arrival of the long-awaited sequel.</p><p><em>Disclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.</em></p><div tabindex="0" data-id="971810473" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

                <p>In 1989, the original Kickboxer martial arts movie helped establish Jean-Claude Van Damme as an action star. Now, for the first time ever, the Kickboxer franchise is making the leap to video games with Force Multiplier Studios, a team of developers with experience on Call of Duty, Borderlands, Halo, Tomb Raider, and Mortal Kombat.</p><p>Screenwriter Dimitri Logothetis and producer Rob Hickman--two of the filmmakers behind the 2016 film Kickboxer: Vengeance and its sequel, Kickboxer: Retaliation--are working with Force Multiplier Studios to bring the Kickboxer video game to life. But for now, the game is at such an early stage of development that there's nothing to show off.</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-call-of-duty-devs-are-making-the-first-ever-official-kickboxer-video-game-but-is-jean-claude-van-damme-in-it" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Force Multiplier Studios was very vague about whether Van Damme will lend his likeness to the game or participate in any way. Instead, the studio stated that the game "will combine the rich narrative of Kickboxer with kinetic martial arts action to deliver an intense, high-octane brawler, and feature iconic characters and locations from the franchise originally starring martial arts icon Jean-Claude Van Damme."</p><p>Van Damme returned to the franchise in Kickboxer: Vengeance and Kickboxer: Retaliation, and he remains the star who is most associated with the films. According to IGN, Van Damme is also set to return for another sequel, Kickboxer: Armageddon, which is expected to film later this year. Outside of Kickboxer, Van Damme portrayed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-kombat-pack-includes-jean-claude-van-damme-skin-for-johnny-cage/1100-6514327/" data-ref-id="1100-6514327">a variant of Johnny Cage in Mortal Kombat 1</a>.</p>

			<p>Today, it's been announced that Summer Game Fest will be returning to Los Angeles from June 6 to June 9 for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-alan-wake-dlc-slitterhead-good-for-horror-fans/">fifth year in a row</a>. Summer Game Fest will have a Live Kickoff show from YouTube Theater hosted by Geoff Keighley, the man who famously hosts The Game Awards. SGF will be kicking off with a magnificent bang as a live, in-person, 2-hour showcase event will be taking place to begin the event. For those who can't attend in person, it will be streamed across more than 20 video platforms, including commonly used YouTube, Twitch, TikTok, and Steam.</p>
<p>For those who want to attend the event in person, the public ticket sales will begin later in the Spring. Summer Game Fest is a major event, and last year saw it deliver more than 36 million global livestreams, up by 12% Year-on-Year, as well as over 8,000 co-streams on Twitch and YouTube. With the showcase happening at the start of the event, there is the potential for SGF to be even bigger and better than before.</p>
<p>2025 will be introducing a couple of new features, including a business-to-business thought leader event, which will explore and investigate some of the changes, challenges, and opportunities present in the video game industry. During this event, the cultural impact and significance of video games will be celebrated, with the event being curated by Christopher Dring, the former head of GamesIndustry.biz, and Geoff Keighley.</p>
<p>As Summer Game Fest usually does, it will be supporting and uplifting the voices of publishers as well as hosting partner events and livestreams during the weekend of Summer Game Fest. This includes the well-known event of Day of the Devs, which is a special non-profit showcase that celebrates the magic of indie games. As it will be taking place during SGF, the event is called Day of the Devs: SGF Edition and will be presented online via a livestream after the live showcase takes place on June 6.</p>
<p>More information about the event can be found on the <a href="https://www.summergamefest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Summer Game Fest website</a>, as well as their social media.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/citizen-sleeper-2-review-steam-rpg-scifi-cowboy-bebop-1851751947<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bodies tear, break, grow, shrink, endure, decay. I occasionally think of myself as a sack of skin transporting around a pure, permanent, irreducible self protected from oblivion by its mortal shell but also transcending it. But as I get older, weaker, more tired, the act of self deception, for better and for worse, becomes harder to maintain. The body keeps the score, whether we want to see it or not. “Everyone has to contend with the entropy of their flesh,” <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em>'s narrator tells me. “And, in that realization, you suddenly feel less alone.”</p><p>A sequel to the 2022 sci-fi visual novel RPG and launching January 31 on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC, <em>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector </em>is a beautiful, tedious, harrowing sci-fi adventure about a copy of a human consciousness stored inside an artificial body (what’s called a Sleeper) who’s on the run from cruel corporate owners. Survival entails endless gig-economy toil across a dozen or so asteroid colonies called the  Starward Belt, scattered throughout the remnants of a once powerful governing federation whose ghosts still haunt the crime-ridden backwater. It’s a slow burn, and a memorable one.</p><p>If you played the first   <em>Citizen Sleeper</em>, you’ll recognize its sequel following a similar but greatly expanded blueprint, leaving behind the atmosphere of a single planet to discover an entire solar system’s worth of possibilities—more characters to meet, bad situations to scrape your way out of, and tools for navigating the harsh realities of an interstellar existence ruled by perpetual scarcity. And like its predecessor, <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em> is primarily a game about words and dice and relishing the serendipity when the two combine in unexpected ways. </p><p><br>Inspired by tabletop mechanics, <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em>'s quests and storylines are governed by a fickle equation of resource balancing and probability-based skill checks. Want to escape the mining asteroid you’re on before your corporate overlords catch you? You’ll need fuel and supplies. Visit some nearby nodes on the map offering work, slot in your dice, and hope your rolls successfully complete the job and net you extra cash. There are no big victories in <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em>, just the patient accumulation of small wins. </p><p>But now you’ve exhausted your dice and need to go to bed. Wake up and you realize you need food or risk a cascading set of bodily failures that will result in one or more of your dice breaking. Eating costs money too. Better take a contract that’ll let you cash in big-time. Except you follow the job to the middle of nowhere and now you’re running out of food all over again, some dice are breaking and others are glitched from permanent damage, and you botched the job so badly that the asteroid you were supposed to survey for water is now breaking up. Back to the nearest colony in even worse shape than when you left. </p><p>It’s a credit to <em>Sleeper Citizen 2</em>'s excellent writing by creator Gareth Damian Martin that, rather than burning me out, the repetition of its resource gathering and the constant tension of things inevitably going sideways keeps me compelled, serving as a richly textured backdrop against which the game’s real concern—a burgeoning family of misfits on a busted-up space ship—takes center stage. Survival in <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em> is merely a catalyst for setting up collisions with other people, including a series of similarly flawed and fragile strays who slowly join your crew</p><p>Serafin, a rude and short-fused pilot, is the one who rescued you from the company that made you, and who got you both on the run. Bliss is a tranquil mechanic always ready to take the temperature down a notch. Juni is a hacker obsessed with uncovering information from before the collapse, when the local system was dotted with massive ships and baroque facilities run by powerful artificial intelligences. And the only thing Yu-Jin likes more than drinking and gambling is chasing bad intel in the hopes of finding a long-lost interstellar space drive that can help him escape the Starward Belt. </p><p><br>Like any true family, they fight, piss each other off, and occasionally let one another down. But they also add their own hopes and dreams to the mix, help shoulder one another’s burdens, and, most importantly, don’t cut and run when shit hits the ceiling, which is where it inevitably ends up in <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em>. These social bonds are borne out in the missions you go on with your crew, where their unique skills and dice rolls are added to yours. The relief of having friends was never sharper than when their fives and sixes helped me narrowly complete a job that would have been impossible on my own. </p><p>I fucked up early in<em> Citizen Sleeper 2</em>. Made some bad calls, got sloppy, and lived with the consequences of that through to the very end. My dice broke from stress, which made it harder to get the materials I needed to repair them. I blacked out a few times and permanently damaged myself, resulting in glitched dice that only ever had a one-in-five chance of not completely screwing me.  I uncovered hidden space cathedrals and helped launch corporate rebellions, and yet no matter what I accomplished or how lucky I got, the jobs never got much easier. The work continued, though; my crew grew, and we managed to scrape together a life for ourselves, at least for a little while. </p><p>Flesh is soft and prone to injuries, but it’s also flexible and resilient. It fights the slow erosion of order and meaning into chaos and emptiness for as long as it can, which isn’t enough but at least it’s something. In <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em> the struggle can end up feeling like much more, thanks in part to the seamless melding of art and interface, as well as plaintive, industrial melodies of minimalist electronic composer Amos Roddy. Life is messy in the  Starward Belt, but its evocative beauty is only brought into such sharp focus because of the uncompromising precision of its elegant presentation. </p><p>There was no game quite like <em>Citizen Sleeper</em> when it first came out. It’s nice to finally have another one.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Capcom's clearly in a sharing mood. It's announced it's airing not one but two showcases next week - one being <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> themed and the other focusing on a number of other upcoming games, including Onimusha Way of the Sword.
</p>
<p>
And if that sounds like your kind of night, things get underway at 10pm GMT/2pm PT next Tuesday, 4th February. First up is Capcom's Spotlight showcase. This lasts around 20 minutes and covers three titles on the publisher's slate: Onimusha Way of the Sword, Capcom Fighting Collection 2, and Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection Arcade Classics.
</p>
<p>
Onimusha Way of the Sword was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-onimusha-game-in-development-from-capcom">announced in December</a> and isn't expect to arrive until next year (some 20 years after the series' previous entry, Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams, released), so it's perhaps a little surprising it has more to say so soon. As for Capcom Fighting Collection 2, it hasn't yet been given a release date beyond 2025, so we can probably expect one - and we'll likely also get a release date for Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics on Xbox, after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-now-coming-to-xbox-following-technical-discussions-with-microsoft">bit of a faff around</a> last year.

<p>
And once Capcom's Spotlight is done, it'll immediately be time for a 20-minute update on Monster Hunter Wilds, which'll be just weeks away from its 28th February launch by then. We can probably expect a couple of monster reveals, a new biome, and me squealing giddily if they announce they're bringing back sea-squirting Cthulhu cuttlefish elder dragon Namielle.

So that's that; next Tuesday, 4th February at 10pm GMT/2pm PT for all your latest Capcom news. The publisher hasn't actually said <em>where</em> you'll be able to watch its showcase yet, but YouTube seems like a fair bet. And we'll have all the news from the event right here too, if you'd rather catch up at a less indecent time over a nice cup of beans.

			<p>BetaDwarf, the publisher and developer behind Forced, Forced Showdown, and Minion Masters, has announced their latest title. The game was previously under the codename Project F4E and has now been announced as Vaultbreakers. The game promises to be a new take on <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-is-the-new-visceral-arpg-from-oris-moon-studios-early-access-launch-in-q1-2024/">ARPGs</a> and PvPvE games. You'll get to experience brawler combat with tactical extractions in an evolving fantasy world. If this sounds like something you'd want to play, make sure to check out the reveal trailer for Vaultbreakers below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vaultbreakers - Reveal Trailer - Join the Playtest" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2OgdcqiVQgA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Vaultbreakers is a hardcore top-down PvPvE ARPG where you can choose to fight off enemies alongside your friends or by yourself as you take on intense missions in a dynamic fantasy world. This game stands out from the crowd thanks to its reactive gameplay. You will get to take on missions that will shift and change based on the choices made by players, as well as actions taken by NPCs. You'll get to explore new environments, such as caves, and uncover ancient rituals.</p>
<p>To keep the combat fresh and keep you on your toes, the enemies will be unpredictable. They are named Changelings, a faction of shapeshifters that can either be controlled by AI or other players, making the battle even harder. You have multiple choices in how you deal with them, with the options to attack them, avoid them entirely, or align with them.</p>
<p>There will be various Champions you can choose from, as well as new perks, items, and Artifacts that can help make you more powerful on your expedition through Vaultbreakers. For those who have a competitive streak, there's also the option to participate in quests to be able to climb leaderboards and get the top ranking among other players.</p>
<p>"The game is set in an evolving world that challenges players to think tactically, adapt dynamically, and battle fiercely. With unpredictable events triggered by Changelings or other players, and with a focus on player skill and knowledge, I believe we are offering a fresh new multiplayer ARPG experience," says Steffen Kabbelgaard, CEO and Game Director at BetaDwarf.</p>
<p>If all of these features are ticking the boxes for you, BetaDwarf will be hosting an exclusive closed playtest of Vaultbreakers on January 31. If you want to get the opportunity to play the game, you can request access <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/306910/Vaultbreakers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Steam</a> or through the <a href="https://vaultbreakers.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Vaultbreakers' website</a>. For content creators that partner up with BetaDwarf, Twitch Drop campaigns will be opened to allow players to get a key for the playtest.</p>
<p>The playtest will consist of the first and second chapters of the narrative campaign. Those who get the opportunity to participate will be able to earn Legacy Points that can unlock rewards that will carry over to the official launch.</p>

My colleague and Verge senior news editor Richard Lawler just fired up Nvidia’s just-announced “Studio Voice” feature on his RTX 3070 — and it made his Logitech webcam’s awful built-in microphone sound downright respectable.</p><p>Take a listen:</p><p>The first clip you’ll hear is Richard on his podcasting mic, then the crummy Logitech C922 webcam mic, and lastly, the webcam mic <em>with</em> Nvidia’s feature turned on.</p><p>What a world we live in.</p><p>It’s part of <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/studio-ai-geforce-rtx-50-series-broadcast/#:~:text=Lights%2C%20Camera%2C%20Broadcast">an update to the free Nvidia Broadcast app</a>, as is another new feature called “Virtual Key Light” that we found slightly less impressive, at least in our very first test.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-review.1096446/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Science fiction has a long history of telling poignant human stories through the lens of non-human subjects. 2022’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/citizen-sleeper"><u>Citizen Sleeper</u></a> earned its place alongside stories like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/12/14/blade-runner-the-final-cut-four-disc-collectors-edition-review"><u>Blade Runner</u></a> almost instantly thanks to its introspective interrogation of personhood and community in a world where all of it feels fragile, and this sequel’s strong, system-hopping story consistently hits the same highs. And though it can be very slow paced, repetitive, and full of walls of text, a byproduct of its tabletop-inspired design, overhauled survival systems, new multilayered crew missions, and an upgraded sense of tension in every dice roll makes Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector more engaging more often.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Citizen Sleeper’s RPG qualities resemble pen and paper systems like <a href="https://bladesinthedark.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Blades in the Dark</u></a> and <a href="https://tomkinpress.com/pages/ironsworn" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ironsworn</u></a> more than popular RPGs like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review"><u>Dungeons and Dragons</u></a> or video games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review"><u>Final Fantasy</u></a>. This is most evident in how little you interact with your stats from a planning and preparation perspective. How good and bad you are at things affects everything you do, and proper allocation of the limited amount of dice you have for the tasks ahead is the crux of your decision making, but there's very little you can do to modify the outcome of these rolls or buffer yourself against potential consequences outside of that. This is a limitation that can also be freeing. Without the chance to get in the weeds in the way more dense RPGs let you, you spend way less time trying to shield yourself from Citizen Sleeper’s whims and more time learning to go with the flow, cheering your triumphs and swallowing your defeats. Starward Vector stays committed to the idea that great drama arises when you can’t just min-max your way through adversity in a way that still feels just as novel as it did the first time. I welcomed this drama with open arms, as it solved my issue with the previous game’s passivity and made sure I had to really consider every option every time.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Citizen Sleeper 2 makes good use of its all new crew systems.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Your Sleeper, an android protagonist who is a machine in body but an emulation of a long deceased human in mind, still comes in three classes. I chose the Extractor, well-equipped for enduring physical labor and excelling at diving headlong into risky environments, but woefully unfit for more delicate and technical work. The strengths and weaknesses of each class are expressed slightly differently here than in the original, all in pursuit of making the dice rolling portions of Citizen Sleeper 2 more tenuous. Your dump stat - the lowest of the five available on your character sheet - can’t be improved at all, and spending your dice on any action that uses that stat as its basis, like the Extractor’s Inuit skill, gets a -2 penalty. Most actions have at least two different stats that could be used to attempt a task, but it can be devastating in the uncommon event that the only way to succeed a check is rolling at such a severe disadvantage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Citizen Sleeper 2 makes good use of its all new crew systems, putting your hangers-on to work during more elaborate sequences. You can take up to two crew members with you on special jobs like scrapping old derelict ships out in space, or surveying an asteroid for drinkable water, each with their own specializations and a pair of dice that you can assign to tasks. Missions that require more hands are often longer and take several cycles of multiple steps to be completed; bashing open the hull of a ship so that a more hardware-inclined ally can find the mainframe and prep it for your hacker to steal some data, for example. Efficiency is key, because every cycle costs supplies, and once you run out of those, disaster escalates quickly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mixing and matching crew to shore up your weaknesses is handy, and your Sleeper’s new Push abilities, like the Extractor’s Rally that buffs their die but also stresses everyone out, can be tactical godsends. Outside of supply limits, many of these special jobs can trigger a crisis, which put a new layer of time constraint on your work before some previously unforeseen calamity ruins your progress. These were easily the most fun parts of Citizen Sleeper 2. It’s where I had to think the most on my feet, prep the most before shipping out, and regretted it the most when I failed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new Stress meter replaces the old condition system, and though it affects your dice from cycle to cycle in similar ways, it can be a bit more brutal. Instead of a status bar that gradually ticks down, cutting off access to dice as the meter shrinks that you can roll again once your condition returns to normal, Stress points accumulate whenever you fail a check or some other unfortunate happening takes place. As your Stress rises, so does the amount of numbers you will be penalized for rolling every cycle. For instance, if your Stress meter is past the halfway mark and any of your dice show between a 1 and 3, they all take damage. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There's a sense of danger that was sorely missing from the first game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Dice can take three damage each before they break, at which point they cannot be used again until they are repaired, which requires not so rare but not always accessible resources to do. More than once have I been stuck mid-mission, down a couple of dice and pushing the limits of my remaining ones. These are frustrating moments, but they really do add a sense of danger that was sorely missing from the first game. It’s also not as much of a problem late-game, when getting around is less of a hassle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Almost every mission (called Drives here) involves making connections and building relationships with people. Community building in the static space station of Erlin’s Eye was a core value of the original’s plot, and Starward Vector re-emphasizes this message in its system-spanning journey both in story and gameplay. It’s a message that feels even more important these days, as well: solidarity among like-minded people and a collective wit and will to fight for change can help overcome the limitations of class and resources when up against seemingly impossible odds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The writing itself is satisfying, on the whole. It’s not overly flowery or descriptive, allowing plenty of space between the mind and the words for your imagination to fill. It can be biting and direct when describing tense exploration sequences. It also really excels at creating dense webs of philosophical and existential conflict when dissecting concepts of personhood revolving around the android protagonist, as well as personal agency as more than one outside agitator attempts to claim ownership over you in different, sometimes chilling ways. That said, it doesn’t have the same kick when it comes to physical conflict, as its scenes of hectic gun fights and daring escapes don’t quite hit in comparison.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The colorful characters you meet along the journey are mostly believable individuals, even if they aren’t all that layered or deep. Though enjoyable, especially when some familiar names show up in unfamiliar places, you won’t find many of these travelers and tinkerers to have surprising turns of personality or purpose outside of your first impressions. Even some of my favorite potential crewmates follow archetypes you’ve seen just about everywhere, like the jetbike-riding space courier Kadet, who fills the role of spunky go-getter. Many NPCs that can’t be lured into your party, from dutiful caretakers of small settlements to hardened bounty hunters, are one-note caricatures that stay long enough to be novel when needed and vanish right before they become burdensome, a good quality borrowed from pulp noir and sci-fi novels that keeps the intrigue machine churning.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector does not stray too far from what made the first one a cult hit, but it doesn’t need to. It tells a rich and poignant story about the complex nature of control on one’s self when that self is a machine that can be rebooted and hacked, finding and enriching community in the face of overwhelming odds, and expressing personhood both to oneself and to others. It’s visual novel-like presentation is heavy on reading and dice rolling, so its not exactly pulse-pounding, but the retooled character classes and stats, new crew missions, and stress mechanics provide just enough feedback and create a sense of precarity throughout that it stays engaging.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In the intro video, Salvador talks about looking through their archives and stumbling on the existence of <em>Pretzel Pete</em>, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oldgames/comments/11w2tyk/pretzel_pete_xsiv_gamespc/">little-remembered early 3D driving/platform game</a>. Despite its extreme obscurity, the game is nonetheless mentioned in the 1999 E3 catalog and an old issue of PC Gamer, both of which are now memorialized forever in the VGHF digital archives.</p>
<p>Getting this kind of obscure information into a digitized, easily searchable form was "a lot harder than it sounds," Salvador said. Beyond getting archival-quality scans of the magazines themselves (a process aided by community efforts like <a href="https://www.retromags.com/">RetroMags</a> and <a href="https://www.outofprintarchive.com/">Out of Print Archive</a>), extracting the text from those pages proved difficult for OCR software designed for the high-contrast, black-text-on-white-background world of business documents. "If you've ever read a '90s video game magazine, you know how crazy those magazine layouts get," Salvador said.</p>

<p>To get around that problem, Salvador said VGHF Director of Technology Travis Brown spent months developing a specially designed text-recognition tool that "handles even the toughest magazine pages with no problem" and represents "a significant leap in quality over what we had before." That means it's easier than ever to find <a href="https://archive.gamehistory.org/search?keyword=%22clu%20clu%20land%22">81 separate mentions of <em>Clu Clu Land</em></a> from across dozens of different issues with a single search.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the vast wealth of video game information on offer here does not include direct, playable access to retail video games, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/can-an-online-library-of-classic-video-games-ever-be-legal/">libraries can't share digitally</a> due to the limitations of the DMCA. But the VGHF and other organizations <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/vghf-opens-free-online-access-to-1500-classic-game-mags-30k-historic-files/%3Ca%20href=">"continue to challenge those copyright rules</a> every three years," leaving some hope that digital libraries like this may soon include access to the source material being discussed.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-review-leitner-worthy</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-review-%E2%80%93-leitner-worthy.1096419/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-review-leitner-worthy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Statement begins. <em>The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game</em> is based on a horror podcast that helped me get through a dark time in my life. The anthology series created by Jonathan Sims and Alexander J. Newall has a dedicated fanbase thanks to its blend of interesting characters, clinical office drudgery, dry British humor, and horror stories slowly weaving a tapestry of human suffering and cosmic terror. It, ironically, was a place of comfort for me during Covid lockdown.</p>

<p>So I had to see how Monte Cooke Games would adapt it into a TTRPG. The result is a game that is the Cypher System's answer to <em>Call of Cthulhu </em>or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arkham-horror-roleplaying-game-review-very-specific-but-good-gateway" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Arkham Horror</em></a>. Thanks to some smart design decisions and a dedication to the source material's core themes, this is a licensed RPG that manages to appease fans while giving general players room for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/good-haunting-beginning-horror-tabletop-rpgs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">their horrific imaginations</a> to run wild.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-investigator-artwork.jpg?itok=7NnNW0RT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-investigator-artwork.jpg?itok=jROGPg8B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The wound wasn't self-inflicted, but there is no sign of forced entry....</figcaption></figure><h2>The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game – Another Day At The Office</h2>

<p>In <em>The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game</em>, players take on the roles of employees at the Magnus Institute, an organization dedicated to archiving and investigating supernatural accounts.</p>

<p>But for every overworked college student who claimed to see a ghost or some conspiracy theorist going on about shadowy government dealings, there are statements that demand further investigation.</p>

<p>Missing persons cases. Serial killers with strange motives. A string of unexplained phenomena around urban legends or mysterious books. These are the statements where the players' skills are greatly tested.</p>

<p>As these investigations continue, the players will uncover dark secrets at the heart of the world. Cults. Artifacts on untold power. World-changing Rituals. All of these are tied in one way or another to eldritch horrors known as Entities. As the players dive further into this world of madness and horror, they will learn to fight back against these Entities and their followers, forever changing in the process. That is, assuming they survive that long.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-flood-of-spiders.jpg?itok=dXtiMYNL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-flood-of-spiders.jpg?itok=ZdWwzfMm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Obviously, go over Lines and Veils. Especially for the arachnophobes.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game – Gazing Into The Abyss</h2>

<p>Character creation in <em>The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game</em> is similar to other games that use the Cypher System. Your character is determined by four Types: Occultist, Elocutionist, Investigator, and Protector, and are made more distinct with Descriptors and Foci. Each character has three stats each with a pool of points. These points can be spent to use certain abilities or provide bonuses to dice rolls.</p>

<p>Each investigation in <em>The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game</em> is broken up into two parts. First is The Statement. This is a written statement submitted to the Institute by someone describing something unusual that happened to them. The statement can be written in isolation by the GM or it can be made collaboratively by all players at the table with final adjustments made by the GM.</p>

<p>The second part is The Investigation. Using the Statement as a reference, the players go into the field, checking areas of interest, interviewing eyewitnesses, or finding corroborating evidence. This investigation usually ends with the group encountering something supernatural, leading to a dangerous chase or fight for their lives.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-devouring-shadow.jpg?itok=gC9mC5xy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-devouring-shadow.jpg?itok=lXZUMnaJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Who would believe this? Even with video.</figcaption></figure><p>Overall, this structure is great at building atmosphere. <em>Magnus Archives</em> fans should be familiar with The Statement portion; it was the main structure of the podcast after all. The Investigation serves as the second half of a horror story where all the intrigue and suspense pays off with jump scares, existential revelations, or bloody violence.</p>

<p>It is where the <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> parallels are apparent. This is most obvious in the introduction of the Stress system. Players gain Stress from both minor and major events during an investigation. Getting lightly cut on broken glass. Witnessing a person sink into a pool of brackish water. Being trapped in a corridor that goes on forever. Reading a certain book.</p>

<p>When Stress hits certain levels, their skill rolls are hindered. At higher levels, Stress can cause physical damage or even outright kill players. Lastly, relieving Stress will take time, leading to persistent maintenance.</p>

<p>The Stress system is the mechanical highlight of <em>The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game</em>. It's an elegant addition to the Cypher System that conveys the game's cosmic horror roots</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-cavern-of-monsters.jpg?itok=Z2Y7hcPY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-cavern-of-monsters.jpg?itok=5pMKv77A 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's in your head. It can harm you. These facts aren't exclusive.</figcaption></figure><p>It doesn't undermine the core of Cypher thanks to small mechanical tweaks made in the system's foundation. For players, getting hurt doesn't drain a character's different resource Pools. Furthermore, reducing Stress is separate from a recovery roll, taking about an hour of in-game time.</p>

<p>On the GM side, there is a mechanic called Horror Mode. This mode, meant to signal a shift into danger and suspense for the party, can cause further Stress and even cascading complications if the dice turn bad. The result is that players can push their luck with more Effort but are harrowed by managing their mental health.</p>

<p>The latter is important since Stress can serve as a perverse form of character progression. Players are encouraged to keep track of how much Stress they have gained throughout a campaign, including the causes of that Stress. The reason for this is if a character gains a certain amount of Stress, they can gain access to supernatural powers. If they go further, that character may become an Avatar: a supernatural agent of an Entity.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-face-in-window.jpg?itok=q0QQyFVv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-face-in-window.jpg?itok=5V50Ole_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>What happens to those who embrace The Darkness?</figcaption></figure><p>It makes for great drama. An extroverted character turns into an Avatar of The Lonely, isolating themselves from their peers until vanishing from sight. Highly individualistic investigators getting twisted into caricatures by The Stranger. The list goes on.</p>

<p>It's a well-thought-out system. Avatars have access to terrifying powers like boiling people from the inside or changing their bodies into deadly claws, but every time they call upon this power, they gain Stress. And Avatar or not, Stress can still kill.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-coffin-artwork.jpg?itok=aNpjAzp4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-coffin-artwork.jpg?itok=PgajGqsf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Do you listen to the warning, or the scratches coming from inside?</figcaption></figure><h2>The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game – Adaptation and Inspiration</h2>

<p>Monte Cook Games' went the extra mile with The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game. As an adaptation of the source material, the book does a great job of portraying the world of the Magnus Institute and its various characters. The book is well-formatted, making rules reference quick and painless. The artwork is stunning, portraying iconic sequences from the podcast courtesy of Bear Weiter, Roberto Pitturu, and Javier P. Beltran.</p>

<p>On the fan service side of things, just about every iconic artifact and monster from <em>The Magnus Archives</em> is represented in this core rulebook. There's an entire section of the book dedicated to the library of Jurgen Leitner from <em>The Boneturner's Tale</em> to <em>The Seven Lamps of Architecture</em>. The book's bestiary also contains memorable monsters like the NotThem, the Monster Pig, and The Man Who Wasn't There. There are even entries for entities and artifacts mentioned in throwaway lines like a certain spooky wardrobe.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-man-who-wasnt-there.jpg?itok=MG18i47W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-man-who-wasnt-there.jpg?itok=GIAus2BW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Oh how I'd wish he would go away....</figcaption></figure><p>But these inclusions are expected for a licensed RPG. What puts <em>The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game</em> on another level is how it uses the text of the source material to give its players carte blanche in its world.</p>

<p>One section of the book discusses the broad story beats of all five seasons of the podcast, including its apocalyptic finale. Near the end of this recap, it explicitly states that due to the nature of how the podcast ends, there are multiple parallel realities where the Entities are free to spread their terror anew. Essentially, every campaign in <em>The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game</em> is an alternate reality where things play out differently.</p>

<p>That malleability is a persistent feature. Major characters don't have stat blocks; they are represented as archetypes. Jurgen Leitner is The Book Collector, Mikaele Salesa is The Artefact Dealer, Michael/Helen is The Distortion. This means your campaign can have different characters fill in these archetypes as you wish, keeping your campaigns interesting for both fans and newcomers alike.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-the-archivist.jpg?itok=rCYoCbmc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-the-archivist.jpg?itok=naa0Q1QT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Archivist looking over records? Who is he? You tell me.</figcaption></figure><p>This extends to monsters as well. There are simple but effective rules for creating original monsters and mixing and matching elements of different Entities. The book even has suggestions for adapting famous myths like Bloody Mary or The Hat Man.</p>

<p>This express permission to adapt and change made my home campaign all the more memorable. Instead of working for The Magnus Institute, my players were hired by The Usher Foundation, the US-based sister institution. Thanks to some tweaks provided by the core rulebook, the switch in location and voice felt like a natural extension of the <em>Magnus</em> universe. For someone whose GM style errs more on creative expression than adherence to text, it is a design decision I cannot praise enough.</p>

It's polite to knock.</figcaption></figure><h2>Should I Pick Up <em>The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game</em>?</h2>

<p><em>The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game</em> may just be my favorite cosmic horror TTRPG. It takes the foundation of the award-winning podcast series and expands it with both reverence and creativity. In addition, it adds a welcome layer of horror to Monte Cook's accessible Cypher System.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a new twist on stale Lovecraftian tropes, check this book out. Statement ends.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/civilization-7-dlc-and-roadmap-revealed-by-developers/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The post-launch roadmap and DLC for Civilization 7 have been revealed. During a special 90-minute stream on Thursday, developer Firaxis announced the plans for the game through its first nine months.</p>



<p>The reveal came after a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/civilization-7-dlc-leaked-ahead-of-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">media outlet leaked details</a> of the first few post-launch leaders and civilizations ahead of the announcement. </p>



<p>Civilization 7 will launch in “early access” on February 6 and will include a Day 0 Patch for those who buy the Deluxe and Founders Edition of the game. For everyone else, it will be available starting February 11.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>From there come the planned “Collections”.</p>



<p>March brings the first DLC with the Crossroads of the World Collection. In Early March, Release 1 introduces Ada Lovelace as a new leader, along with Carthage and Great Britain as playable civilizations and four new natural wonders. A major update—Update 1.1.0—will also roll out, featuring the Natural Wonder Battle event and the addition of the Bermuda Triangle as a new wonder. Later in the month, Release 2 brings Simon Bolivar, along with Bulgaria and Nepal, plus more free content, including the Marvelous Mountains event and Mount Everest as a new natural wonder.</p>



<p>At some point between April and September, the Right to Rule Collection expands the game even further, introducing two new leaders, four new civilizations, and four new world wonders. Free content updates will also continue, adding new events, challenges, and updates for all players.</p>



<p>Firaxis also promised more updates for players in October and beyond for the first Civilization game in nine years. </p>



<p>A specific release date for the Crossroads of the World collection will be announced in the coming weeks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/god-is-a-geek-calvin-robinson-nazi-salute-elon-musk<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you hadn’t heard of <a href="https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/ideas/media/65518/conspiracy-theorist-cleric-calvin-robinson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">far-right, anti-immigration priest</a> Calvin Robinson before, he likely ended up on your radar this week when he <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rightwingwatch.bsky.social/post/3lgvoqwtlcc2a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">performed a conspicuously Nazi-looking salute</a> – which conservatives are attempting to rebrand as “the Elon Musk salute” – on stage at the National Pro-Life Summit in Washington DC. Robinson has spent years making a name for himself on the right-wing media circuit, appearing on Britain’s GB News, popping up next to figures like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/ChrsLybjm6u/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tucker Carlson</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCCCyhIRMkP/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donald Trump</a>, and responding to accusations that he’s a conspiracy theorist by calling the label a “<a href="https://x.com/calvinrobinson/status/1572549758614671361" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">badge of honor</a>.” Before all that, though, Robinson was a games journalist, and he still owns a website he founded and wrote for, <a href="https://www.godisageek.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God Is A Geek</a>. Today, the editorial staff of that site announced that they’re quitting.</p><p>God Is A Geek is a long-running site that focuses on gaming news, reviews, videos, and podcasts and <a href="https://www.godisageek.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prides itself on</a> “a diverse, passionate team with all manner of tastes.” Though GIAG’s following is relatively small, it regularly receives review, preview, and interview access from the video game industry, with its reviews appearing on Metacritic, as well as those fawning review score promo posters publishers love to trot out after games’ releases even though nobody’s heard of half the websites on them. GIAG’s coverage is standard stuff; the writing is not particularly hard hitting, but neither does it seem to have slipped down the <a href="https://aftermath.site/sweet-baby-detected-conspiracy-theory-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DEI-obsessed rabbit hole</a> that its affiliation with Robinson might suggest.</p><p>According to GIAG’s <a href="https://www.godisageek.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privacy policy</a>, the site is owned by LDN.CM, a publishing company whose <a href="http://ldn.cm/team.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">team page</a> lists just two members: Ruk Cooray and Calvin Robinson. Robinson <a href="https://www.godisageek.com/author/calvin-robinson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contributed articles and videos</a> to GIAG beginning all the way back in 2009, but has not done so since 2019, which is also when LDN dissolved, according to records viewed by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/game-site-denies-founder-has-day-to-day-involvement-after-he-imitates-elon-musk-salute/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VGC</a>. While Robinson maintained ownership of the site after that, "Calvin Robinson has no involvement with the site on a day-to-day basis whatsoever," according to an unnamed representative of God Is A Geek who replied to Aftermath’s inquiries via the site’s PR email. I also asked if the site’s team would issue any sort of statement in response to Robinson’s salute or general conduct; the representative said that "The editorial team will make no further comment."</p><p>Aftermath reached out to Cooray and Robinson for more information about LDN’s ownership of the site and Robinson’s involvement in its operations, but did not receive a response as of this publishing.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.godisageek.com/2025/01/godisageek-official-statement-from-the-editorial-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a statement posted to God Is A Geek</a>, the site’s staff reiterated that Robinson did not actively participate in its operations, but that they nonetheless felt compelled by his recent actions to cease publication entirely.</p><p>“We have run the site independently of Calvin for several years now in the hopes that we would not have to lose the hard work we have poured into it, the access we have worked hard for, and the relationships we have developed,” God Is A Geek’s editorial team wrote. “However, it has become increasingly clear that we can no longer separate the site from the owner. As a result, the entire editorial team will be stepping down with immediate effect. We will create a new site and our future content will be published there, bereft of any connection to Calvin Robinson. It will be hard to start again, hard to walk away from the work we’ve done here off our own backs, but this is the right thing to do.”</p><p>At the National Pro-Life Summit, Robinson delivered his gesture to the audience with a knowing nod, saying “My heart goes out to you” before touching his hand to his chest and extending his arm. It was the culmination of a speech about “the last stand for the West” and “the last stand for Christendom” in which he positioned America as “the only country fighting for life.” The audience ate it up, laughing and cheering as if to demonstrate a clear understanding of what Robinson was going for.&nbsp;</p><p>Hours later, the Anglican Catholic Church revoked Robinson’s license.</p><p>"While we cannot say what was in Mr. Robinson’s heart when he did this, his action appears to have been an attempt to curry favor with certain elements of the American political right by provoking its opposition,” the ACC <a href="https://anglicancatholic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said in a statement on its website</a>. “Mr. Robinson had been warned that online trolling and other such actions (whether in service of the left or right) are incompatible with a priestly vocation and was told to desist. Clearly, he has not, and as such, his license in this Church has been revoked. He is no longer serving as a priest in the ACC."</p><p>Online, Robinson received the same reaction as Musk before him, the same one pretty much all far-right figures are going for when they deploy a Nazi salute: outrage, which they can then farm for more engagement by hopping on their high horse and feigning ironic distance from <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/27/nx-s1-5276084/elon-musk-german-far-right-afd-holocaust" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ideals in which they very much believe</a>.</p><p>"Today I received hundreds of nasty calls, texts, voicemails and emails today from very bitter, angry, vile leftists," Robinson <a href="https://x.com/calvinrobinson/status/1884737392537403840" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Twitter</a>, where he later went on to call the salute a "<a href="https://x.com/calvinrobinson/status/1884822896951857300" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joke</a>." "They are often the very thing they accuse you of. I am not a Nazi.
