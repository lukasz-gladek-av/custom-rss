<p>The US Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) has called a strike by voice actors on work with key video game publishers and developers, pushing back against proposed contracts that would enable the use of AI generated voices and performances in video games. However, work can continue on games deep into production… for now.</p>


<p>The ten companies facing the strike are Activision, Blindlight, Disney Character Voices, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, Formosa Interactive, Insomniac Games, Take 2 Productions, VoiceWorks Productions, and WB Games.</p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher said, “We’re not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse A.I. to the detriment of our members. Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live — and work — with, we will be here, ready to negotiate.”</p>
<p>Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland added in a separate statement, “The video game industry generates billions of dollars in profit annually. The driving force behind that success is the creative people who design and create those games. That includes the SAG-AFTRA members who bring memorable and beloved game characters to life, and they deserve and demand the same fundamental protections as performers in film, television, streaming, and music: fair compensation and the right of informed consent for the AI use of their faces, voices, and bodies. Frankly, it’s stunning that these video game studios haven’t learned anything from the lessons of last year – that our members can and will stand up and demand fair and equitable treatment with respect to AI, and the public supports us in that.”</p>

<p>As a rebuttal, a spokesperson for the video game producers group said, “We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we remain prepared to resume negotiations. We have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and additional safety provisions. Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA’s concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry.”</p>
<p>It could take a while for the effects of this to be truly felt. Per Kotaku’s <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1816797825444753673">Ethan Gach</a>, games that have been in development for more than a year, and live service games can continue with union actors, though new and early projects cannot. Given that games can now very easily take 5 years to complete, there’s plenty room for this strike to escalate, especially as motion capture is a time consuming endeavour.</p>
<p>Given the timing, SAG-AFTRA has said that actors can take part in San Diego Comic Con panels which run through this weekend. Ordinarily all promotional work would also be halted, from awards shows to conventions and even social media posts.</p>
<p>The strike comes <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/09/sag-aftra-approve-strike-video-game-industry-1235555756/">ten months after members voted to authorise a strike</a>, and in the wake of the 2023 strike by SAG-AFTRA actors for TV and film, in which the use of generative AI and digital recreation were key points. Where the TV and film strike was also concerned with residual payments and the like, it’s the threat that generative AI poses to almost the entire video game voice actor industry that is really in the limelight here.</p>
<p>Generative AI has come on leaps and bounds in the last few years, and while still a million miles away from what we would traditionally think of as being AI – that’d be a self-aware computer, as opposed to what would more accurately be called ‘Machine Learning’ – it is already capable of synthesising a person’s voice from relatively few audio samples. There’s still things like needing to be able to convey emotion and the nuances of a performance and reading, but developers have already been using generative AI for things like the announcer in extraction shooter <a href="https://gamerant.com/the-finals-beta-criticized-ai-voices-voice-acting/">The Finals in open beta</a>, where a somewhat robotic performance is fairly in keeping with the tone of the game, and other titles have also used AI as placeholder until the latter stages of development.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve-overhauls-steam-demos-with-separate-store-pages-and-more.937614/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-overhauls-steam-demos<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve has announced a new Steam update which will overhaul the way demos work on the storefront, so you should start seeing some changes to demos soon.</p>
<p>The update isn't a client-side one, so you won't have anything new to download. Rather, it's bringing a new suite of tools that devs and publishers can use to make demos "an even more powerful and flexible marketing tool", according to Valve.</p>
<p>First up, demos can now be added to your library without downloading them; a new "add to library" button has been added to demo pages beside the "download" button, so you can set them up for downloading later if you prefer.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steam-demo-overhaul-new-page.jpg?itok=d2bYZrna 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steam-demo-overhaul-new-page.jpg?itok=f0X3bvQw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can now add Steam demos to your library to play them later.</figcaption></figure><p>It's now possible for publishers to create a separate store page for their demos if they wish. At the moment, any demo listings on Steam simply redirect to the main game's page, but in future, you might start seeing distinct pages for game demos.</p>
<p>As a result of this, it's also possible for user reviews to start appearing on separate demo pages, which should be a good way to give players a better idea of whether a demo is worth installing or not. Hey, it's all valuable storage space!</p>
<p>Valve says that demos will also start appearing more often on Steam store lists like New &amp; Trending, New on Steam, and "relevant tag and category pages".</p>
<p>In essence, this means that when developers and publishers launch a demo on Steam, it'll be treated more like a full free game (in terms of listings and visibility, at least) than a straightforward demo.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steam-demo-overhaul-new-trending.jpg?itok=pZCDwax9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steam-demo-overhaul-new-trending.jpg?itok=xf6Gv9MG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You may well start seeing demos on Steam's New &amp; Trending page soon.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're a developer and you're wondering what else you might need to know as a result of this demo overhaul, make sure to check out Valve's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4155211502162971563" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full announcement</a> for some extra details, plus an amusingly-titled "infrequently asked questions" section.</p>
<p>This demo overhaul follows on from a newly-introduced Steam feature in the form of new game recording tools, which were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-game-recording-beta">introduced in beta back in June</a>. Given that Steam players once again <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-player-count-record-sale">broke the platform's concurrent user total</a> during this year's summer sale, it seems these features are still in high demand.</p>

            <p>
This week on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a>, we discuss the downsides and upsides of the video game battle pass.
</p>
<p>In a week where PlayStation live-service hopeful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-next-live-service-sci-fi-shooter-concord-wont-have-a-battle-pass">Concord trumpeted the fact it won't sell you a battle pass as a marketing beat</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apex-legends-studio-u-turns-on-controversial-real-money-battle-pass-changes">Apex Legends dialled back (some of) its battle pass changes</a> following fan fury, we consider the options available to video game makers hoping to ensure their latest releases keep being played - and paid for - well after release.</p>
<p>Would more people play Concord if it was a free-to-play title with a battle pass? Or is it better served by being a £40 launch? Not everyone can promise they'll <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-will-never-charge-money-for-dlc-or-updates">never sell post-launch content, as Stardew Valley's creator did</a> this week. But there's clearly a balance to be struck to ensure players don't feel fleeced, particularly when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-will-have-a-battle-pass-limited-to-cosmetics-report">full-priced launches like Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> are getting in on the act too. Joining me this week are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy to discuss.</p>

			<p>Remnant II, a 2023 game, has been announced to receive its third and final DLC. This announcement accompanies the game's first anniversary, which has been over a year. The DLC will be titled The Dark Horizon and released in September 2024.&nbsp; This DLC will take players back to the depths of N'Erud, where a peculiar phenomenon has taken over the surrounding area, and it's up to you to uncover it.</p>
<p>Originally, Gunfire Games, the developer behind Remnant II, wanted all three DLCs released by the game's first anniversary. However, they have since decided to delay the third DLC. They do this to make the DLC as polished as possible and "deliver you the best possible experience you deserve."</p>
<p>The Dark Horizon, the third DLC, is set to be the most expansive of the three that Remnant II will receive. Players can expect to see more of "the Remnant greatness you've come to expect." In addition to the DLC in progress, they are creating a brand-new game mode that will be free to everyone who owns Remnant II.</p>
<p>While the upcoming game mode has minimal details, Gunfire Games has revealed that a new progression system will be specifically tailored to it. The developers say they will reveal more information about this game mode and The Dark Horizon DLC "soon."</p>
<p>Gunfire Games&nbsp;<span>has&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1282100/view/4364635226638976270" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressed their sadness</a> in having to delay the DLC, going on to say, "While we're not happy about delaying this DLC release -- one you've been itching to jump into already—</span>we feel very lucky to see your ongoing support and loyalty to the Remnant franchise." While they go on to express their joy at the positivity pouring out from the Remnant community, Steam's reviews suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>Both currently released DLCs have mixed reviews, while Remnant II has a primarily positive rating. Regarding The Forgotten Kingdom, players felt that the DLC was more of the same as the base game and couldn't distinguish the difference between the two. In addition, because it lacked a proper end-game, players struggled to see where this DLC slotted in.</p>
<p>Compared to The Forgotten Kingdom, The Awakened King receives slightly better reviews. While players found boss fights enjoyable, they said the area needed to be tuned better. The reasons for tuning were split; some said the bosses were too strong, while others said they were too weak. In addition, players felt it recycled content and assets from the base game rather than giving the DLC its flair.</p>
<p>While Gunfire Games does not specify a specific date for releasing more information on the new DLC, they promise that it will be soon.</p>

<p>Esports is experiencing rapid growth in India, garnering increasing interest from the younger generation as a viable career path. Mobile gaming prevails as the dominant sector within the Indian esports landscape, with most gamers favouring this platform over PC or console gaming.</p>



<p>As a result, games such as BGMI, COD Mobile, and Free Fire hold greater prominence than Dota 2 or LoL. Furthermore, the best Indian esports teams actively engage in mobile gaming competitions, recognizing this platform as pivotal for engaging the audience. Let us now explore some of the top esports games in India.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-bgmi">BGMI</h2>



<p>The battle royale game developed by Krafton is arguably one of India’s most popular esports titles. The game has a turbulent history, as it first replaced Tencent’s battle royale title when PUBG, along with a host of other Chinese applications, was banned from the country in 2022. Later, BGMI was banned from India in 2022 and returned to Android and iOS stores in May 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since its triumphant return, BGMI has regained its former glory and surpassed it, hosting some of India’s most intense and watched esports competitions in recent months. The game’s revival has been nothing short of a spectacle, with top tournaments like the BGMI Masters Series, BGIS, Skyesports Champions Series, and more drawing in massive audiences.</p>



<h2 id="h-valorant-nbsp">Valorant&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Despite the overwhelming dominance of mobile gaming in India, Valorant has managed to carve a niche among the best esports games in India. The game’s unique 5v5 FPS tactical shooter format, coupled with Riot’s strategic promotional efforts, has piqued the interest of Indian gamers. The introduction of an Indian hero, Harbor, has further bolstered the game’s popularity, promising an exciting future for Valorant in the Indian esports scene.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Valorant is one of the few non-mobile games that has made its mark in the country, and Riot will soon make an effort to make their other premier esports game, League of Legends, one of the top esports games in India. Some Valorant competitions where the best Indian esports teams play include the Valorant Challengers Series, Skyesports League, and more.&nbsp;</p>







<h2 id="h-pokemon-unite">Pokemon UNITE</h2>



<p>Back to my point of the top esports in India residing in mobile games, Pokemon UNITE is the next game on the list. Pokemon UNITE burst into the Indian esports scene in 2021, and many players jumped onto the free-to-play MOBA Pokemon game. Since then, it has become a favourite at esports competitions in the country. The famous esports tournaments for this game include Pokemon UNITE Pro League, Pokemon UNITE Championship Series and more.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-counter-strike-2">Counter-Strike 2</h2>



<p>Counter-Strike has always been a fan favourite in the Indian esports scene, with CS: GO being one of the most popular esports games in the country. Counter-Strike is close to most Indian gamers’ hearts as it is one of the first multiplayer games that most gamers come across, thanks to the country’s cybercafe culture.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Counter-Strike 2 - Official Launch Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c80dVYcL69E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>However, Counter-Strike 2 is still relatively new, and there have been hardly any esports competitions in India until now. At the same time, Valve’s first-person shooter has much global history in the esports scene, and the game will pick up in India in the coming years. Popular esports CS2 competitions include Skyesports Championship, Skyesports Masters, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-cod-mobile">COD Mobile</h2>



<p>Lastly, we have COD Mobile, Tencent’s popular mobile port for Activision’s flagship first-person shooter. COD Mobile took India by storm when it was released, setting staggering first-week download records. Naturally, the game became a staple in Indian esports tournaments, boasting intense action and top-notch first-person gameplay for mobile gaming titles.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Call of Duty®: Mobile - Official Launch Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n4b8FRUDNZo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>COD Mobile fans have several tournaments to watch in India, including the Call of Duty Mobile India Cup, Call of Duty Mobile India Challenge, Snapdragon Pro Series and more.&nbsp;This diversity makes it one of the top Indian esports.</p>



<h2 id="h-honourable-mention">Honourable Mention</h2>



<p>When compiling a list of the top esports games in India, one cannot overlook Garena’s Free Fire, a beloved title in the esports community. Despite its ban, announcing an India-specific version of Free Fire on the horizon has reignited hope and anticipation among fans.</p>



<figure><p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-_tfogwUsU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new trailer</a> released today, Mediatonic announced a new Star Wars collaboration is coming to Fall Guys on July 30, 2024.</p>



<p>The crossover will feature Darth Maul, Padme Amidala, Yoda, and R2-D2. Like previous collaborations, today’s cinematic trailer for the new characters makes it clear that the upcoming content requires in-game purchases. </p>



<p>While Mediatonic did not confirm the exact pricing, fans can likely speculate based on past crossovers.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Previously, Fall Guys focused on the original trilogy for May the 4th this year with characters like Captain Han Solo and Boba Fett. </p>



<p>There were also additions specifically based on The Empire Strikes Back, such as a Carbon Freezing Chamber. Today’s cinematic trailer didn’t hint at similar content for the prequel era, though it did hint at some possible emotes.</p>



<p>The new crossover does suggest even more Star Wars collaborations could arrive in the future, such as sequel trilogy or series-based content.</p>



<p>Most recently, Fall Guys finally released its delayed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-fall-guys-collaboration-arrives-in-uefn-following-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collaboration in Fortnite</a> for the major v30.30 update, welcoming many new fans to the game.</p>



<p>Fortnite players can now build Fall Guys islands with UEFN and Fortnite Creative. Fans can publish those islands beginning August 6, 2024.</p>



<p>Just today, publisher Epic Games also unveiled its new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/epic-games-reveals-new-plans-for-mobile-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plans for mobile gaming</a>, ahead of its return to the iOS store in the EU.</p>

			<p>Dark Souls: The Board Game – The Sunless City is a new take on the tabletop adaptation, aiming to make the rules easier to grasp, while also featuring the most iconic location from the original video game: Anor Londo. As a long-time fan of dying a lot in video games, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> is an important series to me, and having also played the standard version of The Board Game, I’m happy to report that it’s definitely a little more player-friendly, while not removing any of the lethality.</p>
<p>Let’s go over what you get in the box though, because that’s pretty important for a board game. You get fifteen enemy minis with three of those being bosses. Calling the bosses “miniature” feels a little off to be honest, given that you can fight against a Titanite Demon, and then the classic duo of Ornstein and Smough, and they’re all massive. You also get three player classes – Herald, Warrior, and Pyromancer – and then a bunch of new cards covering your equipment and spells.</p>



<p>What’s really cool, is that even though the rules do take a new approach, it’s all backwards compatible. That means that you can bring in pieces from other sets you have, and that’ll unlock new classes, more boss fights, and enemies in general. We’re a big fan of this approach, because it means that the money anybody has spent on the first generation of the game isn’t wasted.</p>
<p>You can play this solo and still have a lot of fun, but can also bring up to two of your friends in to help tackle the might of Anor Londo. You’ll have to overcoming different encounters, which are decided by drawing Encounter Cards to decide on what you’ll be fighting in any given room, along with the loot that you’ll be getting as well. The Titanite Demon then stands as a mini-boss of sorts, with the big duo serving as the climactic final fight.</p>


<p>It can feel odd that, without a dedicated player for the bad guys, you have to both control them and try to overcome them, though it’s all handled by a deck of cards that serves as their attack pattern. You’ll need to learn the order of the cards, which you shuffle each time you play the game to keep it fresh, and then think ahead about what attacks are coming, and where you’ll need to be. You can also, if you want, carry your progress on into other expansions to keep games going longer, even serving as a way to allow for a month-long campaign. You don’t have to though, and that’s one of the things that makes this special.</p>

		Dark Souls The Board Game The Sunless City is a great new take on the already solid board game, and the classic setting, incredibly boss design, and beautiful minis only help to maintain a really high level of polish. Throw in compatibility to the original, and you've got a board game that'll keep fans incredibly happy and also serves as a good on-ramp for newer players as well.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-dating-sim<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Team17 and developer Sassy Chap Games have announced&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!</em>, a dating sim where the studios claim you can, in fact, date everything.</p>
<p>According to a press release, the game "whisks players off into a world where everyday objects transform into romantic possibilities". If you've ever found yourself idly wishing you could romance your laundry basket, your vacuum cleaner, or even the very air you breathe, this is the game for you.</p>
<p>With the help of special "Dateviator" (surely that should be Avidater?) glasses, you'll chat up everyday objects around your home to see if any of them spark joy, so to speak.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/date-everything-dating-sim-hoove.jpg?itok=srkdDOGS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/date-everything-dating-sim-hoove.jpg?itok=HxGzgqXS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The possibilities for jokes here are endless.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>is being made by Sassy Chap Games, a new studio formed by "a group of well-recognized voice actors" like&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XV</em>'s Ray Chase and <i>Persona 5</i>'s Max Mittelman, among others.</p>
<p>As such, the game will feature 100 "fully voiced datable characters", as well as branching dialogue with multiple endings for each character.</p>
<p>Sassy Chap says that each romance path will have three potential outcomes, Love, Friend, or Hate, and each one will lead to a different resolution, which creates what the studio calls "an endless panoply of playthroughs".</p>
<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>right here. It'll give you a good idea of what you're in for, as well as which of your suddenly-not-inanimate waifus and husbandos you'd like to romance.</p>

<p>All of the characters mentioned above will have their own themes, and more than 11,000 hand-drawn images will bring them and their environments to life.</p>
<p>You'll also be able to fully interact with a 3D overworld that will change based on the choices you make throughout your run, so it won't just be the kind of static visual novel you might be used to from the dating sim world.</p>
<p><em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date yet, but when it lands, it'll arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201320/Date_Everything/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch. If you're a fan of games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hooked-on-you-dead-by-daylight-dating-sim"><em>Hooked on You</em></a>, then you owe it to yourself to keep an eye on this one.</p>

Combat, or specifically, engaging with enemies has been given a redesign to bring it up to the standards of, once again,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil 4,&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">however, this clashes with the act of survival horror and gives us the easiest distinction between action and survival horror design.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Power vs. Powerless">Power vs. Powerless</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I've talked a lot about the power fantasy distinction in horror and action design in my book on the genre and previous posts. Depiction and intent are important aspects to comprehend if you're designing a horror game. Some people will say that any game that features "monsters" is supposed to be scary, but we know that's not the case.&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Doom Eternal</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;has monsters...demons actually, but the player is not supposed to be scared.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil 4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, both the original and remake, brought to the table was a rethinking of what you could do in a horror setting. Leon in both versions is very capable -- he can headshot, he can perform wrestling moves, he can counter almost anything with his knife. So while the player is in a spooky area, fighting spooky people, the game is not meant to be scary. The player is in, or should be in, control of any situation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">remaster, several things I noticed that gave me pause during the trailer was a greater focus on i-frame dodging, James's ability to stun an enemy before going in for a finishing blow like Leon, and in the extended trailer watching a nurse auto counter James after attacking too much.</span></p><p>Good horror has to strike balance between giving the player power and making them helpless (source IGN)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's easy to think that improving the combat, or creating new combat mechanics, is going to make the game better, but it also clashes with one of the most essential tenets of good horror design -- you&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>DON'T</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;want to be fighting.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Overcorrecting Horror">Overcorrecting Horror</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Two over corrections happened with horror design in the 2010's. Following the success of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil 4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;in the prior decade, designers started to really push the idea of combat as a focus for horror such as in&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dead Space</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;and the later Evils. Even&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>F.E.A.R.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;which is still highly regarded went for this idea of a military shooter meets Japanese horror.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The other was a complete denouncement of the prior trend by smaller and indie studios. One of the most famous for that time was Frictional Games, who after the release of the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Penumbra</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;series went on to hit it big with&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Amnesia: The Dark Descent</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amnesia-designer-removing-combat-opens-up-new-horizons/1100-6328973/">In interviews after the fact</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the co-founder often said they wanted to move away from combat/fighting in horror games as it was hurting the experience. Soon after, every single indie developer went a similar route with the likes of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FNAF</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">,&nbsp;and more horror games than I can count today.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some may put combat in as kind of a boss fight or end-game option, but for most of the gameplay, the player is not fighting or engaging with the enemies in any way. Looking back on both styles, the developers are wrong for different reasons. With the action side, the more the player is allowed to engage with enemies from a position of power, the less horror there is. You know a game is not meant to be scary, such as in&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dead Space</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where most of the encounters are arena fights that put the combat front and center. With&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Callisto Protocol</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I said in my review that it was a good action game, but a terrible horror game for how combat devolved into a&nbsp;dodging mini-game.</span></p><p>Resident Evil 4 wants to have it both ways in terms of survival and action, but still leans more on being powerful than powerless (source author)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From the other side of the equation, having no combat or direct interaction with the enemies presents a different problem. It creates this black-or-white state&nbsp;that the player is either 100% safe or 100% dead. When the player knows that there is nothing else they can reasonably do, the sense of horror is replaced with a sense of frustration getting stuck at a spot repeatedly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From a gameplay standpoint, it makes these horror games become exceptionally repetitive because there is only one "right way" to get through these encounters. If you watch high-level play of something like&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FNAF</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, you're not engaging with the game anymore, you are performing a fixed set of actions designed to counter the AI behavior of the enemy, not the enemy itself. In the past, I've equated horror like this to a haunted house, and in my opinion, that's not good horror design.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With the footage I saw from&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Remaster</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the developers are obviously leaning towards the former, but this betrays several aspects of survival horror design that I don't see a lot of developers doing justice to.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Scrapping By">Scrapping By</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Survival horror, as the name implies, is about "survival". This is not supposed to be about the Doom Slayer ripping and tearing through monsters, just as it isn't about someone being chased by cannibalistic monsters and deciding not to pick up any of the knives, swords, clubs, or chainsaws they find around.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is a very narrow place for where combat should fall in a survival horror game. It is meant to be a tool, but not "the tool" the player can use. If combat is too powerful, then it becomes the best option in any encounter if the player can just fight their way passed everything. If it's too weak or nonexistent, then the player doesn't have a way of interacting with the creatures. A good example of this philosophy would be the survival items from&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil 1 Remaster</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, they allow the player to fight enemies a bit more safely than before, but they are still limited in their use.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What you want to see in a good horror setting is that fighting is allowed, but you do not want to be doing it. There needs to be a credible risk to fighting enemies to the player's health, resources, or both. The horror in these games is a form of the same horror seen in every soulslike where the player is in uncharted territory with a ton of souls -- that risk that in any fight or situation, they could lose everything. Combat needs to be messy and chaotic, not something that you can hone your skills at like in&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sekiro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;where there is a legitimate challenge to get through the game, and games like it, hitless.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That also means designing enemies whose only behavior isn't either "run at the player" or "run very fast at the player." Nemesis and Mr. X from&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;remakes are close to what I'm looking for, but they still feel more like a phase in the level design, rather than an active enemy. Once you know their behavior, they stop being a threat. Looking at the footage from the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2 Remake</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;trailer, the nurse was performing the same three-hit combo twice, which leads me to believe that combat is going to be mechanical in that respect.</span></p><p>The problem with Nemesis and Mr.X is that they still fall into set patterns for engagement (source Capcom)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a surprising twist, the closest a game has gotten to what I'm looking for in survival horror would be&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Amnesia: The Bunker</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The beast that stalks the player is something that can be engaged with in multiple organic ways -- you can set traps, use noise as bait, or just shoot the damn thing until it retreats. Being able to fight the creature or use the environment to your advantage gives the player a lot of options, and takes me to what I want to see as an evolution of horror.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Immsurvival">Immsurvival</h2><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w1sgpGoaOBk?si=yLegKBThoJqyauhV" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What I'm looking for as an evolution of horror design is not about making the game hard to control or have janky movement, but giving the player a variety of weapons and means of survival, and making them completely terrified to use any of them against whatever "thing" is coming after them. Returning to the idea of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Doom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;and push-forward combat, I had a crazy idea -- can you make a survival horror game where the player has infinite healing items and ammo by default, but still make it frightening to play?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I want the enemy designs to have as much freedom to use the environment as they see fit that the player does -- the trapper becoming the trappie to then turn it around on the player. I'm tired of games that only have fixed breakable sections where an enemy can show up -- I want the player to feel like 360 degrees around them is unsafe at all times.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Good horror design is about making the player fight themselves as much as they are fighting enemies and making the player too powerful or too weak ends up with a horror game with either too much or too little bite to it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For more about horror design, you can&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.routledge.com/Game-Design-Deep-Dive-Horror/Bycer/p/book/9780367721749">check out my Deep Dive</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;on it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>If you would like to support what I do and let me do more daily streaming, be sure to check out my&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="http://patreon.com/gwbycer">patreon</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/valve-reworks-steam-demos-to-create-more-powerful-and-flexible-marketing-tool-<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Valve is reconfiguring Steam demos to bolster their functionality as marketing tools. The changes are based on feedback from developers and players, altering how demos behave and appear on the Steam marketplace.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For starters, demos can now be added to Steam libraries without the need for an immediate install. A new 'add to library' button can be used to chuck demos into libraries from the mobile app or other places "where you may not be ready to install them immediately."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It will also be possible to install demos after purchasing the full game, making it easier for developers to test demos and help players manage their library.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another notable tweak will enable developers to create a separate store page for demos without impacting visibility. "By default, your free demo appears as a button on your base game's store page. But if you want to have a separate store page for your demo, you can now enable that in the 'edit store' section for your demo," reads a post from Valve.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Enabling a separate store page for your demo will give you space to better describe the contents of the demo, add screenshots, upload a trailer, and specify supported features. If you choose to enable a store page for your demo, you will also be enabling players of your demo to post user reviews that appear on your demo."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Valve says Steam will treat demos "mostly the same way" irrespective of whether they exist as a standalone page or not. That said, a standalone demo that garners negative reviews might be hamstrung in the same way as a full release.

<p>As reported <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/bioshock-movie-scaled-down-netflix-more-personal-1236085711/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Variety</a>, producer Roy Lee revealed today that Netflix lowered the budget for its BioShock movie adaptation, though it is still under way.</p>



<p>The update came up during a panel at San Diego Comic Con, which is currently running through July 28, 2024. Lee explained that “the new regime has lowered the budgets,” following the Netflix leadership shakeup.</p>



<p>They elaborated that as a result, the BioShock movie will feature “a more personal point of view, as opposed to a grander, big project.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Lee also broke down Netflix’s general new compensation strategy, with bonuses based on viewership numbers. The producer added that “it motivates the producers to actually do a movie that gets a bigger audience.”</p>



<p>Netflix first announced the BioShock adaptation a couple of years ago, but Hunger Games director Francis Lawrence remains attached. Although Lee described the film adaptation as a “much smaller version” today, that could potentially benefit the story in some ways.</p>



<p>The original BioShock launched in 2007 to critical acclaim, and the series continues to thrive. </p>



<p>Reportedly, 2K Cloud Chamber recently ramped up development on the next BioShock video game. Just two weeks ago, the studio began <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioshock-4-developer-hiring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hiring for 30 open positions</a> involving both cinematic and narrative experience.</p>



<p>At this time, the BioShock movie does not have a release window, though today’s update provides a better idea of the development timeline.</p>

    <p><span>New footage from ChinaJoy 2024.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Koei Tecmo Games [3,008 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/koei-tecmo-games">Koei Tecmo</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Omega Force [1,233 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/koei-tecmo-games/omega-force">Omega Force</a> have released the first storyline information, as well as new screenshots and footage of <em><a title="Games > Dynasty Warriors: Origins [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a></em>. The new footage was shown during a <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [45,567 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> booth stage event at ChinaJoy 2024, which runs from July 26 to 29 at Shanghai New International Expo Center in Shanghai, China. <span id="more-901464"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p>Promising to deliver the most intense <a title="Genres > Action [2,039 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> of any <em>Warriors</em> title to date, <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> introduces fans to a heroic martial artist destined to overcome the immense odds as he fights his way through waves of enemies across the battlefields of the ancient Three Kingdoms.</p><p><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> introduces a new, deeper interpretation of the traditional Three Kingdoms storyline, which depicts ancient Chinese history. The story begins the year before the Yellow Turban Rebellion, the dawn of an era of great upheaval, when the protagonist (voiced by Jun Fukuyama)—a martial artist with amnesia—visits a village suffering from famine. Here, he meets Zhang Jiao, a long-haired man who offers a helping hand to people, and Guan Yu, a bearded warrior who denounces the injustice of government officials, and together they fight against the forces of corrupt officials.</p><p>The immersive story is experienced through the amnesiac protagonist, weaving through history as a single hero. Throughout the game, episodes of the Three Kingdoms are described in greater clarity and detail, delivering a clear and engaging experience not only for fans of the <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em> and <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> franchises, but for those who have not experienced them before.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_901497"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> delivers an overwhelming sense of realism on every battlefield, with the largest number of soldiers in the series’ history, intermingled and fighting with their own individual wills. Enemy soldiers attacking in cooperation are extremely formidable, and you must not only fight with your own skills, but also charge forward with your allies to clear the way. Once you push up the battleline and are prepared to fight, you and your allies can charge into the massive armies of enemies, experiencing a sense of realism of the battlefield in an unprecedented scale where thousands of soldiers collide!</p><p>The protagonist of this title throws himself into the battlefield alongside the heroes of the Three Kingdoms, wiping out swarms of enemies using swords, fists, and various other weapons. By meeting certain conditions, players can temporarily control Guan Yu and other officers marching forth by your side. Officers with strength worthy of “exhilarating one vs. 1,000 action” will become the protagonist’s most reliable allies.</p><p>Away from combat, <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> displays the vast world of the Three Kingdoms on a continental map, enabling players to choose which battlefield to participate in. Also, players can interact with heroes and walk around freely on their way to the next major battlefield. </p></blockquote><p><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,531 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,731 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [20,734 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2384580/DYNASTY_WARRIORS_ORIGINS/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> in 2025.</p><p>Watch the footage below.

Ahead of the game's release next month, Angry Demon Studios has unveiled a one-of-a-kind Xbox Series X that features a luxurious--and hopefully synthetic--fur wrapping. This will be given away to one lucky winner who'll have a hard time explaining what it is whenever they have company.</p><p>While the design probably isn't great for keeping the Xbox console running at an optimum temperature, it does look like the fur can come off easily. This isn't the only piece of interesting gear created by the Gori devs, as fans can also check out a unique and furry Xbox controller that has a rectal charging port. We promise that we're not making this up with our irresponsible Photoshop powers.--though the controller isn't actually going to be available.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4341041-gori-controller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4341041" data-ratio="1" data-width="1080" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4341041-gori-controller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4341041"></a><figcaption>Your game developers were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4341041-gori-controller.jpg"></figure><p>Gori: Cuddly Carnage will launch for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Switch on August 29, and while it looks like a cuddly early-2000s platformer in the same vein as Blinx, it's a <em>little </em>bit different from what you'd expect.</p><p>As an anthropomorphic version of nature's greatest smooth-brained killing machine--a ginger household cat--it's up to you to slay an adorably evil army of unicorns in this hack-and-slash adventure that looks kind of cute and excessively violent.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/coral-island-switch-port-uncertain<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Coral Island&nbsp;</em>developer Stairway Games has thrown doubt on the future of the game's Switch port thanks to the recent "restructuring" of publisher Humble Games.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/coralislandgame/status/1816674043954925590" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a letter</a> to "console players" and "Switch backers especially" released on X (formerly Twitter), Stairway says that the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/humble-games-lays-off-over-30-employees-as-it-restructures">recent chaos at Humble</a> leaves "consoles in a place of uncertainty", as the developer doesn't handle updates and changes to&nbsp;<em>Coral Island&nbsp;</em>on non-PC platforms.</p>
<p>The studio says it shares players' frustrations regarding the lack of a&nbsp;<em>Coral Island&nbsp;</em>Switch port, and that there are a lot of things it's wanted to say "in the spirit of transparency", but that it's been unable to do so "because of the publishing agreement and NDA" it's got in place with Humble.</p>

<p>According to Stairway, the studio only has access to&nbsp;<em>Coral Island</em>'s Steam backend, and so updates like the upcoming hotfix for&nbsp;<em>Coral Island</em>'s 1.1 update can't be released on other platforms because the developer has "no idea how to get this update out".</p>
<p>Conversations are currently underway between Stairway and its lawyer in order to "figure out how to navigate this new situation", but sadly, that means some bad news for Switch backers.</p>
<p>If you backed&nbsp;<em>Coral Island&nbsp;</em>for a Switch code, then Stairway says you should <a href="mailto:contact@stairwaygames.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">email it</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://discord.com/invite/stairway" rel="noopener" target="_blank">join its Discord server</a>&nbsp;in order to swap your Switch code for a Steam key. These codes will be available for "as long as [Stairway is] able to" provide them.</p>

<p>There's also been an outpouring of support from other Humble-associated studios, although most of them say that the games they're making, or have already made, won't be affected by Humble's crisis.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see whether the ongoing Humble Games issue causes any other problems for studios releasing games in the near future. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>
Yesterday's dramatic announcement of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">strike action by video game actors over AI concerns</a> may have less of an immediate impact on upcoming titles than first thought. 
</p>
<p>
While the SAG-AFTRA union has indeed voted for voice artists and performance capture personnel to strike from today, a large swathe of projects now appear unaffected. 
</p>
<p>
This includes any video game in development as of a year ago, including (for now) live service games, according to statements from both SAG-AFTRA and the companies the strike will hit, obtained by Kotaku reporter <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1816797825444753673">Ethan Gach</a>.
</p>
<p>
Looking down the release schedule for the remainder of this year and into 2025, this will cover the vast majority of blockbuster titles whose development has stretched back several years. 
</p>
<p>
Last night, there had been concern among GTA fans and unclear reporting as to the impact of the strike on the game's publisher Take-Two. But it's safe to say GTA6 has been in development long enough not to be affected. 
</p>
<p>
This will also include games such as October's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and November's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, as well as the upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. Eurogamer has contacted EA, Activision, Ubisoft and Take-Two for comment.
</p>
<p>
"Due to certain provisions in the IMA [Interactive Media Agreement] contract, games that were in production at the time that the union provided the company its notice of termination are not currently subject to strike order. Most notices were sent in September 2022," SAG-AFTRA wrote. 
</p>
<p>
As for live-service games, while these could be impacted in future, there's also a 60-day grace period where work can continue for now. In other words, the strike would have to last more than two months before this kicked in.
</p>
<p>
"We served a separate notice relating to live service games, which we can strike in less than 60 days," SAG-AFTRA continued. "We will update the membership if we expand the strike order to include those games closer to that time."
</p>
<p>
A statement from the companies potentially impacted by the strike says similar, though notes an even more recent cut-off point for exemption from strike activity.
</p>
<p>
"The language in the IMA is clear that video games that were already in production prior to 25th August 2023, including live service games, are not subject to the strike and remain covered by the ongoing terms of the 2020-2022 IMA. Performers would not be in violation of the strike order if they continue working on these games."
</p>
<p>
This morning, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-actors-union-equity-stands-in-solidarity-with-sag-aftra-but-wont-authorise-its-own-strike">UK actors' union Equity said it stood "in solidarity" with SAG-AFTRA</a>, but wouldn't authorise its own strike.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-ceo-admits-it-made-the-wrong-calls-in-several-projects-following-cancellation-of-life-by-you<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
CEO of Paradox Fredrik Wester has admitted the publisher "made the wrong calls in several projects", following the cancellation of its The Sims competitor Life By You.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-shuts-down-life-by-you-studio-following-sims-likes-sudden-cancellation">game was cancelled back in June</a>, and the internal studio behind the project, Paradox Tectonic, was closed.

</p>
<p>
Wester commented on Life By You as part of Paradox's <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/investors/financial-reports/interim-report-january-june-2024-correction">latest financial earnings report</a>, stating the cancellation was a "difficult decision... as the game would not be able to meet our expectations."

</figure>

<p>
He continued: "It is clear that we have made the wrong calls in several projects, especially outside of our core, and this must change.
</p>
<p>
"We have areas here where we need to improve, for example in production, quality and risk assessment. In 2021, we made major changes to how we invest in riskier projects, which means that we have not started new projects with the same combination of high risk and high costs as Life by You."
</p>
<p>
Along with the cancellation of Life by You, Paradox previously received criticism for the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-fans-complain-of-performance-woes-after-developer-admits-it-missed-target">Cities: Skylines 2 due to its poor performance</a>. A disappointing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-publisher-refunds-dlc-and-admits-we-let-you-down">DLC was rushed out and subsequently refunded</a>.


</p>
<p>
That followed the troubled development of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-declares-pulp-strategy-the-lamplighters-league-a-22m-flop">commercial failure of 2023's The Lamplighters' League</a>, and repeated delays of Prison Architect 2 that led to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-developer-double-eleven-parts-way-with-paradox-after-nine-years-on-series">Paradox parting ways with developer Double Eleven</a>.


</p>
<p>
"Despite great annoyance at our own mistakes, we have faith. Paradox's future is bright, but we need to roll up our sleeves and work hard to fully realise the potential," concluded Wester.
</p>
<p>
The cancellation of Life by You has resulted in a 90 percent decrease in operating profit for its latest quarter, while revenue decreased by 22 percent year-on-year.</p>
<p>Still, Wester believes Paradox's "core business has performed very well" due to ongoing efforts to update Cities: Skylines 2 and the release of Victoria 3's Sphere of Influence expansion among others.

<p>Epic Games has announced its updated strategy for mobile gaming. Fortnite will return to the iOS store in the European Union, while the Epic Games Store will be available again on Android worldwide and on iOS in the European Union. The new terms involve a 12% store fee for transactions made through Epic Games and a 0% fee for third-party payments.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today we announced our new strategy for bringing our games to mobile stores. We're not only approaching the launch of Epic Games Store for mobile, we are also working to put our games on other independent stores that strive to bring fair terms to all developers, including…</p>— Epic Games Newsroom (@EpicNewsroom) <a href="https://twitter.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1816553539524575744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 25, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Moreover, Epic Games stated that they will be “ending distribution partnerships with mobile stores that serve as without competing robustly and serving all developers fairly, even if those stores offer us a special deal for our games.” This&nbsp;decision, which is a response to the situation with&nbsp;Apple and Google,&nbsp;paves&nbsp;the&nbsp;way for&nbsp;Fortnite and more of their mobile&nbsp;games&nbsp;to&nbsp;be available in&nbsp;new mobile stores.</p>



<p>Epic Games expanded, stating they have “long been advocating for the rights of stores to exist and compete fairly on iOS and Android, and progress is spreading across the globe, in the form of Europe’s DMA, similar laws in the UK and Japan, regulatory investigations around the world, and victory in the Epic v Google litigation in the US”. Epic wants to take advantage of this opportunity to bring “developers a great deal” through their store and also support other stores.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-epic-games-arrives-on-altstore">Epic Games Arrives on AltStore</h2>



<p>Epic Games is bringing its mobile games to AltStore on iOS in the EU as part of its strategic expansion. This is just the beginning, with support for at least two other third-party stores to arrive soon. AltStore is a trusted app store designed to side-load mobile apps on iOS.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Finally, Epic Games announced that Fortnite and its other mobile titles will no longer be available on the Samsung Galaxy Store. This decision is in response to “Samsung’s anticompetitive move to block side-loading by default on Samsung Android devices.”</p>



<p>In other news, Epic Games recently claimed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/epic-games-claims-apple-is-stalling-store-launch-over-button-similarities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple was stalling the store launch over button similarities</a>. They also recently acknowledged the presence of ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-epic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pay-to-win’ car skins</a> in Fortnite. What are your views on Epic Games’ new strategy for mobile gaming? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/26/overwatch-2-could-be-going-back-to-6v6-as-blizzard-plans-gameplay-tests/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/overwatch-2-could-be-going-back-to-6v6-as-blizzard-plans-gameplay-tests.937482/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/26/overwatch-2-could-be-going-back-to-6v6-as-blizzard-plans-gameplay-tests/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Blizzard Entertainment has started to openly discuss switching <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> away from 5v5 team matches and back to the 6v6 team sizes that defined the original game.</p>
<p>Writing in a <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24104605/">Director’s Take blog post</a>, Game Director Aaron Keller digs into the broad debate between 6v6 and 5v5, the advantages that the current form has, its difficulties, and announcing that Blizzard will be holding some gameplay tests to look at how it holds up.</p>


<p>The key reason to switch to 5v5 was to break up a tank-heavy meta. Now, with just one tank per side, there’s just one defensive barrier for a team to break through (double shield was a big issue), making damage character feel more effective, allowing healers to do more than just buff the front line, and making ultimates and ultimate combos less of an integral play.</p>
<p>The other positive side effects were a reduction in matchmaking times as the 1-2-2 format better matches up to what people actually want to play as, easier to read matches as you’re tracking nine other players instead of eleven, and even marginally improved performance.</p>
<p>Despite all of this, players of the game have consistently banged the drum for a return to 6v6. Two tanks both allowed for stronger team compositions that could make up for a weak link, and for heightened moments of chaos when a defensive line does fold. It’s a fun factor that the vocal parts of the community want to have back.</p>

<p>However, Keller notes that, “At the end of the day, we want to make the game that players want to play.” So, if people want 6v6 again, Blizzard needs to look at that.</p>
<p>He continues, “because we operate as a service to our players, we always remain open-minded to re-evaluating our decisions based on your actions and feedback, to give you the best game experience we can. &nbsp;Rather than introduce a disruptive, permanent change to the game, we’d prefer to explore the space further and make changes based on that exploration.</p>
<p><strong>“With that said, we’re looking at running a series of events to try out different core team composition formats in Overwatch 2</strong>. The community has, juuuust once or twice, suggested a test. Why not put various forms of 6v6 in the game in order to gauge the results? We agree, and based on your feedback, we’re exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results. This is taking some time, however, for reasons that may not be readily apparent.”</p>
<p>At this point, Blizzard is still just investigating how these tests will look – there’s UI factors like healer vision that need to be looked at, and as mentioned, they may have to find new optimisations to keep performance as it should be.</p>
<p>If the community still wants 6v6 after these tests, and they match up to all of Blizzard’s metrics and analytics, then it could become a permanent switch or a new option.</p>
<p>Keller wraps up:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m going to jump on a soap box for a moment. When you look at the changes to Overwatch since its inception, it’s clear that many of those have reduced some of the variety within an Overwatch match. We get feedback from some players that Overwatch can feel “the same” from game to game. While much of this gets attributed to 5v5, we feel that there is more at play here. Besides running experiments with 6v6, we’d like to run some that re-examine the ways we tried solving previous problems, specifically with the goal of bringing some of the freedom back to an Overwatch match without the severity of issues that accompanied it. For instance, we think there could be other ways of putting a team together that aren’t quite as rigid as a set composition, but not as loose as Open Queue. We’ll be running at least one Quick Play: Hacked based on this idea in Season 13. There are some gotchas to this direction, but after reading 400 pages of this blog, I hope you’re all able to see that there are trade-offs to many of the decisions that go into this game (and into any game, really).</p></blockquote>
<p>The announcement comes just as Overwatch 2 is about to face fresh competition for its hero shooter crown, with Sony about to launch <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a> as a premium title, and the upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> free-to-play alternative. Now, more than ever, Blizzard needs to try and keep their community on board.</p>
