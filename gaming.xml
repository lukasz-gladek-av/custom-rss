			<p>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle on PlayStation 5 Pro features Global Illumination, Ambient Occlusion, and other improvements over other console versions while running at a consistent native 4K resolution.</p>
<p>A new comparison video shared today by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElAnalistaDeBits</a> takes a good look at the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro versions of the game developed by MachineGames, providing additional information on both. On base PlayStation 5, the game runs in its single display mode with dynamic resolution scaling ranging between 1800p and 1620p, with drops to 1440p. On PlayStation 5 Pro, on the other hand, the game is generally displayed at native 4K resolution, as confirmed<a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-runs-native-4k-playstation-5-pro/"> last week</a>. The PS5 Pro version also features improvements to Global Illumination, Ambient Occlusion, and Contact Shadows, although the improvements aren't huge. In addition, both versions of the game are extremely well optimized, as were the Xbox Series X and S versions, maintaining consistent 60 FPS with ray tracing enabled.</p>

<p>It's good news that Indiana Jones and The Great Circle looks and runs well on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro, as it is a game worth experiencing. You can learn more about it by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an excellent adventure/action game that features one of the best Indiana Jones stories, great level design that rewards exploration, and awesome ray traced visuals. This might just be the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton we've ever seen.</em></p>
<p>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle later this week, on April 17th, on PlayStation 5. The game is also available on PC and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-roadmap-for-q2-2025-promises-a-life-updates-and-more.1163775/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-roadmap-q2-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GSC Game World has released a brand new&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>roadmap that covers the second quarter of the year, and it promises more fixes to the game's A-Life system, plus lots of other new features and tweaks.</p>

<p>A-Life, which is the name GSC Game World gives to the system that governs its NPCs' ambient behavior, has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-a-life-20-gsc-game-world" rel="nofollow">the subject of some controversy</a> since&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s launch, with numerous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-1-1-a-life" rel="nofollow">updates</a> attempting to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-12" rel="nofollow">address</a> some of its most critical issues.</p>

<p>That hasn't changed in the new roadmap, which promises "A-Life/AI updates" in Q2. These updates consist of "persistent" improvements to the system, as well as "smarter human combat", mutants eating corpses, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-roadmap-q2-2025-pointing.jpg?itok=zc-NJulR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-roadmap-q2-2025-pointing.jpg?itok=PZ3yqgs2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is getting some big changes throughout the rest of the quarter.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not all about A-Life, though. The new&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is also promising the release of a beta modding SDK (software development kit), allowing you to make your own&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>mods. A closed beta will also be held with mod makers to test out the feature.</p>

<p>Also on the list are features like mutant loot, the ability to skip the game's shader compilation, and an increase to the player's stash window, as well as two new weapons. Naturally, this all sits alongside "further stabilization, optimization, and 'anomalies' fixing" (i.e. bugs).</p>

<p>The next-gen update to the&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Legends of the Zone&nbsp;</em>trilogy, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-roadmap-legends-of-zone-next-gen-2025" rel="nofollow">promised for 2025 back in December</a>, is also scheduled for this quarter, although it may well get delayed again.</p>

<p>GSC Game World says this roadmap, which is the first of a new three-monthly cycle, will help&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>to "become the game we imagined - and you deserve".</p>




<p>In case you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, it's the long-awaited sequel to the cult classic 2007 FPS&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl&nbsp;</em>(which still maintains the old Russian spelling of the town's name, unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl" rel="nofollow">the sequel</a>).</p>

<p>Like the first game,&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>has you exploring the Chornobyl nuclear exclusion zone (albeit a heavily fictionalized version of same), seeking out anomalies and artifacts while also grappling with disparate factions.</p>

<p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/stalker-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

If you've been playing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-blue-prince">Blue Prince</a> and thinking, ah, this could really benefit from having approximately 16.7 million fewer colours and a couple more homicidal husks in diving suits, may I usher you wincingly towards Repose. It's a moodalicious, monochrome dungeon-crawler in which you get 50 in-game steps to search hideously dishevelled techno-crypts for oxygen cylinders, before you die of exhaustion. More likely, you will die of getting shot by a zombie astronaut. Here's a trailer.

<p>
Like Blue Prince, Repose invites you to make use of a notepad. Unlike Blue Prince, this isn't because you'll be jotting down clues about winsome dartboard puzzles. It's because the game doesn't have a save system. It has save codes, instead. Ah, save codes. Once a routine video game design convenience, now the province of the utter sadist. There are, at least, permanent progression elements such as doors you can unlock from the other side.
</p>
<p>
The grid-based format and 50-step limit might lull you into thinking that Repose is a turn-based game. It isn't. If you see a threat, you've got a second to either flinch away or belt it with your fireaxe. The axe is one of two starting possessions in the demo, which is still live on Steam. The other is a glowstick, which lends a gorgeously chiselled glimmer to your surroundings but also makes you visible from a whole 'nother tile away. Try not to equip it absent-mindedly. There are guns in the screenshots, but I've yet to acquire one.
</p>
<p>
The demo doesn't dig deep into the story, but what's here pongs of corpo-dread and existential <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a>. The first location in the game is called Cafe Void - bet the coffee's good there. Your employer is simply The Company. There's a character who warns you not to sleep in any beds you encounter, which is not helpful in a game where you can only take 50 paces before keeling over. In the undeniably existential confines of my flat, 50 paces is good for... three, maybe four midnight toilet round-trips. My flat doesn't harbour any astronaut husks, mind. Not since the landlord put his foot down about couch surfers.
</p>
<p>
Repose launches today. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3002510/REPOSE/">Read more on Steam</a>. Alternatively, try <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/void-stranger">Void Stranger</a> - it has a similar vibe but is (so far) sexier and weirder and marginally less punitive, providing you accept that 'failing' your first run is desirable.

<p>Another indie games studio is closing its doors. It  has been announced that Makea Games, the studio behind the game Supermoves, is shutting down “effective immediately”.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/toikka_activity-7317524349664509953-Y8MO?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAe8N2cBgr8yAdDlzNawvOXeqb-JdsGiQC4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement was made</a> on Monday morning by the studio’s CEO and founder Tomi Toikka.</p>



<p>“After over three incredible years building Supermoves and bringing the vision of the Makeaverse to life through user-generated content, we’ve reached the end of the road for Makea Games,” Toikka said. “Despite our team’s best efforts — and the unwavering support of our community, collaborators, and partners — we are deeply saddened to announce that Makea Games is officially winding down, effective immediately.”</p>



<p>He closed his statement thanking those who believed “in a small team with big dreams” while adding that there is a “fire to build again”.</p>



<p>Makea Games’ first, and only, game called Supermoves: World of Parkour launched in August 2024. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1959580/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, the game’s playerbase peaked at just 50 players with a recent 24-hour peak of just two players.</p>



<p>What do you make of Makea Games shutting down less than a year after releasing its first game? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1896/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

While the hardware itself looks to be what anyone could have hoped for in a Switch successor — a more powerful version of the console millions of owners already love — the economic uncertainty gripping the world has made the Switch 2 a much more complicated prospect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s before we even consider the trade war the United States is currently engaged with China in. The $450 USD console price point and $80 USD sticker on Mario Kart World has made the Switch 2 something of a flashpoint amid the rising cost of games and gaming hardware, both here in the US and abroad. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To get a better idea of how the world is reacting to the Switch 2, I spoke with editors from IGN brands across the world to get a sense of the Switch 2’s impending release.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How the Rest of the World Feels About the Switch 2</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">After consulting with editors from IGN sites abroad, including those based in Europe, South America, and Asia, the reception to the Switch 2 has been, well, mixed. The<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-tech-specs-battery-life-4k-and-up-to-120fps-storage-and-more"> hardware improvements</a> like 120hz refresh rate, HDR, and 4K output are praised, but missing features like not having an OLED screen are seen as serious drawbacks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As far as reception goes, IGN Italia’s readers are predominantly dissatisfied with the Nintendo Switch 2,” says IGN Italy editor-in-chief, Alessandro Digioia. “Among hundreds of comments across news articles and social media, the main concerns revolve around the price point, the lack of an OLED screen, the absence of a trophy/achievement system, and a modest launch line-up. While some third-party announcements were welcomed, many readers expected more from Nintendo’s first-party titles.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN Portugal’s Pedro Pestana shared similar sentiments from their readers – sentiments they agreed with: “Personally, I'm not that impressed with Switch 2, as it is basically a souped up Switch 1 - better in every sense, but without the novelty factor of the original. That being said, I reckon it's gonna come down to the games, and Mario Kart World looked damn nice.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Other regions are seemingly more receptive to the Switch 2’s hardware improvements. IGN Benelux’s Nick Nijiland says the site has been getting mostly positive feedback, despite the price of the console. “We have seen in our region that the console has been received very well. People complain about the price, but at the same time the console sold out within hours. We put up a post on our website stating that we would let our readers know through our Discord server when pre-orders went live and our Discord got so many new members that day, it was insane.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN Turkey’s Ersin Kilic also shared positive views from the region’s readers. “When I look at the comments, it is seen as positive that Nintendo corrected the points criticized on [the first] Switch. Although the console is stylish and uses LCD, the fact that the screen is much better was received positively.” However, Kilic says “the most criticized point was that Hall Effect was not used in Joy-Con 2,” which some gamers hoped could minimize the risk of Joy-Con drift. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN China’s Kamui Ye gave both sides of reader reactions to the Switch 2. “The reveal event has been met with widespread disappointment due to its lackluster launch title lineup and perplexing regional pricing strategies,” they explained. Furthermore, Ye says the launch lineup that didn’t include a new Mario, Legend of Zelda, or Animal Crossing was another negative.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“However, optimism persists among core fans regarding Nintendo's long-term plans,” Ye adds. Along with the belief of a better software lineup down the line, any of the horsepower and battery concerns for the Switch 2 “appear secondary to loyalists prioritizing backward compatibility, hardware refinements like magnetic Joy-Cons, and Nintendo's legacy of iterative software support.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Ultimately, the brand's entrenched fanbase seems willing to tolerate short-term missteps, betting on Nintendo's historical ability to refine its platforms through compelling games over time,” Ye says.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hardware Price and Tariff Fears</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 Console Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch 2 is expected to launch at a $450 USD price point in the United States when it is made available to pre-order some time in the future. The reason <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-order-date-in-the-us-to-assess-impact-of-trumps-tariffs">pre-orders have yet to happen in the United States and Canada</a>, despite the rest of the world already registering their purchases with retailers, is of course due to an ongoing tariff situation from President Trump. It’s a state of affairs that’s seemingly making Nintendo reconsider how to roll out the console properly in time for its June 5 release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, IGN editors from Europe aren’t particularly impacted by the tariffs in their regions, where pre-orders are already up and running.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In Germany, nobody is really worrying about the tariff situation regarding the Switch 2,” says IGN Germany’s Antonia Dressler. However, the actual retail price of the Switch 2 is a separate matter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There are a lot of complaints about the pricing of the console… and [readers are making] direct comparisons with the pricing of the PS5 [which] is seen as the better console,” explains Dressler. Despite the complaints, though, pre-orders do seem to be coming in for the region.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The pricing of the Switch 2 firmly places it in direct competition with consoles like the PS5 and Xbox Series X in many regions, making the choice of which console to get even harder for global buyers. “At the moment, Nintendo's official website is taking pre-orders and the price is R12,499,” says IGN Africa’s Zaid Kriel. “It is not crazy pricing, but it's now in the same bracket as the PS5 and Xbox Series X. It's no longer a cheaper alternative, and that could be a problem, especially with the increase in game prices Nintendo has introduced.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/09/nintendo-switch-2-accessories-1744213576987.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Buying the Nintendo Switch 2 with a number of accessories will not be cheap. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/does-the-price-of-the-switch-2-overshadow-its-reveal">pricing problem pretty much overshadowed everything</a> going on around the Switch 2 reveal, good or bad,” IGN France editor-in-chief, Erwan Lafleuriel, says. “The debate is raging mainly about prices, but I believe because it was kind of easy to overshadow a reveal lacking in many other aspects. Part of that is... we already knew most of what was revealed from the leaks. And there is no impressive 'one more thing' to add. Even in terms of games, it's good, but it feels like something is missing.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other regions outside of the United States, however, are contending with the fallout of the tariffs. IGN Brazil’s Matheus de Lucca says, “The current tariff war initiated by the United States makes the scenario even worse for Brazil, since the Real is a weak currency compared to the dollar and an increase in the price of the Switch 2 in the United States will most likely have a huge impact on the whole of Latin America. The scenario of uncertainty and a possible increase in the price of the console could make the Switch 2 accessible to only a very small group of players in the Brazilian market.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is also the unique situation in Japan where Nintendo is launching a region-locked version of the hardware at a lower pricepoint to protect its domestic market “I think Nintendo knew they couldn’t go over 50,000 yen in Japan – the weak yen means the relative pricing scale is very different here,” says IGN Japan’s executive producer, Daniel Robson. “But presumably they also realised that if the console was much cheaper here than anywhere else, people would try to import it or buy all the stock when they visit Japan. Hence the region lock – our cheaper Switch only plays Japanese games and supports only Japanese accounts. I’m sure this is a direct result of the global trade situation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robson also says that, “The price is still high, and will be tough for many families here, but it's far more competitively priced than the 77,000 yen PS5. Not to mention that Japan is firmly a Nintendo country – the house of Mario dominates the console Top 10 week in, week out, so I doubt families here will be able to go without a Switch 2. That said, as a parent, I’m secretly relieved that my daughter hasn’t asked for a Switch 2, as the price puts it comfortably over the bounds of a birthday present.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Software Price Remains the Biggest Pain Point</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the issues of hardware costs and tariffs, the biggest bugbear affecting the general feeling regarding the Switch 2 announcement has been the price of software. Some of that pain is to be expected: Nintendo games have always been expensive and held their price, and it’s only natural that Nintendo would join the trend of increasing game prices. But it seems the company may have jumped the gun by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy">pricing Mario Kart World at $80 USD</a>. While Nintendo says pricing will be determined on a game-by-game basis, with other Switch 2 launch window games priced at $70 USD or as low as $10 USD, the move has prompted fears that the gates are now fully open for even more expensive software.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Game pricing is by far the biggest issue raised, not only by our readers but by the Italian gaming community at large,” says IGN Italy’s Digioia. “Many feel that Nintendo's new pricing structure is unjustifiable, especially in light of recent increases that came with the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S era (when AAA titles moved from €70 to €80). Now, Nintendo is pricing some first-party games at €90, which has caused considerable concern - particularly given the company's historically conservative approach to discounts. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-tutorial-game-welcome-tour-costs-10-nintendo-explains-why-its-not-a-free-console-pack-in">€9.99 price for Switch 2 Welcome Tour </a>sparked additional backlash, and even the paid upgrade paths for existing Switch games are widely seen as another way to extract money from loyal customers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“People are pissed,” IGN Germany’s Dressler says plainly. “Especially with the 90 Euro for Mario Kart World, that is a record for a video game in Germany; not even titles like Assassin’s Creed cost as much (talking about the base version). It also seems ridiculous that the tutorial game will cost anything — Nintendo just looks absurdly greedy right now.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-direct-nintendo-switch-2-4-2-2025-2-1743605101158.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">While Mario Kart World's $80 is the main offender, fans are also annoyed by the $10 charge for Switch 2 Welcome Tour. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Take a look in any Switch 2 comment thread on IGN.com and you’ll find similar sentiments; the high price of games is unwelcome, especially in a time of increased living costs. A more unusual perspective can be found in mainland China, however, where there are no current plans for an official release. As a result, Switch 2 shoppers there may have to look to the gray market, with stock coming from Japan and Hong Kong – places where prices for games look to be a bit cheaper.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Regarding pricing, game prices in Hong Kong and Japanese editions are relatively lower compared to Western markets. Observations from social media comments under our content show most players find the official price acceptable,” IGN China’s Ye says. “While the console itself has seen some price hikes, users generally consider it more cost-effective than handheld PCs like Steam Deck, especially with backward compatibility support. Based on our data, Chinese mainland Nintendo Switch 1 players appear largely receptive to the official Nintendo Switch 2 price increase.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right now it seems sensible to bet that the Switch 2 will be a success – it’s a safe, recognizable upgrade to one of the most popular and beloved consoles of all time. But what kind of a success story Nintendo has on its hands remains to be seen. The threat of an era of $80 games during a time of economic hardship has clearly put a substantial amount of prospective buyers into a negative headspace. Plus there are still many unknowns surrounding the console, especially in the United States where tariffs stand to negatively impact the North American launch. Then there’s the question of how international politics may result in potential stock shortages and impact the system’s launch around the globe. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For all those unknowns, what is clear from chatting with IGN’s global staff is that Nintendo has whipped up excitement around the world. It’s just excitement with a few more caveats than you’d expect from Nintendo. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-stock-update-journey-together-lost-origin-ex-big-boxes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Grab packs without paying a premium.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I rarely need an excuse to grab more <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop">Pokémon cards</a>, but every so often, something especially good comes along. Right now, a few premium boxes are <em>actually</em> worth it. Not because they’re stacked with guaranteed hits (they’re not), but because the sets inside are finally seeing a drop in single-card prices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That opens two solid options: rip the packs and hope for something great, or skip the gamble and grab your chase cards while they’re cheaper. Either way, it’s one of those rare moments where buying in doesn’t feel like lighting your wallet on fire. With decent promos, good pack variety, and a few worthwhile extras, these boxes are the ones to watch.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon TCG: Iono’s Bellibolt ex Premium Collection</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, it's one of the pricier premium collections out there. And yes, you get a Bellibolt ex promo, which is about as subtle as a battery-powered frog can get. But the real draw here is the 2 x <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-preview">Journey Together</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-azure-legends-tins-has-surging-sparks-boosters-in-stock">Surging Sparks</a>, Obsidian Flames, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-twilight-masquerade-expansion-preview-hands-on">Twilight Masquerade</a> and Paradox Rift packs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Single prices from Journey Together are already coming down, which is great if you’ve been waiting to scoop up stuff like Perrin or Pecharunt ex without giving your credit card a stress headache. You also get an acrylic standee display and photo stickers, which is either a cute bonus or something you'll shove in a drawer forever. I’m choosing to see it as décor. Don’t ruin this for me.</p><div catalogid="4ac4de63-9c20-473d-b7e3-7114da2d9a01" id="218624"><div id="218624" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Iono’s Bellibolt ex Premium Collection</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Single Card Options</h3><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon TCG: Infernape V Box</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This is probably the easiest yes on the list. It's cheap, it’s on sale, and it includes packs from Fusion Strike and Lost Origin. That’s a decent combo if you like old sets with some high highs and very, very low lows. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re thinking of chasing Gengar VMAX or Giratina V, just know those prices are finally starting to cool off. So you can skip the suspense and buy singles now, or you can open these and pretend you’re immune to regret. Either way, the Infernape and Empoleon promos make nice binder filler, and the oversized card will make a great bookmark for someone who doesn’t read.</p></div><div catalogid="4ac4de63-9c20-473d-b7e3-7114da2d9a01" id="218625"><div id="218625" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Infernape V Box</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Single Card Options</h3><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon TCG: Ogerpon ex Premium Collection</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This one’s for anyone who actually plays the game or just likes pretending they might. You get six Twilight Masquerade packs, a Teal Mask Ogerpon ex promo, and sleeves that don’t suck. Twilight Masquerade’s singles are already starting to slide in price, including cards like Carmine, Bloodmoon Ursaluna, and Dragapult ex. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So if there’s a card you’ve been eyeing, now’s the time to grab it without going through a box’s worth of filler. Still, if you do want to roll the dice, this is probably the best pack selection of the bunch. Plus, the magnetic card protector almost tricks me into thinking I own something valuable. Almost.</p></div><div catalogid="4ac4de63-9c20-473d-b7e3-7114da2d9a01" id="218626"><div id="218626" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Ogerpon ex Premium Collection</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Single Card Options</h3><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokemon TCG: Stacking Tin (Q1 2025)</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Is it weird that this is the one I’m most tempted by? You get three booster packs from three solid sets: Stellar Crown, Surging Sparks, and Temporal Forces. That gives you a shot at everything from Pikachu ex to Hydreigon ex to Iron Crown ex. Or nothing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s also on the table. But with single prices dropping in all three of those sets, this is a decent way to gamble without spending too much. You also get two sheets of stickers, which is exactly the kind of freebie that tricks me into thinking I made a responsible decision.</p></div><div catalogid="4ac4de63-9c20-473d-b7e3-7114da2d9a01" id="218627"><div id="218627" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokemon TCG: Stacking Tin (Q1 2025)</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Single Card Options</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

                <p dir="ltr">Even after a reveal showcase over the weekend, there was confusion about one crucial aspect regarding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/">Marathon</a>: the game's price point. Developer Bungie has clarified that the extraction shooter won't be "a full-priced title." However, the entry cost still hasn't been detailed, with that info apparently arriving in the summer.</p><p dir="ltr">Originally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/">GameSpot's Marathon preview</a> noted that the game would be full priced since Bungie has referred to the shooter as "a premium title." <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1911121437848371405" rel="nofollow ">On X</a>, Wario64 shared those details before <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1911129962943549877" rel="nofollow ">the official Marathon account</a> stepped in to spell out the current pricing situation for Marathon. Yes, it's described as a premium experience, but it won't carry a premium price tag (think $70).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/blizzard-has-10-year-plan-for-diablo-iv/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-great-albeit-safe-hack-n-slash-action/">Diablo IV</a> was released in 2023, it was the first new mainline entry in the series in more than a decade, and according to the Diablo series general manager Rod Fergusson, we'll be playing Diablo IV for just as long before we can start to expect Diablo V.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/chain-interview-marc-merrill-rod-fergusson-shuhei-yoshida-more">Game File</a>, Fergusson said that Blizzard is with Diablo IV "<em>for the long haul" and that the studio's plans for the game span</em> the next decade. So, don't expect to hear anything about Diablo V until approximately 2033.</p>
<p>"<em>We're here for the long haul,</em>" Fergusson said. "<em>We've been doing long-range planning recently. And I've created a roadmap - a 10-year roadmap...it was actually a 12-year [roadmap] - I can see this, this, this and this and all these different things that we can do, [which] is really inspiring. And it's really exciting. We're focused on what players want...I can't tell you much more than that."</em></p>
<p>The shortest time between Diablo releases was the four years between the first and second games. After that, it was 12 years before Diablo III came around and another 11 years between Diablo III and Diablo IV. So telling players to expect another 10-year gap between series installments is nothing new, and it would be on the shorter side if Diablo V released precisely 10 years after Diablo IV.</p>
<p>As far as short-term plans go, Blizzard announced the<a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/"> 2025 roadmap for Diablo IV</a> less than a week ago at the time of writing, confirming that a new major expansion for Diablo IV won't arrive until sometime in 2026 and that in the meantime, the significant updates in 2025 will come in the form of seasonal changes and quality of life updates players are still waiting for, such as being able to use keyboard and mouse controls on a console, which won't arrive until sometime this summer, according to the current schedule.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-2-characters-not-coming-to-fortnite/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-2-characters-not-coming-to-fortnite/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It was recently claimed that a slew of characters from popular franchises were heading to Fortnite, which isn’t by any means a reach for the game. The list featured the likes of Agent 47, Mortal Kombat fighters, Jack Black, and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 characters.</p>



<p>The latter title was a bit out of left field, as aside from having a successful launch in February, there’s no real reason why Fortnite would accommodate characters from the medieval RPG epic.</p>



<p>I caught up with one of the game’s actors and tuned into the Warhorse team on socials to see this claim debunked.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-henry-of-tilted-towers">Henry of Tilted Towers</h2>



<p>We recently reported <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-characters-list-leaked/">on a claim that aired</a> during an episode of the XboxEra Podcast. During a brief segment, ShpeshalNick claimed that a string of characters is coming to Fortnite, some more bizarre than others. Amongst the list sat ‘Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’ characters.</p>



<p>I leapt straight over to catch up with Luke Dale, the talent behind Hans Capon in KCDII, and he was none the wiser about the leak. He suggested that KCDII’s publisher might <span>b</span>e <strong>making moves </strong>without anyone knowing, but the team at Warhorse Studios, KCDII’s developer, echoed the sentiment:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The claim hasn’t been corroborated by any of the ‘typical’ Fortnite leakers and insiders, so for now, I’d advise taking this with a pinch of salt. The folks at Warhorse might be trying to subvert our expectations by playing it down, or they could genuinely have no idea what this claim is taking about.</p>



<p>It’s not unheard of for a popular franchise or release to make it into Fortnite <strong>just because </strong>it’s successful, but out of the entire list provided by ShpeshalNick, Kingdom Come just stands out as being too out of left field.</p>

challenging if you had the right loadout. Protagonist Sam Porter Bridges amassed an impressive arsenal of weapons to use against the BT entities--which weaponized his blood and other bodily fluids to harm them--and near the end of the game, you would gain access to a rocket launcher that could be used to take down kaiju-sized BTs.</p><p>The recent trailers for Death Stranding 2 have suggested that we'll see the scale of these boss fights increase. One of the new BTs glimpsed is essentially a giant gnarled hand that can outrun Sam, and in another scene, Sam's ally Heartman faces off against a truly colossal BT by combining another BT with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-preorder-a-model-kit-based-on-death-stranding-2s-magellan-vehicle/1100-6530029/">DHV Magellan submersible</a>, creating something that looks <em>very </em>similar to the Metal Gear Rex mecha. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-introduces-its-own-solid-snake-sort-of/1100-6529990/">Considering that Death Stranding 2 has its own Solid Snake</a>--sort of--it's not exactly surprising to see references to Metal Gear Solid in a Hideo Kojima-directed game.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach launches on June 24</a> for PS5, and it looks like the live-action movie adaptation of this post-apocalyptic series <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-death-stranding-2-fanciest-in-game-timepiece-is-real-but-itll-cost-you-1600/1100-6530011/">may have just found its director</a>.</p>

		<p>After an interminable wait, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</a> is finally <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/24/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-comes-to-ps5-on-17th-april/">coming to PS5 this week</a>. Now Sony lovers can rejoice in travelling the globe, exploring beautiful locales, discovering mystical relics, and hitting fascists with a surprisingly varied selection of comedy objects – for my money, an umbrella is the best.</p>
<p>Indiana Jones is, of course, an iconic character. Over the course of three films – yes, there have definitely positively only ever been <em>three </em>films – Indy became the hero of every child of the 1980’s; so much so, that even the character’s shadow became instantly recognisable. Indiana Jones And The Great Circle brilliantly captures all the whip-cracking, snake-fearing, and fedora-wearing excellence of the films, distilling them into an interactive experience that puts the player firmly in the role of the world’s most dashing professor.</p>



<p>I’ve been thoroughly enjoying Indiana Jones And The Great Circle on PS5, and it was whilst clambering the rooftops of Vatican City (before dropping down behind an unsuspecting Blackshirt and knocking him flat out with a handy mandolin) that I got to thinking – has there even been a real-life Indiana Jones? We all get to be Indy digitally now, but has anyone ever done it for real? The adventures, the danger, the thrills and spills?</p>
<p>Fantastically, the answer is yes. But there’s not just one real-life Indy, there are several! Here though, for your eyeball’s enjoyment, are my two absolute favourites.</p>

<p>Born in 1884, in Beloit, Wisconsin, Roy Chapman Andrews was trained by his father to use a shotgun when only nine-years-old. He put that skill to good use, stuffing and selling the animals he shot to pay for college. In adulthood, Andrews became a world-famous explorer, leading dangerous expeditions through China, Tibet, and Mongolia. He lived a life of danger, always on the edge. In one of his many books, he wrote about how he nearly died ten times, “Two were from drowning in a typhoon, one was when our boat was charged by a wounded whale; once my wife and I were nearly eaten by wild dogs, once we were in great danger from fanatical lama priests; two were close calls when I fell over cliffs, once I was nearly caught by a huge python, and twice I might have been killed by bandits.” I don’t know about you, but fanatical lama priests would make a great plot for a fourth Indy film, should they ever make one.</p>
<p>Andrews was a boffin too, just like Indy. He proved that dinosaurs hatched from eggs during an expedition in Mongolia, he discovered that the extinct Gray Whale wasn’t extinct after all, and he wrote a stonking twenty books. Heck, he became so famous that he even featured on the cover of Times Magazine in 1923.</p>
<div id="attachment_458883"><p id="caption-attachment-458883">TIME Magazine Cover Featuring Roy Chapman Andrews (29 Oct 1923)</p></div>
<p>The uncanny similarity to Indy doesn’t end there though, as Andrews wore a fedora and also suffered from ophidiophobia – the fear of snakes. Quite understandable, as in Mongolia Andrew’s tent was invaded at night by a pack of Vipers, forcing him to fight them off with any object he could find – which, as I’ve learned from playing Indiana Jones: The Great Circle, was probably a shovel, a beer bottle, and a wrench.</p>

<p>Then there’s Percy Fawcett, a British Army Officer, who spent two decades exploring the treacherous jungles of South America. Born in 1867, Fawcett was commissioned into the Royal Artillery before finding his way into spying for the British Government. In 1906, to settle a border dispute between Bolivia and Brazil, Fawcett was tasked with mapping an area of unexplored Jungle that separated the two countries. His adventure should have taken him two years to complete, if he even survived, as the jungles were rife with dangerous creatures and even more dangerous and unpleasant human slavers. Yet, despite the challenges, Fawcett wrapped up his expedition in a few months. This proved a turning point for Fawcett, the Amazon became like a drug for him. He returned again and again to the jungle, despite nearly dying on numerous occasions from causes as varied and nasty as starvation, disease, and mutiny. Still, none of that put off Fawcett, as he became dedicated, in a very Indy way, to finding a ‘lost city’. The city of Z.</p>
<p>Where did this idea of a lost city come from? The early conquistadores spoke of towns and villages found dotting the Amazon, yet these had never been uncovered. Fawcett reasoned, why couldn’t there be a large settlement hidden in the Amazon? After all, Hiram Bingham III had recently rediscovered Machu Picchu, a humongous city hidden in the Peruvian Andes for centuries, so why couldn’t there be a mysterious city in the depths of the Amazon too?</p>
<p>Taking a quick break from exploring to fight bravely on the Western Front in the First World War (why not, right? The dude was a spritely 50 years old at the time), Fawcett returned to begin his search of the Amazon. It was in the National Library of Brazil that Fawcett, just like Indy, found a mysterious ancient document, tucked away. Written by a slaver in 1753, the text spoke of a ruined city, an ancient metropolis, rich for the finding. That was all Fawcett needed; he headed out for adventure. His search continued for years, before finally, in 1924, Fawcett and his party disappeared without a trace. No-one knows what happened to Fawcett, did he ever find ‘Z’? Or did he just meet his end at the hands of a naffed off Xavante warrior?</p>
<p>Fascinatingly, Fawcett’s signet ring was found in 1979, but no other traces of the explorer were ever discovered. Still, Fawcett lived his life like Indiana Jones until the very end, yearning for adventure, for the thrill of discovery, to journey deep into the unknown.</p>

<p>So, as you fire up Indiana Jones And The Great Circle on your PS5 this week, as you swing across a pit trap using your trusty whip, as you search dark catacombs with only a candle to light your way, as you solve brain-tickling puzzles in the depths of an ancient temple, spare a thought for Roy Chapman Andrews and Percy Fawcett, who did all that thrilling stuff for real.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-prices-rising-europe-uk-australia-new-zealand<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced that it's raising the prices of the PS5 in certain regions, although the price of the accompanying disc drive accessory is actually going down.</p>

<p>In a PlayStation <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/13/ps5-price-to-rise-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/?sf276959904=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Sony says that because of a "challenging economic environment" which involves "high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates", the PlayStation 5's price will be increasing in Europe, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>

<p>Happily (or perhaps not if this is the model you're thinking of buying), the PS5 Digital Edition is the only model affected in Europe and the UK, although both models are getting a price increase in Australia and New Zealand, unfortunately.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-price-rises-consoles.jpg?itok=Xhcr_JYv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-price-rises-consoles.jpg?itok=hPGVbS8F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The PS5 is getting a price hike in some areas.</figcaption></figure><p>Although the PS5 itself is getting a price hike, the PS5 Disc Drive's RRP will be decreasing in all four of the previously-mentioned areas. These price changes kick in today.</p>

<h3>Europe</h3>

<ul><li>PS5 Digital Edition:&nbsp;€499.99</li>
	<li>PS5 Standard Edition: no change</li>
	<li>PS5 Disc Drive:&nbsp;€79.99</li>
</ul><h3>UK</h3>

<ul><li>PS5 Digital Edition: £429.99</li>
	<li>PS5 Standard Edition: no change</li>
	<li>PS5 Disc Drive: £69.99</li>
</ul><h3>Australia</h3>

<ul><li>PS5 Digital Edition:&nbsp;AUD $749.95</li>
	<li>PS5 Standard Edition:&nbsp;AUD $829.95</li>
	<li>PS5 Disc Drive:&nbsp;AUD $124.95</li>
</ul><h3>New Zealand</h3>

<ul><li>PS5 Digital Edition:&nbsp;NZD $859.95</li>
	<li>PS5 Standard Edition:&nbsp;NZD $949.95</li>
	<li>PS5 Disc Drive: NZD $139.95</li>
</ul><p>As you'd probably expect given its price is already pretty high, the PS5 Pro's price isn't going anywhere, at least for now. These price increases are strictly for the base PS5 models (well, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-slim-officially-announced-coming-this-holiday-season" rel="nofollow">newer slim models</a>, at any rate).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-price-rises-pro.jpg?itok=FNgXJ0dR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-price-rises-pro.jpg?itok=RcaptrO5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The PS5 Pro won't be subject to the new price hikes.</figcaption></figure><p>This isn't the first time in the last couple of years that Sony has hiked PS5 prices. Back in October 2023, the company upped the cost of its console's Digital Edition by $50 alongside the announcement of the slimmer redesign.</p>

<p>Sony's PS5 price hikes also come at a time when the price of consoles is a hot topic, largely thanks to two things: the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">announcement of the Nintendo Switch 2</a> and its $449.99 price tag, and President Donald Trump's sweeping economic tariffs, which appear to be in constant flux at time of writing.</p>

<p>At any rate, if you want to buy a PS5 (and not a PS5 Pro) in the aforementioned regions, the new price hikes go into effect today. Bear that in mind before you go shopping!</p>

            <p>I cannot remember any of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>’s bosses, so it’s perhaps for the best that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On The Beach will let us skip right past them – skip right past them like children who think video games are just Instagram montages, and that the power of choice is a Christian rock band. Kojima Productions’ forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> off-Reeder will apparently give you the option to bypass bossfights after your defeat, with information about the character then fed to you in the form of image and text descriptions. In other words, Death Stranding 2 is secretly a hybrid visual novel.</p><!--more-->
<p>I jest, I jest! No visual novel would ever receive this kind of financing. They probably blew through the entire budget of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amarantus">Amarantus</a> on Troy Baker’s eyeshadow. Rest assured that Death Stranding 2 will have traditional real game accoutrements like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-death-stranding-2-trailer-features-a-familiar-bandana-and-a-weapon-to-legally-surpass-metal-gear">shooting and cyberpunk pedalos</a>, but should you miss claiming a boss’s scalp by millimetres you will now have the option of delegating its defeat to the Game Over screen.</p>
<p>"For boss battles in DS2 (presumably in easy mode) there will be an extra option on the Game Over screen below the 'continue' option," explains <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1910720581085126707">Genki_JPN</a> on Xitter, translating and summarising comments from game director Hideo Kojima during a recent <a href="https://x.com/koji10_tbs">Koji Pro radio broadcast</a>, as passed on by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-will-let-you-clear-bosses-without-actually-defeating-them">Eurogamer</a>. The bossfight and any story revelations therein will then be spelled out "like a novel".</p>
<p>What will the Kojima faithful make of all this? As Matt Jones <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pillowfort.bsky.social/post/3lmrgnq4bec26">points out on Bluesky</a>, other developers have proposed to let players skip things and gotten it in the neck from people who regard ‘cheating’ at games as some kind of Nietzschean self-negation.</p>
<p>Back in 2012, for example, BioWare writer Jennifer Hepler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/escape-escape-embracing-skippable-combat">received a torrent of abuse from disgruntled Dragon Age 2 players</a> over a recirculated interview from 2006, in which she argued that some games might benefit from the option to skip the combat. Something tells me that Kojima will be granted more latitude. Myself, I see no harm in letting Death Stranders skip bossfights as long as Death Stranding 2 doubles down on the hiking mechanics and lets me choose from a selection of bootlace knots to modify my stamina and agility. Also I want a pogo stick.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Small Black business come ups are always the move. </p><p>On the other hand, the first episode of “Live,” which aired Thursday evening (April 10), is so irrepressibly awful, I won’t know how to explain it to the aliens when they come. It was so terrible, the only reason I turned it back on after shutting it off after the first 12 minutes is to write this piece intelligently.</p><p>The show is a fusillade of f***kery that manages to do everything, everywhere wrong, all at once. The problems start with celebrity host Yvonne Orji, who is meant to bring her irreverent,<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theroot.com/yvonne-orji-gets-honest-about-the-pent-up-energy-of-b-1850996498&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theroot.com/yvonne-orji-gets-honest-about-the-pent-up-energy-of-b-1850996498"> virginal</a></span> humor to the proceedings, but most of her “jokes” land like a fart in church. In contrast, Amuli is happy allowing her contestants to deliver the personality on her “PTB,” limiting her flair to a cute lil’ mic twirl and that shimmy she does when she lands a match.</p><p>Then, there’s the cast of singles, who are all well-dressed and range from decently to preternaturally attractive. A significant aspect of O.G. “PTB’s” charm is that several of its contestants look like they either rolled out of bed to come to the show or their friends should be arrested for allowing them to go on camera dressed as they are. And they <em>damn</em> sure don’t all look like they had modeling contracts at some point.</p><p>There’s also the jocular tone of the whole proceedings — as if no one is <em>really </em>there to find a boo and it’s all for play-play. The several reality TV stars ruin the whole damn thing: The first single guy is a jackwagon named Johnny Bananas who was on MTV’s “The Real World” and who goes out of his way to be the most inauthentic human being next to the guy whose job it is to maintain President Donald Trump’s hair.</p><p>So many other aspects of “Live” just don’t hit. The post-round “confessionals.” The live audience and Orji responding to every <em>single</em> balloon pop. The vibe that everyone is there for exposure — which, in fairness, is a staple of the O.G. “PTB,” where 85 percent of the participants are “entrepreneurs.”</p><p>“Live” is yet another example of an authentically Black product getting in the hands of folks with money who bastardize and gentrify it to a pulp. It’s like what would happen if “Verzuz,” the beloved pandemic-era music competition which featured Black artists in every episode, pitted Taylor Swift against Katy Perry.</p><p>In fact, the racial dynamics on “Live” are cringy out the gate: One of the non-Black women pops on Bananas and says, “My physical type is Black,” to which he, a white boy, responds, “I’m Black from the waist up.” And there’s the blondest woman on the panel “rapping” and gyrating while insisting she grew up in Michigan listening to…Chingy. (So, “Right Thurr” on repeat her whole childhood?) Also, the spirit of Dr. Umar Johnson flowed through me every time a white woman popped on a Black male single.</p><p>We simply don’t have to worry about this shit on Amuli’s “Pop the Balloon.”</p><p>Arguably, the O.G. “Pop The Balloon” isn’t actually good <em>for </em>Black folks in how it lays bare the interminable, tired 50-50, “what-do-you-bring-to-the-table”-head ass conversations — that’s a discussion for a different rant. But there’s something charming about the low budget, somewhat ratchet nature of Amuli’s version: The whole thing looks like its shot on a Samsung Galaxy phone and paid for with a few orders of Zaxby’s, and we love it.</p><p>Fortunately, Amuli will continue her Wednesday YouTube show, hopefully maintaining the stripped-down, all Black vibe with which we fell in love. Because my guess is, with the seemingly universal early disdain for “Pop The Balloon Live,” it’s gonna go the route of the “Good Times” Netflix “remake” very damn soon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The rumored portable edition of the PlayStation 6 won't be as powerful as the PlayStation 5, according to information shared by a known leaker.</p>
<p>Speaking last month on the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/do-you-agree-with-chatgpt-that-ps6-portable-can-match-the-power-of-ps5-in-all-parameters-by-2028.1681803/page-3#post-270213490" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeoGAF forums</a>, as reported today on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jywrgn/kepler_says_the_portable_ps6_is_a_15w_soc_on_3nm/">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, known AMD leaker Kepler L2 revealed that the portable edition of the next-generation console by Sony won't be as powerful as the PlayStation 5, as it will be powered by a 15W SoC on 3nm. As the system is said to be able to run PS5 games, it will definitely be interesting to see how the portable system will be able to do so and which compromises will have to be made to achieve this.</p>
<p>Very little is currently known about the PlayStation 6 as of now. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-soc-design-complete/">Earlier this year</a>, we heard again from Kepler L2 that the SoC is design complete and entered pre-silicon validation with A0 tapeout scheduled for later this year. While this doesn't tell us much about the console, the usual timeframe from A0 tapeout and release is 2 years, so there's a chance the system will launch in 2027.</p>
<p>The only thing we know for certain about the PlayStation 6 is that it will once again be powered by AMD. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-powered-amd/">Last year</a>, it was confirmed that Intel also bid to produce the console, but ultimately AMD won due to a dispute at Intel over how much profit the company would make from each chip sold to Sony, which prevented the company from deciding on a price.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/marathon-wont-be-a-full-priced-game-according-to-bungie/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bungie unveiled its new team-based extraction shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-showcases-marathon-gameplay-release-date-announced-for-september-2025/">Marathon</a> over the weekend, giving us our first honest look at the gameplay and a release date to look forward to. However, we did not get any idea about how much it would cost.</p>
<p>We've known for some time now that Marathon will not be a free-to-play title. The current rumor is that it will be priced at the same level Concord was, at $40. After the weekend showcase went live, previews for Marathon from the press who attended a recent in-person event where they got to play the game and speak to members of Marathon's team at Bungie also went live. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/">GameSpot's</a> preview seems to shed more light on how Marathon will be priced.</p>
<p>Bungie told GameSpot that Marathon will be a "<em>premium</em>" release. Though they did not provide a specific number or price range, Bungie did confirm that it would not be a "<em>full-priced</em> <em>title.</em>"</p>
<p>That might be clear as mud, but it at least officially confirms what was already rumored: Marathon will not be aiming for that $70 premium price tag that most triple-A games get. This keeps the $40 price point still firmly in the lead as to what the price of the game might actually be.</p>
<p>With that said, there's a good chance it could be even less than $40 because the significant remaining variable is how Sony will approach Marathon after watching Concord fail in such a big way last year. The two games aren't entirely comparable. Concord was made by a studio with nowhere near Bungie's legacy. Concord was entirely a brand-new series, unlike Marathon, which has an existing fan base that would be interested in trying this reboot of the series.</p>
<p>There's also likely a contingent of Bungie die-hard fans who will buy Marathon just to try the latest game from their favorite studio. Those factors alone make it very unlikely that Marathon crashes in the same way Concord did.</p>
<p>Still, it wouldn't be surprising if Sony chose to hedge its bets by making the barrier to entry for Marathon cheaper than it was for Concord. Pricing won't be the only factor in Marathon's success or lack thereof, but it will still play a big role. Hopefully, we'll have a better idea of the price soon.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marathon-release-date-and-first-gameplay-revealed.1163673/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bungie has announced a release date for its&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>reboot, which will reimagine the original 90s series of single-player FPS games as a multiplayer extraction shooter.</p>

<p>As revealed over the weekend, the&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>release date is September 23rd. A closed alpha test is also being held between April 23rd and May 4th, and if you want to get into that, you'll have to sign up to the official&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em><a href="https://discord.gg/marathonthegame" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Discord</a> (it's free, though, don't worry).</p>

<p>Narrative director Julia Nardin describes&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>as "both a reimagining of and a direct successor to the original games"; you'll "recognize characters, locations and events" from the original&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>games in the new title, but "those events played out slightly differently" than you may remember.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed-aiming.jpg?itok=MuiY29OP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed-aiming.jpg?itok=INwxFRWe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bungie's&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>reboot lands in September.</figcaption></figure><p>Bungie's goal with&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>is to inject story into the traditional extraction shooter gameplay template, so "new mysteries and stories" will be available to discover in each season. Some of those moments will happen in-game, and others will "go beyond the game", utilizing the likes of ARGs (alternate reality games) and trailers.</p>

<p>As for the gameplay, well,&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>is an extraction shooter, just as you'd expect. You'll team up with up to two other players, facing off against "AI security forces, otherworldly threats, and rival Runner teams" as you explore a lost colony on the planet of Tau Ceti IV.</p>

<p>You'll choose from a range of Runners, each of whom has "unique abilities, stats, and styles", and you'll further customize them using the loot you find while exploring Tau Ceti IV.</p>

<p>You can take a look at&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>'s debut gameplay trailer, which gives a pretty good sense of what kind of game you can expect in September, right here.</p>




<p><em>Marathon</em>'s road to release began back in May 2023, when the reboot of the beloved 90s series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-resurrects-marathon-playstation-showcase" rel="nofollow">was first announced</a>. Following that, Bungie <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/learn-what-marathon-is-all-about-in-new-video-from-bungie" rel="nofollow">revealed a little more info about the game</a> before dropping off the radar for "an extended period" to develop&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>further.</p>

<p>In the months between then and now, Bungie seemingly ran into some snags with&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>; the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-2-developer-bungie-suffers-layoffs-among-reported-delays-for-final-shape-and" rel="nofollow">suffered</a> numerous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees" rel="nofollow">layoffs</a> as&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>was reportedly internally delayed.</p>

<p>Following that, director Christopher Barrett was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-director-fired-report-bungie" rel="nofollow">quietly fired</a> from the project over misconduct allegations last year. He subsequently brought a lawsuit against Sony regarding the dismissal, although Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-evidence" rel="nofollow">has pushed back</a> against the claims he made in that lawsuit.</p>

<p><em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065800/Marathon/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marathon/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marathon/9PB32DKQKZDQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on September 23rd.</p>

<p>A new DOOM 1 and DOOM 2 Edition from Limited Run Games could be the best yet. It’s become a running joke over the years to see what DOOM can run on. Now, it literally runs in a box, and only 666 people have the chance to secure this incredible bundle.</p>



<p>I’ve seen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-can-run-the-original-doom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM played in Fortnite</a>, on fridges and calculators, and I’m sure someone’s probably got it to work on a pencil at this point. DOOM is considered the father of first-person shooters (shout out to Wolfenstein too), and its impact is still being felt in 2025.</p>



<p>It’s not just old DOOM games either. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-pc-specifications/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM The Dark Ages</a> is one of the biggest games of 2025. But if you can’t wait, you might need to fight off Imps, Cacodemons, and people if you want to secure Limited Run Games’ DOOM Will It Run Edition.</p>



<h2 id="h-limited-edition-doom-will-it-run-is-very-limited">Limited-Edition DOOM “Will It Run?” is Very Limited</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You get so much cool stuff. Credit to Limited Run Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Limited Run Games is doing a special DOOM 1 and DOOM 2 collection of the two original games lumped together in one physical package. It’s great for collectors and people who want to buy DOOM again for the umpteenth time.</p>



<p>If you want more, the Big Box Edition comes with Cassette Tapes and Trading Cards. But you’re here for the big gun, and the <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/products/doom-doom-ii-will-it-run-edition-switch-ps5-xbox-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Will It Run Edition</a> comes inside a giant box in the style of an old-school DOOM door.</p>



<p><strong>It’s $666.66 and is limited to the first 666 people who buy it!</strong></p>



<p>This demonic deal includes the following content:</p>



<ul>
<li>DOOM + DOOM II Game*</li>



<li>Box that Plays DOOM</li>



<li>Two Piece Big Box</li>



<li>Cassette Tape Soundtrack Set with Slipcase
<ul>
<li>Includes Base Soundtrack and full IDFKR Soundtrack&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Floating Cacodemon – on Magnetic Base
<ul>
<li>3’ Cacodemon with 5’ Base</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Handheld Cacodemon – Plays DOOM</li>



<li>Trading Card Pack includes five random cards</li>



<li>Certificate of Authenticity&nbsp;</li>



<li><em>*PC Edition includes Digital Steam Code</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The “Box that Plays DOOM” is easily the best feature. It’s tongue-in-cheek, it’s a remarkable piece of memorabilia in its own right, and it is a must-have for hardened DOOM fans.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Before it made a name for itself in the gaming industry with the Halo series, Bungie's big video game series was Marathon, a grand sci-fi saga that was originally released for Mac. In many ways, Marathon was ahead of its time thanks to its rich lore, groundbreaking gameplay elements, and ideas that would help shape Bungie's work on Halo and Destiny. After decades of dormancy, Marathon returns later this year, this time as a multiplayer-focused extraction shooter that combines Bungie's signature gunplay with a vibrant art direction.</p><p dir="ltr">Ahead of its launch in September, we've gathered up all the pertinent information on the game and you can read up to see how Marathon is shaping up.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#When_will_Marathon_be_released_">When will Marathon be released?</a></li><li><a href="#Marathon_preorders">Marathon preorders</a></li><li><a href="#Marathon_platforms">Marathon platforms</a></li><li><a href="#Is_Marathon_free_to_play_">Is Marathon free-to-play?</a></li><li><a href="#Marathon_Alpha">Marathon Alpha</a></li><li><a href="#Marathon_storyline">Marathon storyline</a></li><li><a href="#Marathon_gameplay">Marathon gameplay</a></li><li><a href="#Marathon_Runners">Marathon Runners</a><ul><li><a href="#Locus">Locus</a></li><li><a href="#Blackbird">Blackbird</a></li><li><a href="#Glitch">Glitch</a></li><li><a href="#Void">Void</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Marathon_screenshots">Marathon screenshots</a></li><li><a href="#Marathon_is_a_multiplayer_only_game">Marathon is a multiplayer-only game</a></li><li><a href="#Is_Marathon_a_sequel_to_the_original_trilogy_">Is Marathon a sequel to the original trilogy?</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_will_Marathon_be_released_">When will Marathon be released?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4144884-marathon%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4144884" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4144884-marathon%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4144884"></a><figcaption>One of the Runners off Marathon</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4144884-marathon%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-releases-in-september-on-same-day-as-another-big-game/1100-6530810/">Marathon will launch on September 23, 2025</a>. This will be around two years after Bungie first unveiled the game, although it's worth noting that the studio has undergone massive restructuring since then. There were 220 employees laid off in 2024, and former Marathon director Chris Barrett was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/-marathon-video-game-director-barrett-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behavior" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reportedly fired for inappropriate behavior</a>, a claim that he is disputing as he is suing both Sony and Bungie.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Marathon_preorders">Marathon preorders</h2><p dir="ltr">Physical and digital preorders for Marathon aren't open yet, but we'll update this page as soon the listings go live.<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-preorder-bonuses-appear-to-have-leaked-on-steam/1100-6529918/"> Preorder bonuses for Marathon</a> might have already leaked as well, as datamining fans claim that free Marathon-themed skins that players can use to dress up their Guardian in Bungie's Destiny 2 will be an incentive to grab the game.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Marathon_platforms">Marathon platforms</h2><p dir="ltr">While Sony acquired Bungie--at a cost of over $3.5 billion--back in 2022, Marathon won't be exclusive to PlayStation. The game will arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, with full cross-play and cross-save support. Bungie also confirmed that<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-wont-need-a-psn-account-to-play-on-pc-or-xbox/1100-6530767/"> PC and Xbox players won't need a PSN account</a> to play Marathon.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Is_Marathon_free_to_play_">Is Marathon free-to-play?</h2><p dir="ltr">Unlike many other games in the live-service space, Marathon will not be free-to-play. Pricing hasn't been revealed yet, and<a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1911129962943549877" rel="nofollow "> Bungie says</a> that it will not be a "full-priced" title when it launches. It has been rumored that<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-will-be-40-report/1100-6526561/"> Marathon will cost $40 when it launches</a>, the same price as<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-new-game-concord-going-offline-after-just-over-a-week/1100-6526235/"> Sony's ill-fated Concord</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Marathon_Alpha">Marathon Alpha</h2><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-closed-alpha-begins-in-april-heres-how-to-sign-up/1100-6530808/">Marathon's first closed alpha test will begin in April 2025</a>, and if you're interested in trying it out, you can join the official<a href="https://discord.gg/marathonthegame" rel="nofollow "> Marathon Discord</a> for the chance to get access to this early cut of the game. There will be several playtesting sessions before the September launch as well.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Marathon_storyline">Marathon storyline</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8eLy_C5lOM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/e8eLy_C5lOM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">We're going to be insultingly brief here, but let's just say that Marathon can give Destiny a run for its money when it comes to lore quality and quantity. The original series of games were published exclusively on Apple Macintosh desktops from 1994 through to 1996, and the overarching story involves space exploration, civil war, hostile alien invaders, immortal cyborg super-soldiers, and the concept of using a hollowed-out Martian moon to transport resources between planets.</p><p dir="ltr">The Marathon trilogy storyline is one that has been chronicled and preserved for <em>decades </em>by fans, and while you won't need to know any of it before the new game launches, Bungie says that there will be references to the trilogy that longtime fans will appreciate.</p><p dir="ltr">"A massive ghost ship hangs in low orbit over a lost colony on Tau Ceti IV," the official synopsis reads. "The 30,000 souls who call this place home have disappeared without a trace. Strange signals hint at mysterious artifacts, long-dormant AI, and troves of untold riches. You are a runner, venturing into the unknown in a fight for fame… and infamy. Who among you will write their names across the stars?"</p><p dir="ltr">In the reveal stream, Bungie revealed a few more details. For starters, the game takes place in 2893, and you'll play as a runner; a synthetic human working for one of several factions as you scour the planet for valuable artifacts. "Survive and everything you've scavenged is yours to keep for future runs on Tau Ceti IV or if you're brave enough, a journey to the derelict Marathon ship that hangs above," the updated synopsis reads.</p><p dir="ltr">We also know that Marathon will use seasonal storytelling to flesh out its narrative, with each season lasting three months.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Marathon_gameplay">Marathon gameplay</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4144885-marathon%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4144885" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4144885-marathon%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4144885"></a><figcaption>A closer look at a Marathon Runner.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4144885-marathon%283%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Winning in Marathon can also be achieved through several different methods, and Bungie says that it wants to make these elements as accessible as possible.</p><p dir="ltr">"One of the ways we're addressing this is by making the core fantasies of survival and extraction fun, clear, and easy to understand," Barrett explained. "We want people to quickly understand fundamentals like healing, or oxygen, or how to organize their gear. After all, if they get those things intuitively there’s much more room for tactical thinking and creativity. You know, it's our job to create the fun and the fantasy, not the busy work and tedium."</p><p dir="ltr">As you'd expect from an entry in this genre, Marathon players can expect to face some stiff resistance when they're out in the field. Teams of three will battle each other and powerful NPCs in the wild, and if you die, you'll lose all of the loot that you acquired from your expedition.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/">In his hands-on preview of Marathon</a>, GameSpot's Tamoor Hussain commented on how the gameplay feels excellent, but the experience could leave a lot to be desired.</p><p dir="ltr">"After around eight hours of gameplay where I faced off against developers, content creators, and members of the press, I left Bungie's Bellevue studio keen to play more of its high-stakes PvPvE multiplayer game. And at the same time, I couldn't deny that I had serious concerns about the experience that its compulsive gameplay loop is couched within," Hussain said "Putting it plainly, I'm worried Marathon could launch as a solid multiplayer shooter that is brimming with potential but thin on content. And in the dog-eat-dog world of multiplayer games, that could be a major issue."</p><p dir="ltr">Another feature of Marathon that might be a hard sell is its seasonal model, as while players will be able to amass a sizable arsenal with successful extractions, each new season will reset all Runners back to square one. The seasonal reset will add new zones, weapons, events, and stories, but losing your loot might be a bitter pill to swallow.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Marathon_Runners">Marathon Runners</h2><p dir="ltr">Marathon is a focused PvP game from Bungie--one in which players can play solo or with up to two other players joining them. As a Runner, you'll be venturing out into the wilds of Tau Ceti IV as you compete for survival, riches, and renown in a world of evolving zones. You'll be running into some not-so-friendly fire while out in the field, but thanks to the cloning technologies mastered in 2850, you'll be able to shrug off death, as shifting your consciousness between bodies is a part of everyday Runner life. Speaking of Runners, there'll be six distinct classes to choose from, and details on four of them have been revealed. Each Runner is equipped with a Prime and Tactical ability, as well as two Traits to complement specific playstyles.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Locus">Locus</h3><p dir="ltr">The soldiers of Marathon, Locus

That means that you can expect a narrative and a "rich, immersive world" according to the game director. "Our design philosophy here is to have players affect the story of the world through their choices and their actions. This approach also lets us shape the overall narrative direction of the game experience while giving players a direct sense of agency and power."</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie says that it's creating opportunities for player-driven stories to unfold across a world full of persistent and evolving zones. That might mean that players cross paths and engage in a firefight against each other for the same loot, or a last-second extraction while fending off hostile AI-controlled enemies. The reveal stream did confirm that players will be able to switch squad autofill off and play as a solo Runner, if you're up to the challenge.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the developer, it's also working on ideas that will see tangible changes across the game world. One such example given is that a crew could discover a hidden artifact that opens a new area of the map for all players to explore, with such discoveries being available during every season of Marathon.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Is_Marathon_a_sequel_to_the_original_trilogy_">Is Marathon a sequel to the original trilogy?</h2><p dir="ltr">Unsurprisingly, Bungie is offering a vague answer to Marathon's place in the established timeline. Game director Christopher Barrett has described the game as being "not a direct sequel to the originals, but something that certainly belongs in the same universe."</p>

<p>According to a new report, Nintendo Switch 2 units manufactured in China will face a 145% US import tariff.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-switch-2s-from-china-could-face-145-us-tariff">Nintendo Switch 2s From China Could Face 145% US Tariff</h2>



<p><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/China-made-Nintendo-Switch-2-in-line-for-145-tariff-hit-supplier-warns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nikkei Asia</a> (via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jywikr/chinamade_nintendo_switch_2_in_line_for_145/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Zukhov-74</a>) reports that the Nintendo Switch 2 and other game consoles manufactured in China will fall victim to “the trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.” They recently reviewed an “internal assessment memo” from a “major Apple and Nintendo supplier,” and things don’t seem bright for Nintendo’s upcoming console.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The memo states that game consoles manufactured in China will still face the 145% US import tariff for goods made in China. This means the Nintendo Switch 2s from China are “in line for a massive hit.” This could be one reason why the company decided to delay pre-orders, as it wanted to “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-in-us-due-to-trump-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assess the potential impact</a>” of the tariffs on the US market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report adds that a significant chunk of Nintendo Switch 2 consoles “are made in China” and a “relatively small proportion made in Vietnam.” Hence, it will be hard for the company to manoeuvre through such circumstances. This might also explain why pre-orders for the upcoming console have been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-in-canada/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed in Canada</a> at the last minute.&nbsp;However, there’s no official word from Nintendo at the moment.</p>



<p>In other news, Nintendo Switch 2 pre-order invites will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-invites/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">begin rolling out next month</a>. Also, ‘Breath of the Wild’ and its upcoming DLC cost <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breath-of-the-wild-and-its-dlc-is-90-on-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$90 on the upcoming console</a>.

Amazon clearly got the memo because a bunch of solid bundles just dropped , including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-surging-sparks-is-the-best-scarlet-and-violet-set">Surging Sparks</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-preview">Journey Together</a> and Paldean Fates. If you’ve been telling yourself you’re just buying “a few packs for the kids,” this is your moment to stock up and pretend it’s not for you. I’m not judging. I’m doing the same thing.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Catch Surging Sparks, Journey Together and Paldean Fates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also want to point out the Mass Effect statues in the IGN Store, because apparently my bookshelf wasn’t crowded enough with plastic space heroes. Commander Shepard and crew are up for pre-order, and yes, I already added Jack to my cart because I enjoy chaos. There’s also a Humble Bundle packed with narrative indies that scream “you have emotions, deal with them.” All in all, it’s a good day to make impulsive but justifiable purchases.</p><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-surg"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surg">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surging Sparks</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218606"><div id="218606" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surging Sparks</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I picked up Surging Sparks because six booster packs under $50 is lower than what Amazon has been charging recently (It's still above MSRP though) Honestly, I wanted something new to crack open. It’s part of the latest Scarlet &amp; Violet expansion, so if you’re trying to keep up with current sets or just enjoy the chaos of pulling a good card, this one’s a smart grab.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-ionos-bellibolt-ex-pre"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Iono’s Bellibolt ex Pre">Pokémon TCG: Iono’s Bellibolt ex Premium Collection</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218607"><div id="218607" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Iono’s Bellibolt ex Premium Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This one’s for the collectors who care as much about presentation as they do the pulls. Iono’s Bellibolt ex Premium Collection comes with six packs, a full-art promo, and a display sheet that’s more elaborate than it needs to be — in a good way. It's also a cool way to snag Journey Together packs with a fantastic promo card.</p></div><p id="mass-effect-merchandise"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mass Effect Merchandise">Mass Effect Merchandise</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218608"><div id="218608" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mass Effect Merchandise</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think anyone who's replayed Mass Effect more than once knows exactly why these statues are tempting. I pre-ordered Jack immediately because, well, it felt necessary. The line includes Shepard, Tali, Legion, and others, and they look good enough that I’ve already made space for them on the shelf. If you're still quoting Garrus unironically, these are for you.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-and-violet-pa"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet: Pa"> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet: Paldean Fates: Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218609"><div id="218609" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet: Paldean Fates: Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Paldean Fates is priced a double MSRP, but it's also very hard to come by in 2025. I grabbed it because the baby shiny sub-set is awesome, but if you just want to grab the single cards from this set, it might actually save you money.</p></div><p id="fellow-traveller-publisher-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Fellow Traveller Publisher Bundle">Fellow Traveller Publisher Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218610"><div id="218610" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fellow Traveller Publisher Bundle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Pay less to get fewer items, or pay extra to give more to publishers, Humble, and charity One Tree Planted</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This bundle has some of the better narrative indies from the last few years. I paid the $12, added the games to my backlog like I always do, and immediately booted up The Pale Beyond. It’s a strong lineup if you like character-driven games and don’t mind occasionally being emotionally wrecked by minimalist storytelling.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-and-violet-shr"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shr"> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218611"><div id="218611" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think of this one as the all-in-one box for when you want cards <em>and</em> a bunch of gear you probably won’t use but still want around. Nine booster packs, a promo, sleeves, dice, and enough extras to make you feel like you’re doing more than just opening packs. It’s a solid option if you like having a little structure with your chaos.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-terapagos-ex-ultra-pre"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Pokémon TCG: Terapagos ex Ultra-Pre"> Pokémon TCG: Terapagos ex Ultra-Premium Collection</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218612"><div id="218612" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Pokémon TCG: Terapagos ex Ultra-Premium Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I hesitated on this one, then immediately remembered it includes 18 booster packs and a playmat. It’s definitely a big spend, but if you’ve been waiting for a premium bundle that actually justifies the price, this checks out. I picked it up more for the experience than the individual cards, and that’s the right way to approach it.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-shining-fates-collectio"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Shining Fates Collectio">Pokémon TCG: Shining Fates Collection Pikachu V Box</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218613"><div id="218613" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Shining Fates Collection Pikachu V Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I grabbed Shining Fates Pikachu V mostly because I never actually opened it when it first dropped, and now seemed like a good excuse. Four booster packs, a Pikachu promo, and the oversized card that ends up somewhere near your desk — standard stuff, but still a nice throwback if you missed it the first time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
