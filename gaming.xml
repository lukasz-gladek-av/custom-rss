			<p><a href="https://rebel-wolves.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebel Wolves</a> is a games studio that was co-founded in 2022 by industry veteran Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, the Game Director of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Yesterday, they announced that they are entering a strategic partnership with <a href="https://wccftech.com/bandai-namco-begins-laying-off-employees-after-cancellation-of-several-titles/">Bandai Namco Entertainment</a> Europe. This agreement means that Bandai Namco Entertainment will be responsible for publishing Rebel Wolves' debut title, an action RPG named Dawnwalker. Bandai Namco will be responsible for publishing this title globally, as well as taking on the responsibility for both the retail and digital distribution of the game upon release on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>Dawnwalker is the first title for Rebel Wolves and is shaping up to be a dark fantasy narrative sandbox, AAA action RPG that takes place in medieval Europe. The game is targeting mature audiences and will be developed utilizing Unreal Engine 5. At the moment, the details regarding the project are minimal, but it's said that the developers will reveal more information about what is to come in the upcoming months.</p>
<p>Chief Publishing Officer Tomasz Tinc commented on the partnership between Rebel Wolves and Bandai Namco Entertainment, saying: "Rebel Wolves is a new studio built upon solid foundations: a combination of experience and fresh energy. Bandai Namco Entertainment Europe, a company known for its dedication to the role-playing genre and willingness to engage with new IPs, is a perfect match for our wolfpack. Not only does it share our values, but also its track record in publishing narrative-driven RPGs speaks for itself. We're looking forward to working with them to bring the first chapter of the Dawnwalker saga to gamers worldwide."</p>
<p>From the statements made by Rebel Wolves and Bandai Namco Entertainment Europe, it seems that this project is shaping up to be highly ambitious, with the promise of future games to tie into their debut release. Alberto Gonzalez Lorca, VP for Business Development at Bandai Namco Entertainment Europe, said, "This is another key milestone in our content development strategy for the Western market. By combining our strengths, we will deliver this first game of the studio to a worldwide audience. We're excited with the universe being created by Rebel Wolves thanks to their extremely talented team of developers, resulting in a great addition to our portfolio."</p>
<p>More details about this exciting-sounding title will be released in the coming months, making it a new project for eager fans to keep their eyes on.</p>
<p>Is Dawnwalker a game that you'll be keeping track of? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/trails-studio-nihon-falcom-considering-using-ai-for-translation-in-future.1016130/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nihon-falcom-considering-ai-translation<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Trails&nbsp;</em>developer Nihon Falcom is considering using AI in order to assist with translation for its future games, the studio's CEO has revealed.</p>
<p>In an interview with Japanese gaming platform <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20241009051/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">4Gamer</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/trails-series-developer-nihon-falcom-eyes-using-ai-translation-to-shorten-localization-process/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>), Nihon Falcom head Toshihiro Kondo said that leaving initial translation work to AI could "compress the entire process and ultimately speed up development".</p>
<p>Kondo acknowledges that "human effort would still be needed to make final adjustments to the translated words and lines", but expresses a hope that AI translation could shorten the distance between the Japanese release of a Nihon Falcom game and the Western release.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nihon-falcom-ai-translation-daybreak-2.jpg?itok=MMvmDGqh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nihon-falcom-ai-translation-daybreak-2.jpg?itok=PLyARZxv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Future Nihon Falcom games could be translated by AI before being tweaked by humans.</figcaption></figure><p>In the interview, Kondo says that it's not possible to release&nbsp;<em>Trails&nbsp;</em>games simultaneously worldwide due to the amount of text in them, which he says is "several times larger than that of a typical RPG".</p>
<p>According to Kondo, the Nihon Falcom team begins translation work on a&nbsp;<em>Trails&nbsp;</em>game once the Japanese version is complete, which is why Western versions of the games usually "come out a year later at best".</p>
<p>He doesn't acknowledge the possibility of bringing in a translation team to work on a&nbsp;<em>Trails&nbsp;</em>game alongside the Japanese developers, although it's fair to say Nihon Falcom is a relatively small studio, so perhaps this isn't possible for logistical reasons.</p>
<p>In any case, although Kondo doesn't fully commit to using AI in order to translate future&nbsp;<em>Trails&nbsp;</em>games, I'd be surprised if we didn't start seeing first-pass translations done by AI on&nbsp;<em>Trails&nbsp;</em>games, with humans touching up the results to make sure they're fit for purpose.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nihon-falcom-ai-translation-trails-in-the-sky.jpg?itok=x1F38nqv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nihon-falcom-ai-translation-trails-in-the-sky.jpg?itok=Z7NEZ9s5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nihon Falcom is currently working on&nbsp;a remake of&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Kondo doesn't say his studio has already used AI to work on any translations, which means we probably won't see AI being used for projects like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trails-through-daybreak-2-release-date">Trails through Daybreak 2</a>&nbsp;</em>or the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky&nbsp;</em>remake, nor should other <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ys-x-nordics-release-date">games like&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ys-x-nordics-release-date">Ys X: Nordics</a>&nbsp;</em>be affected.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Nihon Falcom.</p>

For instance, buying Night School Studio and releasing <em>Oxenfree II</em>. But given the streamer’s (sensible) focus on mobile gaming, it was a contrary move to have hired some serious industry bigwigs for a larger project.</p><p>In April 2023, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/veteran-halo-destiny-director-joins-netflix-games-1850344778&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/veteran-halo-destiny-director-joins-netflix-games-1850344778">it was announced that Joseph Staten</a></span>—creative director on the <em>Halo</em> franchise, amongst a lot more—was joining Netflix Games to helm “a brand-new AAA multiplatform game and original IP.” He joined other big names at the division run by former EA exec Mike Verdu, like Blizzard producer Chacko Sonny and Sony Santa Monica’s art director on <em>God of War</em>, Rafael Grassetti. This nominal dream team was set to create something completely new, and now it seems likely we’ll see nothing of their work.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/netflix-games-hades-dead-cells-gta-1851600876&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-games-hades-dead-cells-gta-1851600876">Netflix Is Making 80 New Games, Added To The 100 You Forgot You Had</a></span></p><p>This is nothing unusual in the games industry. It’s very common for a publisher to hire a big name or two after their significant successes, only to see that person move on a few years later with no new games to their name. Internal projects often fail to make it to an alpha build—a process which can take months or years—and even if no releases come of it, the whole process <em>can</em> be a positive experience. (Usually you can tell when the individual involved leaves to start their own studio, employing a suspiciously large number of former colleagues.) However, when it’s a company that has no real games development experience, it does seem more likely than not to fail. </p><p>Ask anyone from Typhoon Studios, bought by Google just before the release of <em>Journey to the Savage Planet </em>during the search engine’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/stadia-google-refund-cloud-streaming-assassins-creed-1849597014&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/stadia-google-refund-cloud-streaming-assassins-creed-1849597014">ill-fated foray into epic albatross Stadia</a></span>.

That's the entire idea behind Activision's character, The Replacer. As played by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/until-dawns-peter-stormare-will-reprise-his-role-in-the-movie/1100-6525489/" data-ref-id="1100-6525489">Until Dawn</a>'s Peter Stormare (and occasionally other performers), The Replacer steps in when people need to play Call of Duty. This past weekend, one of the Replacers actually tagged in for the Los Angeles Rams' mascot during an NFL game.</p><p>There may have been some crossed wires there, as The Replacer with the Rampage mask was confronted by the actual Rampage who serves as the official LA Rams mascot. It was an easy mistake to make! Perhaps he was supposed to show up this Sunday, after the release of Black Ops 6. Then we'll see if Rampage is still feeling put out about his temporary replacement.</p><p>Since sports are one of the few examples of broadcast programming that still command a large audience, video game and movie companies are increasingly coming up with new ways to promote their projects during those events.

Unfortunately, since The Replacer isn't real, the rest of us will have to make other arrangements when Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 hits Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on October 25.

			<p>Today, NVIDIA has released a new GeForce Game Ready driver, delivering optimizations for the following games and DLCs launching shortly: Alan Wake 2: The Lake House, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, No More Room In Hell 2, Red Dead Redemption, and The Axis Unseen. The driver also also adds support for 32 additional G-SYNC Compatible displays.</p>
<p>All the aforementioned PC games and more will support NVIDIA DLSS 3, starting with the second Alan Wake 2 DLC, The Lake House, <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-dlc-new-trailer-confirms-october-22nd-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which is out today</a>. Remedy's game actually offers the complete NVIDIA RTX package: DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Ray Reconstruction, path tracing, and Reflex.</p>
<p>Then there's No More Room in Hell 2, which we covered with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-more-room-in-hell-2-qa-torn-banner-talks-permadeath-roguelike-and-sandbox-ish-elements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gamescom 2024 Q&amp;A</a>. The sequel in development at Torn Banner Studios debuts today in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/292000/No_More_Room_in_Hell_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early access</a>, already packing support for DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, DLAA, and Reflex.</p>
<p>Last but not least, another game due to launch in a few hours is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1807810/The_Axis_Unseen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Axis Unseen</a>, a 'heavy metal horror game' singlehandedly made by Nate Purkeypile, a 20-year Bethesda veteran who worked on Fallout 3, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Fallout 4, Fallout 76, and Starfield. This indie game also supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Reflex. In two days, the strategy/simulation/management game Industry Giant 4.0 will also launch in early access with NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, DLAA, and Reflex.</p>
<p>Next week, it will be up to two heavyweights. On October 29, Rockstar Games will finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-is-out-on-october-29-system-requirements-nvidia-dlss-frame-generation-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release</a> the long-awaited PC version of Red Dead Redemption, which will include DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Reflex. Two days later, BioWare is set to launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/dragon-age-the-veilguard-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-dragon-age-in-a-decade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, the follow-up to Inquisition (a decade later). The game also supports DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Reflex, and ray traced reflections and ambient occlusion. On the same day, Guerrilla will launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-launching-this-october-on-pc-and-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a> with Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Reflex. Lastly, DLSS Super Resolution was added to Wayfinder yesterday as part of its 1.0 launch.</p>
<p>NVIDIA had one more thing to announce today: a new GeForce RTX Series 40 bundle dedicated to Ubisoft Massive's Star Wars Outlaws. The bundle will be available at select retailers until November 12.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/delta-force-open-beta-december<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Team Jade and publisher TiMi have announced the&nbsp;<em>Delta Force&nbsp;</em>open beta (read: Early Access) release date, with the military shooter sim revival heading to PC later this year.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2507950/view/4521142923113768394" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam announcement</a>,&nbsp;<em>Delta Force&nbsp;</em>hits Early Access on December 5th, and it'll be available on both Steam and the Epic Store. You'll be able to check the beta out for free, as well, although the two studios say there will be "paid content available for purchase".</p>
<p>This will, per Team Jade, be the initial release version of&nbsp;<em>Delta Force</em>, which means "full live-service content updates and no more progress resets". In short, if you're interested in&nbsp;<em>Delta Force&nbsp;</em>at all, this is your chance to get in on the ground floor.</p>

Said season will bring a new Operator along with it, as well as new gameplay modes, new battlegrounds, and more.</p>
<p>According to Team Jade, the open beta "will replace Early Access", although it's not entirely clear how said "open beta" will differ from a traditional Early Access release.</p>
<p>The developer says the paid content in&nbsp;<em>Delta Force&nbsp;</em>won't contain any "pay-to-win elements", and will be restricted mainly to "Battle Passes, weapon appearances, and vehicle appearances".</p>
<p>If you've played the Next Fest demo, you can expect more maps, modes, weapons, and vehicles in the open beta, as well as "major improvements to gameplay" and a "stronger anti-cheat system".</p>

<p><em>Delta Force</em>'s main multiplayer gameplay modes will be an&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gray-zone-warfare-tarkov-players"><em>Gray Zone Warfare</em></a>-style extraction shooter mode and a large-scale PvP mode, with a single-player campaign also in the works, although it doesn't seem that this will be included in the open beta.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Delta Force&nbsp;</em>when it launches for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2507950/Delta_Force/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/delta-force-acea48" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a> on December 5th. Console and mobile versions are also planned for early next year.</p>

            <p>
I forgot about just-launched <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game Tormenture when ravelling together <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-maw-whats-new-in-pc-games-this-week-17">this week's round-up of potent PC releases</a>, but thankfully, Maw disciple Fachewachewa was on my case in the comments. It's one of your 'cursed video game' videogames in the spirit of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inscryption">Inscryption</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pony-island">Pony Island</a>, and based on a quick blast with the demo, it seems lush.</p>
<p>It's set in the 1980s, a premise I now automatically find horrible because I was born in the 1980s and that was, like, a million years ago. You're a kid who's playing a legendary 8-bit game that's said to be possessed by evil spirits. The experience sees you alternating between the surprisingly labyrinthine space of the game, and the increasingly threatening environment of your bedroom, where terrible toys abound. Did you have one of those phones on wheels with eyes as a kid? Whoever invented that deserves a spell in Arkham Asylum.

<p>
Sadly, my efforts to make headway in Tormenture's 8-bit component were constrained by the limitations of my own work laptop, which ran it a steady 10fps - this being one practical difficulty of an experience where all the notionally potato-PC-friendly elements sit within a hi-fi 3D environment. I assure you that my laptop is not possessed by restless ghosts. It is simply extremely shit. Ah, if only I had a Steam Deck like the borrowed one James Archer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-wont-sacrifice-battery-life-to-deliver-a-more-powerful-steam-deck-2">insisted on taking back from me</a> (Tormenture's Steam Deck compatibility is currently unknown).
</p><p>
Still, I did play enough to form the impression that this could be a doozie. The trick is that the game within the game is quite fleshed-out. It's not, so far, just a slammed-together Atari facsimile, but an open-ended and quite intricate puzzler, made up of labyrinths and locked doors and roaming spooks. One of the early puzzle rooms has you tempting out a zombie hand to push a button. The 3D component, meanwhile, is enchanting, with additional conundrums that are more in keeping with latter-day horror games, and lots of period bricabrac that slowly grows sinister. Or rather, more sinister. Don't look at me like that, phone.</p>
<p>Downsides? Well, it doesn't seem as loopy as Inscryption. The clear love of throwback memorabilia on show could make for an overly comfortable chiller on the whole. But why content yourself with my aimless speculations? I don't even have a proper PC to play this on. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2545220/Tormenture/">The game's demo is still live on Steam at the time of writing</a>.</p>
<p>Another thought Tormenture inspires is that games from Atari's halycon era make natural Halloween fodder because the default state of the screen is darkness. Nowadays, we're used to desktops that blaze like stained glass windows at full noon, with barely any negative space at all. Bring back those cavernous CRT graphics, I say. Make me feel young again.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-sunset-map-changes-in-valorant-patch-9-08/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Valorant patch 9.08 has dropped and the new update brings significant changes to the Sunset map. The B site has undergone a rework while the A site remains intact.</p>



<p>Coming to the details, the parts of B site that have been changed include B Main, B Main Exterior, B Site Back, B Boba, and Mid Courtyard. Let’s take a look at all the changes now.</p>



<h2 id="h-riot-updated-sunset-s-b-site-to-improve-defensibility-and-post-plant-scenarios">Riot updated Sunset’s B Site to improve defensibility and post-plant scenarios</h2>



<h3 id="h-b-main">B Main</h3>



<p>Starting with B Main, the pivot box has been removed and two boxes have been added right near the entrance and deep B Main. This new change will make things easier for retakers during post-plant situations – and a particular Cypher trip has also been removed with these changes.</p>



<figure>
<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>
</figure>



<h3 id="h-b-main-exterior">B Main Exterior</h3>



<p>In B Main Exterior, the platforms on the right have been completely removed. Defenders now be at the same level as the Attackers and won’t be able to take advantage of the elevated part of the map.</p>



<figure>
<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>
</figure>



<h3 id="h-b-site">B Site</h3>



<p>Within the B Site, the platform near the Market area has been elevated with a slight slope tapering to the left. This raised platform is high enough to hide someone in a crouched position, similar to how the platform near the Market door works in the Ascent map.</p>



<figure>
<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>
</figure>



<h3 id="h-b-site-back">B Site Back</h3>



<p>In B Site Back, the platform right near the B Boba area has been removed. It has been replaced by a smaller box near the edge of the elevated surface.</p>



<figure>
<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>
</figure>



<h3 id="h-b-boba">B Boba</h3>



<p>If you notice the changes in B Boba, it will now allow Defenders to hide deep within the elevated area. This means Attackers will have to put extra effort into clearing the angle, maybe two players wide swinging together to take the Defender down and ultimately take control after plating the spike.</p>



<figure>
<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>
</figure>



<h3 id="h-mid-courtyard">Mid Courtyard</h3>



<p>Lastly, the Mid Courtyard has been slightly tweaked. The palm tree on the extreme right has been replaced with a smaller box and some space that will allow any player to hide beside it. The structure in the middle has also been raised slightly.</p>

<p>It wouldn’t be a new Call of Duty game without a multi-mission Campaign to bolster the overall package. Black Ops 6 brings back many legendary characters and promises another blockbuster story, and it also incentivizes you with exclusive Campaign rewards on the line.</p>



<p>I shouldn’t need to be rewarded for playing a Call of Duty Campaign, but it doesn’t hurt. I’ve played every Campaign since the debut CoD title in 2003, and it’s been a wild ride. We’ve been through the wringer, too, with nuclear explosions rocking our core to storming the Reichstag in a heroic, war-ending fashion.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-release-date-time-countdown-launch-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> is set during the Gulf War, but don’t expect this to be an accurate retelling of history. Treyarch loves to mess with timelines and tinker with the past, and it has lined up a series of fun Campaign rewards if you can make it to the end of the shooter’s story.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-black-ops-6-campaign-rewards">How to Get Black Ops 6 Campaign Rewards</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Cosmetic paradise. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>You unlock Black Ops 6 Campaign rewards by <strong>completing missions and, ultimately, the whole Campaign</strong>.</p>



<p>In essence, if you complete the Black Ops 6 Campaign on any difficulty level, you pretty much guarantee yourself a ton of exclusive BLOPS 6 rewards, which can be used to customize your player profile, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-launch-weapons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch weapons</a>, and more.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-black-ops-6-campaign-rewards">All Black Ops 6 Campaign Rewards</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 Campaign rewards consist of <strong>Weapon Blueprints</strong>, an <strong>Operator Skin</strong>, a <strong>Loading Screen</strong>, a <strong>Finishing Move</strong>, <strong>Sprays</strong>, <strong>Stickers</strong>, <strong>Charms</strong>, and <strong>additional goodies yet to be revealed</strong>.</p>



<p>The rewards aren’t too shabby, all things considered. Better still, Call of Duty has revealed what each reward consists of—courtesy of one of the FPS sequel’s many pre-release <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/au/en/blog/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-part-2-character-bio-intel#Rewards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6 blogs</a>.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Type of Reward</th><th data-align="center">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Weapon Blueprint</td><td data-align="center">Case Cracker (Knife — Melee)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Weapon Blueprint</td><td data-align="center">Onyx Echo (LR 7.62 — Sniper Rifle)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Weapon Blueprint</td><td data-align="center">Pocket Aces (Jackal PDW — SMG)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Weapon Blueprint</td><td data-align="center">The Bastion (Marine SP — Shotgun)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Weapon Blueprint</td><td data-align="center">Truth Serum (Ames 85 — Assault Rifle)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Operator Skin</td><td data-align="center">Marshall — Heist</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Loading Screen</td><td data-align="center">A Good Look at the Devil</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Finishing Move</td><td data-align="center">Hook, Line, and Sinker</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Spray</td><td data-align="center">Slip Sauce</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Sticker</td><td data-align="center">Allied Effort</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Sticker</td><td data-align="center">Forging Fate</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Charm</td><td data-align="center">Tank</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Charm</td><td data-align="center">The Cradle</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The promo art for the Campaign rewards does specify that this isn’t everything, and there’s still “more” not being advertised. I would hazard a guess that XP Boosters will also be given out for completing missions. Activision has done this previously, and I would expect the trend to continue with Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>

There was, of course, that new game proposal I had written. I’d been given the OK to move forward with production, but it was going to take some time to assemble the right team. The target timeframe was [starting] April 2022. Until then, I would have to wait. </p><p>“Up to this point, I had always gone directly from one job to the next. Directors tend to stay involved in projects longer than anyone else. As one job approaches the finish line, you’ll often be getting ready for the next one—so you never get to rest. Yet after all these years, by some miracle… my schedule was wide open for several months straight!</p><p>“My next job was decided, and I was done getting ready for it, but the team hadn’t been assembled yet—leading to this longer-than-usual gap. What a lucky break! It was time for some fun! Maybe a trip around the world? Well, I can’t do that because of [my cat] Fukurashi. Recently, she’s started getting really lonely whenever I go out. Still, I finally had some time off. I could have used it to recharge, but I felt as though this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. So I ended up using that time to plan out this very YouTube channel.</p><!-- AD: content -->

            <p>Sony developer Guerrilla seems to be done with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killzone">Killzone</a>, instead now favouring its Horizon series.</p>
<p>According to art director Roy Postma, Guerrilla's decision to start working on the Horizon series was a conscious choice by the developer, and one which would see it move away from the darker and more violent Killzone games the studio was initially known for.</p>
<p>"We were done with it as a team. As a studio, we needed to refresh the palette. It was, by choice, the opposite of 'Killzone,'" Postma told the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/10/21/lego-horizon-adventures-is-all-ages-crossover-sonys-dreams/">Washington Post</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>The developer now has its focus on the Horizon series, which began with Zero Dawn back in 2017.</p>
<p>"I think the themes that this story and the characters represent are relatable for all ages and people, like having a found family of friends and finding your place in the world," the developer continued.</p>
<p>Guerrilla is now gearing up for the release of the next Horizon game - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-horizon-adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> - which is being made in collaboration with Britain-based Studio Gobo. This bricky take on Aloy's story is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-horizon-adventures-is-a-playful-and-light-hearted-take-on-guerrillas-franchise">described as a "playful and light-hearted" take on Guerrilla's franchise</a>.</p><p>"We came from making smaller games and games for children," said Toño Gonzalez, lead game designer at Studio Gobo, when discussing the upcoming release. This was a change for Guerrilla in a lot of ways, with Postma further adding: "Making people laugh when they play the game, that was new for us."</p>
<p>I recently went hands-on with Lego Horizon Adventures, and had a lot of fun exploring the world in its new block form. "Yes, it's still a 'kids game' at its heart, but as a Horizon fan, it's one I can feel much better about when it comes to introducing my own children to Aloy's world... which now also includes hot dogs," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-horizon-adventures-lets-aloy-find-her-sense-of-humour-with-the-help-of-some-exploding-hot-dogs">Eurogamer's Horizon Lego Adventures preview</a>.</p>
<p>Outside of Lego, Guerrilla previously confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guerrilla-casually-confirms-horizon-forbidden-west-sequel">another Horizon game with Aloy at the fore is in the pipeline</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guerrilla-games-makes-its-rumoured-horizon-online-project-official">an online offering</a>. A TV show was also once in the works at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>, however recent reports said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-netflix-series-no-longer-moving-forward-following-showrunner-allegations-report">project had been cancelled</a> following accusations of "bullying, manipulative and retaliatory behaviour" by its planned showrunner Steve Blackman.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Smash Bros. creator Masahiro Sakurai has now finished his YouTube series, and revealed he has also been working on a new game the whole time.</p>
<p>Sakurai has revealed that he had the opportunity to write a game proposal back in 2021, which he completed at "lightning speed", while working on DLC for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-smash-bros-ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry I can't share more about this project, but assuming we're able to get it made, it should be announced sooner or later," he said in this latest video.</p>

<p>Then, despite being given the OK to move forward with production on the new project, Sakurai realised it would take time to assemble a team.</p>
<p>This left the Smash Bros. boss with a few months to spare before production could begin, which he decided was the perfect opportunity to begin a YouTube channel. And this is why, surprisingly, all 260 episodes he broadcast were recorded in advance during this time.</p>
<p>Sakurai launched the channel in 2022, with video editing outsourced to another company. Still, he said he'd spent the last two years juggling game production during the day with YouTube channel management in the evenings.</p>
<p>In total, Sakurai spent around 90m yen on the channel (about £460k), with the majority of that money spent on the video editing company.</p>

<p>So, what exactly could his mysterious new project be? Sakurai gives nothing away.</p>
<p>Of course, fans are speculating Sakurai has been busy working on a new Smash Bros. game for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>, but could it be something else? A new Kirby or Kid Icarus game?</p>
<p>This finale episode of Sakurai's series goes into great detail about the channel's creation, his lifestyle over the past two years, and data on viewing habits.</p>
<p>"I'm at the age now that there's no telling when I might decide to step away from the game industry," concluded Sakurai. "And there's no guarantee I'll remain in good health, either. With that in mind, I'm glad I jumped on this opportunity to leave behind my knowledge in a form other than just another game."</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sakurai-ends-youtube-channel-with-touching-tribute-to-former-nintendo-president-satoru-iwata">Sakurai released the final Grab Bag video</a> on the channel: a touching tribute to former Nintendo president Satoru Iwata.</p>
<p>"A chaos of details and features come together for one of the Switch's most generous - and exhilarating - games," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review-a-messy-magical-festival-of-video-games">Eurogamer Super Smash Bros.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/metaphor-refantazio-how-to-farm-a-exp-quickly-to-master-all-archetypes/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://metaphor.atlus.com/">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> twists the most iconic features and mechanics of the Persona series to offer an experience that is markedly different from that of the popular series. Among these twisted mechanics is the Archetype system, a deep class system that determines what each character can do in combat.</p>
<p>Some of the more advanced Archetypes, like the Elite and Royal Archetypes, require you to level up multiple Archetypes, which can be time-consuming, considering the vast majority of enemies in the game don't grant a whole lot of A-EXP. There is, however, a way to acquire tons of A-EXP to Master all Archetypes in a very short amount of time.</p>
<p>For starters, this Metaphor: ReFantazio A-EXP farming method is only available right before the final dungeon, during the preparation period before the final confrontation. Additionally, your main character needs to be at level 67 or below, as you will need to be able to stun two enemies that are, as you may have guessed, at level 67 themselves. Any higher, and you will kill the enemies in a single hit, which will make the farming method way slower and considerably less convenient.</p>
<p>This whole A-EXP farming method is centered around stunning two Blueblood Imitec enemies found in the optional dungeon called Disgraced Ruins, which can be reached with one day of travel from Gran Trad. The two enemies are found in a side room in the dungeon's lowest floor, the one with the final boss and the save point, as shown in the map below.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241022131810_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If defeated in Squad battle, the Blueblood Imitec enemies will sometimes drop a Hero's Jewelled Root, an item that grants a whopping 3000 A-EXP. By using any of the Thief family Archetypes for the main character, however, these mimic enemies can also drop a Hero's Jewelled Root after getting stunned in the field, thanks to the Pickpocket Hero Passive. To increase the chances of this happening, you can assign to your current party members the Lucky Find from the Merchant and the Luckiest Find from the Tycoon, unlocked by maxing out the bond with Brigitta, which increase chances of getting a rare item by 20% each.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241022131842_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Once you are done with your preparation, which can require quite a bit of MAG, considering you need to level up the Merchant to 10 and the Commander to 10 to unlock the Tycoon, all you need to do is to stun the enemies, wait for them to recover, and then stun them again. Before long, you will get enough Hero's Jewelled Roots to level up all your Archetypes very quickly. Be careful not to get hit by the Blueblood Imitec's attacks, as that will throw you into a Squad battle at a disadvantage, forcing you to wait a turn before being able to escape. If you're at a very low level, I suggest you drop the difficulty to Easy to avoid getting wiped out by the enemies and losing some progress.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netflix-reportedly-shuts-down-star-studded-aaa-studio-team-blue.1016031/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-team-blue-shut-down-report<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix has reportedly closed down one of its internal development studios, known as "Team Blue", with several of the high-profile staff associated with said studio no longer working at the company.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-team-blue-socal-studio" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a>, Team Blue, which boasted the involvement of the likes of ex-<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>producer Chacko Sonny and former&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>creative lead Joseph Staten, has been shut down.</p>
<p>Staten first joined Netflix's Team Blue <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halo-infinite-creative-director-joins-netflix-to-work-on-aaa-multiplatform-game-based">back in April last year</a>, announcing that he was serving as creative director on "a brand-new AAA multiplatform and original IP". Sadly, it looks like that project won't be coming to fruition now.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/netflix-team-blue-shut-down-master-chief.jpg?itok=17PXSENI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/netflix-team-blue-shut-down-master-chief.jpg?itok=IWuqpzUb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Netflix's Team Blue boasted the involvement of creatives like&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>'s Joseph Staten.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that Netflix hasn't made any kind of official announcement regarding the closure of Team Blue (which technically doesn't even have an official name), we don't know why the studio was disbanded, assuming that Totilo's report is correct.</p>
<p>However, Netflix isn't the only tech giant to be shutting down game studios or reworking projects. Amazon, for instance, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazons-games-division-hit-by-over-180-layoffs-amid-refocus-on-prime-gaming">laid off over 180 employees</a> across its gaming division in late 2023, and the company's gaming segment is apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-games-boss-lord-of-rings-mmo">still trying to find the "hook"</a> for its upcoming&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>MMO.</p>
<p>With many studios being hit by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th">layoffs</a>, closures, or project changes, it's entirely possible that Netflix simply underestimated the time and money it would require to launch a big-budget original IP, and the truth of that situation is catching up with it now.</p>
<p>It's also possible that the project simply wasn't progressing as Netflix wanted it to, or that recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds">high-profile failures</a> scared the tech giant into cutting its losses. Without an official reason, it's very difficult to say.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/netflix-team-blue-shut-down-kratos-atreus.jpg?itok=SBb86iB3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/netflix-team-blue-shut-down-kratos-atreus.jpg?itok=18DN2ftG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Team Blue also took on former&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>art director Raf Grassetti in 2023.</figcaption></figure><p>Technically, Totilo and Game File don't say that Team Blue's in-development project is being canceled, so it's possible Netflix will continue work on the game, although doing so without its key creative personnel would seem a touch foolhardy.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what Netflix is planning with regards to the future of its involvement in the gaming industry. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft has detailed how the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> Collector's Edition will change as a result of the game's shock delay. 
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows is now set to arrive next year, on 14th February 2025, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">following a dramatic postponement by publisher Ubisoft</a> last month.
</p>
<p>
Pre-orders for the game were cancelled, and plans to offer a season pass have been scrubbed - a move that directly impacts the Collector's Edition, which was set to include it within its package.
</p>
<p>
Writing on the official Assassin's Creed Discord, Ubisoft said the Assassin's Creed Shadow Collector's Edition will now be cheaper as a result of the season pass no longer being included. On console, it will cost $230/€240 (UK price TBA), around $50 cheaper, while on PC it will cost $230/€230.
</p>
<p>
The Collector's Edition will no longer provide three days of early access to Shadows, as it was previously set to. Instead, the edition will officially launch - and unlock - on the game's main 14th February 2025 release date. 
</p>
<p>
As for the package's other gubbins, which include a character statue, Steelbook case, artbook, Naoe's katana tsuba (a sword guard), a world map, a scroll and two lithographs, Ubisoft has said these will "mostly remain as initially advertised".
</p>
<p>
"Some design elements may change," Ubisoft noted - perhaps a reference to any alterations made in the game's artbook, which featured <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-sorry-assassins-creed-shadows-artwork-features-real-life-historical-re-enactment-group-logo">some historical inaccuracies</a> in behind-the-scenes concept art. 
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft is now offering Assassin's Creed Shadows' first expansion for free to all players - provided they pre-order the game. Pre-order customers will also get a bonus quest at the game's launch.
</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-statue-pulled-as-company-behind-it-acknowledges-insensitive-design">the company behind another Assassin's Creed Shadows statue said it was pulling the model</a>, after acknowleding it featured an "insensitive design".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The launch of the marketplace is an important step in Epic’s plans to make it easier for developers to acquire assets for developing games — and, maybe someday, to let them make content <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/5/24262376/epic-unreal-engine-6-fortnite-metaverse-plans">for an interoperable metaverse</a>.</p><div><p>The company first revealed its plans for Fab — which will combine offerings from the <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/store">Unreal Engine Marketplace</a>, <a href="https://sketchfab.com/store">Sketchfab Store</a>, <a href="https://quixel.com/">Quixel</a>, and <a href="https://www.artstation.com/marketplace/game-dev">ArtStation Marketplace</a> into one place — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/22/23645601/epic-games-fab-asset-marketplace-state-of-unreal-2023-gdc">in March 2023</a>. While Epic initially planned to launch Fab in 2023, the company <a href="https://sketchfab.com/blogs/community/announcing-fab-the-next-phase-for-sketchfab/">later delayed</a> the launch to 2024.</p></div><p>Epic is offering an 88 percent revenue share for goods sold on Fab, matching the revenue share it offers developers on the Epic Games Store. Ahead of the launch, Epic has allowed creators to prepare their <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/fab-content-marketplace-launches-in-october-publishing-portal-opens-today">Unreal Engine Marketplace</a> and <a href="https://sketchfab.com/blogs/community/fab-publishing-portal-open-for-sketchfab-migration/">Sketchfab</a> products to be available on Fab. (According to Epic, ArtStation Marketplace will “continue operating as it does today,” but the company plans to let ArtStation users bring over their content to Fab in 2025.)</p><p>Epic is also sharing some plans about updates to come for Fab. Perhaps most notable is that the company is reiterating that it plans to add support for offering Roblox and <em>Minecraft</em> assets. Epic also plans to let people access <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/20/24106494/fortnite-unreal-editor-uefn-metahumans-fps">its hyperrealistic MetaHumans</a> on Fab.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Debuting today, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alan-wake-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-547391">Alan Wake 2</a>'s second and final expansion, The Lake House, arrives almost exactly one year after the base game arrived. After waiting 13 years for the sequel, it feels too soon to already say goodbye to this chapter of the Alan Wake saga. Thankfully, in the wide, weird world of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-alan-wake-2-reveals-about-the-remedy-connected-universe/2900-4952/" data-ref-id="2900-4952">Remedy Connected Universe</a>, The Lake House isn't so much a conclusion as it is a continuation. Just as the studio used Control's second expansion to build the runway for Alan Wake 2, The Lake House feels like an exciting lead-in to Control's announced sequel, and perhaps even to its multiplayer spin-off, FBC: Firebreak.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who already played the base game, The Lake House fully explores a mystery only hinted at previously. A Federal Bureau of Control (FBC) outpost, The Lake House, has gone dark, and Agent Kieran Estevez, introduced during the main story, is the responding agent and thus a playable character for the first time. For those who finished Control's second expansion, AWE, the events of The Lake House were hinted at in the final scene of the DLC, when Jesse Faden notices a distress signal that an altered world event is set to occur in Bright Falls.</p><p dir="ltr">As Estevez, players will get a new perspective on the high strangeness of Remedy's quilted story world. She's no rookie, and where others may cower at the sight of paranatural monsters oozing out of the walls of The Lake House, Estevez is just upset it will lead to more paperwork. As Control players know, even the FBC isn't safe from bureaucratic red tape.</p><p dir="ltr">"[In Control], we do obviously interact with a lot of other people inside the bureau, but it's in the context of the events that are taking place inside The Oldest House," game director Kyle Rowley told me during a recent roundtable interview. "Whereas here we're kind of coming from a slightly different outside perspective. And we were interested in exploring, like, 'What is the FBC like outside of that headquarters? How does the FBC operate as an agency throughout the United States?'"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4387177-1%281%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4387177" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4387177-1%281%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4387177"></a><figcaption>Agent Estevez is calmer in the face of danger than some others, given how much she's seen during her time with the FBC.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4387177-1%281%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">That point of view is how The Lake House manages to pull a trick Remedy is getting better at and more familiar with year over year: expanding its connected universe and setting up dominoes to fall in the form of future stories, without alienating players who may be taking it all in more casually or playing these connected games out of order. "We wanted to make sure that the story that we write is self-contained enough and is interesting enough and has its own character arcs," Rowley told me, "that it's not something that you need to have played Control to enjoy."</p><p dir="ltr">Still, he says, the team has gone to greater lengths than before to tie the storylines of Alan Wake and Control together, which is interesting when you consider Control's second expansion was effectively an Alan Wake 2 prologue. Now, the inverse appears true.</p><p dir="ltr">"[We] have a lot of narrative objects, including emails between different FBC staff, or like, research documents that are lying around, that if you're someone who's really into the lore, that's there for you to explore [...] I think that's kind of like how we've always approached it. On the surface level, it's accessible for everybody. The deeper you go and explore the world, the more rewarding it can become, especially if you're heavily invested in our previous games."</p><p dir="ltr">Rowley suggested the team is still learning how to weave this narrative web on a logistical level, with disparate teams on each franchise and everyone's schedules being routinely overstuffed. However, it's made possible due to how the studio's internal Alan Wake and Control franchise teams work together.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's very, very much a collaboration between the two teams, because we are kind of like two separate teams inside Remedy, but, you know, we're inside the same studio. We're inside the same building, so it's very easy for us to just set up meetings and have discussions about stuff," he said. The Control team has a certain aesthetic this expansion needed to honor, Rowley told me, noting that it's "not just visual, but also audible." That led to the teams trading notes and ideas so that The Lake House could feel like the Alan Wake 2 expansion it first and foremost is while also building out another Remedy storyline that's yet to have its first true follow-up and is managed internally by an almost entirely different group of creators.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4387178-1%284%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4387178" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4387178-1%284%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4387178"></a><figcaption>The Lake House shares The Oldest House's brutalist architecture, but Rowley told me it will prove to be more than just a smaller, satellite version of Control's setting.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4387178-1%284%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">As for what else the Remedy Connected Universe has in store, Rowley hinted at the team's approach, and how lore deep-divers may or may not be able to connect dots they'll find in The Lake House. "Right now, our key franchises within [the Remedy Connected Universe] are the Control franchise and the Wake franchise. That's where a lot of our efforts are. But it doesn't mean, necessarily, that every single piece of content that we put inside either game is specifically tailored to a specific franchise. It's more just to expand the world that we're trying to build as a whole."</p><p dir="ltr">The Lake House is also a return to the base game's survival-horror tone and mechanics after June's Night Springs expansion tried on a few different genres through several shorter episodic missions, such as sci-fi and an oddly cute, pastel-tinted massacre akin to Ti West's Pearl. Rowley said he's glad not to have gone from the base game straight into developing The Lake House as it could've been desensitizing to flesh out all of the game's darker, scarier elements in a row. The Night Springs expansion was the "palette cleanser," he said. Now, just before Halloween, the game will return to its roots with a more methodically paced, tenser story. And just as that story will fill in some gaps for Alan Wake 2, it will also newly ask and answer some of its own questions, like the nature of its new Annihilation-inspired enemies, the Painted.</p><p dir="ltr">In all likelihood, it will ask many more questions Remedy has no intentions to resolve today--if ever. For Remedy, telling one larger, interconnected story is a long process that demands patience from the obsessive fanbase and the folks within the studio alike. Unlike the Marvel saga, which often releases a handful of entwined shows and movies annually, games of Remedy's size and scale arrive much less frequently. Rowley said he's been working on Alan Wake 2 for just shy of six years, and finishing the base game was a short-lived reprieve as he was then thrust into creating the game's expansions.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4387179-1%283%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4387179" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4387179-1%283%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4387179"></a><figcaption>The Painted are the new enemies introduced in The Lake House, but Estevez will encounter more familiar monsters, too, like the Taken shown here.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4387179-1%283%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Now, with Alan Wake 2's final chapter here, he's ready to consider it the closing of one storybook for him, too. "I'm going to take a bit of a holiday, I think [...] It's going to be bittersweet in the sense that I've really enjoyed working with the team, and really enjoyed working with Sam [Lake]. It's good to put a pin in it, and then start thinking about other things."</p><p dir="ltr">For players who haven't played any of Alan Wake 2 but may soon, especially now that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alan-wake-2-physical-edition-preorders-are-live-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-x/1100-6524001/">physical Deluxe Edition</a> is on the way, The Lake House will merge right into the base game just like the previous expansion, essentially fleshing out the campaign into one longer, more varied saga, while those who just want to jump into The Lake House after having finished the base game can play it that way instead. It's available now as part of the Alan Wake 2 Deluxe Edition, or can be purchased via the Deluxe Edition upgrade for those looking to expand the base game they already own.</p>

                <p>Square Enix is entering the console gaming space, but not in the way that you were expecting. The home of Final Fantasy has had a big merchandising arm for decades now, and it has just unveiled a new line of collectibles based on classic Sega consoles. The only catch? You won't be booting up any games on these <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SEGA-Hardware-Saturn-Gallery-Diecast/dp/B0DK28R9D7?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sega Saturn</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SEGA-Hardware-Bright-Gallery-Diecast/dp/B0DK22LZSQ?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Genesis</a> consoles, as they're adorably tiny replicas of the original machines. Priced at $44 each, they're expected to start shipping out on July 16, 2025.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4388637-sega-diecast-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4388637" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4388637-sega-diecast-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4388637"></a><figcaption>A finger on the monkey's paw curls as a fan's wish for a mini-Saturn console is granted.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4388637-sega-diecast-2.jpg"></figure><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SEGA-Hardware-Bright-Gallery-Diecast/dp/B0DK22LZSQ?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sega Hardware Series: Sega Genesis</a> -- $44</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SEGA-Hardware-Saturn-Gallery-Diecast/dp/B0DK28R9D7?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sega Hardware Series: Sega Saturn</a> -- $44</li></ul><p>These are durable keepsakes of Sega's iconic machines, as they're made from diecast materials and boast a surprising amount of detail. They even come with <em>tiny </em>controllers and each piece is hand-painted. The little Genesis replica is based on the original version of that console, and has its signature toggle switches, grill design, and "16-Bit" on the shell to remind you of one of the key selling points of consoles back in the '90s.</p><p>The Sega Saturn mini-console features a striking design--a pure diecast finish without any paint applications on the main body. While the various buttons on it do have color highlights, the reflective finish is an instant attention-getter, and other neat details include the various ports that you can find on the rear of this Saturn replica. This isn't the first time that Square Enix has made collectibles based on Sega's hardware, but those collectibles have been sold out for a while. If you are looking to bookmark a page for when these pieces are potentially back in stock, you can save the listings for a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SEGA-Hardware-Dreamcast-Gallery-Diecast/dp/B0DK287ZR4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cute Dreamcast</a> and an alternate <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SEGA-Hardware-Saturn-Gallery-Diecast/dp/B0DK28R9D7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sega Saturn</a> design.</p><p>If you're a retro enthusiast looking for something more functional, you can also check out the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/analogue-fully-unveils-its-modernized-n64-preorders-go-live-october-21/1100-6527188/" data-ref-id="1100-6527188">Analogue 3D console</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-season-looks-to-bring-back-sharks-and-midas<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> has begun teasing its next highly-anticipated throwback season, which this year will focus on the game's Chapter 2 era. 
</p>
<p>
Promotional items highlighting Chapter 2 Remix, as it'll be known, have begun landing with content creators (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1848547548044177771">Shiina</a>) - and from these, we can learn a little of what will be on offer.
</p>
<p>
Chapter 2 was, as you'd expect, the era featuring Fortnite's second map. Over eight seasons, the game experienced some of its strongest creative riffs and narrative moments to date, as it introduced a fan-favourite group of spies, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-the-device-live-event-analysed-as-epic-sets-up-fortnites-longterm-future">flooded its map</a>, had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-showstopping-marvel-finale-drops-a-huge-cliffhanger">its first Marvel-focused season</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-fortnites-new-season-nears-the-ufo-abductions-have-begun">got invaded by aliens</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-fans-think-its-major-new-character-is-secretly-being-played-by-the-rock">introduced The Rock as a key character in Fortnite lore</a>.
</p>
<p>
At least some of all that will be reprised in Chapter 2 Remix, which looks to feature a return of spy boss Midas, his buff cat lieutenant Meowscles and the rest of their gang.
</p>
<p>
Pin badges highlighting Chapter 2 Remix offerings include a new remix of Midas/Meowscles, plus Slurp commando Rippley and TNTina. Loot sharks (which you could battle, or ride on top of with a fishing rod), Boogie Bombs and a building from Misty Meadows are also featured.

<p>
The expectation among Fortnite fans (fuelled by a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/billie-eilish-coming-to-fortnite-adding-weight-to-a-much-discussed-leak">comprehensive development roadmap leak earlier this year</a>) is that Chapter 2 Remix will focus on the first half of the chapter. It's expected that the return to Chapter 2 will first be established, before the emergence of Midas and crew in a new map update, before his antics cause the map to flood. How and why exactly we'll be returning to Chapter 2, though, remains to be seen. 
</p>
<p>
Epic Games of course is keen to capitalise on the enormous popularity of Fortnite's original OG season late last year, which took players back to the game's very first map for a month. That return was part of a well-choreographed set of events that led to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-the-big-bang-event-was-a-blast-of-marketing-for-the-games-multi-genre-future">Fortnite launching several new modes</a>, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a>, and ultimately landing on its current, fifth main battle royale Island. What could be coming this time?
</p>
<p>
It's expected that Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix will kick off at the end of the game's current, Halloween-infused Marvel season at the beginning of November.

            <p>Nintendo Switch Online members will soon be able to get their hands on three full games, as part of a free trial.</p>
<p>The games in question are spin-off <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/minecraft-dungeons">Minecraft Dungeons</a>, cosy puzzler A Little to the Left and Cursed to Golf, which plops you down on the dungeon-like holes of Golf Purgatory (of course).</p>

<p>On its initial release, we called Minecraft Dungeons "by far the most promising Minecraft spin-off released to date".</p>
<p>"While Minecraft Dungeons might sound an unlikely concept - a more accessible Diablo with Creepers - it ends up feeling a natural extension of the formula," our Tom wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-dungeons-review-a-diablo-like-thats-just-deep-enough">Eurogamer's Minecraft Dungeons review</a> from 2020. You can check out the video team having a little galavant about in it above.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-little-to-the-left-review">A Little to the Left review</a>, meanwhile, complimented the game's "slick puzzle design". However, overall it was felt the game was at "odds with the creativity of organising" the developer hoped to evoke.</p>

<p>Last but not least, we have Cursed to Golf. Donlan gave the game's demo a whirl a couple of years ago, and was quite taken with it.</p>
<p>"This is a clever game, I reckon. A spin on a platformer that feels nothing like a platformer. It turns out that purgatory golf holes are tough. They zig-zag up and down, so the fairway you want to land on with your first shot might be below you. Or it might be blocked off by TNT. Or a fan might push the ball out of the way," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cursed-to-golf-is-golf-in-purgatory">Eurogamer's Cursed to Gold feature</a>.</p>
