<p>Fallout New Vegas and Horizon Zero Dawn lead writer John Gonzalez has announced he will be retuning to Obsidian after 14 years. </p>



<p>The announcement came via his LinkedIn profile, where he was quick to shoot down impending rumours of Fallout New Vegas 2, by simply saying, “No, it’s not Fallout: New Vegas 2.”</p>



<p>As for what Gonzalez is working on remains to be seen and could ride on the success of the studios next two upcoming games, Avowed and The Outer Worlds 2. If tremendously successful, he could be working on a future sequel.</p>



<p>However, Obsidian Entertainment has also released some stellar games in the past few years, including Pentiment, Pillars of Eternity, and Grounded, so he could also be working on a sequel to those, or a new IP entirely. But for now, all we know if that he’s not working on New Vegas 2… Apparently.</p>



<p>What do you think Gonzalez is working on? Would you like to see a Fallout: New Vegas 2? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

		<p>The PC port of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvels-spider-man-2">Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</a> launched on Thursday, but the game has had a “Mixed” reception in the Steam user reviews as many players complain about performance, graphical issues and crashes.</p>
<p>Sony leant on their in-house porting team at Nixxes to handle the port of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/16/marvels-spider-man-2-review/">Spider-Man 2</a>, but while they traditionally have a good reputation for their PC ports, this one has fallen flat, joining a number of other PlayStation PC ports that have had a rocky landing.</p>


<p>We’re working on our own impressions of the PC port, but just to grab <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/765Tet/recommended/2651280/">one </a>of <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2651280/negativereviews/?browsefilter=toprated&amp;snr=1_5_100010_">the many negative Steam reviews</a>, “I have an RTX 4070ti, on high graphics and no raytracing I get crashes […] Even when it’s not crashing, shadows flicker for no good reason and it feels like it struggles to render hair at times.”</p>
<p>Part of this is down to performance. While <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/10/marvels-spider-man-remastered-pc-review/">Spider-Man Remastered</a> and Miles Morales were well received for their performance, those games fundamentally had the PS4 platform as the base target for Insomniac’s original creation, and were designed with ray tracing as an additive feature. Spider-Man 2 only launched for PS5 and so could always feature ray tracing, could always rely on the fast NVMe SSD loading times, and the fundamental uplift that the console provided.</p>
<p>Spider-Man 2’s PC port actually scaled back down to GPUs without ray-tracing features, with a broad set of hardware and performance targets to go from 720p30 up to full 4K with “Ultimate” ray tracing.</p>

<p>The problems that players are encountering seem to run the full gamut, and affect both Nvidia and AMD GPUs alike with performance dips, frame rate stutters and running out of VRAM even with a 16GB card. The majority of PC gamers have gone with Nvidia, and with many newly implemented graphical options seem to come plenty of problems.</p>
<p>Odd driver issues can lead to full-blown crashes citing GPU temperatures. Elsewhere Nvidia’s bespoke ray reconstruction for improving ray traced reflections and certain other DLSS features are claimed to actually reduce frame rates.</p>
<p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198820911436/recommended/2651280/">One user has a potential performance aid,</a> saying “Before you play, open the install folder of the game,make a new folder and drag dsstorage.dll and dsstoragecore.dll into the new folder to improve load times, low fps and micro freezes!”</p>
<p>Essentially, this ditches the game’s use of Direct Storage, which has certain requirements for SSD speeds and technology. It’s not clear how this would help, as in theory it would reduce SSD read performance, but perhaps there are some bugs with the system.</p>
<p>As for the other issues, turning down ray-tracing effects and relying less on DLSS features that use AI to fill in the blanks seems to have an effect. In general, it feels like players will want to wait for a patch from Nixxes and a fresh driver update from Nvidia and AMD. Nvidia is also juggling a new GPU generation launch and adding more trickery to their drivers right around now.</p>

<p>Borgit's Beastgrabbaz are a five-unit warband comprising of Borgit, Snagz, Rigg and Shamm, Uglug, and Dregg. These Grots are all out on an adventure to find Trugg, the Troggoth King, and while they might not have pure strength at their disposal they instead work together to empower one another to constantly be on the move and attacking.</p>

<p>There are a number of mechanics that are constantly in play; At the start of each Action Step you'll pick an enemy with Health of 3 or higher and mark it for +1 Attack dice when trying to hit it, your leader will be constantly put in danger, and there are different reactions that you'll be taking based on other actions that your fighters will be using.</p>

<p>While there's a lot to be keeping an eye on, it is also a lot for an opponent to be planning around. Something as simple as using one of Uglug's Core abilities then lets you push every friendly minion up to three hexes ending up adjacent to Uglug. This kind of swarming can very quickly sure up defences and turn the tides of battle.</p>

Interestingly though when these fighters become empowered they don't actually get stronger, they're just able to move further.</p>

<h2>Edge of the Knife Rivals Deck</h2>

<p>Pairing well with the frantic gameplay style of Borgit's Beastgrabbaz is the Edge of the Knife Rivals Deck. This deck is "tailor-made for those who prefer dirty fighting and high-risk maneuvers."</p>

<p>An additional mechanic that is part of this Rivals Deck is that "While using this Rivals deck, fighters with a Health characteristic of 2 or less and/or 2 or more damage tokens are tempered."&nbsp;The Rivals Deck is filled with cards that interact with those in the tempered state.</p>

<p>Some Objective cards that interact will have you making sure all tempered fighters are in neutral or enemy territory, if you're holding a feature token in enemy territory, or if every fighter is tempered.</p>

You can stop them being pushed, swap units across the battlefield, and you can even draw additional Power Cards allowing for more options in the battle.</p>

<p>There's a lot of very situational cards which makes this a difficult kind of game to play. While there are a lot of actions at your disposal you'll need to predict the kinds of situations your opponent will throw you into to ensure you always have the upper hand.</p>

<p>This deck will reward a player with knowledge of their opponent's Warband and Rivals Deck abilities so it might take some practice.</p>

<h2>Borgit's Beastgrabbaz and Edge of the Knife Rivals Deck Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>There are some excellent ideas here for a seasoned professional at Warhammer Underworlds. With both the Warband and the Rivals Deck both being centered around risky play even a few mistakes will throw you well behind in the battle.</p>

<p>If you have the patience to learn the strategies and read your opponents there's a lot that you can do to always turn the tide of battle.</p>

<p>Ubisoft has revealed that Far Cry: New Dawn, the 2019 post-apocalyptic title, is getting a 60 FPS update on both Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 platforms. Fans of the franchise were quick to point out how ‘random’ the update is, with some stressing that other Ubisoft titles are in sore need of similar attention from the developer.</p>



<p>It was recently confirmed that on February 4, Far Cry: New Dawn will land on the Game Pass subscription service, which could go some way to explaining the performance upgrade.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-smoother-is-better">Smoother is Better</h2>



<p>It has taken six years, but Ubisoft is finally getting around to upgrading one of the most underrated Far Cry games ever made.</p>



<p>I’m a huge fan of the franchise, and New Dawn was a welcome addition to the series. Given that I love anything rooted in a post-apocalyptic environment, it made sense that New Dawn spoke to me quite nicely. </p>



<p>It’s set in the aftermath of Far Cry 5, which sees the player plunged into a bunker as nuclear war erupts across the world. What emerges after the bombs have fallen is something incredible – a world taken over by nature, roving bandit gangs, and settlements of survivors trying to get by.</p>



<p>It’s far outside the standard expectations of the Far Cry series, and it’s a twist on the post-apocalyptic vibe like no other. This isn’t a drab, woeful world like the ones portrayed in Fallout or Metro, for instance. It’s bursting with colour, representing an oversaturated take on the end of the world.</p>



<p>The 60 FPS upgrade on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 is a welcome thing, and it might be enough to pull me back in for another loop around the game when it lands on Game Pass next week.</p>



<p>On social media, <a href="https://x.com/UbisoftSupport/status/1885437595527557264" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft announced</a> that ‘this wasn’t how (they) planned’ to reveal the upgrade. They had to cut off ‘FPS Boost’ on Xbox consoles to roll out the change, and assuming that players would notice that, they were forced to make the announcement early.</p>

While you’re here, stop by my list of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-far-cry-games-ranked/">best Far Cry games ever, ranked</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-writer-rejoins-obsidian-but-hes-not-working-on-fnv-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Fallout New Vegas remains the most beloved out of all the games in the popular post-apocalyptic franchise. While buggy, it featured excellent storytelling by Obsidian Entertainment, and many RPG fans believe this was their best work to date.</p>
<p>Over the years, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-2-in-development-rumor-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors about a potential sequel</a> have only <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-2-talks-reportedly-happening-at-microsoft-obsidian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gotten stronger</a>, particularly after Obsidian joined Bethesda in the Xbox family, and even more following the explosive success of the Fallout TV series on Amazon Prime Video. Besides, Obsidian CEO Feargus Urquhart didn't exactly hide his fondness for the franchise. In October 2022, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/obsidian-entertainment-fallout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<p><em>Of course, if we ever got the opportunity to make another Fallout game, we'd make it. There's not even a question of whether or not we would do it, it's just 'Will the opportunity arise? I hung around at Interplay for probably an extra year because I wanted to work on Fallout more. I love Fallout.</em></p>
<p><em>At some point, we'll start looking into what those next games are going to be, and I would be surprised if Fallout is not on that list. If we were to do Fallout, it has to tie in with what Bethesda is doing with Fallout and a lot of other things, but I would always personally say my hope is that before I ride off into the sunset, I'd love to make another Fallout game.</em></p>
<p>Fans' hopes suddenly spiked yesterday when acclaimed game writer John Gonzalez <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johnrgonzalez_im-happy-to-share-that-im-starting-a-new-activity-7290785057554767873-EjZ9?utm_source=social_share_send&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that he had returned to Obsidian. Gonzalez is credited for his work on Tom Clancy's EndWar, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, Horizon: Zero Dawn and its sequel, Horizon Forbidden West. He was briefly the Narrative Director at Smilegate Barcelona and then at Fantastic Pixel Castle on their upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-mmorpg-qa-ex-wow-designer-opens-up-on-every-aspect-of-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghost MMORPG</a>. And yes, we said that he returned to Obsidian because, as you probably have guessed by now, Gonzalez was also the Lead Creative Designer and Lead Writer on Fallout New Vegas (for which he publicly thanks God on his LinkedIn page).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, any hopes for a sequel were quickly dashed when he added the following under his new role as Creative Director at the studio:</p>
<p><em>Back to Obsidian for exciting times! (No, it's not FNV2.)</em></p>
<p>So, the time hasn't come yet, despite Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-might-be-here-sooner-than-we-thought-at-microsofts-behest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly wanting to push harder on the Fallout franchise</a>. Still, given the studio and the writer, we're definitely eager to learn more about this new project in due time. For now, Obsidian is certainly focused on the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-hands-on-preview-eora-from-a-whole-new-perspective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avowed</a> in a couple of weeks, followed by The Outer Worlds 2, also <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gameplay-showcased-at-the-game-awards-releases-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated to debut this year</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-dead-ninja-marvel-rivals/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98overwatch-is-dead-and-gone%E2%80%99-ninja-thinks-marvel-rivals-has-killed-the-competition.1097709/</guid>

<p>As Marvel Rivals has gone from strength to strength, the game’s main competitor – Overwatch – has floundered. Since being released by NetEase in December, Marvel Rivals has taken the gaming world by storm, racking up tens of millions of players and sitting proudly atop social and streaming charts worldwide.</p>



<p>Overwatch 2 is struggling by comparison. From concerns about the game’s player count to the lack of meaningful updates, the hero shooter that once stood atop the genre is imploding.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-overwatch-2-launch-was-abysmal">‘The Overwatch 2 Launch Was Abysmal’</h2>



<p>During a recent stream, Ninja broke down the state of play for Marvel Rivals and Overwatch. He stressed that Overwatch 2 has been in a pit since it was released in October 2022, which is accurate. It was seen by many as being ‘Overwatch 1.5’, and even a pivot to a free-to-play operating model didn’t do much to revive the game’s prospects.</p>



<p>He referenced the Overwatch 2 launch being ‘abysmal’ and then went in against the game, stressing that Marvel Rivals is taking over right now.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Overwatch is dead and gone.</p>



<p>It’s so unfortunate. Here’s the thing — first off, they already have a new map coming, which is incredible. Second, they have so much lore and so many heroes and villains and anti-heroes that they have enough for updates for the next ten years.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The clip captured and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lilgoldnn/video/7463580999025265962?embed_source=121374463%2C121468991%2C121439635%2C121433650%2C121404358%2C121497414%2C73319236%2C73363867%2C121477481%2C121351166%2C121487028%2C73347566%2C121331973%2C120811592%2C120810756%2C121501435%3Bnull%3Bembed_masking&amp;refer=embed&amp;referer_url=&amp;referer_video_id=7463580999025265962" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared on TikTok can be viewed here</a> (thanks to Dexerto for the spot).</p>



<p>The hero shooter space is booming right now. Marvel Rivals is in a league of its own, but fans of the genre are still enjoying and anticipating the imminent arrival of Valve’s Deadlock, which has received global praise from some of the biggest streamers in the business.</p>



<p>VALORANT, a hero shooter with a serious esports ecosystem, is also enjoying rampant growth and popularity.</p>

<p>Techland recently surfaced all over social media to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Dying Light franchise. In 2015, the first game was released, introducing a high-octane, intense zombie-slaying title to the world, and it quickly became known as one of the best games in the genre. In 2022, Techland followed up with Dying Light 2: Stay Human, a live-service title that’s going strong today.</p>



<p>As part of the celebration, the team at Techland published a video packed with stats, including a juicy one – <strong>45 million players </strong>have been through the Dying Light universe since 2015.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-populated">Populated</h2>



<p>In a promotional video posted on social media, Techland revealed that across two games, more than 45 million players have entered the Dying Light universe.</p>



<p>Collectively, they’ve played 1.1 billion hours of Dying Light and have killed more than 75 billion zombies – ‘9 times the world population’. By utilising the franchise’s fluid and advanced movement mechanics, players have made the equivalent of <strong>41 trips to the sun and back </strong>on foot.</p>



<p>Dying Light is well known for its aggressive and visceral combat engine, and with that in mind, more than 20.3 billion zombies have been beheaded by players in the last decade. </p>



<div><article><p><span>Since the release of the original Dying Light, we have been blessed with the best fans in the world. So it’s only right that we recognize you. Watch our summary video that shows off all the craziest feats you have achieved in those 10 years!

<p>There’s plenty more to come this year. In the summer, players will get their hands on Dying Light: The Beast, a standalone title that sees the return of Kyle Crane, played by Roger Craig Smith. I had the pleasure of catching up with the iconic actor at Gamescom 2024, where <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-roger-craig-smith-dying-light/">we spoke about his role</a> in the upcoming open-world zombie game.</p>



<p>To celebrate the 10th anniversary of Dying Light, Techland has rolled out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/techland-dying-light-next-era-10th-anniversary/">a series of events and special offers</a> across the universe, present in both Dying Light and Dying Light 2.</p>

<p>The Carolina Royal Ravens have had an unexpected start to the 2025 Call of Duty League season. The squad has put up some impressive numbers since day dot, floating around the top of the CDL standings and knocking the biggest teams in the business down a peg. It all started with a 3 – 0 win over Atlanta FaZe, a feat that any team hadn’t achieved for more than 500 days.</p>



<p>However, FaZe retaliated with a win against the Ravens in the GF of the first CDL Minor. At the Madrid Major, which is unfolding now, the Royal Ravens have kicked off a dominant run through the elimination bracket, after being pushed down into the depths by the LA Thieves.</p>

<h2 id="h-eliminations-galore">Eliminations Galore</h2>



<p>In the opening round of the elimination bracket, the Carolina Royal Ravens decimated the Vegas Falcons, producing a 3 – 0 scoreline that included a dramatic reverse sweep in the round of Search. Many have praised the Falcons for their resilience, but the lack of mental composure during much-needed clutch moments is becoming an issue.</p>



<p>Following that round, the Royal Ravens soared onwards, clashing with OpTic Texas, previously the favourite to win the Madrid Major. OpTic managed to close out just one map – the opening Hardpoint. That was as close as close could be, with the scoreline settling at 248 – 250 in Carolina’s favour.</p>



<p>From there, it was a sweep for the Royal Ravens, with the remaining maps including a 3 – 0 wash over OpTic Texas on Protocol Control.</p>



<p>There were concerns about the resilience of the Carolina Royal Ravens following the opening loss against LAT. It was revealed that Reece ‘Vivid’ Drost has an eye injury that he’s dealing with, but regardless of that, he has been frying in-game.</p>



<p>The Royal Ravens will now need to contend with the likes of Toronto Ultra or Atlanta FaZe, two formidable teams that have had a brilliant season thus far. It took a while for Atlanta FaZe to get the wheels turning, but the squad now sits on a solid win streak of nine matches – including a win at the first CDL Minor.</p>



<p>It’s anyone’s game right now, and the $150,000 grand prize is lying in wait for whoever has the talent to secure it.</p>

		<p>Tripwire Interactive has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/killing-floor-3">Killing Floor 3</a> will launch on 25th March for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Want to try it out sooner? Well, there’s a closed beta coming in February.</p>
<p><iframe title="Killing Floor 3 - Siren Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r5hsuRpMiDY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Killing Floor 3 closed beta will take place from 20th-24th February across all platforms, giving Tripwire a great chance to stress test the live launch. You need to sign up for access, which you can do on the <a href="https://killingfloor3.com/#signup">Killing Floor website</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Killing Floor 3 - Closed Beta Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4RCHPgFjXXs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s multiple editions of the game, some region specific, in partnership with Plaion as their distributions partner.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Standard Edition </strong>(MSRP of $39.99) – Available in North America, includes the base game and a pre-order bonus, either the limited timed exclusive Clamefield Patrol Specialist Skins Pack<strong>, </strong>or the Flatline Tactical Bundle (at select retailers).</li>
<li><strong>Day 1 Edition </strong>(MSRP of $39.99/€39.99/£34.99) – Available outside North America, includes the base game, Flatline Tactical Bundle, and Clamefield Patrol Specialist Skins Pack.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there’s two digital editions, in addition to a base game version:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deluxe Edition </strong>(MSRP of $59.99) – Includes the Shadow Agent Specialist &amp; Weapon Skin Sets, Launch Nightfall Supply Pass, and 1000 Creds.</li>
<li><strong>Elite Nightfall Edition </strong>(MSRP of $79.99) – Includes everything from the Deluxe Edition plus Year 1 Premium Nightfall Supply Pass Access (four passes) and 3000 Creds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Killing Floor 3 takes the already dark war against the Zeds and jumps forward 70 years from Killing Floor 2, with a new army of Zeds on the march from megacorp Horzine. You’re part of a group known as Nightfall which is trying to fight back.</p>
<p>Of course, that’s all just a wrapper for the 6-player co-op in which you face off against waves of incoming Zeds. There’s six Specialist character classes, each with complimentary abilities and roles, and an array of weapons that you’ll be able to upgrade and adapt, both through the overarching player progression and by buying equipment between waves.</p>
<p>The M.E.A.T. System returns as well, ramped up to give even more guts and gore, which is sure to make wielding a katana rather visceral.</p>
<p>In general, though, fans of horde more games and previous Killing Floor titles will know what to expect from Killing Floor 3. This is a wave-based zombie horde shooter that will keep you on your toes as enemies hound you, forcing you to get around the map, set traps, use the environment, and survive as long as possible.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-5-bioware-layoffs-ea<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s a bad time to be a diehard BioWare fan – or a BioWare employee, for that matter. The house that <em>Dragon Age</em> and <em>Mass Effect</em> helped build is being taken apart piece by piece, with EA <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-developers-reveal-theyve-been-laid-off-after-bioware-puts-full-focus-on-mass-effect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reallocating employees</a> to its other studios following <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>’s bumpy landing and <em>Mass Effect 5</em>’s apparently stunted development. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-31/electronic-arts-slashes-bioware-after-dragon-age-sales-miss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg reports</a> that less than 100 people remain at the once-revered studio. On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we talk about how it all came to be.</p><p>We’re joined by Kat Bailey, former news director at IGN and current host of the <a href="https://bloodgodpod.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Axe of the Blood God</a> podcast, to discuss a news week that’s certainly been… interesting. First we talk about the entire staff of long-running video game site God Is A Geek <a href="https://aftermath.site/god-is-a-geek-calvin-robinson-nazi-salute-elon-musk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quitting after its now-ex-priest owner threw up a Nazi salute</a> at a pro-life conference. Guess you can only get away with that shit if you’re a billionaire.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we dig into BioWare’s recent post-<em>Dragon Age</em> woes, with EA reshuffling some developers into non-BioWare teams and laying off others. Is the next<em> Mass Effect</em> in trouble? And beyond that, does BioWare as we know it have a future?&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, in response to a variation on the age-old question of which Pokemon would taste best to eat, we pose another: Could Moltres die of avian flu?&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can purchase BioWare and give its developers enough money to finally make their dream game, free of needless trend chasing. There will be just one stipulation: No more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeX0scFunQc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">punching reporters</a>.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Kat: </strong>Things aren’t super amazing at BioWare right now, unfortunately. From what I’ve heard from people who are connected to it, there are people who are on preproduction for <em>Mass Effect 5</em> – which is still in pre-production because a lot of those folks were working on <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> – and then there are a number of people who are on loan to other teams at the moment, for example <em>Skate</em>. Yeah, remember <em>Skate</em>?&nbsp;</p><p>And then the rest have unfortunately been laid off, including some veterans like the Weekes. Trick Weekes and their partner, Karin, were laid off. Trick Weekes has been around since the original <em>Mass Effect</em> and was I believe the lead writer on <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, among other things. So some notable names from the heyday of BioWare are being let go.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Can you speak to the scope of the layoffs? EA is being very unclear about it.</p><p><strong>Kat:</strong> I can’t speak to the actual scope. I can only say that the mood is not amazing at BioWare at the moment. It’s hard to say where they go from here. Not detecting a lot of optimism around <em>Mass Effect 5</em> at the moment either, unfortunately.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>EA as a company is kind of in a weird place. If you look at Maxis, Project Rene [the next <em>Sims </em>game] has been spinning its wheels for literally years now. The <em>EA Sports FC</em> fell off quite a bit on the sports front. They’ve got this wild Manhattan Project going on with <em>Battlefield</em>, which encompasses four or five studios, and it’s going to be the everything shooter. They’ve got a lot of franchises on ice, and oh by the way, last year they did a huge presentation that was centered almost entirely around AI.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong><a href="https://aftermath.site/electronic-arts-ai-demo-imagination-creation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">All of their boxes</a>! They’re very proud of their boxes.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>So much of this mush of “Oh, it’s a live service, it’s a shooter, it’s AI.”</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It all means nothing. It all sounds vaguely pleasing to investors.</p><p>But yeah, it strikes me as telling of where things are at for BioWare. <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> wasn’t a bad game, but neither did it land with the kind of impact they needed. It was yet another mid triple-A game, which is what a lot of triple-A games have been lately as a result of an unwillingness to take risks due to the amount of money invested and the size of audiences they’re trying to attract. All of these games are kind of OK.</p><p><strong>Kat: </strong><em>Dragon Age</em> is an interesting case, because it was in development for something like a decade and was rebooted at least twice. It began as a totally different game, then it became a multiplayer live service game. Then the directors on that ended up departing, and they effectively hit the reset button again. And they were using some of the leftover materials from that version. They were using the tech stack. A lot of what happened with <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> is due to the fact that it started its life as a multiplayer game – particularly in the way the hubs and the mission structure ended up working.&nbsp;</p><p>In my view they did their best with what they had, but it was by all accounts quite a grueling production process. They got the entire <em>Mass Effect</em> team to help, and they dragged themselves across the finish line. They put a lot of focus on being as polished as possible, because they were aware that this game would get completely battered and end up in a 50 Metacritic score territory, and instead it ended up in the 80s, which is where they were aiming for.&nbsp;</p><p>I think there was a lot of hope that maybe that would be enough, but it didn’t quite land with the base. The word of mouth around it was mixed, especially around the moment-to-moment writing. Because there wasn’t a huge amount of enthusiasm from the actual community – outside certain elements; my sister platinumed that game – and they were getting hammered by, frankly, <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-dragon-age-veilguard-review-controversy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a hate campaign</a>, it was tough to achieve liftoff. That’s kind of where we ended up with <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, unfortunately.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I saw the sales numbers for it. 1.5 million, right?</p><p><strong>Kat:</strong> Maybe just under, because they included EA’s subscription service, where people were getting access to it as well. I think the word they were using was “engagements.”&nbsp;</p><p>A lot was riding on <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> in many respects. The eye of Sauron was upon BioWare, and it was kinda known that they had to get this game out and have it do well. What they were able to accomplish by getting it into the 80s was almost a bare minimum “OK, ship a product and have it not be a complete tire fire.” <em>Dragon Age</em> was not a tire fire.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> What was the last major game that didn’t have a troubled development cycle or reboot mid-development or change to accommodate whatever the new trend of the day is in a way that ultimately felt half-baked?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kat:</strong> <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> And <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> was tremendously successful.</p><p><strong>Kat: </strong>It was developed by a fully independent studio that was not beholden to a publisher and was able to make it on their own timeline, and when they needed to cut off development and get the thing shipped, they did. And it went longer than they expected it to – considerably longer. But they plotted out their runway, and it ended up working. They were making a game that they wanted to play and not necessarily catering to mainstream audiences. What’s the result?<em> Baldur’s Gate 3</em> is one of the most successful games of the last couple years.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/james-gunn-suicide-squad-dc-comics"><h3>James Gunn Can’t Stop Making Suicide Squads</h3></a><p>Groups of freaky little guys are the stuff of comic book history, and maybe the future of comic book movies.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/does-elon-musks-gaming-rig-suck-or-not"><h3>I Am Disgusted By Elon Musk’s Gaming Setup</h3></a><p>Watching these streams hurt me but I have to know: is one of the wealthiest men on earth using a mediocre streaming setup?</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Marking the 25th anniversary of series, EA has re-released the first two games and all their expansion in The Sims: Legacy Collection and The Sims 2: Legacy Collection.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Sims &amp; The Sims 2 Legacy Collections - Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QQUMkHngWjA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Both are available now ahead of the franchise’s birthday on 4th February, on sale separately or combed in The Sims 25th Birthday Bundle along with The Sims 4 Grunge Revival Kit and The Sims 4 Throwback Kit bundled in with each game respectively.</p>
<p>Both games have been tweaked and updated to help them work with modern Windows 10 and Windows 11 machines.</p>
<p>For The Sims it now supports aspect ratios other than 4:3 and will automatically set itself to your monitor’s aspect ratio on launch. There’s also crisper rendering – though you can cycle through different scaling options with Alt + Enter – and they’ve fixed a handful of crashes and bugs while they’re at it.</p>

<p>The Sims 2 seemingly needed more work to get working, with the following change list:</p>
<ul>
<li>GraphicsRules.sgr now supports modern hardware configurations</li>
<li>Fixed a shadow bug that surrounded Sims with a big black square</li>
<li>Wide screen and higher game resolutions are now supported</li>
<li>UI scales better to higher resolutions</li>
<li>Texture memory corruption and “pink soup” are fixed</li>
<li>Dragging The Sims 2 window from one monitor to another works more smoothly</li>
<li>If your computer has a lot of RAM, The Sims 2 is able to use it</li>
<li>Fixed several crashes</li>
<li>Improvements and fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite this, there’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/comments/1iej4qa/sims_2_legacy_not_launching_for_me/">plenty of technical complaints with DirectX 9.0c errors</a> for some with The Sims 2 – seemingly high refresh rates and/or resolutions above 1080p don’t play too nice. It’s also quite a shame that, even though it would have taken more work to re-port them to new hardware, there’s no Mac versions for these releases.</p>
<p>Oh, and the IKEA pack is missing from The Sims 2, much to the dismay of quirkily named flat pack furniture fans around the world.</p>

The brief, three-hour demo wasn’t enough time to get a feel for how well leaders and different civilizations work together, but I left feeling excited about all the ways <em>Civilization VII</em> aims to change the course of history. </p><p>In previous <em>Civilization </em>games, civs were always tied to a specific leader who was usually, but not always, a noteworthy head of state. Later iterations of the game offered multiple leaders for civs, and on a couple of occasions where it made historical sense, one leader could straddle multiple civs like France and England both having access to Eleanor of Aquitaine, who, during her unusually-long-for-the-time-period life, was the queen of both countries.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24224489/civilization-7-hands-on-demo-impressions-firaxis-games">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Here are the PC requirements for Civilization 7.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/CivGame/status/1841870892449640471">Check ‘em out</a> to see if your PC can run the game when it comes out on February 11th.

            <p>
John Gonzalez, lead writer on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> and Horizon: Zero Dawn, has announced his return to Obsidian Entertainment after 14 years elsewhere in the industry - but not, he suggests, to work on a Fallout: New Vegas 2.
</p>
<p>
Gonzalez originally joined Obsidian in 2008, after a two year stint as lead narrative designer at Ubisoft. He was only with Obsidian for a little over two years, but his impact - as "lead story guy" on the hugely beloved Fallout: New Vegas - was significant. He was responsible for its quest and "most of" its dialogue, introducing characters such as Mr. House and Yes Man.
</p>
<p>
After that, Gonzalez spend two and a half years at Monolith Productions, working as lead narrative designer on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-review">acclaimed Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</a>, and in 2016 he made the move to Guerrilla Games, where he served as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/can-horizon-zero-dawn-really-be-a-aaa-game-without-cynicism">narrative director on the hugely popular Horizon: Zero Dawn</a> and its sequel. Since then he's worked on a number of smaller projects - including his "ultimate video game novel" God Mode - and now he's come full circle.

<p>
Gonzalez announced his return to Obsidian Enterintament in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johnrgonzalez_im-happy-to-share-that-im-starting-a-new-activity-7290785057554767873-EjZ9">brief post on LinkedIn</a>, and his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnrgonzalez/details/experience/">updated profile</a> confirms he's officially joined as the studio's new creative director. As to what he'll be working on, that isn't yet known beyond vague allusions to "exciting times". Gonalez did, however, append a quick note adding, "No, it's not Fallout: New Vegas 2."
</p><p>
Of course, "exciting times" at Obsidian is a tantalising prospect given the studio's usual stellar output - which in recent years has included <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a>, Grounded, and Pentiment. Avowed and The Outer Worlds 2 are up next for the studio, but it's unlikely Gonalez will have much, if any, involvement with those, seeing as the first is out in three weeks and the second is out this year. All of which suggests he's been drafted in to help imagine Obsidan's next project.
</p>
<p>
The question, though, is whether Gonzalez's attempt to get ahead of the Fallout: New Vegas 2 speculation is genuine or a cheeky bit of misdirection. After all, back in 2022, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-new-vegas-2-reportedly-in-very-early-discussions-at-microsoft-and-obsidian">Obsidian was in "very early" talks with Microsoft</a> to work on a sequel to its much-loved post-apocalyptic RPG, and that there was "a lot of interest to make it happen."
</p>
<p>
Almost three years later, there's been no hint of an update, so it's unclear if those talks were in any way fruitful. But even if Gonzalez <em>hasn't</em> been drafted in to work on a Fallout: New Vegas sequel, there's enough semantic wiggle room in his denial to still leave hope among fans that <em>some</em> form of new Fallout might be on the cards. Still, with Gonzalez having only just joined Obsidian in January, it'll likely be some time before we learn anything more - especially with two big new Obsidian RPGs releasing this year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magpie-games-and-failbetter-games-announces-official-fallen-london-ttrpg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Failbetter Games has announced a crowdfunding campaign for <em>Fallen London</em>. The campaign isn't for a videogame spin-off but an official <em>Fallen London TTRPG</em> being developed alongside Magpie Games.</p>

<h2>The <em>Fallen London TTRPG</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>The <em>Fallen London TTRPG</em> was announced <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/failbettergames.bsky.social/post/3lgx6srhssc2a" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on Bluesky Social</a> by the official Failbetter Games account. It announced that the Kickstarter campaign will go live on February 11th at 10 AM ET.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallen-london-ttrpg-clocktower-artwork.jpg?itok=mQPhsOrv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallen-london-ttrpg-clocktower-artwork.jpg?itok=NIK-F_N9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In addition, if you sign up for their official newsletter, you will receive a Quickstart Guide for the game. This guide contains six premade characters, the core rules, and a playable adventure titled "The Disappearance of the Transfigured Poet."</p>

<p>The official Kickstarter <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/magpiegames/fallen-london-the-roleplaying-game" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a> promotes additional incentives for the <em>Fallen London TTRPG</em>. In addition to several physical products, the core rulebook, a GM screen, custom six-sided dice, etc., stretch goals include digital items for your character in the Fallen London browser game. Lastly, those who back the campaign in the first 48 hours will get a physical Devilbone Die at no additional charge.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallen-london-ttrpg-physical-goods-image.jpg?itok=heEsoobO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallen-london-ttrpg-physical-goods-image.jpg?itok=ewkYTL2- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The campaign doesn't state what system the <em>Fallen London TTRPG</em> will run on. However, given Magpie's track record of adapting properties like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/avatar-legends-republic-city-supplement-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/root-tabletop-rpg-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Root</em></a>, there's a good chance it will use the Powered by The Apocalypse system. A mechanically light, story and character-centric system where players just roll 2d6 to resolve challenges.</p>

<p><em>Fallen London</em> made its debut in 2009, originally under the name <em>Echo Bazaar</em>, as a browser-based interactive narrative game. The game was packed with branching story decisions, involved <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallen-london-to-conclude-ambition-storylines" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ambition Quests</a>, and in-depth worldbuilding of a version of Victorian London that had sunken into a vast cavern under the Earth called the Neath.</p>

<p>In this new suberranean home, London changed into something twisted. The city streets twisted into a labyrinth, inhuman creatures arrived trading in esoteric goods like human souls. and even physical law itself has faded in this state of darkness. The original experience is still receiving new quests and updates to this day.</p>

<p>Alongside the impressive longevity of this main game, Failbetter Games has developed other titles set in the Fallen London universe. These include the shipfaring horror game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/sunless-sea-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Sunless Sea</em></a>, the sequel <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/sunless-skies-fallen-london-anniversary" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Sunless Skies</em></a>, and the visual novel <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mask-of-rose-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Mark of the Rose</em></a>.</p>

It’s since been followed by survival sim <em>Grounded </em>and the Renaissance detective RPG <em>Pentiment</em>, with <em>Avowed</em> arriving next month and <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> expected by the end of the year.

Will it be the team’s next big RPG franchise, or a completely different genre mash-up that explores new territory for the studio? I’ll be happy with whatever it might be, as long as it arrives sometime this decade. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>BioWare’s headcount is . According to a new report from Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, the company now sits at less than 100 employees after having over 200 people just two years ago.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-31/electronic-arts-slashes-bioware-after-dragon-age-sales-miss?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczODM1MTgzMSwiZXhwIjoxNzM4OTU2NjMxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUVlXVThUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.91ztnslkcG02JwTwRRfVCXIJp8FOdqGBjCNQgz-bE8k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The report says</a> that a number of employees who were put “temporarily” on new teams were informed that those moves were permanent. No longer were they BioWare employees helping out in a different area. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>“If they want to work at BioWare again in the future, they would have to look for job openings and re-apply,” Schreier writes. He adds that, for now at least, a small team will  work on the next game in the Mass Effect series. This team is being led by “company veteran who oversaw the development on the original trilogy as well as on 2019’s&nbsp;Anthem”. The goal is to then expand as needed later on in production.</p>







<p>As sources told Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-moves-some-employees-to-other-ea-projects-while-developing-mass-effect-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after the memo</a> from BioWare was released, there is still an internal evaluation being done in order to see where things can be improved. There is still a worry from those who spoke under the condition of anonymity that more layoffs and moves within the studio are coming.</p>



<p>Neither EA nor BioWare have responded to multiple requests for comment on the state of things at the studio.</p>

Di Benedetto</a> <span>is a reviewer covering laptops and the occasional gadget. He spent over 15 years in the photography industry before joining The Verge as a deals writer in 2021.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>A popular <em>Bloodborne </em>framerate mod is no longer available thanks to a DMCA takedown request from Sony. Australia-based Twitch streamer Lance McDonald first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0tqppZDYxw">developed the mod back in 2020</a> before <a href="https://x.com/manfightdragon/status/1359037954576928769?mx=2">making it available to download in 2021</a>. Lance <a href="https://x.com/manfightdragon/status/1885347693125566806">announced today in a post on X</a> that Sony Interactive Entertainment asked them to remove download links for the patch.</p></div><p>The hack’s sole purpose was to get <em>Bloodborne </em>running at a smoother 60 fps with improved frame pacing. FromSoftware originally released <em>Bloodborne</em> back in 2015 for the PlayStation 4, and the game has always been locked at 30 fps with occasional stuttering from inconsistent pacing (the 30 frames within each second were not always on-screen for equal amounts of time). The beloved game’s graphical limitations have persisted even on the PS4 Pro and while playing it via backwards compatibility on the PlayStation 5.</p><p>Lance’s mod has received its share of testing and praise from the “Soulsbourne” community that covet FromSoftware games but wish their technical and graphical chops were more cutting-edge. This includes being spotlighted by creators like Digital Foundry, who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hDIvDPRcPA">interviewed McDonald about his hack back in 2020</a>, used his mod to make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOn2ludP6gM">a 4K / 60 fps representation on PS5 using AI upscaling</a>, and recently published a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zjzBbdl7hk"><em>Bloodborne</em> PS4 emulation video</a> that really juices up the performance and has an extra-spicy video thumbnail aimed squarely at Sony.</p><p>For years, the most rabid of <em>Bloodborne </em>fans have been quick to jump at any <em>Bloodborne</em>-related news as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24173905/sony-teases-bloodborne-in-astros-playroom-update-hours-ahead-of-summer-game-fest">a potential clue</a> to an upcoming, long-awaited remake. And in this case, it only takes a short scroll of McDonald’s replies on his post to see people speculating that this takedown means Sony <em>must </em>be nearing some kind of announcement in time for the 10-year anniversary of <em>Bloodborne’s</em> release. Or, perhaps, Sony is just taking a page from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike">Nintendo’s playbook</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is really strange considering that at one point in time, Sony was Xbox’s bitter competitor. </p><h2 id="h101223"><a id=""></a>Xbox dips out of the console war</h2><p>Internally, before its 2001 launch, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://venturebeat.com/games/making-of-the-xbox-1/2/#:~:text=Bachus%20was%20an,of%20the%20Japanese.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://venturebeat.com/games/making-of-the-xbox-1/2/#:~:text=Bachus%20was%20an,of%20the%20Japanese." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the original Xbox was referred to as Project Midway</a></span>. This was a crass reference to WW2's Battle of Midway. During that battle, American forces decisively defeated Japan’s navy. The name clearly indicated that Microsoft wanted to enter into a video game console war with Nintendo and Sony, and it wanted to win. And for years, Xbox, Sony, and Nintendo battled each other. </p><p>One would lower its price, another would launch a new bundle. One would give away free games to subscribers, another would follow suit. Motion controls were copied. Exclusives were secured. It was a very expensive war that had millions of kids around the world bickering on playgrounds over which was better, as teens and adults did the same on internet forums. </p><p>But now, in 2025, Microsoft was willing to give away one of its crown jewels—<em>Forza</em>—to Sony and PlayStation. It’s part of a trend of Xbox making more of its games multiplatform following its purchase of Activision. And rumors are swirling that even more Xbox games and franchises will make the leap to PlayStation and Switch. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamingbible.com/news/platform/xbox/halo-master-chief-collection-teased-ps5-port-439080-20250131&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamingbible.com/news/platform/xbox/halo-master-chief-collection-teased-ps5-port-439080-20250131" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Master Chief Collection</em> is likely to arrive on other platforms</a></span> sooner than later, according to insiders, as is a rumored (but unconfirmed) <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gameranx.com/updates/id/526870/article/gears-of-war-trilogy-collection-will-be-multiplatform-says-insider/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/526870/article/gears-of-war-trilogy-collection-will-be-multiplatform-says-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Gears of War</em> trilogy collection</a></span>. Insiders are also claiming that <em>Fable</em> and <em>Starfield</em> will be making the leap to PlayStation 5 and Switch 2.</p><p>Combine that shift in Xbox’s strategy with Game Pass being available on more devices and the company downplaying console sales for years and years now, and it becomes clear that Microsoft isn’t fighting in the console wars anymore. It arguably hasn’t been for a few years now, but the news of <em>Forza </em>jumping ship should be the confirmation that its flown the white flag and decided to become a massive publisher, harnessing the combined power of Game Pass, all of its studios, and Activision/Blizzard. It’s a strategy that is already paying off, too. </p><p>So if Xbox is done fighting, who is left? Well, not Nintendo. </p><h2 id="h101224"><a id=""></a>Nintendo isn’t fighting in the war anymore</h2><p>Yes, the company is releasing a Switch 2 and it’s going to sell incredibly well, assuming tariffs don’t inflate the price too much. But in 2025, Nintendo doesn’t care about the console war. </p><p>The Wii U was the last time the company behind Mario arguably tried to compete directly with Sony and Microsoft. It released the Wii U in late 2013, just within a year of the Xbox One and PS4, while trying to court third-party AAA franchises like <em>Mass Effect,</em>&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty, </em>and the <em>Batman: Arkham </em>games.</p><p>The Wii U ultimately was a failure for Nintendo and in 2017, it released the Switch, nearly three years before Sony and Xbox’s next consoles, the Xbox Series X/S and PS5, would arrive. Nintendo realized that it could do its own thing. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-completely-bailed-on-console-generations-and-1845719633&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-completely-bailed-on-console-generations-and-1845719633">It didn’t need to stick to the hardware cycle of the old console wars</a></span>, competing directly with other companies every five to seven years. Instead, Nintendo focused on giving fans what they always wanted—a hybrid device merging its portable and home consoles into one—and found incredible success.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-trailer-date-nintendo-mario-kart-9-1851739487?_gl=1*1kfnkw9*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzA0MTE0Mi4xNDEuMS4xNzM3MDQ3NTczLjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-trailer-date-nintendo-mario-kart-9-1851739487?_gl=1*1kfnkw9*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzA0MTE0Mi4xNDEuMS4xNzM3MDQ3NTczLjYwLjAuMA..">The Switch 2, launching later this year</a></span>, continues to show that Nintendo doesn’t care about the console war. It’s not concerned about when the PS6 or next Xbox arrive. That doesn’t matter. All it has to do is make a new console that people want every several years and make sure it keeps turning out stellar first-party games for the machine. It can focus on itself and not worry about matching GPUs or terraflops with Sony or Xbox in some never-ending console war. And as long as it sells well, third-party publishers and devs will show up with games, even it means cutting them up and squishing them just to make stuff like Harry Potter or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/batman-arkham-trilogy-switch-port-framerate-1851074882&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/batman-arkham-trilogy-switch-port-framerate-1851074882">Batman work on the Switch’s hardware</a></span>.</p><p>So if Nintendo is out and Xbox isn’t fighting anymore, then that just leaves Sony. And yeah, I think you can argue that Sony and PlayStation are still fighting the war. But if everyone else has left or given up, is it even a war anymore? </p><h2 id="h101225"><a id=""></a>Sony is the last soldier fighting</h2><p>Sony is still spending a lot of money to secure exclusive games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogy-playstation-exclusive-1851313313&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogy-playstation-exclusive-1851313313"><em>Final</em> <em>Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em></a></span><em> </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-release-date-cast-1851235004#:~:text=Death%20Stranding%202%20will%20launch,PS5%20version%20launches%20in%202025.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-release-date-cast-1851235004#:~:text=Death%20Stranding%202%20will%20launch,PS5%20version%20launches%20in%202025."><em>Death Stranding 2</em></a></span><em>. </em>And, unlike Xbox, it’s not publishing its big, first-party games day one on PC or including them in its subscription service, PS Plus, at launch.

However, in 2025 the PS5 Pro feels like Sony firing a very pricey missile into an empty patch of ground. Maybe once upon a time there were tanks and jeeps in that spot. Not anymore, though. Everyone else has moved on. </p><p>In a technical sense, Sony has won the console wars because it’s A) Still here and B) the last one fighting.

Meanwhile, free-to-play games on phones are making more than all of them on devices that have never been connected to the console wars. </p><p>2025 might not be the <em>precise</em> year the console war ended, as it likely ended years ago and what we see now are small skirmishes slowly wrapping up as news reaches each front, conflicts still puttering on though the struggle that once set it all in motion is largely resolved. I’m confident that even if more consoles are released in the future—which they will be—the era of three or more companies spending millions every month to fight each other in multiple ways as synchronized hardware cycles stretch across years is over.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
