			<p>Capcom has announced that Street Fighter 6 has hit a brand-new milestone, just 15 months after the game was first released. <a href="https://x.com/StreetFighter/status/1831814865297489924" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As announced on X</a>, Street Fighter 6 has officially reached over four million sales globally. This now puts it on a level playing field with Mortal Kombat, which surpassed that number 11 months after launch. Despite that, at least in the fighting game community, it seems that Street Fighter 6 is the more popular of the two. However, Tekken 8 did significantly better than these combined, reaching two million sales in a month.</p>
<p>With this information, Capcom firmly believes that Street Fighter 6 is on the right path to surpass the sales of Street Fighter 5, which reached over 7.6 million sales in its lifetime. Street Fighter 6 still has a lot of life left in it, with Capcom hoping that the sales will surpass 10 million sales during its lifetime. Currently, there is still a lot of content planned for Street Fighter 6, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/street-fighter-6-terry-gamescom-hands-on-ready-for-domination/">Terry being the latest fighter</a> to join the roster, being officially released on September 24, 2024.</p>
<p>For context, Street Fighter 5 was first released in 2016, and most players continued to play it until the release of Street Fighter 6. The Champion Edition of the game, which included all DLC characters, was released in 2020.</p>
<p>As it stands, Street Fighter 6 is currently in the middle of season 2, with the DLC characters Terry and Mai, fighters from Fatal Fury and The King of Fighters, respectively, joining the game this year. Looking further into the future, Elena is due to return to Street Fighter 6 after her debut in Street Fighter 3 sometime in 2025.</p>
<p>So far, Street Fighter 6 has seen a lot of content added to the game, including DLC fighters such as Rashid, Ed, Akuma, A.K.I, and M.Bison, the most recent fighter to join the roster. Compared to previous iterations in the franchise, Street Fighter 6 is the most accessible, with the option of using Modern Controls, similar to the new feature added to Tekken 8. For those who struggle to do complex button inputs, Modern Controls allows you to use a smaller amount of buttons to execute the same combo. However, it doesn't come without consequences. Using Modern Controls reduces the damage output of Special moves and Supers.</p>
<p>Overall, Street Fighter 6 is on a great path, and with more DLC characters in the future, there is plenty of room for the game to grow and surpass the 4 million sales it has currently reached. Although it isn't stated in the post, it's safe to assume that this number comes from sales across all platforms, including PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/greedfall-2-developer-spiders-secures-better-pay-and-policies-after-strike.974142/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spiders-strike-policies-negotiations<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>GreedFall 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Steelrising&nbsp;</em>developer Spiders has scored a win for itself by securing better pay and working conditions following a strike that took place earlier this week.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/spiders-employees-secure-boosted-wages-better-remote-work-policies" rel="noopener" target="_blank">statement provided to Game Developer</a>, studio management says it's negotiated raises and improved working policies with employees, although the statement does also contain some pointed remarks regarding allegations made by the union to which said employees belong.</p>
<p>Spiders bosses say that statements made by the SJTV union in an <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/08/open-letter-from-spiders-workers-to-their-employer/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">open letter to managers last week</a> were "false and defamatory", so even though the managerial side of the studio has agreed to better conditions for employees, it sounds like they didn't do so without some pushback.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/spiders-strike-negotiations-greedfall-2.jpg?itok=y5rvSH9B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/spiders-strike-negotiations-greedfall-2.jpg?itok=subQOyw4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Spiders is currently working on&nbsp;<em>GreedFall 2</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Game Developer, Spiders managers have agreed to raise the studio's minimum base salary by 11%, starting from this month (and retroactive to April 1st of this year).</p>
<p>Although that sounds like a pretty big jump, Game Developer does also say that the average Spiders employee will only see a salary increase of around 3% as a result of this move. Still, it's progress, right?</p>
<p>Additionally, workers will now benefit from a "telework company agreement" that should improve remote working policies in the studio, and management has agreed to conduct an audit on working conditions.</p>
<p>Spiders managers aren't just out for SJTV, either; they're also seemingly upset with the media. In the statement given to Game Developer, studio management says that the "portrayal" of the studio's working conditions in the media is an "attempt to destabilize the company".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/spiders-steelrising.jpg?itok=TUnfLvqR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/spiders-steelrising.jpg?itok=se3ezHa6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Spiders is also responsible for the rather curious Soulslike&nbsp;<em>Steelrising</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering what Spiders is up to right now, the studio is currently gearing up to release the hotly-anticipated RPG sequel&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/greedfall-2-dying-world"><em>GreedFall 2</em></a>, which will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/greedfall-2-release-date">hit Early Access later this month</a>.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more on that, and in the meantime, you can check out my review of Spiders' <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/steelrising">previous game</a>, the rather curious Soulslike&nbsp;<em>Steelrising</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/steelrising-review">right here</a>.</p>

For your primary weapon, you’ll want to select the Heavy Bolt Rifle. It excels at close and mid-range fights, and you’ll want to ensure that you’re hitting anything that’s fairly close to you.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is the only gun that you can swap out in this class, so you won’t have much freedom with alternative builds in your arsenal.</p><h2 id="h1951"><a id=""></a><strong>Best Assault Class Loadout</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="b0ba7f4d228e8558d50f95fa5ea7faa8" data-recommend-id="image://b0ba7f4d228e8558d50f95fa5ea7faa8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Assault Class" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Assault Class" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b0ba7f4d228e8558d50f95fa5ea7faa8" data-recommend-id="image://b0ba7f4d228e8558d50f95fa5ea7faa8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Assault Class" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Assault class is meant for those looking to fight up close and personal. We recommend that you lean far into this. Since this class is unable to have a primary weapon, we suggest using the Heavy Bolt Pistol as your secondary because this can double as a ranged weapon, and it packs a serious punch.</p><p>As for your melee weapon, we highly recommend the Thunder Hammer. One, because it’s a giant hammer that allows you to live out your Thor power fantasy, and two, because it’s the strongest weapon of the bunch. Even though it does have the slowest swing out of the three, we are mainly looking for it to dish out maximum damage more than anything else.</p><h2 id="h1952"><a id=""></a><strong>Best Vanguard Class Loadout</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="3ff0a94d2edd960e64f1cd880a99c7eb" data-recommend-id="image://3ff0a94d2edd960e64f1cd880a99c7eb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Vanguard Class." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Vanguard Class." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3ff0a94d2edd960e64f1cd880a99c7eb" data-recommend-id="image://3ff0a94d2edd960e64f1cd880a99c7eb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Vanguard Class." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Vanguard class is meant to be played zippy. For this, you’ll want to have the Instigator Bolt Carbine as your primary weapon. When compared to the Metal and Oculus, it’s the better fit for Vanguard because it has a three-round burst that allows you to place your shots in a single target. This ensures you inflict as much damage as possible.</p><p>For a melee weapon, you’ll want to stick with the Combat Knife, because when playing Vanguard you’re not looking to jump into a horde. Instead, you’re mainly focusing on one target at a time, and this setup will help when going toe-to-toe with enemies,</p><h2 id="h1953"><a id=""></a><strong>Best Bulwark Class Loadout</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="40bd4443ea80a5b893d5c7ec101b8791" data-recommend-id="image://40bd4443ea80a5b893d5c7ec101b8791" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Bulwark class" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Bulwark class" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="40bd4443ea80a5b893d5c7ec101b8791" data-recommend-id="image://40bd4443ea80a5b893d5c7ec101b8791" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Bulwark class" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Even though the Bulwark class is meant to be played in melee combat, you’ll want to make sure you have a proper secondary to help you in unavoidable ranged fights, especially as you don’t have access to a primary. With that in mind, we recommend using the Plasma Pistol for a couple of reasons: The first is that you won’t have to worry about reloading it, letting you keep firing without stopping in your tracks. The second is that you can charge it up to ensure you inflict as much damage as possible.</p><p>When selecting your melee weapon, we suggest using the Power Sword. Out of all three, it’s the most balanced, so it’ll allow you to play with more versatility, and keep you from staying in one play-style. Plus, it has a super cool lighting effect that triggers whenever you swing it.</p><h2 id="h1954"><a id=""></a><strong>Best Sniper Class Loadout</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="17910da3b0fe0932ff72d5fb6f818e19" data-recommend-id="image://17910da3b0fe0932ff72d5fb6f818e19" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sniper Class" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sniper Class" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="17910da3b0fe0932ff72d5fb6f818e19" data-recommend-id="image://17910da3b0fe0932ff72d5fb6f818e19" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sniper Class" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When using the Sniper class, we recommend staying away from the Stalker Bolt Rifle and the Bolt Carbine. The weapon we best suggest you use is the Las Fusil Sniper Rifle because it has the highest firepower out of all of them. This class is meant to be played at a distance, and Las Fusil is the perfect gun for picking off enemies from afar.</p><p>This is another class that doesn’t have a lot of freedom when it comes to having a diverse loadout. You won’t be able to switch out your melee or secondary weapon, so make sure you’re comfortable with the Bolt Pistol and Combat Knife. </p><h2 id="h1955"><a id=""></a><strong>Best Heavy Class Loadout</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="f15550fe9e1a48346fcf691fa84d9823" data-recommend-id="image://f15550fe9e1a48346fcf691fa84d9823" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="heavy class" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="heavy class" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f15550fe9e1a48346fcf691fa84d9823" data-recommend-id="image://f15550fe9e1a48346fcf691fa84d9823" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="heavy class" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Heavy Class is the only option that doesn’t allow you to have a melee weapon. The best way to counter that is by equipping the Multi-Melta. This gun is basically a shotgun flamethrower that’ll melt anything it shoots. The only downside is that you have to be close to your targets, but that shouldn’t be an issue when playing the Heavy.</p><p>As for secondaries, we suggest the Plasma Pistol. This gun has a fairly decent range and can be used in mid-ranged fights when attempting to close the gap for your Melta.</p><hr><p>These are the best loadouts we recommend using while hunting the Emperor enemies in <em>Space Marine 2</em>. As you level up in the game, you can upgrade these weapons and customize them to your liking, which will only help you in combat. Go out there and slay some heretics!<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The bundle consists of, in narrative chronological order, <em>Yakuza 0</em>, <em>Kiwami</em>, <em>Kiwami 2</em>, <em>3 Remastered</em>, <em>4 Remastered</em>, <em>5 Remastered</em>, and <em>6: The Song of Life</em>.

Not only am I 60 hours in and about 11 chapters deep, but I don’t see an immediate end anywhere in sight. These games are traditionally massive crime epics stuffed to the brim with characters and activities to do. At the moment, I’m in the middle of a cabaret mini-game that is its own management sim within <em>Yakuza 0</em>, which is a brawler, and features its own storyline about my character trying to reclaim the neighborhood from the clutches of cartoonishly evil business owners. That’s on top of all the other irreverent substories that are typically featured in a <em>Yakuza </em>game.</p><p>But these games are just as technically and artistically impressive as they are massive. Real-world settings, like Kabukichō, are the inspiration for the nearly 1:1 era-specific recreations that are rendered across the <em>Yakuza</em> games, which take you to pockets of Tokyo, as well as Osaka, Yokohama, and Hiroshima. I once recognized the exact place a friend had posted on their Instagram story because they happened to be in Dōtonbori, which is the real-world equivalent of the Sotenbori setting that regularly features in the games, especially <em>Yakuza 0.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>The <em>Yakuza </em>games are deep in more senses than just sheer content. I sometimes bristle against brawlers, which often feel too button-mashy for my taste, but I’m finding a surprising amount of depth in <em>Yakuza 0</em>’s mechanics. There are completely different styles of fighting that should be used in the right scenarios/boss fights, but there are huge skill trees attached to each of them, and even a storyline centered around the people training you. Six fighting styles split evenly across two protagonists on entirely different maps means that <em>Yakuza 0 </em>has felt tremendous in scope, but it also hasn’t been overwhelming. Chapters do a great job of giving either character ample time to breathe, and I’ve thus far been encouraged to go at my own pace and set my own priorities as far as goals, skills, and completion.</p><p>Extrapolate that formula across about six other titles that consistently grow in scale, and you’re in for a hell of an undertaking with <em>Yakuza Complete Series</em>. Once you’re done with those in about two years, which is the timeline I’m roughly looking at for myself, you can jump into the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/infinite-wealth-like-a-dragon-review-kasuga-yakuza-1851190269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/infinite-wealth-like-a-dragon-review-kasuga-yakuza-1851190269">newest saga of the series</a></span>, following a different protagonist named <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yakuza-s-latest-protagonist-is-the-hero-i-need-right-no-1845755843&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-s-latest-protagonist-is-the-hero-i-need-right-no-1845755843">Kasuga Ichiban</a></span>.

The patch notes reveal several major adjustments, including changes to weapon movement speed and a nerf to last weekend's overpowered Jackal PDW submachine gun.</p><p dir="ltr">This second weekend raises the level cap from 20 to 30, so players will have access to more of Black Ops 6's weapons, scorestreaks, perks, and equipment. This includes popular perks, such as Ninja, Cold-Blooded, and Fast Hands.</p><p dir="ltr">A change is coming to the swap speeds for all weapons. The weapon-drop time was reduced for sniper rifles by 100ms, while weapons in all other classes were reduced by 50ms. Treyarch says players looking for an even quicker weapon swap should try out the Fast Hands strategist perk.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4363189-cod-bo6-needtoknowbeta-025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4363189" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4363189-cod-bo6-needtoknowbeta-025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4363189"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 6 beta rewards</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4363189-cod-bo6-needtoknowbeta-025.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The movement speeds of weapon classes are also adjusted for week two. The developer explains that these are small adjustments to baseline movement speeds on all weapon classes to "make sure they are sitting in a good spot relative to one another." These movement adjustments include move speeds and ADS move speeds, which come into play during combat engagements.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Treyarch says it's being mindful of speeding the game up too much and will continue to monitor and assess game data and player feedback.</p><p dir="ltr">Another movement change comes from an adjustment to speed up the melee sprint speeds. The developer says it wants players to feel incentivized to pull out their dedicated melee weapon as a means of map traversal and ensure that melee users can catch up to other players who are sprinting with ranged weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">The first weekend of the beta was dominated by the Jackal PDW submachine gun, but Treyarch confirmed it was overperforming at medium ranges. The nerf includes an increase to the damage falloff, a reduced damage range, and a slight increase to recoil. Additionally, week two gives players access to the new Tanto .22 submachine gun, so players will have another option for submachine guns to try out.</p><p dir="ltr">Spawns are also adjusted based on the feedback from week one. Treyarch has adjusted the game's general spawn logic to enable additional valid spawns, and also changed the spawn logic across several maps with the goal of reducing a high frequency of spawn flipping.</p><p>The full patch notes can be seen below, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-open-beta-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">as shared by Activision</a>.</p><p>Here are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-settings/1100-6526279/" data-ref-id="1100-6526279">some recommended Black Ops 6 settings</a> to try for the beta.

We’ll be reducing weapon drop times across the board for an overall increase to swap speeds. Players looking for an even quicker swap speed can try out the Fast Hands Strategist Perk in Week 2 of the Beta.</p><ul><li>Assault Rifle, SMG, Shotgun, LMG, Marksman Rifle, Pistol, and Launcher drop times reduced by 50ms</li><li>Sniper drop times reduced by 100ms</li></ul><h4><u>MOVEMENT SPEEDS</u></h4><p>We are making small adjustments to baseline movement speeds on all weapon classes to make sure they are sitting in a good spot relative to one another. We have mostly focused on Move Speeds and ADS Move Speeds, which come into play during combat engagements.</p><p>Overall we are happy with the weapon class usage and performance we’ve seen in Beta Weekend 1, as well as the upper end of movement pacing offered by SMGs, so these adjustments keep SMGs the same and generally improve other classes. We are mindful of speeding the game up too much and will continue to monitor and assess game data and your feedback.</p><p>The other notable change here is to Melee Sprint Speeds. We want players to feel incentivized to pull out their Dedicated Melee weapon as a means of map traversal. We also want to ensure that Melee users can catch up to other players who are sprinting with ranged weapons for those sneaky Body Shields and Finishing Moves.</p><h4>Movement Speed Adjustments</h4><p>Weapon Category Adjustments</p><h4>Assault Rifles</h4><ul><li>ADS Crouch Speed increased from 1.75m/s -&gt; 1.88m/s</li><li>Move Speed increased from 4.14m/s -&gt; 4.29m/s</li><li>ADS Move Speed increased from 3.07m/s -&gt; 3.23m/s</li></ul><h4>SMGs</h4><ul><li>Crouch Speed increased from 2.31m/s -&gt; 2.77m/s</li></ul><h4>Shotguns</h4><ul><li>ADS Crouch Speed increased from 1.63m/s -&gt; 1.75m/s</li><li>Move Speed increased from 4.14m/s -&gt; 4.29m/s</li><li>ADS Move Speed increased from 3.07m/s -&gt; 3.23m/s</li></ul><h4>LMGs</h4><ul><li>ADS Crouch Speed increased from 1.14m/s -&gt; 1.3m/s</li><li>Move Speed increased from 3.71m/s -&gt; 3.86m/s</li><li>ADS Move Speed increased from 2.31m/s -&gt; 2.46m/s</li></ul><h4>Marksman Rifles</h4><ul><li>Crouch Speed increased from 2.41m/s -&gt; 2.49m/s</li><li>ADS Crouch Speed increased from 1.37m/s -&gt; 1.55m/s</li><li>Move Speed increased from 3.76m/s -&gt; 3.99m/s</li><li>ADS Move Speed increased from 2.9m/s -&gt; 3m/s</li></ul><h4>Sniper Rifles</h4><ul><li>Crouch Speed decreased from 2.41m/s -&gt; 2.31m/s</li></ul><h4>Pistols</h4><ul><li>Crouch Speed decreased from 2.9m/s -&gt; 2.84m/s</li><li>ADS Crouch Speed increased from 1.88m/s -&gt; 2.24m/s</li><li>Move Speed increased from 4.47m/s -&gt; 4.52m/s</li><li>ADS Move Speed decreased from 3.94m/s -&gt; 3.81m/s</li></ul><h4>Launchers</h4><ul><li>Crouch Speed decreased from 2.44m/s -&gt; 2.18m/s</li></ul><h4>Melee</h4><ul><li>Crouch Speed increased from 2.9m/s -&gt; 2.95m/s</li><li>Jog Speed increased from 5.16m/s -&gt; 5.31m/s</li><li>Sprint Speed increased from 6.93m/s -&gt; 7.16m/s</li><li>Super Sprint Speed increased from 8.41m/s -&gt; 8.66m/s</li><li>Move Speed increased from 4.47m/s -&gt; 4.62</li></ul><h4><b><u>Weapon Adjustments</u></b></h4><h4>SMG Adjustments</h4><p>Weapon Adjustments</p><h3>Jackal PDW</h3><ul><li>Decreased Maximum Damage from 29 -&gt; 26  <ul><li>Decreased Maximum Damage range from 15.24m -&gt; 14.61m</li></ul></li><li>Decreased Near-Medium Damage from 23 -&gt; 22  <ul><li>Decreased Near-Medium Damage range from 22.86m -&gt; 17.78m</li></ul></li><li>Decreased Medium Damage from 22 -&gt; 18  <ul><li>Decreased Medium Damage range from 29.21m -&gt; 26.04m</li></ul></li><li>Decreased Minimum Damage from 19 -&gt; 15</li><li>Small increase to view kick strength and view kick deviation.</li><li><b>CHF Barrel</b><ul><li>Headshot multiplier improved from 1.2 -&gt; 1.4</li></ul></li></ul><p>The Jackal PDW ‘s intended strength is best in class handling and decent mobility, balanced by a slower rate of fire compared to many of the other automatic weapons in the game. It was overperforming at medium ranges, so we’ve increased the damage falloff and pulled the ranges closer along with a slight increase to recoil. Maximum damage and CHF Barrel headshot multiplier have been adjusted to maintain the same hit to kill numbers while using the attachment.</p><h3><b>C9</b></h3><ul><li>Increased medium damage range from 25.4m -&gt; 27.31m</li></ul><p>We feel that the C9 is in a good spot as a well-rounded Submachine Gun with a solid rate of fire. It has higher horizontal recoil compared to other Submachine Guns, so we’ve given a boost to its medium damage falloff range.</p><h4>Marksman Rifles Adjustments</h4><p>Weapon Adjustment</p><h3>SWAT 5.56</h3><ul><li>Disabled burst fire queuing, which was queuing an additional burst if the fire input was activated at any time during the previous burst or the burst cooldown.</li></ul><p>This is a minor change to improve control with the Swat 5.56 (and any future burst weapons).</p><h4><u>ATTACHMENTS</u></h4><ul><li>The Rapid Fire attachment now correctly displays its recoil penalty con. The attachment description has also been updated to indicate the tradeoff.</li></ul><h3>MAPS</h3><h4>General</h4><ul><li>Adjusted general spawn logic to enable additional valid spawns under certain scenarios.</li><li>Adjusted spawn logic across several maps with the goal of reducing a high frequency of spawn flipping.</li></ul><p>Our longstanding definition of a “bad spawn” is any time a player deals or receives damage within 3 seconds of spawning. This is the cornerstone of building the spawn system and does not change regardless of map size or game mode. We use this metric (among others) to track bad spawn rates for Black Ops 6, meaning that if you dealt or received damage within 3 seconds in Weekend 1 of the Beta, we saw it.</p><p>As an example, our Core Moshpit entry with the highest bad spawn rate in Week 1 was Domination on Skyline with a 4.2% rate, which means 4.2 out of every 100 spawns saw someone give or receive damage within that 3 second window. While we are generally happy with our averages, we know that an average also consists of worst cases, and we'll continue to assess throughout the lifetime of this game.</p><p>We also recognize that we each have our own definition of what a good spawn or a bad spawn is, and that’s not always just about combat situations. For example, did I spawn out too far on Hardpoint? Or why am I spawning on the same side of the map as the enemy team? The overarching spawn system and the placement of spawns in a map are critical to the flow of the match. It is our goal with Black Ops 6, as it has been with every prior Black Ops game, to have a predictable spawn system that results in head-on engagements with your opponents while providing ample time from respawn for decision making.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> will feature the option to remove all UI elements and add on a "90s filter".</p>
<p>Developer Bloober Team confirmed the news in a recent X/Twitter post, revealing that the 90s filter includes grain effect, colour correction, and screen adjustments for that "old-school experience"... even though <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> released in 2001.</p>

<p>The ability to remove UI elements will likely be welcome news for veteran Silent Hill fans, as that is entirely in keeping with the original game.</p>
<p>"Without UI, player guidance will naturally be directed by the game's visuals, sound effects, and James's behaviour," the team <a href="https://x.com/BlooberTeam/status/1831331610291012035">explained</a>.</p> <div>

<p>"He will glance towards important spots and have different animations and facial expressions during wounded states," Bloober added.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Tom Morgan shared his thoughts on the opening hours of the remake in Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2s-remake-dares-to-modernise-a-classic-and-is-largely-succeeding">Silent Hill 2 Remake preview</a>.</p>
<p>"In rebuilding such a beloved classic with upgraded visuals and controls, the new combat style fits in surprisingly well," Tom wrote in his excellent summary.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> creative director and lead designer for Silent Hill 2 Remake, Mateusz Lenart, recently confirmed the psychological horror game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-will-take-more-than-20-hours-for-silent-hill-2-remake-completionists-to-find-everything-hidden-for-you">will take 16-18 hours to complete on average</a>, but teased that it will take "more than 20 hours" for players to find "everything that [the team] put into the game and things we've hidden for you".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Shinji Mikami thought Tango Gameworks would be safe from closure "as long as they continued to make <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> games".</p>
<p>Mikami, who spoke to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shinji-mikami-and-goichi-interview-tango-gameworks-shadows-of-the-damned">IGN</a> alongside Suda 51, was the founder of Tango Gameworks but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shinji-mikami-leaving-tango-gameworks-after-12-years">left in February 2023</a>. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">studio was then closed by Microsoft</a> earlier this year, before being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton-following-microsofts-studio-closure-in-may">acquired by PUBG publisher Krafton</a> last month.</p>
<p>"I had thought the studio would be safe as long as they continued to make Hi-Fi Rush games," said Mikami. "That's one of the reasons I left Tango Gameworks. So I was surprised when the studio was closed down."</p>

<p>When Suda replied the closure was "a bolt from the blue, wasn't it?”, Mikami was ultimately positive about the future of Tango Gameworks.</p>
<p>"Now Krafton has taken over the business, so I feel like it worked out well in the end. I was reminded that if you make a good game, someone will pick it up. The hard work of the Hi-Fi Rush development team led to a new chapter for the company.</p>
<p>"I think that for a development studio, making a good game is more directly related to survival than making a popular game."</p>
<p>After his departure from Tango, Mikami stated his reasoning for leaving was to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-creator-shinji-mikami-left-tango-gameworks-to-break-free-from-survival-horror">break free of survival horror games</a>. He also wanted to create an environment for younger developers to have more frequent opportunities to gain experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-director-shinji-mikami-founds-new-company">Mikami has now founded a new company</a>, KAMUY, though it's unknown what projects are in the works.</p>
<p>Both developers have been interviewed ahead of the release of Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shinji-mikami-and-goichi-suda-on-shadows-of-the-damned-remastered-killer-7-and-a-sweet-home-remake">pair discussed the nature of remakes with Eurogamer</a>, with Mikami suggesting he'd be interested in a remake of Sweet Home - the game that inspired Resident Evil back in the '90s.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-space-for-dino-crisis-when-monster-hunter-exists-says-shinji-mikami">Mikami also discussed his thoughts on a new Dino Crisis game</a>, noting "the awesomeness of dinosaurs and the stuff you can do with dinosaurs, that's been kind of really nailed down by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a> in recent years".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>While the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> has been the runaway winner of the generation, running laps around Xbox for the last few years, it’s been a pretty bumpy ride. Some of that has been out of Sony’s hands – the chip shortages and the general economy, for example – but you do have to wonder about some of the choices they’ve made along the way, where even someone with the most basic grasp of the video game market could have told them they aren’t making the best decisions.</p>
<p>Outside of the PS5, Sony’s other hardware plans haven’t panned out, for various reasons. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PSVR 2</a> is a great headset, but with gamers feeling the financial squeeze, it’s just priced too high to be appealing. That wouldn’t be so bad if there were great reasons to save up for one, but outside a handful of exclusives – literally, you can count them on one hand’s fingers – there’s been no sign of first party support, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/15/psvr-2-pc-adapter-review-is-sonys-headset-now-the-go-to-for-pc-vr/">the PC adapter</a> released last month feels like they’re ready to give up on it.</p>



<p>Then there’s the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/13/playstation-portal-review/">PlayStation Portal</a>, a truly wonderful idea that should let you stream PlayStation games anywhere you want for £200, and grab some of that juicy Switch market in the process. Except it’s not quite that simple, because even when playing within a good home network, we’ve seen the remote play stumble and interrupt gameplay, so how is it going to handle hotel or cafe Wi-Fi? A lot of this could be improved if you could just stream from PlayStation Plus, hooking up to Sony’s optimised streaming servers, and being able to tap into the full PS Plus library.</p>
<p>Sure the Portal sold out as soon as it went on sale, but that’s pretty much inevitable with tech these days.&nbsp;There are plenty of units available now, but is anyone buying them?</p>

<p>But the bigger problems seem to be on the game development side, where Sony’s decision to chase after the live service big bucks has stumbled, staggered, lurched forward and picked up a big of momentum, and then fallen flat on its face.</p>

<p>Naughty Dog’s full The Last of Us multiplayer spin-off was in development for years, having split off from The Last of Us Part II, and grown and grown in scope and ambition… but then someone pointed out they would <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/15/the-last-of-us-online-has-been-cancelled/">need a full team to support the game as a live service</a> and Naughty Dog did not have the staff to do that. So they cancelled it.</p>
<p>Just… how? How did it get that far before someone did a headcount at Naughty Dog? Before someone pointed out just how many people have to work at Epic and Bungie to support their games? To make it worse, the game had been teased and mentioned for years since the launch of The Last of Us Part 2, it wasn’t a secret, so fans were really let down. And let’s be honest, those fans basically just wanted a revamped Factions mode from TLOU with prettier graphics, TLOU 2’s enhanced gameplay and maybe a bit better progression to keep them hooked.</p>

<p>But then came Helldivers 2, the sequel that no one asked for but that turned out to be exactly the game everyone wanted. A deservedly massive hit with Sony selling the PC version across the globe, including in regions where you could not make a Sony account… and then they<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/06/sony-backtracks-on-helldivers-2-pc-psn-requirement-may-6th-update-cancelled/"> told PC players</a> they would need a Sony account to continue playing, were forced to backtrack on that demand, but have still cut off unsupported regions. The game is still great, though, and shows exactly how finding a small niche and going big with it can be a major success.</p>
<p>Which brings us to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a>, which is basically the opposite of that. It’s an excellent, colourful, multiplayer hero shooter that cost money to play. Going up against the biggest game in the world, an excellent, colourful, multiplayer hero shooter called Overwatch which is now free. Oh, and there’s also just Fortnite, Warframe, Valorant, that Marvel hero shooter that’s about to come along. They’re all free to play, and the only time you can really beat free is if you’re first.</p>

<p>Having a price tag worked for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> because it’s in a market where paying up front is still common, but Concord turned up to the party much too late, and you have to wonder why was it made and supported more and more and more strongly by Sony over the last few years? <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/03/concord-is-shutting-down-this-week-refunds-being-issued-while-they-explore-options/">Taking it offline and reworking it</a>, presumably into an F2P model,</p>
<p>While all that has been going on, Destiny 2 has been coming to its natural end. The expansion, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/">The Final Shape,</a> was the perfect conclusion to a story that has been running for ten years. A story that has had fans gripped with mysteries and lore which have taken a decade to pay off, The Final Shape ends with massive battle ripped from Avengers Endgame and a beautiful cut scene that will have had a lot of year one players crying.</p>
<p>Then they announced the game would continue and many people really did not care. Why would they, after investing ten years in that story, building and building to epic and most importantly, satisfying conclusion, players are finding it hard to be engaged with what appears to be a story tacked on to the end of the game just so they have something to sell. And at the same time, Bungie are barrelling down the path of trying to make a big budget PvPvE extraction shooter reboot of the early 90s FPS <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/24/bungie-announce-some-kind-of-marathon-remake/">Marathon</a> – a game that by it’s very nature will speak to a very different audience than Destiny’s PvE fans.</p>

<p>Sony’s live service ambitions are feeling on shaky ground, but what’s even more confusing is that they’re not making use of what they already have. Why not bring back Killzone, for example? Now I’m not pretending that it’s no work at all, but they could bring back Killzone’s multiplayer, revive classic maps and modes, release it as F2P on PC and PS5 and make money off Battle Passes and cosmetic DLC. We’re seeing the arena shooter still has some clout,</p>
<p>Oh, and one other word: SOCOM.</p>
<p>At the very least, this week has given us a reminder of just what made PlayStation so good in the first place. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">Astro Bot is a pure delight</a>, it’s playful and fun, and it’s a single player game – something that Sony built the whole PS4 generation on. Now, we’re not going to tell Sony to never do live service or multiplayer, and there are success stories, but it’s pretty clear that they’ve made some poor decisions along the way, gone too big and tried to go too quickly, when smaller and steadier would have been safer and worked better in the long term.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/alan-wake-pc-update-to-remove-iconic-licensed-song.974082/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-pc-update-licensed-song<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy has announced that a new&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>update is scheduled to arrive next week, and it's set to remove one of the game's most iconic licensed songs, replacing it with an original composition.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/alanwake/status/1831739167392272866" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Remedy reveals that David Bowie's famous song "Space Oddity" will be removed from the PC versions of the original&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>on September 10th. That'll hold across the Steam, Epic, and GOG versions of the game.</p>
<p>"Space Oddity" will be replaced by "a new original song by Petri Alanko" by the name of "Strange Moons". As a reminder, Petri Alanko is a composer who's worked with Remedy on a number of projects, including&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake</em>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/control"><em>Control</em></a>, and, of course, last year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/alan-wake-2">horror sequel</a>&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alan-wake-david-bowie-removal.jpg?itok=BQcFJjGw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alan-wake-david-bowie-removal.jpg?itok=2GRm6qcd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>David Bowie's iconic "Space Oddity" is being removed from&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>next week.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that this removal only applies to the original PC version of&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake</em>; it doesn't affect 2021's&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake Remastered</em>, which presumably still holds the rights to use the song for a while yet.</p>
<p>Of course, if you're playing the original&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>on Xbox 360, then you'll still be able to hear "Space Oddity" there, too. After all, it's not like Remedy or Warner can physically remove the rights to the song from your Xbox 360 disc, right?</p>
<p>Video games regularly run into problems due to the expiry of music licensing agreements, including&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>itself.</p>
<p>Back in 2017, it was announced that the digital and physical versions of the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-to-be-pulled-from-stores-due-to-music-licensing-issues">would be pulled from stores</a> around the world due to music rights issues. The game subsequently <a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/1055512227623530496" rel="noopener" target="_blank">returned to stores in 2018</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grand-theft-auto-4-music-rights.jpg?itok=89cxyhpe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grand-theft-auto-4-music-rights.jpg?itok=qvhJhlcN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Games like&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 4&nbsp;</em>have also run into music rights issues.</figcaption></figure><p>Back in 2018, it was also revealed that&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 4&nbsp;</em>would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/updated-grand-theft-auto-iv-losing-lot-of-music-due-to-license-agreements-expiring">lose a number of its music tracks</a> due to expiring license agreements. Many of those songs were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-iv-may-be-bringing-back-removed-songs">subsequently restored in a later update</a>, although that update brought some woes of its own.</p>
<p>Again, if you're playing&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake Remastered</em>, you won't need to worry about "Space Oddity"; it'll still play over the game's closing credits. However, if you're playing the original game on PC, you'll hear Alanko's composition instead.</p>

<p>It has been a year to the day since Starfield was released on Xbox and PC, taking the world by storm but landing a relatively mixed reception after a few days in the open. It was in development for a staggering amount of time, and when it finally hit the market, it wavered in its ability to live up to the hype.</p>



<p>The game is now one year old, and the first major expansion for the title – Shattered Space – will be released at the end of the month. With that in mind, it’s a critical time to take a look at the game’s performance and determine if anyone is still playing Starfield.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-lost-in-the-stars">Lost In The Stars</h2>



<p>At first blush, Starfield looks impressive. It offers a vast universe bursting at the seams with opportunities to explore, along with an immersive, lengthy story, plenty of side quests, factions, and intuitive, innovative ship-crafting mechanics. One of the key selling points of Starfield was that the story unravels in a way that <strong>technically </strong>gives it infinite replay value.</p>



<p>But once you start digging, you find a plethora of copied and pasted content, baseless side missions, forgettable factions and bosses, and a gameplay ‘reset loop’ that quickly becomes stale and repetitive.</p>



<p>In the months that followed Starfield’s release, Bethesda Game Studios became slow to release any new content for the game. Even minor updates were spread out across a gap-laden cadence, and it has taken an entire year for the team to ship Shattered Space, an expansion that was marketed before Starfield was released.</p>



<p>With that being said, is there much of a market ready to receive Shattered Space, or has everyone long since moved on?</p>



<h2 id="h-mixed-numbers">Mixed Numbers</h2>



<p>Using Steam as a representative example of Starfield’s player count, it looks as though the game isn’t faring too badly. It had 7,311 players in the game at the time of writing, which isn’t awful for a single-player game a year after it was released.</p>



<p>But Baldur’s Gate 3, which was released a month before Starfield, has 68,586.</p>



<p>Elden Ring, which was boosted by the June release of Shadow of the Erdtree, has 57,600.</p>



<p>Fallout 4, which was released in 2014 by Bethesda Game Studios, has 16,180 players exploring a post-apocalyptic wasteland – <strong>ten years</strong> after launch. </p>



<p>It’s important to stress that <strong>many </strong>players will still be locked in on Xbox Series X|S, but it’s near impossible to get those numbers.</p>



<p>One of the biggest boons in the Bethesda world is the extent of modding opportunities that bleed into the tech titan’s games. On Nexus Mods, Fallout 4 has 61,700 mods, and Skyrim has almost 100,000. Even 2010’s Fallout: New Vegas has 35,000 mods.</p>



<p>Starfield has just 496 mods available a year down the line, despite BGS pushing out official mod support several months ago. Even Fallout 76, which doesn’t <strong>officially </strong>support mods, has more than 2,000 files on Nexus Mods. I get that it’s tough to code mods for Starfield, but that’s another issue.</p>



<p>If we look at the sentiment around streaming, we can see that, at the time of publishing, Starfield had just <strong>62 live viewers </strong>on Twitch. That’s down from an all-time high of 522,021. By comparison, Fallout 4 had around 2,000 live viewers. If we look at some space-faring competitors to Starfield, we can see that they’re all doing better than Bethesda’s title:</p>



<ul>
<li>Elite: Dangerous – 184</li>



<li>No Man’s Sky – 517</li>



<li>Star Citizen – 4,705</li>
</ul>



<p>According to Google, the search volume for Starfield bottomed out at the start of 2024 and has never picked back up again.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-dlc-outlook">The DLC Outlook</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Shattered Space <strong>could </strong>do something to revive Starfield, but I doubt it’ll be anything major. In recent trailers, Bethesda Game Studios made it more of a priority to showcase the arrival of an in-game vehicle than it did the impending release of Shattered Space. Players were excited for a faster way to get across the game’s many planets – but Shattered Space isn’t turning heads.</p>



<p>Historically, Bethesda Game Studios’ DLC game has been sublime, especially in Skyrim and Fallout 3, way back in the day. Fallout 4 had some solid expansions, and Fallout 76 has been getting better for almost six years. But I’m just not feeling the same level of excitement from the community for Starfield’s Shattered Space expansion.</p>



<p>Those other games had expansions released <strong>faster </strong>than this, so perhaps that’s a problem. </p>



<p>Let’s not forget that Todd Howard <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-wants-annual-starfield-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wants <strong>annual </strong>Starfield expansions</a>, but that’s only going to work if there’s a player base there to receive them. Also, Phil Spencer said he wants Starfield to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-starfield-popular-skyrim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as popular as Skyrim is</a> 12 years after launch. Will that be a reality a decade from now if it’s not even true <strong>today</strong>?</p>



<p>I’m willing to give Shattered Space a run, even if I completed Starfield <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-one-month-later/">and then never looked back</a>. I can’t imagine it’ll do much to bring many players back into the fold, but it should be entertaining for a few hours at least, and given that I bought the Constellation Edition, I want to get the most from my money.</p>

<p>At Gamescom, I sat down with the team at MADFINGER to learn about the next evolution for Gray Zone Warfare. The team has been preparing a super-sized content update that has just been revealed in full, at the heart of which sits the ‘day/night’ mechanics. This long-awaited feature plunges Lamang into darkness, altering the game state in many ways.</p>



<p>That’s only scratching the surface of this update, though. MADFINGER’s Rick Lagnese advised me that a wipe is ‘100% necessary’ because of all the new features and mechanics being implemented, which means that once you’ve installed the update, you’ll find your account reset.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-am-the-night">I Am The Night</h2>



<p>Gray Zone Warfare emerged earlier this year to considerable success, hitting more than 800,000 sales in just a few days. It won players over with gorgeous visuals and an open-world approach to the extraction shooter formula, despite the team being adamant that it’s not <strong>strictly </strong>an extraction shooter.</p>



<p>There’s plenty in the GZW pipeline, I’ve come to learn. As I sat down with the guys at Gamescom, I was presented with exclusive live footage of the new update, checking out how darkness impacted the world of Lamang. To survive at night, you’ll need to have your wits about you and plenty of equipment: night-vision goggles, flashlights, tracer rounds, and other tactical devices like lasers.</p>



<p>It’s <strong>very </strong>realistic. In designing the night cycle, the team has gone so far as to replicate the Southeast Asian sky, matching up constellations you’d see in the real world in the game. They’ve also tweaked how the AI behaves at night, with soldiers sleeping, taking reduced patrols, and using their own aids like flashlights when needed.</p>



<p>Oh, and the squad is adding a series of night-only quests that’ll force you into that less comfortable environment.</p>



<h2 id="h-getting-better">Getting Better</h2>



<p>MADFINGER has boosted the world of Lamang in this update, deploying more points of interest that add a little backstory to the region, and the in-game economy has been ‘rebalanced’.</p>



<p>This means rewards, prices, loot, AI equipment, vendor stocks, and progression have all been addressed. This overhaul is why ‘a wipe will be 100% necessary’, Rick Lagnese said. With this update comes high-value loot, boosted loot density, and various other elements like stash cases, faction chat in the wider world, streamer mode, and even an emote system.</p>



<p>Movement mechanics have been tweaked or added, such as prone leaning and diagonal sprinting, and the team has worked tirelessly to address some of the biggest issues in Gray Zone Warfare:</p>



<ul>
<li>AI being overpowered</li>



<li>‘Deafening’ helicopters</li>



<li>Long helicopter wait times</li>



<li>Rubber-banding</li>
</ul>



<p>Ultimately, all this is just a taste of what’s coming in the next Gray Zone Warfare update. If you’ve not yet picked the game up, consider investing in it on PC – you won’t regret it.</p>

Not only are they doing the right thing by their workers, they’re also helping to preserve the human art, ingenuity and creativity that fuels interactive storytelling. These agreements signal that the video game companies in the collective bargaining group do not represent the will of the larger video game industry.

As is evident in the quotes above and our reporting on the strike, chief among the members' concerns (and a large reason for the strike itself) are guaranteed protections against the use of unethical genAI practices.

			<p>Even though Rockstar Games only released a single Grand Theft Auto VI to date, there's a lot of information floating around regarding the next entry in the series, and most of it can now be checked out in a very convenient way thanks to the hard work of a dedicated fan.</p>
<p>The GTA VI Document version 1.5 was released online earlier this week, providing an in-depth look at the game, the very first trailer released last year, all the leaks that have occurred so far, and more. You can check out the latest version of the document by going <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1usHpd-r-dllDIlMj6rBWxCCLwy4SgRyM/view">here.</a></p>
<p>It has been some time since we have heard anything about Grand Theft Auto VI from Rockstar Games, but the lack of information definitely hasn't impacted the excitement surrounding the game, which is only getting bigger as we get closer to the late 2025 release window <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/">confirmed</a> by Take-Two a few months back. It's not just players who are excited about the game's release but also the video game industry, as GTA VI is expected to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">biggest entertainment launch of all time</a>, whose performance on the market can have a huge impact on the entire industry.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is now in development for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/peter-molyneux-says-ai-will-be-a-real-game-changer-in-the-future-of-games/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/peter-molyneux-says-ai-will-be-a-real-game-changer-in-the-future-of-games/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Peter Molyneux, a veteran game developer responsible for games such as Fable, Dungeon Keeper, and Theme Park, spoke out about what he thinks people can expect from the games industry over the next few years and what developments will be made to keep it alive. The main answer was AI. When<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/where-will-games-be-in-25-years" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> asked by Eurogamer</a> where he thinks the world of video games will be in two years time, he mentioned that AI will most likely be heavily used at this point.</p>
<p>"AI is going to be a real game changer. There will come a time where AI will be used to create huge parts of a game - AI-generated characters, animations, dialogue, VO, there is so much that AI will be able to tackle." While this is a genuine possibility, it spells danger for those who are in the games industry at present, as it would leave their jobs dangling in the balance. What will happen to those responsible for animating characters when AI takes over? His statement continues with, "You will be able to, for example, create a game from one single prompt such as 'make a battle royale set on a pirate ship,' and your AI will go and do that for you."</p>
<p>With how controversial Peter Molyneux has been in the past, these responses don't surprise many people. In addition to adding AI into the game industry mix, he also went on to explain his thoughts on how Hollywood will perceive video games and says that Hollywood is "going to continue to be fascinated with games and keep on coming for more game stories and narrative." We've seen the Fallout TV show, The Last of US TV show, the Super Mario Movie, and recently announced the Minecraft movie.</p>
<p>While Peter Molyneux commented on AI during this interview with Eurogamer, he wasn't the only veteran games developer to comment, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/shinji-mikami-says-no-need-for-dino-crisis-to-exist-when-monster-hunter-is-so-successful/">Shinji Mikami,</a> founder of Tango Gameworks, also explained how AI will make a difference in the game industry. Looking into the far future, Mikami mentioned "there's not a whole lot that can be changed as far as backgrounds, but animations and stuff like that could all be, in 25 years, completely AI-generated. And so the importance of the creation of backgrounds and actual animations, I feel that there's going to be a much bigger gap than there is now. That's one of the things that is a bit daunting."</p>
<p>AI has accelerated from janky-looking art prompts on Dall-E to fully-fledged videos and imagery that borders reality. For the most part, it is still easy to clock out what is AI and what isn't, but who knows how fast AI will continue to evolve?</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fa0og5/john_totalbiscuit_bain_homage_in_the_w40k_space/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Redditor Tiucaner</a>, the credits feature an "In Memoriam" section, which pays tribute to John "TotalBiscuit" Bain. The section also seemingly features several other staffers who died during the game's production, including casting and voice director Roman Palmov and technical writer Andrey Kozyrev, among others.</p>
<p>Just in case you need a reminder, TotalBiscuit, also known as The Cynical Brit, was a very well-known figure within the gaming industry. He's perhaps best known for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@cynicalbrit" rel="noopener" target="_blank">his YouTube channel</a>, where he drew attention to lesser-known indie games, and the Co-Optional Podcast, on which he served as one of the hosts.</p>

In 2015, Bain's cancer was sadly deemed inoperable, and he was given around two to three years to live.</p>
<p>That prediction sadly proved to be correct; Bain passed away in 2018. He had, at that point, already retired from content creation on YouTube, although he was still hosting the Co-Optional podcast alongside his wife Genna.</p>
<p><em>Space Marine 2</em>'s mention of Bain in the credits reminds us that he's no longer with us, of course, but it also gives us a chance to honor and celebrate his legacy, which includes a 2011 video shining a spotlight on the original&nbsp;<em>Space Marine</em>. You can check that out here.</p>

<p><em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>is, as you might expect, the followup to 2011's third-person hack-and-shooter hybrid <i>Space Marine</i>.</p>
<p>It returns to the story of Captain Demetrian Titus, although he's a captain no longer; stripped of his rank after being accused of heresy, Titus must prove his worth to the Empire by putting a stop to a Tyranid invasion on an Imperial planet.</p>
<p>Saber and Focus have promised that&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>will feature <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-no-microtransactions">no microtransactions</a>; although the game will have a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-roadmap">post-launch roadmap</a> that adds new features, all gameplay additions, including new modes and features, will be free for all players.</p>

They’re <em>born</em> loving guns. Their blood has bullets running through it. So naturally, the Imperium has a wide range of weapons for players to use in <em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em>. But which to use? Which is best? What if you’re using <em>the wrong gun</em>?! Calm down, it’s OK, this guide will detail the best guns you should use to slay your enemies in Space Marine 2.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="51b2fdf858489d76cce52eee135e8cd2" data-recommend-id="image://51b2fdf858489d76cce52eee135e8cd2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1098" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Plasma Incinerator" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Plasma Incinerator" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="51b2fdf858489d76cce52eee135e8cd2" data-recommend-id="image://51b2fdf858489d76cce52eee135e8cd2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1098" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Plasma Incinerator" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h566"><a id=""></a><strong>Plasma Incinerator</strong></h3><p>The Plasma Incinerator is arguably one of the best guns to use in the game. Even though its firepower isn’t the highest, you can charge it up to do a significant amount of damage. Its overall stats balance it out to be an ideal rifle, and since it doesn’t have a magazine, you don’t have to reload it.</p><figure id="" data-id="cc79ab50798cd7dc7f57b7ed64ce8ddd" data-recommend-id="image://cc79ab50798cd7dc7f57b7ed64ce8ddd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1063" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Heavy Bolt Rifle" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Heavy Bolt Rifle" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cc79ab50798cd7dc7f57b7ed64ce8ddd" data-recommend-id="image://cc79ab50798cd7dc7f57b7ed64ce8ddd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1063" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Heavy Bolt Rifle" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h567"><a id=""></a><strong>Heavy Bolt Rifle</strong></h3><p>The Heavy Bolt Rifle is a light machine gun. Its firepower is surprisingly low for its heft, but it makes up for it in speed and range, which is ideal when you find yourself fighting large hordes (which happens a lot). Out of all the weapons you can carry, this one has the largest magazine size too.</p><figure id="" data-id="c118e2d2841de68a8e8acd919c79d0d9" data-recommend-id="image://c118e2d2841de68a8e8acd919c79d0d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1063" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Melta Rifle" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Melta Rifle" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c118e2d2841de68a8e8acd919c79d0d9" data-recommend-id="image://c118e2d2841de68a8e8acd919c79d0d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1063" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Melta Rifle" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h568"><a id=""></a><strong>Melta Rifle</strong></h3><p>The Melta Rifle is one of the strongest weapons to use in the game. It has the highest firepower, and can kill anything within two rounds. This weapon is essentially a shotgun flamethrower that’ll melt anything you shoot at. But the catch is the Melta Rifle has horrible range and reload speed, so you’ll need to be mindful of that.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c8f909cc1b6cf1b5215b17a065887a3b" data-recommend-id="image://c8f909cc1b6cf1b5215b17a065887a3b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1098" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Plasma Pistol" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Plasma Pistol" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c8f909cc1b6cf1b5215b17a065887a3b" data-recommend-id="image://c8f909cc1b6cf1b5215b17a065887a3b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1098" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Plasma Pistol" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h569"><a id=""></a><strong>Plasma Pistol</strong></h3><p>The Plasma Pistol is a miniature version of the Plasma Incinerator. It has the second-highest firepower out of all the pistols, and can be charged up to inflict a lot of damage at once. This pistol perfectly pairs up with the Melta Rifle, if you’re looking for a one-two combo.</p><figure id="" data-id="85aa366e4f5d589b6806d69f26655ce4" data-recommend-id="image://85aa366e4f5d589b6806d69f26655ce4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1162" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Heavy Bolt Pistol" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Heavy Bolt Pistol" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="85aa366e4f5d589b6806d69f26655ce4" data-recommend-id="image://85aa366e4f5d589b6806d69f26655ce4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1162" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Heavy Bolt Pistol" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h570"><a id=""></a><strong>Heavy Bolt Pistol</strong></h3><p>The Heavy Bolt Pistol is a great weapon. It has the highest firepower of all the secondary weapons, and an incredibly high reload rate. If you find yourself surrounded, this is a perfect fallback weapon to use. Just be aware that it only has eight bullets per clip.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fc2214a8f1d87bce4eb9bbf22f6f79bf" data-recommend-id="image://fc2214a8f1d87bce4eb9bbf22f6f79bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1090" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Power Sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Power Sword." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fc2214a8f1d87bce4eb9bbf22f6f79bf" data-recommend-id="image://fc2214a8f1d87bce4eb9bbf22f6f79bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1090" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Power Sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h571"><a id=""></a><strong>Power Sword</strong></h3><p>The Power Sword is perhaps one of the most enjoyable weapons in the game. It can be used for light or heavy attacks, and it is great for any situation you find yourself in, and it looks like…a sword! Out of all the melee weapons in the game, it’s the most well-rounded one. Except for the sides. They’re very sharp.</p><figure id="" data-id="b77f79dc534972c05c632524a032679a" data-recommend-id="image://b77f79dc534972c05c632524a032679a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1095" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Thunder Hammer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Thunder Hammer." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b77f79dc534972c05c632524a032679a" data-recommend-id="image://b77f79dc534972c05c632524a032679a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1095" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Thunder Hammer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h572"><a id=""></a><strong>Thunder Hammer</strong></h3><p>Nothing screams <em>40K</em> like a giant hammer swinging at your enemies. The Thunder Hammer is extremely satisfying to use, and packs a serious punch. It’s great for clearing out hordes, but the downside is how long it takes to swing. When using this, be prepared to take a hit or two.</p><hr><p>These are some of our favorite weapons to use while playing <em>Warhammer 40:000 Space Marine 2</em>. But be sure to experiment with all the options, and find the mix that works best for you. Then follow your holy calling and slay those heretics.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>It's fair to say that Concord is one of the biggest flops in recent gaming history, with the hero shooter shutting down after just two weeks of existence. However, despite that, it seems that the game will live on through a side story in Prime Video's video-game-themed TV show Secret Level, which releases on December 10.</p><p dir="ltr">Announced back in August during Gamescom, Secret Level is an anthology series that will feature animated short stories set in the world of various games and gaming franchises, including God of War, The Outer Worlds 2, and Warhammer 40K. Concord was announced as one of the 15 franchises involved in the project, and a source <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-will-remain-in-prime-videos-secret-level-despite-games-sudden-cancellation-source" rel="nofollow ">told IGN</a> that the game will remain a part of Secret Level.</p><p dir="ltr">Secret Level will also feature new stories in franchises that haven't seen a fresh entry in some time, such as Mega Man and Unreal Tournament. A brief moment in the trailer led us to think that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/were-thinking-its-keanu-reeves-in-secret-level-upcoming-armored-core-episode/1100-6526013/">Keanu Reeves might star</a> in the Armored Core episode, but that hasn't been confirmed yet. The John Wick star was recently revealed as the voice of Shadow in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-adds-keanu-reeves-as-voice-of-shadow/1100-6522667/">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The future of Concord remains unclear, with one of the developers of the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-dev-thanks-fans-for-their-support-but-admits-none-of-us-know-whats-next/1100-6526291/">outright stating</a> that "none of us know what's next." Prior to the game's shutdown on September 6, reports suggested that players were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-players-are-repeatedly-killing-their-characters-to-get-a-platinum-trophy/1100-6526260/">killing themselves in the game on purpose</a> to try to gain the platinum trophy before the curtain fell.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lou%E2%80%99s-lagoon-preview-%E2%80%93-a-new-cozy-obsession.974010/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/lous-lagoon-preview-new-cozy-obsession<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sometimes low stakes vibing with a sense of progression is all you want out of a game. To chill yet effect change all the same. <em>Lou’s Lagoon</em> is the next up and coming game to let you do just that.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Lou’s Lagoon</em> is obviously its own game, but it’s also got quite the interesting mixture. Part <em>Animal Crossing</em>, part <em>My Time at Sandrock</em>, part flying game, and add in a dash of <em>No Man’s Sky</em> -- yes, really – and you’ve got <em>Lou’s Lagoon</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your uncle has disappeared and you’ve turned up to figure out what happened to him and to rebuild his delivery business at the same time. Set in an archipelago of islands full of mystery, you’ll be building up and connecting people from all around.</p>
<p>The throughline of the game is the mystery of what happened to your uncle, but the meat of the game will be rebuilding, repairing, and improving the various islands and the inhabitants you meet along the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Collecting resources is very <em>No Man’s Sky</em>-like in that you’re “vacuuming” things up with your Swirler 2000, like wood debris and metal parts, to then use to craft things later. Also, what else are islands but a planet analogue with the sea and air between standing in for space? Alright, reaching a bit here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those resources can then be used to repair or build structures, repair stairs to reach new places on an island ,and pretty much anything and everything in-between. You can even craft your own decorations and furniture. There's cooking and a science station, too.</p>
<p>The most unique thing you can repair and upgrade, however, is your plane that's unlocked after you repair it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Using the plane isn’t simply a quick travel system, as you will be actively flying it around the archipelago of Lou’s Lagoon. The brief time I had with it showed a simple control set that will be difficult to master if you’re wanting to challenge yourself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Timed challenges can be found throughout the sky that see you flying through rings. You’ll need some serious practice to complete some of them, let alone set a good time.</p>
<p>With all of those tools in hand, that’s more or less the basis of the game. You go around collecting resources, doing quests for people you meet along the way, find and upgrading more things along the way so you can explore even more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I’m always a sucker for a game where I can collect some sort of resource or do a quest to then upgrade some sort of town or building. That tangible result of my effort that has a permanent physical affect on the game world is never not satisfying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thankfully, <em>Lou’s Lagoon</em> is full of things like that. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a game of exploration, growth, and connection set in a beautiful backdrop. There's a mystery to uncover and plenty of secrets within many of the islands to find as well. You can go where you want, when you want, at your own pace -- comfort gaming you can curl up with any day.</p>
<p>I think this game will speak to anyone looking for their next cozy game fix. <em>Lou’s Lagoon</em> smartly mashes together a few systems with its unique island hopping world to make for a compelling game.&nbsp;</p>
<hr><p>Lou’s Lagoon<em> was previewed at PAX West 2024.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-sales-4-million</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/street-fighter-6-sales-top-4-million-around-the-world.974007/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-sales-4-million<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>sales have hit another major milestone around the world, around fifteen months after the game was initially released.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/StreetFighter/status/1831814865297489924" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Capcom reveals that&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>has sold more than four million units globally, which presumably counts across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>The studio says that updates and new stuff for&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>will continue, as "more content" and "more events" are on the way for the game. Given that&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-sales-3-million">crossed the three million threshold back in January</a>, that means it's shifted another million units in the last eight or nine months, which isn't too bad.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/street-fighter-6-sales-4-million-blanka.jpg?itok=VZAO-jhP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/street-fighter-6-sales-4-million-blanka.jpg?itok=chYcewUM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>has broken another big sales barrier.</figcaption></figure><p>By way of comparison, Bandai Namco's&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-sales-2-million">sold two million copies</a> within its first month or so on sale, while&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>had sold around 2.47 million copies by the time of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-sells-247-million-copies-drives-capcoms-overwhelming-financial-results">Capcom's September 2023 financial results</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, it's difficult to compare fighting franchise sales directly; fighting games are a fairly niche genre in the grand scheme of things, and each franchise within the genre arguably has its own audience as well, although there will naturally be some crossover.</p>
<p>Still, four million sales for the latest entry in a pretty major series well over a year after its initial release suggests that there's still a market for&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6</em>, which Capcom will no doubt be happy about. Those might not be&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-village-sales-10-million"><em>Resident Evil Village</em>-level sales</a>, but hey - there's still time!</p>

<p><em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>may already be well over a year old, but the game's not resting on its laurels.

But it was more than just an elaborate tech demo, and established the <em>Astro</em> franchise, previously a VR-exclusive, as a budding Sony first-party A-lister. Leading up to the release of the third game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280"><em>Astro Bot</em></a></span>, Team Asobi even added a countdown timer to the mission room in <em>Astro’s Playroom </em>for the September 6 launch. </p><p>That’s where players were able to wait ahead of actually being able to play <em>Astro Bot</em> and watch all of the little guys count down like it was New Year’s Eve 1999. It was a neat little easter egg that’s in keeping with the franchise’s dedication to celebrating PlayStation’s past and taking time to add little touches that make the whole thing feel extra special. </p><p><em>Astro Bot</em> is out now on PlayStation 5 and I’m not alone in thinking it’s a strong frontrunner for GOTY and also one of the best 3D platformers ever. It’s full of whimsical little touches and dazzling set pieces, with levels that revolve around clever mechanics and make full use of the DualSense controller, from the haptic triggers to the speaker. It all gives playing the game the same tactile satisfaction of playing with toys in real life. </p><p>But the seeds of many of those ideas, including blowing onto the touch pad to to create wind gusts in the game, were there in <em>Astro’s Playroom</em>, a short game not enough people played despite it being free with each of the over 60 million PS5s that have been sold so far. It only takes three hours to beat and will give you a nice taste of what to expect in <em>Astro Bot</em>. Plus, it will give you a point of reference to see how far the franchise has come in just four years, and a new appreciation for all of the novel ways the new game iterates on what Team Asobi experimented with before. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The sales milestone comes 15 months after the fighting game went on sale in June 2023 across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</p><p>“Thank you for playing and for helping us reach this milestone!” Capcom said. “We hope you're excited for the future of SF6 as we intend to release more content and hold more events!”</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/street-fighter-6-punches-through-3-million-copies-sold">Street Fighter 6 hit three million copies sold back in January</a>, seven months after launch. That means it’s taken just over half a year to add another one million sales. Capcom has said Street Fighter 6 is  “generally progressing in line with our expectations.”</p><p>Capcom had said it aimed for Street Fighter 6 to outsell Street Fighter 5, targeting over 10 million copies sold over the course of its lifetime.</p><p>“While we do not communicate specific figures for internal budgets, we look to outperform the title’s predecessor, Street Fighter 5, and are aiming for more than 10 million units over the life of the title,” Capcom said. Street Fighter 6, then, has a long way to go before it beats Street Fighter 5’s sales total.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Street Fighter 6 Akuma Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>To put Street Fighter 6’s sales into context, 1993 SNES hit Street Fighter 2 Turbo sold 4.1 million copies, the seminal Street Fighter 2 sold 6.30 million, and Street Fighter 5 sold 7.60 million.</p><p>Another interesting comparison is with fighting game rival <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a>, which has sold four million copies since going on sale in September 2023. Mortal Kombat is typically the best-selling fighting game franchise, outselling the likes of Street Fighter and Tekken by some margin. Mortal Kombat 1 hit four million sales around 11 months after launch. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-sells-over-2-million-in-a-month">Tekken 8 sold two million in a month</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Street Fighter 6 is in the middle of Second 2, with DLC characters Terry and Mai from Fatal Fury and The King of Fighters coming soon, and Elena due out winter 2025. Capcom has yet to say what comes after.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
