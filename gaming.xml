                <p>Next year marks <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-25th-anniversary-year-will-be-really-special-phil-spencer-says/1100-6532334/" data-ref-id="1100-6532334">the 25th anniversary of Xbox</a>, but one of the console's original team members, Laura Fryer, is openly questioning one element of Microsoft's gaming division. Fryer--who no longer works for Xbox--recently shared her response to Microsoft's recent handheld and console partnerships and concluded that the company "has no desire" to create hardware anymore.</p><p>On <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFG7YxFFCnY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her YouTube channel</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-hardware-is-dead-says-founding-team-member-it-looks-like-xbox-has-no-desire-or-literally-cant-ship-hardware-anymore" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), Fryer noted that the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-windows-handheld-revealed-releases-holiday-2025/1100-6532245/" data-ref-id="1100-6532245">ROG Xbox Ally handheld devices</a> won't have any exclusive games to drive sales and added that Microsoft's partnerships with Asus on the handheld and AMD on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/" data-ref-id="1100-6532502">the next generation of Xbox</a> reflects a dim future for its consoles.</p><p>"Obviously, as one of the founding members of the Xbox team, I'm not pleased with where things are today," said Fryer. "I don't love watching all of the value that I helped create slowly get eroded away. I'm sad because, from my perspective, it looks like Xbox has no desire--or literally can't--ship hardware anymore. So, this partnership is about a slow exit from the hardware business completely. Personally, I think Xbox hardware is dead."</p><p>Fryer acknowledged that remasters of classic games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review/1900-6418359/" data-ref-id="1900-6418359">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> have been massively successful, but she questioned Xbox's ability to make new hits. She also notes that Microsoft has a valuable resource in Game Pass, but believes that it's not enough to drive hardware sales on its own.</p><p>Former Xbox Live and Game Pass vice president Mike Ybarra had a slightly different assessment on <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1939298865976647790" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a>. While Ybarra also believes that Microsoft is pulling back from hardware, he thinks it can become the biggest gaming publisher if it focuses on that goal alone.</p><p>"They have to figure out what needs to change, and fast," wrote Ybarra. "I'm a big fan and will always bleed green... Pick your lane and stick to it... It's simple to me, Xbox should strive to be the world's largest publisher of entertainment content. Get rid of everything else and get focused. Do not be afraid to say what you are. Embrace the lane... Straddling the fence is not a winning plan."</p><p>A recent report suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/major-xbox-layoffs-reportedly-coming-soon/1100-6532671/" data-ref-id="1100-6532671">a new round of layoffs may hit Microsoft's gaming division</a> as soon as this week. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has said multiple times that the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-defends-xbox-studio-closures-layoffs-i-have-to-run-a-sustainable-business/1100-6524121/" data-ref-id="1100-6524121">needs to cut Xbox staff to be a sustainable business</a>. At the same time, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q3/press-release-webcast" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft's latest quarterly report</a> noted that net revenue the company achieved net revenue of $70.1 billion (up 13%) and a net profit of $25.8 billion (up 18%). The Xbox division also posted year-over-year revenue growth.</p>

<p>Another console port first</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Hamster, known for its suite of retro <strong>Arcade Archives</strong> ports, has revealed its next Switch 2 game as part of the Arcade Archives 2 series. And, just like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-ridge-racer">Ridge Racer</a>, it's another polygonal arcade-to-home port. This time around, it's <strong>Air Combat 22</strong>, which is coming to both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_air_combat_22">Switch 1</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_2_air_combat_22">Switch 2</a> on <strong>3rd July 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/06/namcos-air-combat-22-is-coming-to-arcade-archives-on-ps4-ps5-switch-and-xbox">Time Extension</a> (via <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202506/46058">Famitsu</a>), Air Combat 22 is an arcade game from 1995 and a spin-off of the original 1993 <strong>Air Combat</strong> arcade game. These games would eventually become part of what we know as the <strong>Ace Combat</strong> series, which actually celebrates its 30th anniversary <em>today</em> (for the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/air_combat">console port of the original</a>, at least).</p>
<p>The Switch 1 version comes in at <strong>$14.99</strong>, with the Switch 2 one priced at <strong>$16.99</strong>. And, those of you who don't have a Switch 2 yet, you'll be able to buy an upgrade pack when you eventually upsize for <strong>$2.99</strong>.</p>
<p>Both versions of the game come with "Original Mode", "High Score Mode", and "Caravan Mode", but the Arcade Archives 2 version (for Switch 2) will also get a resolution bump and additional modes such as "Time Attack" (not Network Mode though, as this is a single player game).</p>

<p>Air Combat 22 was a step-up in nearly every way to its predecessor. Named for running on the Super System 22 hardware, the game let you choose form one of three aircrafts — Grumman F-14 Tomcat, Sukhoi Su-27 and the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor</p>
<p>Notably, this is the first time that Air Combat 22 has ever received a console port, so it's fantastic that we're finally getting it in a more-accessible format. And if the Ridge Racer Switch 2 version is anything to go by, you're in for a treat.</p>
<p>Let's hope we get more Ace Combat love on Switch 2, especially after the fantastic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ace_combat_7_skies_unknown_deluxe_edition">Ace Combat 7</a> port.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/until-then</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-until-then-switch-a-relatable-yet-ethereal-narrative-adventure.1231761/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>Glitch in the Matrix</p>
<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> European</p>
</section><section><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/until_then">Until Then</a> is a visual novel that tells the story of Mark Borja, a high school student who grapples with the usual day-to-day of teenage life while trying to figure out why he’s experiencing weird cases of déjà vu. It’s a slow burn; one that relishes in the quieter, mundane aspects of life that many TV shows and movies would rather you believe didn’t exist.</p>
<p>With beautiful pixel art visuals at its heart, Until Then feels a lot more ‘alive’ than a lot of visual novels, with dialogue and actions taking place entirely within the scene; so in other words, no ‘talking head’ sequences where static characters are nattering to one another from across the screen.</p>
<p>There is a supernatural element that slowly reveals itself, but it’s best if I keep this under wraps here. This is a game that works best with as little prior knowledge as possible, and its story will definitely tug at your heartstrings on more than one occasion through its 10-15 hour runtime.</p>
<p>Gameplay is understandably pretty limited, and you’ll spend most of your time simply pressing ‘A’ to advance the dialogue. Occasionally, you’ll be able to move left or right through the environment, and developer Polychroma Games has also seen fit to include a bunch of fun little minigames. Again, these all fit into the narrative wonderfully, so one moment you might be trying to jam a stick into some floating fishballs, and the next you’ll be playing a tune on the piano. They're really cool and help to break up the experience nicely.</p>
<p>I have to give a massive shoutout to the sound design, too. A lot of the music is composed of slow, gentle melodies no doubt designed to heighten moments of emotion, but the true star of the show is the diegetic sound. Almost all of the public scenes are bolstered by background noises of folks just going about their day; it gives a wonderful sense of place, but also a weird, ethereal feeling to the bizarre events that play out.</p>
<p>While I do appreciate a slow burn, there were definitely a few scenes that outstayed their welcome. One in particular sees Mark simply trying to keep himself entertained at home: he watches TV, plays games, and even chats to random strangers on his phone. It demonstrates his boredom and loneliness well, but I think the same goal could have been accomplished a bit quicker. Mark's bored, but that doesn’t mean I need to be.</p>
<p>This is a minor gripe, though. Until Then is a wonderful story that manages to feel both strange and relatable, and it’s well worth playing. One quick note on the Switch 2, however: the game hasn’t been optimised for the new console yet, so after a certain point early on, it simply didn’t work for me. Stick to the Switch 1 for now.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/until-then]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Bandai Namco isn't done talking about what it has coming down the pipeline, as the company announced it will host its own Bandai Namco Summer Showcase this week on <strong>July 2, 2025, at 12pm PT/3pm ET/8pm BT.</strong> </p>



<p>The showcase will feature more information on a number of titles Bandai Namco is publishing, including news on the recently announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/code-vein-ii/">Code Vein II</a>, the upcoming RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-open-world-rpg-revealed-with-gorgeous-trailer-and-in-game-sneak-peek/">Blood of the Dawnwalker</a> from former CD Projekt RED developers at their new studio Rebel Wolves, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/tekken-8/">Tekken 8</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/little-nightmares-iii/">Little Nightmares III</a>, and Everybody's Golf Hot Shots, to name a few of the 12 games from Bandai's portfolio that'll be shown off.</p>



<p>Chief among the 12 titles being shown in this showcase is the one that we know very little about, as Bandai Namco is set to premiere a brand-new My Hero Acadedmia title at this Wednesday's showcase. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Here's the full list of titles Bandai Namco has committed to showing at this Summer Showcase event:</p>



<ul>
<li>Code Vein II</li>



<li>Death Note Killer Within</li>



<li>Digimon Story Time Stranger</li>



<li>Everybody's Golf Hot Shots</li>



<li>My Hero Academia</li>



<li>Little Nightmares III</li>



<li>Patapon 1+2 Replay</li>



<li>Shadow Labyrinth</li>



<li>Super Robot Wars Y</li>



<li>Tekken 8</li>



<li>The Blood of the Dawnwalker</li>



<li>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree</li>
</ul>



<p>Though this month has already included plenty of new information on titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-showcase-announces-little-nightmares-iii-release-date-little-nightmares-enhanced-edition-a-little-nightmares-vr-game-and-more/">Little Nightmares III</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-looks-suitably-witchery-in-new-gameplay-overview-2026-launch-confirmed/">The Blood of the Dawnwalker</a>, most of the games on the list are titles that players have been waiting to hear more about.</p>



<p>Plenty of them have release dates, with Super Robot Wars Y, Shadow Labyrinth, and Patapon 1+2 Replay all due out this summer, in August for the former and July for the latter two games. While Digimon Story Time Stranger, Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree, Everybody's Golf Hot Shots, and Little Nightmares III are all due out in September and October. </p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll get better looks at gameplay for each of these titles, as some of them are due out in the next few weeks.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-alters-possible-generative-ai</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-alters-players-reckon-theyve-spotted-some-undisclosed-generative-ai-work.1231755/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Eagle-eyed&nbsp;<em>The Alters&nbsp;</em>players reckon they've spotted some undisclosed generative AI work hiding in one of the game's background screens, which would technically contravene Steam's guidelines if it's true.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-slam-the-alters-after-discovering-evidence-of-undisclosed-gen-ai-in-images-text-and-translation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAlters/comments/1lhbpox/did_the_alters_captain_use_a_little_bit_of_ai/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">EarthlingKira</a> noted that text shown on a screen in the game's Command Center area displays the line "Sure, here's a revised version focusing purely on scientific and astronomical data", which sounds an awful lot like the kind of thing ChatGPT or a similar AI chatbot might spit out.</p>

<p>Later in the same thread, another user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAlters/comments/1lhbpox/comment/mz9sx70/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">points out</a> that the subtitles for the Brazilian Portuguese version of&nbsp;<em>The Alters&nbsp;</em>appear to have been created using AI as well, as it seems to include part of a prompt given to a chatbot to translate phrases into Portuguese.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-generative-ai-text-anomaly.jpg?itok=69mt4Kru 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-generative-ai-text-anomaly.jpg?itok=A_JWvtMy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sure! Here's a screenshot of&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>. (No AI was used in the retrieval of this screenshot, or, indeed, in the writing of this story.)</figcaption></figure><p>If the text and Brazilian Portuguese subtitles in question were indeed generated by AI, then this would seem to contravene Steam's guidelines on the technology.</p>

<p>While Valve does allow generative AI content in games on Steam (although this <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-explains-its-rules-on-ai-content-in-steam-games" rel="nofollow">wasn't always quite so straightforward</a>), it requires developers using gen-AI to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-changes-rules-on-ai-to-allow-vast-majority-of-games-that-use-it" rel="nofollow">disclose that they're doing so</a> when the game is submitted.</p>

<p>As you've probably guessed already,&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>' Steam page doesn't contain any such disclosure, so if AI was used, it was either done without developer 11 bit studios' knowledge or ignored during the submission process.</p>

<p>With that said, a PR representative for 11 bit studios has <a href="https://x.com/callmeshawnp/status/1935830483214254450" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">publicly stated</a> on social media that generative AI was not used during the creation of&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>. I've reached out to 11 bit for clarification on this and will update this story as soon as I hear anything.</p>




<p>Some players have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAlters/comments/1lhbpox/comment/mz4l9e5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">questioned</a> whether or not&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>' supposed use of generative AI is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAlters/comments/1lhbpox/comment/mz4nwe9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">even a particularly big deal</a> or not in this case. Their argument is that the asset in question would probably consist of "lorem ipsum"-style placeholder text if it wasn't AI-generated, and that this isn't a particularly taxing creative task.</p>

<p>The counterarguments, of course, are the usual ones when it comes to generative AI; it's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ai-search-wrong-a-lot-inacurracy-study" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">often wrong or nonsensical</a>, it's <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/ai-has-environmental-problem-heres-what-world-can-do-about" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">environmentally damaging</a>, and it could be <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/openai-cto-mira-murati-ai-may-cause-some-creative-jobs-to-disappear.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">taking away opportunities</a> for creatives to flex their muscles, even for background assets.</p>

<p>If you've been sitting here throughout all of this wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>The Alters&nbsp;</em>is, it's the latest game from&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>This War of Mine&nbsp;</em>developer 11 bit studios.</p>

<p>The game revolves around Jan, an astronaut who's left stranded on a hostile planet. Jan is forced to clone himself in order to keep his space station running, but each of his clones is quite literally his own man, and Jan must balance the needs of his "alters" with his mission.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-alters">The Alters</a> is a sci-fi management game in which you remix your character's life history in a "Quantum Computer" to generate a workforce of deeply disturbed, borderline non-functional clones. In a twist so on-the-nose I can feel its fingers plucking at my olfactory bulb, developers 11 Bit Studios may have used generative AI to spawn or auto-translate parts of the in-game lore - despite the absence of a generative AI disclosure on Steam.</p><!--more-->
<p>The rumour bubbled up last week, when Reddit user EarthlingKira <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAlters/comments/1lhbpox/did_the_alters_captain_use_a_little_bit_of_ai/">posted a screen</a> of an in-game mission log with the phrase "Sure, here's a revised version focussing purely on scientific and astronomical data". It reads pretty obviously like a chatbot response that was accidentally left in the text after it was generated and pasted into the game. Bluesky user Hietor De Paolo has also <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zitosilva.bsky.social/post/3lsm3lzvb3s2b">posted a screen</a> of a piece of dialogue, featuring the phrase "Sure! The text translated to Brazilian Portuguese is..." This suggests that 11 Bit also used ChatGPT or another genAI tool to translate the game's script.</p>
<p>Valve's Steam policies <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">require developers</a> to tell players upfront whether they're using generative AI software, though the policy is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">so vague as to be totally unhelpful</a>. There is no mention of generative AI on The Alters Steam page at the time of writing. Nor did the developers tell me they were using generative AI when I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-cant-have-sex-with-yourself-in-the-alters-but-its-not-like-this-topic-is-totally-removed">broached the subject</a> at an event in Poland last year. They did have a booth at the event that let attendants create and chat to AI personas, but I perhaps naively took this for a stunt dreamed up by the PR team - there was no suggestion that any of it would be part of the game itself.</p>
<p>GenAI continues to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/electric-nightmares">a Trending Topic, with strong undertones of Discourse</a>. The industry's largest publishers, especially Microsoft, have bet billions on the success of generative AI tools of one kind or another. You can't sign into a Windows laptop these days without being harassed to generate something - go on, do it for uncle Satya Nadella.</p>
<p>While genAI appears to be widely used in game development as a continuation of older, less romanticised automation tools, many developers and creatives are rightly suspicious of the bigger promises around genAI, seeing the supposedly magical artmaking technology as a source of ugliness and error and a threat to their livelihoods, foisted on them by snake oil merchants who, for all their talk of <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/practical-ai-how-ludos-generative-ai-tools-aim-to-help-democratise-game-development/">"democratising"</a> the creative process, are only accountable to their shareholders. Unions have attempted to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sag-aftra-union-reach-tentative-agreement-with-game-companies-that-could-end-the-latest-voice-actor-strike">put "guardrails"</a> on genAI in game development, with varying success.</p>
<p>Back in 2024, I wondered whether The Alters' premise of cloning a character from the protagonist's own backstory could be interpreted as a parody of how generative AI bots appropriate and regurgitate existing texts and imagery. Lead designer Rafal Wlosek told me that 11 Bit did consider making your space station's Quantum Computer a talking AI character, but this was not envisaged as an actual genAI bot, nor a commentary on today's genAI tools. "I think it was [conceived] before GPT showed up to the general public," he said. Wlosek added that he was "very interested" in the discussion around generative AI and that 11 Bit "will be watching closely", but they had no plans to engage with the subject in The Alters.</p>
<p>I've reached out to 11 bit for clarification about the presence of genAI material in The Alters. I feel I should have been more on top of this, as the Rock Paper Servitor who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-alters-review">reviewed The Alters</a> and thought it was, on the whole, pretty decent. In my defence, I didn't spend much time combing the lore bits in the menus, because I was on deadline.</p>
<p>There's been some suggestion on Reddit that translation and optional lore writing are tertiary tasks, and thus, appropriate to hand off to a bot. This seems wildly silly. Translation and localisation are demanding and "creative" pursuits. Languages do not mesh easily - it takes wit and imagination to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-jolly-cooperation-of-localising-dark-souls">capture, say, the peculiarity of Dark Souls dialogue in English</a>. The Alters is about making subtle differentiations between versions of "the same" person. Choice of wording during dialogue was often key to my understanding of each Alter, and I have yet to encounter a chatbot capable of such delicacies. </p>
<p>As for lore document writing, you could say that my inattention to this side of The Alters during my review supports the view that it is an inessential extra. But come now - I don't think anyone can seriously dispute the importance of lore text to a sci-fantasy jobbie such as this.</p>
<p>In any case, the arguments about whether genAI can deliver on these fronts ignore the wider point that genAI is, essentially, just the latest way of trimming costs, shaving away labour and increasing output, to ensure that the industry can continue to be a mechanism of transferring wealth upwards. The Alters really does feel like an allegory for all that, despite 11 Bit's protestations - the basic stakes of the plot are that your employers want you to treat the Alters as bots, even as they protest that they are living beings who deserve a future. But this is a big, sticky issue that we probably need to revisit in op ed form. In the meantime, I'll let you know as and when we get clarity from 11 Bit.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clone-generating-game-the-alters-may-have-used-ai-to-generate-some-writing-despite-the-lack-of-a-steam-disclosure]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> griefers are pinning ornithopters to the ground in PvE zones, summoning worms with thumpers, and feeding helpless players to the monstrous beasts in otherwise safe regions of the game.</p>
<p>It works due to vehicle collision. While Funcom <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-patch-ends-the-reign-of-vehicular-terror-as-ramming-into-other-players-no-longer-deals-damage">removed the ability to damage other players by ramming into them with ornithopters</a>, you can still push other players' vehicles around by flying into them. What these griefers are doing is essentially parking their own flying vehicles on top of players looking to harvest spice or flour sand, stopping them from flying out of the reach of incoming sandworms.</p>
<p>This comes following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-deep-desert-pve-expansion">a massive patch made the PvP Deep Desert significantly safer</a> for PvE-minded players, allowing them to farm the highest tier of resources without fear of roaming ornithopter gangs. In response, those who got a kick out of hunting down these combat-averse players have seemingly taken their devious behaviour elsewhere.</p>

<p>It's worth noting victims of this strategy do have ways out. They can attempt to slip out of the grasp of these griefers and fly away, or retrieve their scout ornithopter (while it has no stored cargo) with a vehicle back-up tool. However, taking the second approach still leaves you stranded on the sand with a worm approaching, forcing you to make a break for the nearest safe spot.</p>
<p>This, obviously, trapping players on the ground isn't an intended vehicle interaction. So what can Funcom do? Well, they can remove vehicle-on-vehicle collision altogether in PvE zones. This was a popular community-suggestion during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-is-being-dominated-by-one-busted-technique-crushing-people-with-helicopters">the whole ornithopter squishing saga</a>.</p>
<p>The counter-argument is, harvesting spice on open sand is meant to be dangerous! While Hagga Basin isn't a PvP zone for the most part, you're still meant to keep your head on a swivel for incoming dangers. Removing this vehicle collision issue could make harvesting spice too easy.</p>
<p>It's a tricky one. Removing vehicle-on-vehicle collision is likely harder than it looks, and may have knock-on effects on the wider game. It's unlikely Funcom can flip a switch to make it work in PvP areas and not in PvE ones. There is a touch of irony with this, as an update to make the PvP endgame safer for PvE players has consequently made the PvE area more dangerous.</p>
<p>In my heart I can't really be mad at these sorts of shenanigans. Obviously for the player taking things slow and steady, happy in Hagga Basin, it would be incredibly frustrating to get pinned and eaten by a worm. But I also can't help but shake the feeling that these sorts of hyjinx add a wild west charm to Dune: Awakening, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-early-meta-helicopter-infested-nightmare">one I hope never goes away</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-griefers-are-parking-on-other-players-and-feeding-them-to-worms]]></content:encoded>

And once again, the griefing concerns Ornithopters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Funcom launched Dune: Awakening's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-dev-funcom-is-already-testing-a-radical-change-to-the-pvp-deep-desert-experience"><u>Public Test Client </u></a>and then <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-patch-11017-makes-big-changes-to-improve-deep-desert-endgame-experiences-for-all-players"><u>extended the PvE zone of the Deep Desert from about 10% of the map to 50%</u></a>. It followed an AMA in which the studio told players frustrated by the endgame experience that it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-developer-is-formulating-a-plan-to-improve-pvp-and-toxic-deep-desert-experiences"><u>"formulating a plan" to improve PvP in the Deep Desert</u></a>.

They're doing the same thumper and land on thopter technique they perfected in [Deep Desert].

Griefers are in an all-out war against everyone else on their server, and yet there's zero way for solos to band together to stop it. And as a Dune fan, I don't think planting a thumper and then having four thopters land on you is part of the mythology."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">u/RandoFinder then edited their post to add: "I kept my Thopter at 730 km for 30 minutes until a spice blow, and as soon as I moved, four thopters were chasing me. JFC, y'all are pathetic. This was in Hagga. I had players tonight telling each other to doxx me when I stood up to them in Hagga chat. I've been in WoW general and other horrible chats, but Dune general is the most toxic chat that I've ever seen."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think it goes without saying that PVP is PVP, and killing other players in a PVP zone is totally legitimate and expected," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lnop0k/comment/n0guz4x/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>responded</u></a> another player. "Entrapping someone by abusing game mechanics intended to prevent grief of a similar kind, ala pinning people with ornithopters that otherwise can't be destroyed or escaped in a PVE zone, is griefing.

The existence of Rush mode is no surprise, as it's one of the franchise's trademark multiplayer modes, but this is some of the first footage we're seeing of it in action.</p><p>This footage stems from a Battlefield Labs alpha test, and it was not meant to be published publicly since the alpha requires players to agree to not share footage online.

Many commented that the footage was giving off Modern Warfare 2019 vibes. Specifically, some are saying the footage looks similar to Call of Duty's large-scale, 32 vs. 32 Ground War mode (<a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Ground_War" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">which itself took cues from the Battlefield series</a>).</p><p>Battlefield 6, which may or may not be what the game is actually called, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reveal-still-happening-this-summer-ea-assures/1100-6532481/" data-ref-id="1100-6532481">set to be revealed sometime this summer</a>, but it remains to be seen exactly when.</p><p>The game, whatever it ends up being called, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-be-fully-revealed-this-summer-launching-by-march-2026/1100-6531349/" data-ref-id="1100-6531349">officially set to launch by the end of March 2026</a>, but with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> slipping to 2026, some have theorized <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-battlefield-6-launch-window-clearer-than-before-following-gta-6-delay/1100-6531351/" data-ref-id="1100-6531351">EA might capitalize on the delay and launch Battlefield 6 this year</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka has no plans to remake or remaster the Dreamcast <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-adventure">Sonic Adventure</a> games.</p>
<p>Iizuka, who directed both Sonic Adventure and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-sa2-dc">Sonic Adventure 2</a>, is frequently asked by fans to remake the two beloved games, but he told <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/144842/takashi-iizuka-sonic-racing-crossworlds-interview-june-2025">Shack News</a> the effort required would be better spent on new games.</p>
<p>"I do hear that a lot," said Iizuka. "I really am appreciative of everyone who likes the Sonic Adventure series, but when I think about what it would take to bring that game up to the standards and expectations of what the modern gaming audience would want, I think it would be about as much time and energy as it would to make a new title.</p>

<p>"So part of me is thinking maybe I should just make a brand new title and that's why there are currently no plans."</p>
<p>Sonic Team doesn't seem averse to remakes and remasters entirely, considering last year it released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a> - an update of the 2011 original.</p>
<p>However, both Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2 are particularly dated. And as Sonic Team continues to develop its 3D Sonic games, Iizuka previously stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-frontiers-is-cornerstone-of-future-sonic-games-says-sonic-team-head">open zone design of Sonic Frontiers is the "cornerstone of future Sonic games"</a>.</p>
<p>Further, last year Iizuka stated there were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-plans-for-sonic-adventure-3-says-sonic-team-boss-but-wed-love-to-make-it">no plans for Sonic Adventure 3 or a Chao Garden game</a> either, but said "we'd love to make it".</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Iizuka discussed the roadmap for the development team and how they decide which game to make next.</p>
<p>The three core pillars of the Sonic series are the modern 3D action games, the 2D classic games, and the racing games, Iizuka explained.</p>
<p>Looking back, it's clear the team is seeking to alternate between these each year: last year had Sonic x Shadow Generations, the year before was the 2D <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-superstars">Sonic Superstars</a>, and the year before that was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-frontiers">Sonic Frontiers</a>. Now there's Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds following previous racing games.</p>
<p>In addition, Sonic Team is also thinking about what new experiences and games people want in the future. "So when we think about our roadmap for content," said Iizuka, "that's what we're constantly thinking about: what are those long-running series and how can we add new?"</p>
<p>New experiences the developers have recently released include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-murder-of-sonic-the-hedgehog-is-an-april-fools-joke-that-turned-out-to-be-real">The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, an April Fool's joke that turned out to be real - it was quickly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-murder-of-sonic-the-hedgehog-surpasses-1m-downloads">downloaded a million times</a>.</p>
<p>Between games and films, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/10-years-ago-we-were-fighting-to-survive-its-totally-different-now-segas-franchise-guru-on-sonics-redemption-arc">Sonic has become a global megastar in the last 10 years</a>, as Iizuka detailed to Eurogamer.</p>
<p>To celebrate the forthcoming release of Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-joins-mclaren-racing-in-historic-partnership-with-sega">Sega has partnered with McLaren Racing</a> in a multi-year collaboration.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/no-plans-for-sonic-adventure-remakes-as-sonic-team-focuses-on-new-games-instead]]></content:encoded>

			<p>During a recent investor meeting, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa addressed the topic of demand for the newly released Switch 2 console. According to Furukawa, it greatly exceeded Nintendo's internal estimates, which is why you may have had trouble finding it in stores. The president even apologized to customers for the inconvenience. Here's the quote, initially <a href="https://x.com/NStyles/status/1938408070784393520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found</a> by X user NStyles and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendos-president-apologises-for-not-being-able-to-meet-switch-2-demand" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">translated</a> into English by Nintendo Life:</p>



<p><em>Currently, in many countries, the demand for Switch 2 exceeds the supply, and we are unable to meet it. We understand that some shareholders have also been unable to obtain it. We started accepting lottery sales at My Nintendo Store in April. The response far exceeded our expectations, and I announced in my name on X that there were 2.2 million applicants, along with an apology.</em></p>



<p><em>Since then, we have conducted four lottery sales, but some people were not selected. We have announced that the fifth lottery will take place starting in July. Many general retailers have also conducted lottery sales. The number of stores offering in-store sales is gradually increasing. As a company, we are working to improve our production system to deliver as many units as possible. We apologise for the inconvenience caused by this initial demand, which greatly exceeded our expectations.</em></p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 <span><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/" target="_blank">sold</a>&nbsp;over 3.5 million units in the first four days, which is</span> <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-selling-twice-as-fast-as-the-og-switch/">twice as fast</a> as its predecessor in the same timeframe. Last week, DFC Intelligence <a href="https://wccftech.com/switch-2-2025-sales-forecast-bumped-from-15-to-16-million-units-by-dfc-intelligence/">raised</a> its 2025 sales forecast for the new console from 15 to 16 million units. That estimate does include the limited supply, for without that, DFC Intelligence reckons the Switch 2 could sell 20 million units.</p>

<p>The first of these new modes is known simply as Challenge. This will introduce "tougher foes" and "greater trials".</p>
<p>Then there is the Iron Squire mode, which ups the difficulty even more by giving you no second changes. It's a permadeath situation, people. "Die once, your save is gone," The Plucky Squire developer All Possible Futures wrote, wishing us all good luck.</p>
<p>As well as this increased level of difficulty, the studio is also adding the likes of dialogue fast forward and new achievements. </p>
<p>The Plucky Squire's free Challenge update is already available for those on Steam. Console versions are coming "soon". You can check out a little teaser for it all via the embed below.</p>

<p>"There's also a handful of pacing issues, not least that the game has a habit of interrupting its own flow to explain things.

And indeed, according to <strong>Star Fox</strong> designer Takaya Imamura (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-is-so-full-of-geniuses-even-zelda-and-star-fox-veteran-takaya-imamura-felt-a-constant-sense-of-inferiority-working-with-them/">Automaton</a>), this was indeed the case during his own stint at the company.</p>
<p>In speaking on <a href="https://x.com/ima_1966/status/1938107363799798252">X</a>, he noted that he felt relieved when he left the company; not because it provided a negative experience of any kind, but rather so that the overwhelming sense of inferiority he felt could be eased. Despite his own huge contributions, it seems even Imamura felt somewhat intimidated by his talented colleagues.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hkvqyx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I really felt that Nintendo is full of amazing people, and I was constantly thinking about how to prove my own worth among them. A sense of inferiority was always lingering somewhere.</p>
<p>"When I left the company, it’s true that I felt a sense of freedom, as if I had been released from the inferiority complex I’d carried for years. But at the same time, there was also a loneliness in thinking, “I won’t be able to work with these people anymore…” That said, with only a few years left until retirement anyway, and since game development often takes many years, I felt a stronger desire to move forward at my own pace, doing more freely creative things."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shinji Watanabe, another ex-Nintendo employee and now CEO of Epsilon Software, <a href="https://x.com/es_s_watanabe/status/1938131920317256011">responded to Imamura</a> and agreed, even describing developers at Nintendo as "celestial beings".</p>
<p>Imamura has certainly earned his place in the Nintendo Hall of Fame, however, having contributed to massive franchises such as Star Fox, <strong>F-Zero</strong>, and <strong>The Legend of Zelda</strong>. He has since released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/omega_6_the_triangle_stars">Omega 6: The Triangle Stars</a> on Switch.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">King Slime might not rule over much, but they’re royalty nonetheless, as they’re the first boss most players encounter in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/terraria/" data-ref-id="5000-105503" data-mce-href="/games/terraria/">Terraria</a> and the one most likely to squash you when you least expect it. Big, blue, and bouncy, this gelatinous monarch is the perfect entry point for testing your mettle, dropping some handy loot and setting the tone for boss battles to come.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike the more dramatic foes lurking deeper in Terraria’s layers, King Slime is pretty casual about the way in which it appears, showing up if you poke it the right way or sometimes just crashing the party on its own. Although entirely optional, defeating it is often the first step towards serious progression, unlocking early mobility options and giving newer players a clear combat checkpoint. Here’s how to summon and beat King Slime in Terraria.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to prepare for King Slime</h2><p dir="ltr">While King Slime isn’t exactly Moon Lord material, it still pays to come prepared. The first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-terraria-bosses-in-order/1100-6532648/" data-ref-id="1100-6532648" data-mce-href="/articles/all-terraria-bosses-in-order/1100-6532648/">Terraria boss</a> might be a glorified blue blob, but it’s one that teleports, spawns minions, and can flatten you like a professional pancake chef if you’re caught off guard.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523258-how-to-summon-king-slime-gun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4523258" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523258-how-to-summon-king-slime-gun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4523258"></a><figcaption>Using a gun against King Slime.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523258-how-to-summon-king-slime-gun.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Make sure you’ve got at least copper-tier or better armor - packing wood armor is pushing your luck, and vanity-only setups are asking for a swift respawn screen. You might get away with melee weapons if you’re feeling brave or fancy a particularly tall challenge, but your best bet at this early stage is to equip a ranged weapon to keep your distance. Shurikens work well, but my pick is a bow with flaming arrows, as you can craft your ammo by hand using standard arrows and torches. As for accessories, finding a grappling hook and Hermes Boots from Underground and Cavern chests will help you maintain momentum.</p><p dir="ltr">Just like all Terraria bosses, life is much easier when making a platform arena ahead of the fight. Hack a few trees down with your axe, and you’ll soon have enough wood to craft the blocks by hand. You’ll need to anchor the first wooden platform onto something, such as stone, but once you’ve started extending, you can remove the initial placement without the whole thing collapsing. The further you go, the simpler it is to kite the King and avoid getting boxed in by blue slimes.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to spawn King Slime</h2><p dir="ltr">There are a few ways to get the royal jelly rolling, and none of them require a regal invitation.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523262-how-to-summon-king-slime-crown.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4523262" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523262-how-to-summon-king-slime-crown.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4523262"></a><figcaption>Use a Slime Crown to summon King Slime</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523262-how-to-summon-king-slime-crown.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>King Slime spawns in three different ways:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Use a Slime Crown -</strong> Crafted at a Demon or Crimson Altar with 1 Gold/Platinum Crown and 20 Gel. Crowns are made from 1 Ruby + 5 Gold/Platinum bars at an anvil. Simple, clean, and entirely under your control</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Naturally spawn during Slime Rain -</strong> This random weather event causes slimes to fall from the sky. If you defeat enough, King Slime may drop in unexpectedly. It’s fashionably late, but will always show up towards the end if you meet the 150 slime quota</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Random spawn -</strong> On rare occasions, King Slime just spawns because he feels like it. You’ll either need to roam the outer edges of your world to the far left or right, particularly near forests, but you might stumble into an accidental boss fight. Just make sure it’s daytime, you’re on the surface, and there’s grass nearby</li></ul><p dir="ltr">King Slime has a few tricks: it teleports if you get too far away, bounces faster when its health drops, and constantly spits out blue slimes to keep you distracted. It’s also one of the few bosses that can despawn easily if you run too far or die, so don’t stray too far mid-fight.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to beat King Slime</h2><p dir="ltr">Keep your distance. King Slime is massive, slow, and easy to predict, but if you stand still for too long, it’ll hop right on top of you. Use platform layers or rope elevators to move vertically, and pepper it with ranged attacks. It only teleports when you're far away, so keep within a few blocks if you’re going to melee and want to avoid surprise jellification.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523257-how-to-summon-king-slime-terraria-attack.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4523257" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523257-how-to-summon-king-slime-terraria-attack.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4523257"></a><figcaption>Attacking King Slime.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523257-how-to-summon-king-slime-terraria-attack.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Clear the blue slimes as they spawn, especially in Expert or Master Mode, where crowd control becomes critical. This prevents your arena from becoming a trampoline death trap. If you’re using flaming arrows, shurikens, or even early magic weapons like the Wand of Sparking, aim for sustained damage per second (DPS) and keep kiting.</p><p dir="ltr">When fighting with friends, designate a tank to hold his attention while ranged players pelt from above. It has no phase changes, just increased aggression and movement speed as it slowly shrinks from the damage it takes. Don’t panic when it gets faster. That just means you’re close to victory.</p><h2 dir="ltr">King Slime drops and rewards</h2><p dir="ltr">Defeating King Slime nets you a royal helping of goodies, particularly useful for early exploration. None are essential for progressing, but nice to have in preparation for your next fight.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Classic Drops</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Solidifier</strong> - Lets you craft slime-themed furniture</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Slime Gun</strong> - A bit useless but completely fun, giving you the ability to inflict the Slime debuff on both enemies and friendly NPCs alike</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Slime Hook</strong> - A grapple hook styled blue after the King</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Slimy Saddle</strong> - Ride around on your own mini Slime. It’s faster, jumps far higher than you can, and even float on water</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Ninja Armour Pieces</strong> - Helmet, shirt, and pants drop individually, affording decent movement bonuses and a stylish headband to boot</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>King Slime Trophy</strong> - Commemorate your victory with a wall hanging</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>King Slime Mask</strong> - A vanity item that plonks a blue bubble on your head</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Gel</strong> - Makes crafting a little easier, especially when making torches, sticky glowsticks, bombs, or the Slime Crown you’ll use to summon the King.</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">Expert and Master Mode Drops</h3><p dir="ltr">All Classic drops apply to Expert and Master Modes, but these harder versions of Terraria boss fights give you extra rewards to aim for:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Royal Gel</strong> - An accessory that makes most regular slimes friendly. Consider it an early-game peace treaty</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Coins -</strong> Not glamorous, but everyone loves a bit of pocket change</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>King Slime Relic</strong> (Master Mode-only) - A golden piece of furniture to celebrate your win</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Royal Delight</strong> (Master Mode-only) - Summon the Slime Prince as your pet, right after you kill its father</li></ul><p>Beating King Slime also ticks off an early-game milestone: it earns you the Slippery Shinobi achievement, unlocks a Bestiary entry, and gets you one step closer to conquering Terraria’s ever-escalating gauntlet of chaos.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Splatoon 3 upgrade introduces some significant improvements that highlight just how much more powerful the new system is compared to its predecessor.</p>



<p><span>Over the weekend, the tech experts at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank">Digital Foundry</a>&nbsp;shared their analysis of multiple Nintendo Switch 2 upgrades for several original Switch first-party titles like Super Mario Odyssey, Zelda: Link's Awakening, and Echoes of Wisdom, and a few others, highlighting how the games have been improved on the new generation system.</span> The improvements introduced to the vast majority of games, however, don't highlight how much the new console is more powerful than its predecessor as the Splatoon 3 upgrade does. </p>



<p>The Splatoon 3 upgrade bumps the resolution from dynamic 1080p to 4K in docked mode with image quality improvements and, in some scenarios, the Nintendo Switch 2 increases resolution by five, six times, as seen in one instance where the game runs at 864p on the original system, and at 2160p on the new. The upgrade also massively improves the city hub area, which runs at locked 60 FPS on the Nintendo Switch 2, as does the rest of the game. In handheld mode, the upgrade is less of an improvements as the game ran well in the same mode on the original Switch, though the 1080p resolution at locked 60 FPS is still an improvement over the dynamic 720p resolution offered on the original system.</p>

<p>The power of the Nintendo Switch 2 is definitely being put to good use<span> to improve some of the best games released for its predecessor, and even&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-backward-compatibility-better-original-system/" target="_blank">unpatched games can brute-force some welcome performance improvemen</a>ts.&nbsp;</span>With the exception of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-display-problematic-worse-predecessor/">screen</a>, the system as a whole is a significant improvement over its predecessor, as highlighted by Chris in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is now available worldwide</p>
