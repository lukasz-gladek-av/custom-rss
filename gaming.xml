			<p>Today, Heart Machine revealed that Hyper Light Breaker, the 3D follow-up to Hyper Light Drifter, will be released in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Early Access on Steam</a> on January 14, 2025. This news came during the Day of the Devs: The Game Awards Edition, where a trailer was released to reveal the official Early Access date for the game. For those interested, Hyper Light Breaker will cost $29.99 during the Early Access period, with the price subject to change depending on content added to the game and changes made to the title.</p>
<p>This game is published by Arc Games, which has also published games like Torchlight, Neverwinter, and Remnant 2. For those who are unfamiliar with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hyper-light-breaker-gameplay-trailer-stylish-action-no-mans-sky/">Hyper Light universe</a>, Hyper Light Breaker is a co-op open-world roguelike where players get to assume the role of a "Breaker," with multiple different Breakers to choose from. Breakers are warriors who are tasked with rebuilding a civilization that was ruined due to a cataclysmic war. To do so, you get to explore a vast and ever-changing world in a procedurally generated world that is known as the Overgrowth.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hyper Light Breaker | Release Date Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VijrcUbspqU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>During the exploration, you'll get to come across secrets hidden in nooks and crannies while battling against the Crowns, which are bosses controlled by the Abyss King.</p>
<p>While this game is a follow-up game to Hyper Light Drifter, it isn't in terms of story. It's set in the universe like their previous game, but Hyper Light Breaker takes place several decades before the events that happened in the first game. Luckily, to play Hyper Light Breaker, it isn't required for the player to have played Hyper Light Drifter, as the game is set to be a stand-alone experience.</p>
<p>Much like many other roguelikes, Hyper Light Breaker will have intense and difficult combat, where players have to use the loot that they have on them to upgrade their gear and become more powerful with each new run. Every time the player dies, the Overgrowth regenerates but will never be the exact same as the world you experienced previously. While this is a common feature in many different roguelikes, this is a first for the Hyper Light universe and gives it a similar feeling to that of Risk of Rain 2, a game that shares a lot of similarities with this upcoming title.</p>
<p>Heart Machine has stated that Hyper Light Breaker will continue to receive support and updates beyond the Early Access launch, with the developers planning on adding new Breakers to choose from, new bosses to fight and weapons to utilize, to keep the game fresh.</p>

            <p>Creation is an act of kindness. One person sloughs off a piece of themselves, shapes it, wraps it, and sends it out into the world in the hope that it might mean something to someone else. Other people do this for us all the time and mostly we don't even notice. The work is unseen and unremarked upon even as, through repetition, we come to depend upon it. Until, one day, that light that they shine can't be seen. Maybe you left home, or maybe they did, but now it's your turn to perform such acts of kindness. To carry the tradition forward for others - and for yourself.
</p>
<p>Friends, it's time to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skeal">Skeal</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Playing Skeal at Christmas is an annual RPS tradition, created by Alice O and written about by her in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skeal-free-skiing-game">2017</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skeal-comedy-skiing-game">2018</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-is-your-annual-reminder-to-play-skeal-this-christmas">2019</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/merry-christmas-its-time-to-play-skeal">2020</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-not-christmas-until-youve-played-skeal">2021</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skeal-reflects-the-power-pleasure-and-pain-of-all-our-christmasses">2022</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/here-we-go-ho-ho-its-time-for-your-annual-play-of-skeal">2023</a>. Alice <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alice0-is-leaving-rps-come-and-celebrate-her-work-and-make-lamentation">departed RPS back in April</a>, so I am continuing it in her stead.
</p>
<p>Skeal is a short, free joke created by Nick Cummings which you can <a href="https://whymog.itch.io/skeal-webgl-version">play in your browser</a>. It'll take you five minutes. Go do it now.
</p>
<p>Ah, that's fun, isn't it. A bit of silly wordplay blown up and out in a way that causes the delight to stack and multiply. Every year I forget the details of it, and every year I smile the first time I miss a gate and the "Pain" counter appears in the top left. 
</p><p>We play Skeal every year and invite you to do the same as a little marker in the closing season. I play every year, but in many ways the tradition begins for me long before I actually head over to Itch to find the game. It begins early in December when I first recall the tradition and start to sing around my kitchen. The mere thought of Skeal has become a prompt for reflection on where I've been and where I am. Briefly put? RPS, you remain my power, my pleasure, my pain.
</p>
<p>The nature of traditions is that we get to choose which we continue and which we don't. Alice O also played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rock-around-the-christmas-tree-with-dracula-cha-cha-and-christmas-pain-in-christmas-town">Dracula Cha Cha and Christmas Pain in Christmas Town</a> each December - fine traditions! - but I have let them go, for this year at least. 
</p>
<p>Of course, we likewise get to create new traditions of our own, should we want to. Who knows what Nic, Edwin, James and Ed might cook up in the months and years to come? That is for them to decide. For me, for now, I Skeal.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There are no respawns until the next round and between rounds, you buy guns and equipment with money you earn from kills and winning.</p><p> That probably sounds a lot like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dust-2-new-crate-boost-update-counter-strike-2-valve-1851602614?_gl=1*1luxzsp*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzk1MjM5NC45Ni4xLjE3MzM5NTQ2OTMuMTQuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dust-2-new-crate-boost-update-counter-strike-2-valve-1851602614?_gl=1*1luxzsp*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzk1MjM5NC45Ni4xLjE3MzM5NTQ2OTMuMTQuMC4w"><em>Counter-Strike</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>and that’s because, yeah, <em>Ballistic </em>is basically <em>Fortnite</em>’s<em> </em>version of Valve’s popular FPS. </p><p>Before I played a few matches, I was curious how well FPS gameplay would work in <em>Fortnite</em>. After a few matches of <em>Ballistic</em>, I came away impressed. Epic has done the work to make animations and movement feel and look good in the first-person perspective. Sprinting, climbing, aiming down sights, reloading, and all that feels snappy and responsive, like you’d expect from a well-made first-person shooter. </p><p>I do have some quibbles with the controls. I really want a button that lets me swap between my rifle and pistol. I’d love to be able to map my grenade and gadgets to specific buttons, too, instead of using <em>Fortnite</em>’s default inventory and hotbar system. But these are minor issues that could be fixed in future updates. For now, what’s here is a solid FPS that just happens to live in <em>Fortnite </em>and uses all the character and weapon skins you already own. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-z-goku-fortnite-vegeta-anime-update-dbz-1849420484?_gl=1*14um7a4*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzk0NzY1My4xMTQuMS4xNzMzOTQ3ODg5LjQyLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-z-goku-fortnite-vegeta-anime-update-dbz-1849420484?_gl=1*14um7a4*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzk0NzY1My4xMTQuMS4xNzMzOTQ3ODg5LjQyLjAuMA..">Yes, that means Darth Vader can snipe Goku</a></span> while Leatherface helps Snoop Dogg plant the bomb at location A.

However, I experienced some issues with menus not loading properly, random sound effects happening for no reason, long waits between matches, and janky post-game victory screens. While I had a good time taking out <em>Fortnite </em>kiddies who have never played a game like <em>Counter-Strike</em>, I understand why Epic labeled this an “Early Access” experiment. It’s enjoyable, but far from finished or stable.</p><p>Still, even in this janky, early access form, Epic’s latest mode is a promising first step toward the developer adding more FPS modes and games into <em>Fortnite</em>. </p><p>Epic has also, with the launch of <em>Ballistic</em>, given the community the ability to start publicly uploading games using the company’s FPS tools.  I expect that in the coming days and weeks, we’ll see people recreating famous <em>Counter-Strike</em> maps and more. That sounds exciting, though if I was someone working on a first-person shooter that wasn’t <em>Call of Duty</em>, I’d be nervous. </p><p>If Epic can build upon <em>Ballistic </em>and add more modes, games, and options, it might be able to bring a whole new audience into its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-lego-fortnite-brick-life-roleplay-ps5-xbox-pc-1851716667&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-lego-fortnite-brick-life-roleplay-ps5-xbox-pc-1851716667">ever-growing ecosystem</a></span>, and it might get even tougher than it already is to launch a multiplayer shooter. </p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

director, Miles Leslie, spoke about the balance between fun and realism.</p><p dir="ltr">"Fun always comes first for us," Leslie said. "Of course, we want to stay grounded in the DNA that makes a Black Ops game unique when it comes to core gameplay, but we also like to break the rules if it's going to maximize fun for players."</p><p dir="ltr">"When it comes to cosmetics, the Black Ops series naturally lends itself to some pretty outlandish themes when you consider we're the birthplace of Call of Duty Zombies and all of the crazy mindf**kery that comes with the storytelling in our games, so we like to have fun there too."</p><p dir="ltr">However, it's worth noting that Treyarch's mindset is slightly different when it comes to designing campaigns, which the developer explained remains focused on keeping the story as detailed and accurate as possible. "The Campaign has a tightly-defined cast of characters with an era-specific look to them that fits the story that we and our friends at Raven Software are telling,” Leslie explained.</p><p dir="ltr">When discussing the game's postseason narrative, the developer said the story is still taken seriously, but that "doesn't mean we can't have some fun with cosmetics along the way.”</p><p dir="ltr">This means players can likely expect plenty more of those wacky operator bundles hitting the shop for future seasons of Black Ops 6. Activision already teased an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-teases-squid-game-collab-for-black-ops-6-and-warzone/1100-6528158/">upcoming Squid Game collaboration</a> for January, so expect those bright pink suits to start showing up in Black Ops 6 and Warzone sometime in the new year.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 1 Reloaded recently added more multiplayer maps, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-merry-mayhem-all-event-rewards/2900-6018/">Merry Mayhem holiday event</a>, and new DLC weapons.</p>

                <p>The distinctive "plumbob" icons from The Sims appear to be featured in a new movie, set to premiere at the Sundance Film Festival. The film is called Twinless and concerns two friends who meet in a counseling group for bereaved twins.</p><p>Twinless will debut as part of Sundance's "U.S. Dramatic Competition," but was billed as a "dark comedy" by <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/02/dylan-obrien-twinless-paramount-1235826958/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>. A frame from the film shared on <a href="https://x.com/sundancefest/status/1866893242303721587/photo/1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sundance's social media</a> features actors Dylan O'Brian and James Sweeney (who also writes and directs) with what look like plumbobs affixed to their heads with wire. Sweeney previously wrote, starred in, and directed the romantic comedy Straight Up.</p><p>In The Sims, the plumbob is a green crystal shape which indicates the Sim currently under the player's control. It is also a symbol for the franchise writ large, usually incorporated into the games' logos. The significance of the plumbob in Twinless is unknown, though it could be featured as part of the pair's Halloween costumes or the like.</p><p>GameSpot has reached out to EA for comment and has not received a response by time of publishing.</p><p>In other Sims news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-movie-moving-forward-at-amazon-mgm-apparently/1100-6523607/" data-ref-id="1100-6523607">a movie adaptation is on the way</a> from producer Margot Robbie and director Kate Herron (Loki).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/aetherdrift-brings-wacky-races-and-new-name-for-old-plane-to-magic-gathering<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has revealed their first new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> set of 2025. The latest set, <em>Aetherdrift, </em>brings a unique spin to the popular card game: a massive fantasy racing grand prix spread across three different planes. One of those planes is an old favorite with a changed name.</p>

<h2>The <em>Aetherdrift</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/planeswalkers-guide-to-aetherdrift-part-1" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Wizards of the Coast lets players know what they can expect in <em>Aetherdrift</em>. The set will revolve around ten racing teams competing in The Ghirapur Grand Prix, the most high-stakes racing competition in the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> multiverse.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aetherdrift-streets-artwork.jpg?itok=PrClPASp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aetherdrift-streets-artwork.jpg?itok=2oMbWLgw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The race will go through three different planes: Avishkar, Amonkhet, and Muraganda. Furthermore, the ten teams featured are as diverse as the premise suggests. They include The Speed Demons, whose vehicles are powered by demonic spirits, the Mad Max-coded Endriders, the chaotic Goblin Rocketeers, and the shark-people group known as The Keelhaulers.</p>

<p>As for the grand prize waiting the lucky winner, it is an artifact of power known as the Aetherspark, which can potentially grant the user the power of a Planeswalker.</p>

<p>But among all of this worldbuilding and lore is that one of the planes isn't a new one, but an older one under a different name: Avishkar. It was originally known as <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/magic-the-gathering-kaladesh-spoilers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kaladesh</a>, the Indian fantasy-themed setting from <em>Magic's</em> history.</p>

<p>So why the change? The in-universe explanation is the plane was named after the Avishkar Assembly, a newly appointed democratic governing body which rose to prominence after overthrowing its monarchal Consulate government which the Phyrexian Invasion weakened<em>. </em>This ties the world to the events of an earlier set, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/march-of-machine-battles-and-more-cards-revealed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">M</a><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/march-of-machine-battles-and-more-cards-revealed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>arch of the Machine</em></a>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aetherdrift-avishkar-artwork.jpg?itok=Bd_anwEV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aetherdrift-avishkar-artwork.jpg?itok=Z2UeNbsO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The real world explanation is a bit more complicated. In a <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/avishkar-why-we-changed-the-name-of-a-plane" rel="nofollow">separate blog post</a>, Wizards of the Coast explains that the name Kaladesh carried unfortunate connotations in some Hindi dialects. Given that the setting is heavily inspired by India, it was an issue that had to be addressed.</p>

<p>According to their consultants, the name Kaladesh can be read as "kala-" meaning "tomorrow" or "art"&nbsp; and "-desh" meaning "home" or "country." On paper, this sounds fine. But, "kala-" can also be associated with the meaning "black" which carries colorist and racist connotations.</p>

<p>The new name, Avishkar, was also the result of this consultation. It comes from the Hindi word, "aavishkar" which means "invention." All earlier cards from earlier Kaladesh sets will still be referred to as such, but all cards released in the future will be called Avishkar.</p>

<p><em>Aetherdrift</em> will be available worldwide February 14, 2025.</p>

            <p>Infamous evolutionary flop <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spore">Spore</a>, for all its flaws, still had a lot of magic to it. It was fun to design your weird creatures, to watch them try to walk, and - in principle - to turn your humble creations into a spacefaring species.
</p>
<p>Curiosmos is a very different game, but it has a little of the same appeal. It's a galactic playground in which you smash meteors together to make planets, then tinker with the ecosystems of those planets to make life and watch that life evolve. All while a hungry black hole lingers nearby, eager to consume everything you have created. There's an explanatory video below.

<p>I drew comparisons with Spore, a game which tried to do everything, so I should stress that it doesn't look like you're directly creating the life that can wander about your planets. Instead, you seem to interact with the physics and elements of the solar system. For example, you can drag a cloud around to spread rainwater across the surface of a planet, perhaps turning it into an ocean world or simply making flowers grow.
</p>
<p>There's a playfulness to every interaction which I really enjoy. Don't like one of those flowers? Pluck it from the ground and toss it into deep space.
</p>
<p>It looks like a delightful playground, but there does seem to be some objectives and story to it. You're guided, somewhat, by a satellite called Curio, who apparently has some plan for dealing with the black hole that wants to devour everything. 
</p>
<p>There's no release date yet - and a lot of the footage used in the Day Of The Devs video comes from trailers released earlier this year - but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2585710/Curiosmos/">follow the game on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Finals was released in December 2023, shadowdropped to an audience that was all too eager to receive it, and for a while, it turned heads. It wasn’t long before the free-to-play, live-service shooter dwindled a little, but it remains relatively innovative and fresh, boasting solid destructive mechanics, an entertaining gameplay loop, and a unique aesthetic.</p>



<p>Recently, Embark Studios revealed that an esports scene is on the way and that in 2025, a $100,000 Major will take place. That’s all the information the company parted ways with, but right now, <strong>not</strong> <strong>one organisation </strong>has invested in The Finals, which leaves us wondering who’s going to compete.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-who-will-play-at-the-finals-major">Who Will Play At The Finals Major?</h2>



<p>The Finals Major 2025 is a $100,000 tournament with an undetermined format, structure, and schedule. Nobody knows what it’ll look like, where it’ll be played, or which organisations will field a squad.</p>



<p>The Finals has been around for an entire year, and in that time, it has retained a decent core following.</p>



<p>If we use Steam as a representative example, we can see that the game peaked at 242,000 players when it came out, and right now, it floats around an average of about 14,000 – which <strong>isn’t bad</strong>. It’s a brand-new shooter that had absolutely no following when it dropped, so for it to still be securing those numbers on <strong>one platform </strong>is great.</p>



<p>On social media, Embark Studios posted a short teaser trailer promoting the impending $100,000 Major, but it could be several months before it takes shape.</p>



<p>What organisations do you want to see surface in The Finals? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>Microsoft has announced its ambition to bring all PC games with Xbox features into the Xbox app, and those plans continue today with the addition of over 400 games.</p><p>Xbox's Chris Charla <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2024/12/updates-to-the-xbox-app/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared the announcement</a> that games like Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove, Jackbox Party Pack, The Invincible, and "dozens of games from veteran Japanese studios Kemco and Kairosoft" are among the new additions to the Xbox app. Charla also noted that 100 of these titles support Xbox Play Anywhere, which means players who buy the Xbox console version can also play their games on PC as well.</p><p>Charla stated that universal Xbox ownership, universal cloud saves, and cross-play between Xbox games on console and PC are among the benefits of this arrangement. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318799/microsoft-xbox-app-new-games-homescreen" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a> notes that this is part of a larger initiative for Microsoft to lure developers from rival digital storefronts, which includes the company dramatically lowering its cut from sales to just 12%. Charla promised that additional news will be announced at Game Developers Conference 2025, which will take place next March.</p><p>Although Xbox's direct-to-cloud controllers weren't mentioned by Charla, a previous report indicated that those are in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cloud-gaming-is-planning-for-direct-to-cloud-controllers-and-higher-quality-streams-report/1100-6527246/" data-ref-id="1100-6527246">a testing and development phase</a>. The same report indicated that Microsoft is trying to improve the visual quality of its streams to make it possible to play Xbox games without a console that can perform at the same level as the Xbox Series X|S. Earlier this week, Microsoft also revealed that Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members can take part in a test pilot program <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-adds-a-nice-new-feature-but-only-for-testers-right-now/1100-6528390/" data-ref-id="1100-6528390">to stream some games they own</a> on Xbox consoles.</p>

<p>The "Breakers" of the title are an organisation of warriors and explorers attempting to save the world after a war. What those Breakers do, and where its similar to its predecessor, is explore a world full of strange, abandoned buildings, with a plentiful sense of mystery. You'll also scavenge items that you can use to create your character build and change how you approach combat, and that combat is a mixture of ranged and melee with combos and parries.

<p>I loved Hyper Light Drifter, but it's always a worry when a game makes the leap to a new medium - and 3D, in many ways, is a different medium than 2D. Ed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/solar-ash">didn't love Heart Machine's last third-person action game Solar Ash</a>, and Edwin was not reassured <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hyper-light-breakers-3d-reworking-of-drifters-combat-is-promising-but-a-little-raw">by his Hyper Light Breaker hands-on</a> from back in March.
</p><p>"In general, I found my character to be unwieldy and a little unresponsive," wrote Edwin. "Equipped with dual knives and a pistol, they're one of several classes you'll be able to choose from in Breaker's final form, so perhaps I simply drew the short straw this time round. However, while the conspicuous recovery times of your attack and damage animations nudges you to memorise the inputs and avoid over-committing, Breaker's delays feel a little too drawn-out versus the overall floridity and fluidity of its presentation."
</p>
<p>I have hope in my heart (machine) all the same. It'll have had nearly another year of development by the time it launches, and it'll still be Early Access even at that. Plus, if Risk Of Rain can successfully leap into the third dimension, anything can.

                <p>Amazon offers a pretty great bundle of PC games every month through its <a href="https://gaming.amazon.com/home?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Prime Gaming hub</a>--which is included as part of a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Prime subscription</a>--but this month you can grab a <em>staggering </em>number of games for free. Some of the bonus freebies were added to celebrate the release of Amazon's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/salp/secretlevel?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Secret Level anthology series</a> on Prime Video. In total, Prime members can claim and keep 72 free games, including plenty of GOG and Epic Game Store keys as well as games launched via the Prime Gaming app.</p><p>How does it work? While Amazon Prime does cost $15 each month, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can get a free 30-day trial if you're new to the service</a>. But even without the free trial, this is effectively a 72-game bundle for $15. That means you are paying roughly 20 cents per game, which is downright silly.</p><hr><p>The other big plus to this promotion is that once you download these games, they're yours to keep forever. You won't need to stay subscribed to play them--unlike PS Plus or Xbox Game Pass--and, as mentioned, many of the games are being offered as download codes for platforms like the Epic Games Store and GOG. On top of that, you get the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-prime-members-get-these-18-free-games-in-december/1100-6528196/" data-ref-id="1100-6528196">other monthly games included with Prime Gaming</a>, like Planet of Lana, Predator: Hunting Grounds, and The Town of Light.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4413725-amazongames.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4413725" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4413725-amazongames.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4413725"></a><figcaption>Prime Gaming free games</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4413725-amazongames.jpg"></figure><p>Warhammer 40K fans can grab the original Space Marine game for some fun third-person shooter action. If you're in the mood for a tactical game, Dawn of War is a pretty great entry in the franchise. Shifting from sci-fi to fantasy, you can tour the Forgotten Realms in three beloved enhanced editions of classic RPGs: the first two Baldur's Gate games and Neverwinter Nights.</p><p>For something more recent, there's the nautical Lovecraftian vibes of Dredge, really gross first-person action in Scorn, and Death's Door is a fascinating look at life, death, and adorable crows armed to the teeth with big swords. If you're a fan of roguelikes, Cursed to Golf is a fantastic side-scrolling golf game with clever level designs that remain fresh throughout each run. </p><p>There are quite a few older AAA hits included in the list, including The Outer Worlds, Dishonored: Definitive Edition, BioShock Remastered, and Mafia: Definitive Edition. For some couch multiplayer fun, both Overcooked games are up for grabs. And if you love metroidvanias, there are several notable ones here: Ghost Song, Moonscars, and 9 Years of Shadows.</p><p>And there are many, many more awesome indies. Spelunky remains as captivating as ever; Super Meat Boy is still one of the best 2D platformers today; Coromon is Pokemon with a cheeky sense of humor; and No Straight Roads is a delightful celebration of music that plays like a Saturday morning cartoon adventure. </p><hr><p><strong>PlayStation Studios Game Deals for Prime Members</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CBNPMX7P?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sackboy: A Big Adventure (Steam)</a> -- $12.59 ($<del>60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/God-War-Standard-Online-Game/dp/B0CBNQPBCY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">God of War (Steam)</a> -- $20 ($<del>50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Tsushima-DIRECTORS-CUT-Online/dp/B0CZPM4KLZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut (Steam)</a> -- $48 ($<del>60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CBNN7BP1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart (Steam)</a> -- $27 ($<del>60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/HELLDIVERS-Standard-Online-Game-Code/dp/B0CLYZ1FCP?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Helldivers 2 (Steam)</a> -- $32 ($<del>40</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/HELLDIVERS-Standard-Online-Game-Code/dp/B0CLYZD4X2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Helldivers 2: Super Citizen Edition (Steam)</a> -- $48 ($<del>60</del>)</li></ul><p>In case you're looking for a few PlayStation Studios games to play on PC as well, Amazon has some really great deals.

            <p>One of video game's greatest pleasures is being able to shoot bits off an enemy and then append them to yourself. TankHead gets it. It's about steering a tank through a desolate sci-fi landscape, blasting similar tank and mecha enemies to bits, then scavenging them for parts using a drone.
</p>
<p>It's been in quiet development for years, but it got a big reveal during tonight's Day Of The Devs stream. It was also <em>released</em> during tonight's Day Of The Devs stream, so you can buy it from <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/tankhead-2f3b51">the Epic Games Store now</a>.

<p>"As Whitaker your goal is to fight to reach Highpoint, to do that you must traverse the ECA – an area where humans cannot survive. Whitaker must project his mind into a Needle, a robust drone capable of surviving in the harsh conditions of the ECA – and of piloting your Tank," explains the store page. "Use your Needle and Tank to combat the vehicles and creatures of the ECA to reach Highpoint."
</p><p>The tank combat is tactical in the ways you might expect if you've ever shot a tank in a video game before. Some areas of your machine are more armoured than others, so you need to try to keep those angled towards enemies to protect your vulnerable engine. Enemies, likewise, can have their outer shells chipped off, revealing the sweet weak spots within. 
</p>
<p>I'm really a fan of the production design, here. The look of the tanks, the robots, the drones, the larger boss you fight; it's all just a little unexpected, a little odd, in a way that suggests a world worth exploring. That plus <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/captain-forever">Captain Forever</a>-style your-bits-are-my-bits-now action, and I really want to try this.
</p>
<p>TankHead was the recepient of an Epic development grant, which presumably accounts for its Epic Games Store-only release at this stage. With a launch discount, it'll currently cost you £20.74.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/huke-replacing-pred-in-optic-texas-starting-roster/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/huke-replacing-pred-in-optic-texas-starting-roster-reports-claim.1058433/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/huke-replacing-pred-in-optic-texas-starting-roster/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On social media, claims have surfaced suggesting that Huke is stepping in to replace Pred in OpTic Texas’ starting roster.</p>



<p>Presently, there isn’t much information accompanying the rumoured move, and it’s yet to be confirmed by OpTic Texas, but several sources close to the change have corroborated it on socials.</p>



<p>It’s expected that the change will be temporary as Pred is reported to be ‘dealing with something’ out of the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-changes">Changes</h2>



<p>In a claim leaked first on Twitter by <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1866933336565846433" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGhostofHope</a>, it was suggested that Cuyler ‘Huke’ Garland will be slotting into the OpTic Texas starting roster in replacement of Amer ‘Pred’ Zulbeari.</p>



<p>This was then followed up <a href="https://x.com/TheFlank/status/1866943980723966192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by The Flank</a>, which posted on socials that Pred could be dealing with ‘out-of-game’ issues’. That’s also unconfirmed at present, but Seth ‘Scump’ Abner, who has been aligned with OpTic for many years and is one of the game’s most prominent legends, said Pred’s switch is down to personal reasons.</p>



<p>The flip would see Huke return to the OpTic Texas roster after a hiatus lasting a year and a half. In June 2023, the former Call of Duty world champion departed OpTic Texas and shortly after, was picked up by Seattle Surge (now Vancouver Surge).</p>



<p>Whatever the reason may be, it looks as though Huke could be filling in for Pred when OpTic Texas meets Vancouver Surge this Saturday, which is a bizarre turn of events for the pro player.</p>



<p>I’ve reached out to OpTic’s representatives for more information, if at all possible.</p>

		<p>The narrative prequel to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hyper-light-drifter">Hyper Light Drifter,</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hyper-light-breaker">Hyper Light Breaker</a> is set to launch into Steam Early Access on 14th January 2025.</p>

<p>Set decades before the acclaimed action adventure RPG, Hyper Light Breaker is making a pretty clean break(er) in terms of genre, even if it retains a lot of the visual traits of the original. This is now a 3D co-op roguelite where players will head into the Overgrowth and explore its procedurally generated worlds and challenges, looking to uncover the truth of the Crowns, the Abyss King and the eerie landscape in general.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn’t going to be the full game, with developer Heart Machine having plenty planned for the journey through Early Access. There will be new Breakers characters, Crowns bosses, gear, and more on the to-do list. They will also naturally be listening to the community feedback to help balance the experience and shape certain parts of it as it heads toward a 1.0 launch.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/10/08/hyper-light-drifter-special-edition-review/">Hyper Light Drifter – Special Edition Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Hyper Light Drifter review, Miguel wrote, <em>“Hyper Light Drifter is a jaw-dropping experience no matter the platform you play it on. What started as an engaging masterpiece in 2016 continues to be just as rewarding and worthwhile of a video game in 2018. With the Nintendo Switch you get the valuable bonus of being able to take this journey with you anywhere you want and believe me when I say this is a journey you will not want to step away from once you start it.”</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/day-of-the-devs-the-game-awards-edition-2024-everything-announced.1058388/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/day-of-the-devs-the-game-awards-edition-2024-everything-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Once again, non-profit Day of the Devs officially returned Wednesday with an indie showcase featuring nearly 20 independent games across multiple genres, platforms, studios, and styles as part of the run-up to The Game Awards. The show featured everything from a stop-motion game that’s entirely made of felt, a game where you engage in medieval warfare with modern guns, the return of an unreleased puzzle game first announced over a decade ago, and something to do with changing channels on a one-bit TV.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You should really go back and watch the whole thing, but if you’re skimming the highlights, here’s a rundown of everything we just saw at Day of the Devs:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Faraway</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The presentation opened with Faraway – a single-player, one-button, procedurally generated arcade game about drawing constellations in the night sky. Faraway has been a hot rumor for a long time, having been shown around at indie showcases all the way back in 2011 and initially billed as an iPad game. But it missed its planned release date then, and disappeared for years. Faraway is developed by Steph Thirion of Little Eyes studio, and is being published by Annapurna on PC in 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Ultimate Sheep Raccoon</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimate Sheep Raccoon is exactly what it says on the tin. A spiritual successor to Ultimate Chicken Horse from the same team, Clever Endeavor Games, it is a multiplayer competitive platformer where players build wild platforming courses and race through them with friends. This time, everyone’s on bikes. No release date yet, but it’s planned for Steam.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Sleight of Hand</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve seen Sleight of Hand, from Riffraff Games, at an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/framed-developer-unveils-occult-noir-stealth-game-sleight-of-hand-xbox-partner-preview"><u>Xbox Partner Preview</u></a> event earlier this year. In it, you play as Lady Luck, a witch detective working to take down her former coven using dark magic via a cursed deck of cards. In Day of the Devs today, we watched a sample of how a gameplay scenario might go, with Lady Luck using a drawn hand of cards to hide, lure her enemies, and ultimately trap them so she can pass by unseen. Sleight of Hand is coming to PC and Xbox at a later date.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Demon Tides</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">By studio Fabraz, Demon Tides is an open world 3D platformer that gives off “Wind Waker but hip and stylish” vibes. We got a look today at some of the platforming and the player’s ability to customize not just their character’s appearance, but also their abilities, giving them a number of different options for how to cross the same gaps. Demon Tides is planned for release in 2025 on Steam.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Kingmakers</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Developers Redemption Road, makers of, uh, Road Redemption, appeared in Day of the Devs to show off Kingmakers, a game we’re <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingmakers-combines-back-to-the-future-with-army-of-darkness-and-its-blowing-up-right-now-ign-next"><u>already pretty stoked about here at IGN</u></a>. It’s a game with a concept that’s…kind of delightful? You play as part of a team of fighters with modern weapons – guns, bombs, tanks, and so forth – who go back to medieval England to change the course of history. So you’re fighting in medieval times…but with guns. Kingmakers mixes city simulator elements with first and third-person shooter mechanics and massive, destructible environments. You can blow up anything you can see, or stage a fight on top of it, or drive a car through it. The whole thing looks kind of nuts, and you can play the entire campaign solo or with up to three friends. Kingmakers is coming to early access on Steam and the Epic Games Store next year.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Recur</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Recur is a puzzle game from developer kaleidoscube where you play as an unassuming postman who suddenly finds himself with the ability to pause, rewind, and fast forward time itself. From what we saw, it looks like you’ll be working your way through levels where the postman has to use his time powers to avoid obstacles and danger, such as collapsing platforms, a moving train, attacking dogs, or even a whole car nearly smashing into him. Recur is planned for release on Steam.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Blue Prince</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Blue Prince (Get it, like Blueprints?) looks gorgeous and mysterious, an atmospheric "architectural adventure” where you’re exploring an “ever-changing house of shifting rooms.” There seems to be some kind of mystery to solve, where you’re hunting for “Room 46” in a 45-room house, and you’re using the house’s blueprints to shape your exploration and build the structure as you go, day by day. The vibes are kind of like Edith Finch meets Mist, and the whole thing is coming out on PC in spring of 2025 from developer Dogubomb.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Incolatus: Don’t Stop, Girlypop!</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s right there in the title: don’t stop. Incolatus is a Y2K-style girly-pop movement shooter where you literally cannot stop moving. The more you move and the faster you go, the more damage you do and the more you heal yourself, so you just have to keep going. It’s a first-person arena shooter, where you’re shooting elaborate, colorful, and sometimes massive guns that blast cutesy girly hearts and stars at enemies (an evil mining corporation destroying the environment) to a boppin’ soundtrack. The guns get bigger the faster you go. More scope. More damage. More movement. Oh, and there’s a dress-up megagame where you can dress up your arms and customize your guns. Incolatus: Don’t Stop, Girlypop! is coming to Steam “soon”.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Lok Digital</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Lok Digital was born of a fascinating collaboration between a puzzle designer who made a clever physical puzzle book, and a game developer who wanted to digitize it in video game form. The result, Lok Digital, is a puzzle game where you slowly solve world puzzles in the fictional language of Lok, which you learn as you work your way through the puzzles. You start with the word “Lok”, and from there will discover other words, other puzzle rules, and the language of the little Lok creatures the game is named after. If that sounds intriguing, great news, you don’t have to wait. Lok Digital is out today on PC, and it’s coming to mobile next year.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Neon Abyss 2</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">We didn’t get a ton of info today about Neon Abyss 2, but it’s safe to say it’s a sequel to Neon Abyss from Veoowo Games. A 2D, pixelated, run-and-gun roguelike, Neon Abyss 2 looks to bring back the bright colors, flashy lasers, and bullet hell intensity of the first game for another round. It’s coming in 2025 to Steam, and looks like it will incorporate multiplayer, too.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Crescent County</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A sci-fi fantasy motorbike game, Crescent County styles itself as “roller derby but with gay witches” or “Studio Ghibli but with considerably more crop jackets”. You’re a witch, you ride a broom motorbike, and through the day you make deliveries and do other important witch tasks on your broom, earning parts that will make your broom faster, cooler, and more powerful. Then, at night, you go out for broom races. In between it all, there’s plenty of flirting and smooching, as witches do. Crescent County is still fairly early in development, but there’s an early playtest happening now on Steam and itch.io.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">PBJ - The Musical</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I briefly thought I was looking at a Marcel the Shell short when I glanced at my screen and saw this one, but maybe that was just the googly eye. PBJ - The Musical is…well, a musical, telling a romance story of a berry and a peanut, sweet and salty, and their ultimate creation of the peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Through the musical acts, you’ll be guiding these two characters through paper stop motion cut out from vintage cookbooks and retelling the story of Romeo and Juliet…in sandwich form. All the music is written by Britain’s Got Talent’s Lorraine Bowen. Sadly, no word on when or where this hungry adventure is dropping for now.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Curiosmos</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Curiosmos is a cute little space game where you slowly create a solar system, at first by bashing asteroids into one another to create a planet. Once the planet’s created, you can experiment with sunlight, terrain, water, weather, and other elements to see what happens…including whether or not life blossoms and evolves. It seems like a fairly peaceful experience…until a giant black hole starts flying at you and your planets, potentially causing a catastrophe you’ll have to try and avert before it arrives. Curiosmos doesn’t have a release date yet.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Bionic Bay</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In the platformer Bionic Bay, you’ll be thinking a lot about gravity, speed, and momentum. You’re a scientist with strange powers over time and space, allowing you to teleport, manipulate time, and flip the environment on its head. Using these abilities, you’ll flip and launch yourself across sci-fi themed environments with realistic physics. Bionic Bay is planned for release on Steam and PS5 in 2025.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">inKonbini</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-amazing-upcoming-games-that-make-xbox-playstation-and-nintendos-2024-so-much-more-interesting"><u>wrote about inKonbini earlier this year</u></a> after playing it at an Xbox showcase adjacent to the Game Developers Conference. It’s a soothing organizational game about working in a convenience store, stocking the shelves, and interacting with customers who come in and share tidbits from their lives. I found the concept appealing and the execution incredibly relaxing, especially the sound effects of bags and boxes hitting the shelves and the satisfying way everything fell neatly into place on the display. InKonbini is planned for launch on Xbox, PS5, Switch, and Steam sometime in the future.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Feltopia</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Feltopia is a stop-motion game that is entirely hand-felted. Every piece of the environment, character, enemy, everything is made by hand, out of felt, recorded, and animated. And the effect is adorable, with fuzzy unicorns, sheep, butterflies, clouds, and more all puffing up out of the world soft as can be. The game itself is a sidescrolling shmup where you ride a unicorn and shoot rainbow beams at shadowy creatures that will transform them back into their true forms. Feltopia is planned for release on Steam in 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Blippo+</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not sure what I just watched, but I guess it’s Blippo+. This looks like some sort of game around changing the channel on a one-bit TV and watching all the different, weird programs? Whatever it is, Panic (the Untitled Goose Game and Thank Goodness You’re Here) publisher, so that might convey the vibe. No idea when this is coming out, where, or how. Stay tuned for more Blippo?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Hyper Light Breaker</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve already seen a lot of Hyper Light Breaker from Heart Machine, so I won’t belabor it (you can <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hyper-light-breaker-exclusive-first-hands-on-gameplay-preview-dreaming-a-tangerine-dream"><u>read my preview from earlier this year here</u></a>), but today the team showed up at Day of the Devs to announce an early access release on Steam on January 14, 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Tankhead</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Day of the Devs closed with Tankhead from Alpha Channel. It’s a sci-fi vehicular adventure where you play as a “sleepwalker” or a person who uploads their consciousness into a machine to explore a dangerous world. Basically, you’re a literal tank (or sometimes a smaller robot) exploring a ruined world, able to travel over tough terrain, shoot stuff, and move fast when you need to. The tank’s customizable, and yes, you drive using tank controls. Tankhead, delightfully, is out today on the Epic Games Store.<br>
