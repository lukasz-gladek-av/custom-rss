The launch of the marketplace is an important step in Epic’s plans to make it easier for developers to acquire assets for developing games — and, maybe someday, to let them make content <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/5/24262376/epic-unreal-engine-6-fortnite-metaverse-plans">for an interoperable metaverse</a>.</p><div><p>The company first revealed its plans for Fab — which will combine offerings from the <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/store">Unreal Engine Marketplace</a>, <a href="https://sketchfab.com/store">Sketchfab Store</a>, <a href="https://quixel.com/">Quixel</a>, and <a href="https://www.artstation.com/marketplace/game-dev">ArtStation Marketplace</a> into one place — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/22/23645601/epic-games-fab-asset-marketplace-state-of-unreal-2023-gdc">in March 2023</a>. While Epic initially planned to launch Fab in 2023, the company <a href="https://sketchfab.com/blogs/community/announcing-fab-the-next-phase-for-sketchfab/">later delayed</a> the launch to 2024.</p></div><p>Epic is offering an 88 percent revenue share for goods sold on Fab, matching the revenue share it offers developers on the Epic Games Store. Ahead of the launch, Epic has allowed creators to prepare their <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/fab-content-marketplace-launches-in-october-publishing-portal-opens-today">Unreal Engine Marketplace</a> and <a href="https://sketchfab.com/blogs/community/fab-publishing-portal-open-for-sketchfab-migration/">Sketchfab</a> products to be available on Fab. (According to Epic, ArtStation Marketplace will “continue operating as it does today,” but the company plans to let ArtStation users bring over their content to Fab in 2025.)</p><p>Epic is also sharing some plans about updates to come for Fab. Perhaps most notable is that the company is reiterating that it plans to add support for offering Roblox and <em>Minecraft</em> assets. Epic also plans to let people access <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/20/24106494/fortnite-unreal-editor-uefn-metahumans-fps">its hyperrealistic MetaHumans</a> on Fab.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Debuting today, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alan-wake-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-547391">Alan Wake 2</a>'s second and final expansion, The Lake House, arrives almost exactly one year after the base game arrived. After waiting 13 years for the sequel, it feels too soon to already say goodbye to this chapter of the Alan Wake saga. Thankfully, in the wide, weird world of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-alan-wake-2-reveals-about-the-remedy-connected-universe/2900-4952/" data-ref-id="2900-4952">Remedy Connected Universe</a>, The Lake House isn't so much a conclusion as it is a continuation. Just as the studio used Control's second expansion to build the runway for Alan Wake 2, The Lake House feels like an exciting lead-in to Control's announced sequel, and perhaps even to its multiplayer spin-off, FBC: Firebreak.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who already played the base game, The Lake House fully explores a mystery only hinted at previously. A Federal Bureau of Control (FBC) outpost, The Lake House, has gone dark, and Agent Kieran Estevez, introduced during the main story, is the responding agent and thus a playable character for the first time. For those who finished Control's second expansion, AWE, the events of The Lake House were hinted at in the final scene of the DLC, when Jesse Faden notices a distress signal that an altered world event is set to occur in Bright Falls.</p><p dir="ltr">As Estevez, players will get a new perspective on the high strangeness of Remedy's quilted story world. She's no rookie, and where others may cower at the sight of paranatural monsters oozing out of the walls of The Lake House, Estevez is just upset it will lead to more paperwork. As Control players know, even the FBC isn't safe from bureaucratic red tape.</p><p dir="ltr">"[In Control], we do obviously interact with a lot of other people inside the bureau, but it's in the context of the events that are taking place inside The Oldest House," game director Kyle Rowley told me during a recent roundtable interview. "Whereas here we're kind of coming from a slightly different outside perspective. And we were interested in exploring, like, 'What is the FBC like outside of that headquarters? How does the FBC operate as an agency throughout the United States?'"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4387177-1%281%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4387177" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4387177-1%281%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4387177"></a><figcaption>Agent Estevez is calmer in the face of danger than some others, given how much she's seen during her time with the FBC.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4387177-1%281%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">That point of view is how The Lake House manages to pull a trick Remedy is getting better at and more familiar with year over year: expanding its connected universe and setting up dominoes to fall in the form of future stories, without alienating players who may be taking it all in more casually or playing these connected games out of order. "We wanted to make sure that the story that we write is self-contained enough and is interesting enough and has its own character arcs," Rowley told me, "that it's not something that you need to have played Control to enjoy."</p><p dir="ltr">Still, he says, the team has gone to greater lengths than before to tie the storylines of Alan Wake and Control together, which is interesting when you consider Control's second expansion was effectively an Alan Wake 2 prologue. Now, the inverse appears true.</p><p dir="ltr">"[We] have a lot of narrative objects, including emails between different FBC staff, or like, research documents that are lying around, that if you're someone who's really into the lore, that's there for you to explore [...] I think that's kind of like how we've always approached it. On the surface level, it's accessible for everybody. The deeper you go and explore the world, the more rewarding it can become, especially if you're heavily invested in our previous games."</p><p dir="ltr">Rowley suggested the team is still learning how to weave this narrative web on a logistical level, with disparate teams on each franchise and everyone's schedules being routinely overstuffed. However, it's made possible due to how the studio's internal Alan Wake and Control franchise teams work together.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's very, very much a collaboration between the two teams, because we are kind of like two separate teams inside Remedy, but, you know, we're inside the same studio. We're inside the same building, so it's very easy for us to just set up meetings and have discussions about stuff," he said. The Control team has a certain aesthetic this expansion needed to honor, Rowley told me, noting that it's "not just visual, but also audible." That led to the teams trading notes and ideas so that The Lake House could feel like the Alan Wake 2 expansion it first and foremost is while also building out another Remedy storyline that's yet to have its first true follow-up and is managed internally by an almost entirely different group of creators.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4387178-1%284%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4387178" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4387178-1%284%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4387178"></a><figcaption>The Lake House shares The Oldest House's brutalist architecture, but Rowley told me it will prove to be more than just a smaller, satellite version of Control's setting.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4387178-1%284%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">As for what else the Remedy Connected Universe has in store, Rowley hinted at the team's approach, and how lore deep-divers may or may not be able to connect dots they'll find in The Lake House. "Right now, our key franchises within [the Remedy Connected Universe] are the Control franchise and the Wake franchise. That's where a lot of our efforts are. But it doesn't mean, necessarily, that every single piece of content that we put inside either game is specifically tailored to a specific franchise. It's more just to expand the world that we're trying to build as a whole."</p><p dir="ltr">The Lake House is also a return to the base game's survival-horror tone and mechanics after June's Night Springs expansion tried on a few different genres through several shorter episodic missions, such as sci-fi and an oddly cute, pastel-tinted massacre akin to Ti West's Pearl. Rowley said he's glad not to have gone from the base game straight into developing The Lake House as it could've been desensitizing to flesh out all of the game's darker, scarier elements in a row. The Night Springs expansion was the "palette cleanser," he said. Now, just before Halloween, the game will return to its roots with a more methodically paced, tenser story. And just as that story will fill in some gaps for Alan Wake 2, it will also newly ask and answer some of its own questions, like the nature of its new Annihilation-inspired enemies, the Painted.</p><p dir="ltr">In all likelihood, it will ask many more questions Remedy has no intentions to resolve today--if ever. For Remedy, telling one larger, interconnected story is a long process that demands patience from the obsessive fanbase and the folks within the studio alike. Unlike the Marvel saga, which often releases a handful of entwined shows and movies annually, games of Remedy's size and scale arrive much less frequently. Rowley said he's been working on Alan Wake 2 for just shy of six years, and finishing the base game was a short-lived reprieve as he was then thrust into creating the game's expansions.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4387179-1%283%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4387179" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4387179-1%283%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4387179"></a><figcaption>The Painted are the new enemies introduced in The Lake House, but Estevez will encounter more familiar monsters, too, like the Taken shown here.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4387179-1%283%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Now, with Alan Wake 2's final chapter here, he's ready to consider it the closing of one storybook for him, too. "I'm going to take a bit of a holiday, I think [...] It's going to be bittersweet in the sense that I've really enjoyed working with the team, and really enjoyed working with Sam [Lake]. It's good to put a pin in it, and then start thinking about other things."</p><p dir="ltr">For players who haven't played any of Alan Wake 2 but may soon, especially now that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alan-wake-2-physical-edition-preorders-are-live-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-x/1100-6524001/">physical Deluxe Edition</a> is on the way, The Lake House will merge right into the base game just like the previous expansion, essentially fleshing out the campaign into one longer, more varied saga, while those who just want to jump into The Lake House after having finished the base game can play it that way instead. It's available now as part of the Alan Wake 2 Deluxe Edition, or can be purchased via the Deluxe Edition upgrade for those looking to expand the base game they already own.</p>

                <p>Square Enix is entering the console gaming space, but not in the way that you were expecting.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-season-looks-to-bring-back-sharks-and-midas<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> has begun teasing its next highly-anticipated throwback season, which this year will focus on the game's Chapter 2 era. 
</p>
<p>
Promotional items highlighting Chapter 2 Remix, as it'll be known, have begun landing with content creators (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1848547548044177771">Shiina</a>) - and from these, we can learn a little of what will be on offer.
</p>
<p>
Chapter 2 was, as you'd expect, the era featuring Fortnite's second map. Over eight seasons, the game experienced some of its strongest creative riffs and narrative moments to date, as it introduced a fan-favourite group of spies, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-the-device-live-event-analysed-as-epic-sets-up-fortnites-longterm-future">flooded its map</a>, had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-showstopping-marvel-finale-drops-a-huge-cliffhanger">its first Marvel-focused season</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-fortnites-new-season-nears-the-ufo-abductions-have-begun">got invaded by aliens</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-fans-think-its-major-new-character-is-secretly-being-played-by-the-rock">introduced The Rock as a key character in Fortnite lore</a>.
</p>
<p>
At least some of all that will be reprised in Chapter 2 Remix, which looks to feature a return of spy boss Midas, his buff cat lieutenant Meowscles and the rest of their gang.
</p>
<p>
Pin badges highlighting Chapter 2 Remix offerings include a new remix of Midas/Meowscles, plus Slurp commando Rippley and TNTina. Loot sharks (which you could battle, or ride on top of with a fishing rod), Boogie Bombs and a building from Misty Meadows are also featured.

<p>
The expectation among Fortnite fans (fuelled by a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/billie-eilish-coming-to-fortnite-adding-weight-to-a-much-discussed-leak">comprehensive development roadmap leak earlier this year</a>) is that Chapter 2 Remix will focus on the first half of the chapter. It's expected that the return to Chapter 2 will first be established, before the emergence of Midas and crew in a new map update, before his antics cause the map to flood. How and why exactly we'll be returning to Chapter 2, though, remains to be seen. 
</p>
<p>
Epic Games of course is keen to capitalise on the enormous popularity of Fortnite's original OG season late last year, which took players back to the game's very first map for a month. That return was part of a well-choreographed set of events that led to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-the-big-bang-event-was-a-blast-of-marketing-for-the-games-multi-genre-future">Fortnite launching several new modes</a>, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a>, and ultimately landing on its current, fifth main battle royale Island. What could be coming this time?
</p>
<p>
It's expected that Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix will kick off at the end of the game's current, Halloween-infused Marvel season at the beginning of November.

            <p>Nintendo Switch Online members will soon be able to get their hands on three full games, as part of a free trial.</p>
<p>The games in question are spin-off <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/minecraft-dungeons">Minecraft Dungeons</a>, cosy puzzler A Little to the Left and Cursed to Golf, which plops you down on the dungeon-like holes of Golf Purgatory (of course).</p>

<p>On its initial release, we called Minecraft Dungeons "by far the most promising Minecraft spin-off released to date".</p>
<p>"While Minecraft Dungeons might sound an unlikely concept - a more accessible Diablo with Creepers - it ends up feeling a natural extension of the formula," our Tom wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-dungeons-review-a-diablo-like-thats-just-deep-enough">Eurogamer's Minecraft Dungeons review</a> from 2020. You can check out the video team having a little galavant about in it above.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-little-to-the-left-review">A Little to the Left review</a>, meanwhile, complimented the game's "slick puzzle design". However, overall it was felt the game was at "odds with the creativity of organising" the developer hoped to evoke.</p>

<p>Last but not least, we have Cursed to Golf. Donlan gave the game's demo a whirl a couple of years ago, and was quite taken with it.</p>
<p>"This is a clever game, I reckon. A spin on a platformer that feels nothing like a platformer. It turns out that purgatory golf holes are tough. They zig-zag up and down, so the fairway you want to land on with your first shot might be below you. Or it might be blocked off by TNT. Or a fan might push the ball out of the way," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cursed-to-golf-is-golf-in-purgatory">Eurogamer's Cursed to Gold feature</a>.</p>

			<p>Neva wants to make you cry, and not in a cute Romcom kind of way. No, I’m talking full on blubbering and wailing here, the kind of sobbing ringing out at the end of screenings of Titanic back in 1997. So intent is the game on making you cry that it comes across as desperate, like one of the lesser Pixar movies. Too many cutscenes are weighed down by a desire to be emotionally charged, whilst numerous set pieces are leaden with clumsy and clunky emotional beats; it’s all a bit cringe-worthy, to be honest. But put aside the attempted tear-jerking, and&nbsp;what remains is an enjoyable action-adventure puzzle game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Neva | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TwolC-YT2Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Evil sentient pollution stuff is trying to corrupt the world, so it’s up to our hero Alba and her trusty mystical wolf-hound Neva to save the day. That’s basically the plot but do prepare yourself for lots of navel-gazing, pontificating, and shrill cries of ‘NEVA!!!’ along the way.</p>


<p>Played from a 2D perspective, Neva is gorgeous to behold. Slick, smooth animation, alongside a strong sense of awe-inspiring scale, brought back fond memories of Ico during my playthrough. The use of colours, of light, of depth, alongside jaw-dropping cinematography and innovative visuals, have resulted in one of the most beautiful video games I’ve ever played. From serene forests to misty mountain tops, Neva is a sumptuous visually experience. It isn’t all about the heavenly vistas, though, relishing in getting creepy and grotesque. Stand out moments involve Neva clambering over a vast nightmarish structure made out of carcasses, or plunging into the deep dark depths of hell itself. No matter the scenery, it’s eye-poppingly pretty.</p>


<p>Unfortunately, on occasion, Nomada Studios forgets that you do need to be able to see what’s going on when you play a video game. So intent are they to pull back the camera to give you a sense of scale that you can often hardly see Alba – pretty problematic during particularly tricky platforming sections. There are also many moments when the studio floods the screen with resplendent rays of gorgeous lighting, but you can’t actually see the precarious platforms you are meant to be landing on. So, it looks great, but plays poorly during these pretty yet anger-provoking moments, a shame when the platforming is so rock-solid and enjoyable elsewhere.</p>
<p>The game also really pushes its luck with the number of times it requires you to run from left to right whilst a grand-sum of absolutely nothing happens. The dreary duration of these walkathon sections makes one think that they are only there to pad out the rather brief three-hour runtime.</p>

<p>Still, when Neva does get stuck into some actual gameplay, it’s great. Platforming – other than the aforementioned ‘not-being-able-to-see-what’s-going-on’ sections – is terrific, with tight and responsive controls. Combat is simple, yet chunky and satisfying. Boss battles are innovative and never outstay their welcome. The puzzles are undoubtedly the highlight, offering some surreal brain-benders that are fresh and unique to solve.</p>
<p>It’s just a shame that everything feels so fleeting. Take the puzzles, they are brilliant but underexplored – an interesting new approach is revealed that the game then promptly forgets about and moves on from. Sure, it leaves you wanting more, but in a “why did I only eat starters for dinner?” kind of way.</p>
<p>This applies to the entirety of the game, it’s fun and expertly crafted but over far too soon. With more killer and less running left to right filler, this could have been a classic. As it is, it’s only good enough. Now that really is something to cry about.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dave-the-diver">Dave The Diver</a> is getting a story DLC and, possibly, more games set in the same universe. This comes from an interview with developer Mintrocket's new CEO Jaeho Hwang, who <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dave-the-divers-creator-wants-to-create-a-dave-cinematic-universe-of-games">spoke to VGC</a> at Gamescom Asia about their plans to expand Dave and his diving. A future Dave may not even dive, but like, connive. Keep a beehive alive. Jive. Collect tithe.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Hwang says that "besides the story DLC" that they're working on "right now", they also "want to make separate games about each character to show how they met, what they did before coming to the Blue Hole". On this note, Hwang goes on to mention that they'd explore Dave in different genres and settings, perhaps giving him a backstory and profession.</p>
<p>It seems like Hwang's taken by Cobra, DTD's retired arms dealer who was from a previous project of his, "Evil Factory". He says he'd love to tell Cobra's type of story in other games. Honestly, I think the idea of a DTD sequel being a prequel, or starring an entirely new character sounds like a much better idea than slapping a "2" on its end. I'd want to see the resource management, mini-game hybrid applied to a different activity. Dave being some tornado chaser who gathers scrap to make his car more resistant to storms. Maybe the backstory of Bancho the sushi chef, as we chart his success through culinary school.</p>

</figure>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Hwang mentions that he'd like to keep Mintrocket a small outfit despite DTD's immense success. The reason being that it's easier to communicate if you're not some enormous team of hundreds of developers with a frightening amount of hierarchical systems in place.</p><p>I gave DTD a go when it first popped off a while back, but I never <em>quite</em> got the bug for it. I liked its variety and I liked the rhythm of gathering stuff, then using that stuff to serve sushi and make money. I just needed a little more from it? To the point where I just stopped playing and never went back. I'm afraid I can't pinpoint what that "little more" is right now, but if you had a similar experience, maybe you can articulate it better than I can in the comments below.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> has issued an apology for preventing new account sign-ups from Israel and Palestine due to the ongoing conflict.</p>
<p>When creating an account, users can select a verification method via email or phone. However, in a statement shared on X/Twitter, the streaming platform explained sign-ups with email verification were temporarily disabled following the attacks on 7th October 2023 to "prevent uploads of graphic material related to the attack and to protect the safety of users".</p>
<p>However, until recently, this verification had not been re-enabled.</p>

<p>The statement continued: "Signups were not disabled, and we continued to see sign ups from both regions. Users could choose to sign up with phone verification. We've learned that, inadvertently, we did not re-enable email verification sign ups for either region.</p>
<p>"We deeply regret this unacceptable miss, and the confusion it has caused. We've fixed the issue, meaning all affected users can sign up with email verification."</p>
<p>This all may have simply been an honest mistake from Twitch to re-enable verification in a timely manner, and indeed Twitch has been working towards greater transparency with its community for some time.</p>
<p>However, users have responded to the statement suggesting phone verification was also blocked and not just email verification, somewhat undermining the sentiment. Eurogamer has contacted Twitch for further comment.</p>
<p>Twitch's protective measures here are perhaps unsurprising. A shooting at a Mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019 was livestreamed on Facebook; later the same year, a shooting outside a synagogue in Germany was streamed on Twitch.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Twitch's policies have come under fire following racist and anti-semitic comments from high profile streamer Asmongold. While he was rightly banned from the platform for breaking its terms of use, some have called the consistency of Twitch's policies into question.</p><p>"We've also heard concerns about whether our Community Guidelines apply to all content on our service," Twitch's statement continued. "We continue to enforce our rules as consistently as possible, and are actively reviewing content and taking enforcement action where needed."</p>

            <p><strong>UPDATE 12.58am:</strong> Pearl Abyss has replied to Eurogamer's request for comment regarding PlayStation's reported publishing offer. </p>
<p>"In our last quarter earnings call, which is publicly available, we revealed that we would publish Crimson Desert independently. We of course honour and appreciate our business partners who we are constantly in touch with about our progress and plans, and we are discussing various forms of collaboration with them," the developer told us.</p>
<p>"Additionally, we have not announced any release date yet, so any articles about the topic are only speculation at this point. We look forward to showcasing a playable Crimson Desert build to media this week in Paris and to the public at G-Star in November."</p>
<p>The original story continues below. </p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL 11.54am:</strong> Sony reportedly tried to lock Crimson Desert developer Pearl Abyss into a timed PlayStation exclusivity deal.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/pearl-abyss-offered-an-exclusive-deal-by-sie-for-crimson-desert-but-refused-plans-to-release-dokev-1-5-years-after-cd-expects-cd-ltd-sales-at-3-4m.1014846/">translation</a> of <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/vlvk1703/223609533714">the developer's investor relations</a>, Pearl Abyss was approached by Sony, with the PlayStation maker hoping to act as publisher for the studio's upcoming open world action-adventure.</p>
<p>Should Pearl Abyss have taken Sony up on its offer, Crimson Desert would have remained a PlayStation exclusive for one year, "with no release on Xbox". PC distribution rights would also have belonged to Sony.</p>

<p>The developer, which is best known for MMORPG Black Desert Online as well as its upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pearl-abyss-delays-creature-collecting-game-dokev">creature collector DokeV</a>, said this offer from Sony was "appealing" due to the company's marketing power and other incentives. However, Pearl Abyss ultimately decided to decline Sony's offer and move forward with self publishing (something it is said to be "99 percent certain" it will do).</p><p>The translated report notes that fellow Korea-based developer Shift Up entered an exclusivity agreement with Sony for its own release, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a>. However, Pearl Abyss said this was a different situation, as Shift Up did not have a publishing team in place.</p>
<p>"In a typical contract, 30 percent of revenue goes to platform fees, and the remaining 70 percent is split between the developer and publisher," reads the translation. "Since we already have the capability to self-publish globally and have overseas branches, we concluded that using our own resources would be more advantageous."</p>
<p>As for DokeV, Pearl Abyss said it expects the delayed project - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pearl-abyss-delays-creature-collecting-game-dokev">once set to arrive in 2023</a> - will arrive now around 18 months after Crimson Desert's launch.</p>
<p>Pearl Abyss' comments come following reports PlayStation also entered into an exclusivity deal for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, which caused <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confusion-over-black-myth-wukongs-missing-xbox-release-follows-claims-of-playstation-exclusivity">confusion around its forthcoming Xbox release</a>.</p>

<p>Cronos: The New Dawn was revealed with a cinematic trailer shown during last week's<a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-is-bloober-teams-next-survival-horror-game/"> Xbox Partner Preview showcase</a>. At the end of the trailer, gameplay was also shown, which looked more like a traditional survival horror game than the narrative-driven game that Bloober Team released until the Silent Hill 2 remake, which is generally considered one of the studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">finest works.</a></p>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/caves-of-qud">Caves Of Qud</a> developer has posted a cryptic riddle that sounds a bit like a release date in disguise. A <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/333640/announcements/detail/4542535021346976835?">post on the game's Steam page</a> yesterday reads: "{n} purple wardens beseech the Chair, What is death, if one rose is fair? How long from beetle moon to beetle moon?" That means absolutely nothing to me. But at least one fan in the comments knows their lore enough to have translated it, resulting in a specific date later this year. If their solution is correct, this could be a characteristically cryptic way for developer Freehold Games to announce the date for the roguelike's 1.0 release. So, let's double check those numbers.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The date the riddle comes out as is 12/5/24. That's December! Just in time to shove Caves Of Qud into the Christmas stocking of some rogue you like. But as I say, I didn't figure this out myself.</p>
<p>"'n' purple wardens beseeching the chair are the twelve from the Quetzal caucus, right?" says <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/333640/eventcomments/4702413158525014387?snr=2_groupannouncements_detail_&amp;ctp=2#c4702413332606375600">player 'pileofoats'.</a> "The second comes from the vintner's dialogue: one is fair, FIVE is death. And 900 game ticks/18 hours between beetle moons... so 12/5/18? 12/5/900? </p>
<p>"Or maybe from one beetle moon to another, is another whole day, so 24 hours? Meaning that release date is December 5th, 2024. That makes the most sense to me."</p>
<p>Sure enough, in the lore there is a set of twelve wardens who make a resolution to <a href="https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Council_at_Gamma_Rock">the Chair of a grand council</a>. Likewise, the vintner is a character who <a href="https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Vintner">does indeed talk about roses</a>, saying: "Try some rose wine? One rose is fair, but as you may know from hanging around the Stiltgrounds, five is death." </p><p>As for the time between "beetle moons", this is where things become less clear. Caves Of Qud's world has <a href="https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Calendar">its own fantastical calendar</a>, which describes a "beetle moon" waxing and waning every night. The commenter above has calculated there are 18 hours between the first appearance of these moons (or 900 game ticks). But there are 24 hours between these moons at their <em>zenith</em> (1200 games ticks). </p>
<p>Also, like that commenter notes, the numbers 12/5/24 just make more sense than 12/5/18. Publishers Kitfox Games previously said <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sci-fantasy-roguelike-caves-of-qud-is-getting-a-full-release-in-2024-after-15-years-of-development">the full release would be some time in 2024</a>. The Steam page also says the full release is "nearly complete". We were told that the most recent update <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/caves-of-quds-final-update-before-10-adds-new-ui-and-mouse-and-gamepad-support">would be the last</a> before a 1.0 release. In other words, it all checks out.</p>
<p>Caves Of Qud has been in early access since 2015, and it's one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">our best roguelikes</a>, having a depth you might expect from a game 15 years in the making. The full release is going to add some extra stuff, say the devs, including a "new, fully graphical UI" and "the last leg of the main quest". </p>
<p>But it's pretty damn solid already. The game is set in a far future wasteland, in which busted technology has become almost indistinguishable from magic. You can travel across a vast map in a mercifully short time, meaning that a huge world is open for exploration pretty much right away. If you visit a graveyard, you'll find it filled with people who "made too many mocking sounds at an ogre ape". You have been warned.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> released a rather chunky patch for its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> yesterday, however in the process it appears the studio also introduced a progress breaking bug.</p>
<p>Over on the Silent Hill reddit feed, dozens of users report that the patch has broken the game's Labyrinth section. This is an area in the Silent Hill 2 Remake's latter half that involves manipulating a large cube to open new pathways. Now, however, it seems some pathways are not unlocking as intended.</p>
<p>"The cube puzzle is not updating after completing a zone," one PS5 user wrote, with another replying: "I'm stuck here."</p>

<p>"Literally saved and quit last night after finishing the first Path, to wake up to an update that might've broke it. I'm a PC-player so just know Steam's version got broke too! Waiting to see if they release a super quick hotfix soon," reads one post on the reddit thread.</p>
<p>Another Silent Hill 2 Remake player on PS5 (with a physical copy of the game) did manage to find a fix that worked for them, and shared the steps they followed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have a save file at a point before you jumped through the hole.</li>
<li>Delete the game and turn off internet connection</li>
<li>Copy/install the game</li>
<li>Load the save I mentioned in 1</li>
</ol>
<p>This user left a further two notes to go with their post. First, they said they "haven't actually tried loading a save file after you jumped through the hole in the ground so it may work, but I cannot say for certain", and second, they suggested digital users perhaps "try downloading the game and cancelling the queued download for the update".</p>
<p>The Silent Hill 2 Remake team has said an official fix is on the way. Writing on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2124490/announcements/detail/4538031421720444975?snr=2___">Steam</a>, Bloober confirmed this will be released "as soon as possible".</p>
<p>"Currently, we would like to propose a temporary workaround which is using an earlier save, before entering the Labyrinth," it wrote.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/22/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-doesnt-have-a-platinum-trophy/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launching later this week, preloads for what is sure to be one of the biggest games of the year are now live, and this has revealed that there’s no <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a> platinum trophy on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>.</p>
<p>There’s a list of 44 trophies for Black Ops 6 on PS5, but they top out with a handful of gold trophies instead of a platinum that you would typically expect for any new game. Bizarrely, there is a platinum trophy for the game on PS4, per <a href="https://www.exophase.com/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-psn/trophies/">Exophase</a>.</p>


<p>Black Ops 6 preloads are available through the unified Call of Duty game app that launched with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/modern-warfare-ii">Modern Warfare 2</a> in 2022 – AKA COD HQ – providing one client that brings together MW2, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii">MW3</a>, Black Ops 6 and Warzone and does what it can to keep game install sizes in check through sharing common assets.</p>
<p>This also means that MW2, MW3 and Black Ops 6 trophy lists are brought together. Of the three, only Modern Warfare 2 has a platinum trophy with MW3 and Black Ops 6 missing out.</p>
<p>You might think this is a deliberate tactic to get under the skin of PlayStation gamers by Activision Blizzard’s new owners at Microsoft, but it’s almost certainly nothing to do with that. Black Ops 6 presents itself within Sony’s system as an expansion to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, so it cannot have a platinum trophy, just like Destiny 2 only ever had one platinum despite numerous big yearly expansions. Then again, that doesn’t explain why Black Ops 6 can have a platinum on PS4…</p>

<p>This won’t stop millions of people playing the game, but it will be a sour note for trophy obsessives. Thankfully the trophy list doesn’t look that bad, with goals to complete the campaign on Veteran difficulty, some mission specific objectives, and a pretty typical smattering of multiplayer trophies, building up to getting Prestige for the first time.</p>
<p>One oddity is needing to eat a fish in Zombies. Look forward to figuring out what that’s about!</p>
<p>Black Ops 6 leans into all of the usual tropes and expectations of Black Ops series, with double crossing subterfuge and more through the campaign, set in the 1990s after the end of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/17/cod-black-ops-cold-war-review-ps5-xbox-series-x/">Cold War</a>. George HW Bush is President, and there’s lies and more swirling around that you’ll dip your toes into. The campaign is sure to be another rollicking ride of gunfire and explosions, and that will absolutely carry on over to the full multiplayer game, as well as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/08/see-the-black-ops-6-zombies-gameplay-reveal-and-its-definitely-round-based/">the round-base zombies mode</a>.</p>

		<p>Naughty Dog has released a patch for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered">The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</a>, fixing a few bugs, but most importantly adding support for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>.</p>
<p>We’re going to see a lot of PS5 Pro updates coming out in the next couple of weeks, and Naughty Dog are amongst the first to add native support to their game. In this case, they’ve added a new rendering mode that aims to take advantage PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution with a new “Pro” mode. This will render the game at 1440p, upscaled to 4K, while also maintaining a target of 60fps. The intention, as revealed during the PS5 Pro’s announcement is to give Fidelity mode visuals at Performance mode performance, with PSSR adding a little soupçon on top.</p>


<p>Performance and Fidelity rendering modes will both still be available, with the higher power of the PS5 Pro simply buffing their performance metrics.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there’s a fix for PS4 save imports not popping all the trophies, some stat tracking fixes for the No Return roguelike mode, and</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-will-feature-sylens-recast-following-lance-reddicks-untimely-death/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-horizon-adventures-will-feature-sylens-recast-following-lance-reddick%E2%80%99s-untimely-death.1015878/</guid>

			<p>Guerrilla Games has confirmed that they are recasting the character Sylens, starting with LEGO Horizon Adventures. Sylens was played by actor Lance Reddick, who unfortunately <a href="https://wccftech.com/lance-reddick-passes-away-60/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">met an untimely death at 60 years old in March 2023</a>. Reddick, who was also known to gamers for Destiny's Commander Zavala and for Quantum Break's Martin Hatch, was last featured in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/horizon-forbidden-west-bigger-and-better-in-every-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horizon Forbidden West</a>. Those who completed the storyline already know his character Sylens was positioned to be instrumental in future installments, making this recast less than surprising.</p>
<p><a href="https://nordic.ign.com/lego-horizon-adventures/88300/news/lego-horizon-adventures-recasts-lance-reddicks-character-sylens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to IGN</a>, Guerrilla's World Art Supervisor Lucas Bolt said:</p>
<p><em>Lance Reddick tragically passed away in 2023, and he is deeply missed within Guerrilla and our community. He wonderfully portrayed the essential character of Sylens in Horizon Zero Dawn and Forbidden West. The character of Sylens does appear in LEGO Horizon Adventures, and we will introduce the new actor at a later date. Hearing the voices of other original actors, including Ashly Burch as Aloy, JB Blanc as Rost, John Macmillan as Varl and John Hopkins as Erend, has really brought back the tone of comradery found in the original game</em></p>
<p>LEGO Horizon Adventures will retell the first franchise entry, Horizon Zero Dawn. Guerrilla previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-will-feel-lighthearted-while-keeping-the-characters-as-they-are/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> that the goal is to keep the core of every character while switching to a more lighthearted tone due to the different target audience. Narrative Director James Windeler explained:</p>
<p><em>It has still got to feel like Horizon. We have definitely bent the rules a lot. But the characters remain core to who they are. I think we've found a really good balance with it. We have a lot of help. Ashley Burch is back as the voice of Aloy, and JB Blanc (as Rost). And you would have heard the exuberance to their performances. It is different to what the other games are, but they're still recognisable. They're part of it and they bought into it, and that's been a huge boon to us.</em></p>
<p>LEGO Horizon Adventures is out <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-reportedly-launching-on-november-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November 14</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch. It features two-player coop, a first for the franchise ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-online-co-op-game-nearly-confirmed-by-job-openings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned cooperative multiplayer game</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-review.1015872/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>For most of us, the biggest penalty for making too much noise might be a scolding shush from the movie theater seat behind you, but in A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead you’re only ever one creaky floorboard away from getting snuffed out by an alien threat that’s always listening out for you like it’s the most sinister form of Siri. This instant fail stealth-heavy horror story does a pretty convincing job of recreating the breath-holding tension of the films, in addition to borrowing heavily from the likes of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/alien-isolation">Alien: Isolation</a> in the way it casts you as the reluctant rodent trapped in a deadly game of cat and mouse. The result is a consistently stressful undertaking from start to finish, even though my careful creep down The Road Ahead moved at a relentlessly glacial pace and occasionally snagged on some slightly curious design decisions.       </p><p>A standalone story mostly set around four months after the alien invasion seen in <a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/a-quiet-place-day-one">A Quiet Place: Day One</a>, The Road Ahead casts us as college student Alex Taylor and follows her attempts to flee her abandoned hospital hideout in order to make a silent and steady pilgrimage towards an off-shore safe haven isolated from the threat of the monsters, known as Death Angels. It’s a straightforward setup, but tender early moments spent with her likable boyfriend Martin and kindhearted father Kenneth were enough to get me invested in Alex’s cause before inevitable alien-inflicted tragedy spurs her escape plan into action. It’s a bit of a letdown that, in spite of its strong start, the payoff for The Road Ahead’s plot in its dying hours is all too predictable, and its overall story comes up noticeably lacking in impact – particularly in the wake of the far more emotionally resonant tale found in <a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/a-quiet-place-day-one">Day One</a> earlier this year. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead Review Screens</h3></div></output><p>Still, there’s no shortage of affecting human artifacts to comb through along the way. Outside of the story’s opening chapters and the odd flashback, Alex is alone with her own thoughts – which are appropriately represented via onscreen text since any spoken sentence is only ever followed by a death sentence – for most of The Road Ahead. In lieu of any interactions with other survivors, I got a strong sense of the history of each space I shuffle-stepped through by observing the heartbreaking family portraits handcrafted in a child’s crayon tacked to the wall of a deserted safehouse, or the hilarious note about a toilet paper-related riot left by a store owner in a seaside shopping strip. There are plenty of great worldbuilding touches like this in The Road Ahead, and I had ample opportunity to study every little detail since I moved through it in a constant state of slow-motion, desperately trying to keep my every movement on mute.</p><h2>Creeping with the Enemy</h2><p>It might be a first-person adventure almost completely devoid of combat, but The Road Ahead is no “walking simulator;” it's a <em>balking </em>simulator. Every step you take or action you perform is a reluctant one, because even the lightest door hinge-squeak or stomped-on gravel crunch can alert an alien hunter to your whereabouts and end your slow-walk to safety in an instant. Thus, most of my progress through Alex’s adventure through empty houses, camping grounds, and trainyards was made with micro movements to my controller’s thumbstick; tip-toeing through rooms at a snail’s pace and incrementally tilting forward to push doors open or carefully pulling back to slowly open desk drawers to search through. It felt a bit like coming home late from a night out and trying to find your way to bed without waking your significant other, only in this instance your significant other is a spindly-limbed extraterrestrial who wants to rip your insides out rather than simply ask you to sleep on the couch.</p><p>Almost every environment you explore in The Road Ahead is purpose-built to test your coordination and fine-motor skills. Rooms are cramped and cluttered with beast-stirring booby traps to avoid and – if you’re not careful – simply brushing past hollow barrels or pulling open the cover of an air vent too eagerly can bring your swift undoing. Thankfully, Alex is given a homemade phonometer early on which, when carried in her left hand, indicates the decibel level produced by her movements relative to the overall volume of the ambient sounds around her. I basically spent the entire seven-hour journey anxiously trying to prevent its meter from lighting up as a result of each steady-handed interaction I performed, not unlike trying to extract the wishbone in a game of Operation without suddenly triggering the patient’s buzzer and blinking red nose.  </p><p>Some of the ways The Road Ahead conjures up a life-ending crunch or clang do feel a little contrived, though. It makes total sense for there to be shards of broken glass lining the paths beside the shattered windows of an upturned train carriage, but the number of discarded paint cans to be found on remote forest hiking trails does seem a touch too improbable, like rolling out from under the Simpsons’ family car and finding yourself in a carpark that’s inexplicably full of garden rakes to step on. I managed to suspend my disbelief and just abide by the noise-making obstacle course that the developers have created, but I do wish they’d been able to disguise their monster-rousing trip-ups a little more organically. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The threats to blowing Alex’s cover aren’t only found in the world around her, though; they’re also within. Alex is an asthmatic, so actions of overexertion – like pulling herself up onto ledges or carrying heavy planks to use as makeshift bridges, as well as moments of heightened stress such as finding herself in close proximity to one of the alien stalkers – can push her into a state of noisy hyperventilation, which acts as a heavy-breathing beacon to any monsters in the area. This brings the welcome challenge of identifying when to best use the inhalers that can be collected along the way, even if it does seem a little silly that they’re single-use only, as though their previous owners huffed each of them right up to the limit.   </p><h2>Quiet Riot</h2><p>The Road Ahead isn’t only about stalking around in silence like some sort of survival-horror street mime, and along with the phonometer you are provided with some other basic tools to keep the keen-eared killers at bay. Bricks and bottles can be picked up and lobbed to temporarily distract them in fairly standard stealth-game style, while some other items serve dual purposes, like the hand flares that can be sparked to either light up darker environments or tossed away to confuse your petal-faced pursuers with their crackling hiss. It does feel a bit arbitrary the way certain items in Alex’s inventory can only be wielded in certain hands, though. It may create an added layer of tension to be forced to choose between measuring sound with the phonometer and illuminating the path forward with Alex’s flashlight, for example, since they can each only be wielded in her left hand, but it hardly makes any logical sense. Where was this flashlight purchased, at Ned Flanders’ Leftorium?</p><p>Occasionally, I’d find myself caught in close quarters with a monster and not have any noise-making tools in either hand, which put me in the lose-lose situation of either trying to make a run for it and getting instantly slashed in the back, or standing perfectly still only for the blind beast to accidentally bump straight into my nose and strike me down on the spot. It didn’t seem to matter if I chose to stick or twist, since either way I was going to find myself stuck and twisted apart. Thankfully, The Road Ahead’s generous auto-save system meant I was rarely penalised too heavily each time I perished, so although the slightly scripted feel of its enemy encounters mean it’s never as outright terrifying as <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/alien-isolation">Alien: Isolation</a>, it is at the very least more lenient and less likely to frustrate because you couldn’t reach a manual save point.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s never as outright terrifying as Alien: Isolation, [but] it is at the very least more lenient and less likely to frustrate.</p></div><p>The quarter-speed crawl along The Road Ahead does eventually run out of steam, though, even despite the fact that encounters with the aliens do evolve in some ways. There’s only ever one enemy type, but midway through they develop the ability to sense your movements even if the sounds you make are masked by the threshold of the ambient noise, effectively forcing you to simply take your hands off the controls and stand as still as a statue until the concussive effects of their scanning is completed, as an example. These modest changes help preserve the tension level throughout, but they struggle to completely disguise the fact that you’re otherwise mostly doing tedious tasks like turning valves and searching through drawers for supplies like any other survival-horror game, only at a considerably slower pace and without any combat sequences to release that tension in. There is one short flashback sequence that allows you to briefly blaze away with a shotgun out of the back of a speeding van, but The Road Ahead could have done with a few more of these dynamic detours to help break up the bit-by-bit crawl even more.  </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Tristan's Favourite Horror Games</h3><p>Intensity in ten entries.</p></div></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead does a commendable job of taking the uniquely silent scary movie series and spinning it into an interactive adventure, even if its methods for sustaining stress seem a bit too clearly contrived at times. I greatly appreciated the many handcrafted human touches that made its evacuated spaces so evocative, and the safety net of its consistent auto-save meant that my numerous instant deaths never became a source of frustration. However, although it may maintain a regularly tense atmosphere every shuffled step of the way, the absence of any significant story surprises or enough substantial changes to its simplistic stealth-based gameplay means that A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead doesn’t quite have enough twists and turns to make for an unmissable journey.

			<p>For years, Netflix has slowly started ramping up its gaming department. After launching with a mobile offering, they also <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-reportedly-working-on-aaa-pc-third-person-action-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened</a> a triple-A development studio in Los Angeles, California, around two years ago, with former Overwatch executive producer Chacko Sonny chosen as its founder.</p>
<p>The goal was to create a third-person action RPG for PC (and, presumably, consoles). To achieve this objective, the studio continued hiring high-profile industry veterans such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-joe-staten-joins-netflix-343-creative-director-frank-oconnor-leaves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Staten</a> (known as the writer and creative director for various Halo games, ReCore, Crackdown, and more) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-hires-ex-god-of-war-art-director-to-create-original-aaa-game-alongside-halos-joe-staten/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raf Grassetti</a>, former Art Director at Sony Santa Monica on the God of War games.</p>
<p>Despite all this talent, though, Netflix has already decided to shut down this studio, which had become known internally as Team Blue.&nbsp;<span>The news came from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-team-blue-socal-studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stephen Totilo's Game File</a>, who added that the Netflix gaming department had undergone some major changes starting in July when former chief Mike Verdu was moved to another role.</span> Alain Tascan, former executive vice president of game development at Epic Games, stepped into Verdu's role, and last week, Business Insider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-shakes-up-gaming-division-new-epic-hire-layoffs-2024-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Tascan picked former Epic Games VP of game development to join Netflix as VP of game technology and portfolio development. Business Insider also said there were around 35 cuts when Tascan was hired, although Totilo's sources say the figure was slightly lower.</p>
<p>That said, Netflix is not thinking about closing up shop in games if that's something you were worried about. It seems like its other studios (<a href="https://wccftech.com/night-school-studio-is-the-first-game-developer-purchased-by-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Night School</a> of Oxenfree fame, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-to-acquire-next-games-by-q2-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Next Games</a>, Spry Fox, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-acquires-dungeon-boss-developer-boss-fight-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boss Fight Entertainment</a>) will continue as if nothing happened. Of course, most of those are mobile game developers, so the question is whether Netflix plans to resume its triple-A multiplatform plans at some point or if it is content to stay on the mobile market for the time being. Time will tell.</p>
