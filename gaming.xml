			<p>While the cosy genre for some might mean a spot of farming or a touch of interior design, it’s tower defence that remains my calm, happy place. I’m not sure what that says about me, but it’s fair to say that IDUN – Frontline Survival puts you in that zen zone of constant watchfulness, laying down destructive towers while the hideous alien hordes attempt to overrun your defences. Ahhh, so cosy.</p>
<p><iframe title="IDUN: Frontline Survival - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2eea98br6hc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You play Security Officer Ham, who’s literally having a nap on the job when you’re introduced to him. This is the only rest he’s getting though, with a grotesquely rude awakening when vermin start to attack your mining post. You have to rely on your trusty flamethrower turret and Ham’s shotgun to make it out alive. There’s a cool sci-fi story running through IDUN’s tower-centric action, presented with great-looking character art to back it up.</p>


<p>The narrative drive helps to get you dug in with IDUN’s different mechanics, from controlling multiple hero characters, alongside moving and shifting your towers to deal with threats in the moment. As with the best tower defence games, IDUN forces you to face huge swarms of incoming enemies and hold them off, and it’s a lot of fun doing so.</p>


<p>The thing is, this isn’t so much a tower defence game as it is an RTS defence game. It merrily skewers the two genres together, and if you’re a fan of either it’s a winning combination that takes very little time to get you hooked. You move your towers and heroes as you need them, and it maintains a frantic pace that isn’t often found in the defence genre.</p>
<p>The only downside to moving your towers around is that you potentially lose some of the strategy and decision-making that you do when placing things permanently. In return though, I really like the addition of hero characters that you can use to plug gaps and turn the tide in your favour, and the increased pace lends IDUN – Frontline Survival its own feel.</p>
<p>There’s resource collection to think of too, and it’s often like spinning a very angry plate, balancing the need to control resource nodes while protecting your drilling equipment and base. Collecting enough resources unlocks upgrades mid-mission, from extra towers to permanent upgrades. This gives you a constant flow of improvements and decisions to make, and you have to hope that you’re making the right one to deal with the incoming threats.</p>

<p>Things can become a little too hectic at times, and there were moments where I lost my hero characters amongst the writhing enemy hordes. That said, it’s so enjoyable, that you can look past the occasional foible. You can call down additional artillery fire to give you a boost when things are looking desperate, and you’ll probably find yourself using it every single chance you can.</p>
<p>IDUN – Frontline Survival is no joke, pushing you to the limit in terms of enemy numbers and resources. On Medium difficulty you’ll be up against it by the third level, but in turn it feels really well balanced, and victory is hard won and rewarding.</p>

<p>You can upgrade your crew using resources won through successfully completing missions, increasing their health, range, fire rate and more. In addition to that, there’s a vast number of different turrets and additional weaponry you can install from your space station, keeping things interesting as you progress, and hopefully helping you through to the other side.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		IDUN – Frontline Survival is an RTS/Tower Defence hybrid that sells the concept incredibly well. While there’s a few rough edges, if you’re a fan of either genre, it’s an edge-of-the-seat blast. 	</p></div>

			<p>There are some major strategy and simulation games that will be released this year, including the eagerly-awaited release of Civilization VII. If you're looking for a new strategy or simulation game, you'll want to keep your eyes on some of the titles on this list that are set to be released later this year. Without further ado, here are Wccftech's five most anticipated strategy and simulation games of 2025.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Most Anticipated Games of 2025: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2025-excellence-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2025-retro-and-vibrancy/">Indie</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-roleplaying-games-of-2025-heroes-and-monsters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPG</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-horror-games-of-2025-new-scares-inbound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-sports-and-racing-games-of-2025-in-the-fast-lane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sports and Racing</a></em></p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Civilization VII (February 11, 2025)</h2>
<p>The year is starting off really strong with <a href="https://wccftech.com/civilization-vii-announced-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Civilization VII</a> from Firaxis. For some, it may feel like Civilization VI was released just a couple of years ago, but it was actually launched in 2016. Now, we are seeing a new era of Civ, with the latest game in the franchise set to be released on February 11, 2025. This game will be widely available, with those on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and even Nintendo Switch able to get it in the future. For those who have pre-ordered the Deluxe Edition or the Founder's Edition, you'll get access to this title a full five days before the full release of the game, getting an advantage over those who will be waiting for the official release date, especially if you plan to play against them in multiplayer. You can check out the official PC system requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-system-requirements-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Two Point Museum (February 27, 2025)</h2>
<p>The Two Point franchise has had some fantastic games, including Two Point Hospital and Two Point Campus. The latest iteration in the franchise allows you to become a museum owner, and is set to be the most ambitious in the franchise. For those who enjoyed the previous games in the franchise, you'll definitely want to keep your eye on this one. Especially if you've had dreams of owning your own museum, this will allow you to do just that. Two Point Museum is set to release on February 27 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Football Manager 25 (March 2025)</h2>
<p>If playing the actual game of football doesn't do it for you, but you enjoy the management of creating your own teams and having them compete, Football Manager is the way to go. The game was originally set for <a href="https://wccftech.com/football-manager-25-announced-launches-november-26/">release last year</a> as usual, being an annual series, but has since been delayed by the developers, with the game now set to release sometime in March. For those interested, Football Manager 25 will be released on most systems, including the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and even the Nintendo Switch.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Alliance of the Sacred Suns (2025)</h2>
<p>If you enjoy a 4X Strategy game set in space, then you'll want to keep your eyes peeled on Alliance of the Sacred Suns. It begins with your coronation as the new head of an empire, with the game ending when you die. Between the start and the end, you have a lot of major choices to make to ensure the survival of yourself as well as your empire. There are feuding houses, attempts at usurping the throne, and much more to keep you on your toes. At the moment, this game doesn't have a set release date but is due to come out later in 2025.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Commandos: Origins (March 2025)</h2>
<p>Commandos: Origins is that perfect hit of nostalgia that is set to be released later this year. This game is a long-awaited sequel in the Commandos franchise, a series that hasn't received a new release since 2006. There have been HD remasters of some of the classics in 2022, but this is a brand-new story that takes you back to the start of the elite force, where you get to experience their origin stories for the first time. It's set to be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in March; meanwhile, you can<a href="https://wccftech.com/commandos-origins-demo-released-for-pc-and-xbox-series-sx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> check out a demo</a> (available only on PC and Xbox).</p>

            <p>One piece of worldbuilding advice I've always found useful is to go at least one level deeper than the obvious. To wit: why have a lantern, asks <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mohrta">Mohrta</a>, when you can have a horrible vulture-esque creature called a lantern beast that lives on your head to light up the dark for you? "Found a good'un," I wrote in Slack shortly after playing Mohrta's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2881610/Mohrta/">Steam demo</a>. "It's so rad and strange!". Well, that's the pitch, reader. It's a "nonlinear FPS game blending action, exploration, and light dungeon crawling". Very rad. Very strange. Nom nom.</p>

<p>It's a world of stumpy, cowbell-wearing pet giraffes and ferocious avian nightmare bastards. These aren't things I'm used to dealing with on daily basis, so I naturally sought something to ground myself. Luckily, you start with a very nice, comfortingly chunky pistol with an excellent alt fire that unloads a full clip at whatever you're pointing at. Your sword also has an alt fire, as all good swords should. These use mana, which you can restore with a big sippy from your flask. And so you progress. Looking at things and going "oh yeah, that's cool", shooting very fast things that want you dead, and taking big sippies.</p>
<p>Between the vaguely futuristic modern and medieval bits, and the very strange horse your character rides, my mind naturally went straight to Wolfe's Book Of The New Sun. This is likely more recency bias than anything else, but there's definitely a sense of thick, somewhat pulpy history to the world, and I'm very curious to find out more about it. What's interesting is how the lore blurb would fit equally well for a modern military shooter, albeit one with a few supernatural elements:</p>
<blockquote><p>"A special military group known as "The Hayward" was formed to investigate and destroy the anomalies within The Strange. For years, the Hayward had done an admirable job of monitoring, handling, and reverse-engineering elements of the Great Strange into their work. Among these Hayward operatives is where your remains found new life."</p></blockquote>
<p>You'll often hear people say "graphics don't matter", but rarely the same about features. I must then conclude that most people care about features. As such, here are Mohrta's:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Adventure through an atypical take on the FPS genre.</li>
<li>Play through the game's five enormous and differently-themed dimensions in any order you choose.</li>
<li>Soak in the otherworldly atmosphere and lovingly-crafted level design.</li>
<li>Fight though a myriad of highly-detailed environments that push the limits of GZDoom.</li>
<li>Explore unusual settings, characters, and enemies fleshed out in beautiful signature Scumhead detail, featuring designs by Osiol.</li>
<li>Acquire a huge roster of weapons, each with multiple functions and utility.</li>
<li>Upgrade your weapons and gear, and choose a custom loadout that best suits your playstyle.</li>
<li>Over 50 diverse enemies and 20 challenging boss fights to dodge, shoot, and strike through.</li>
<li>Befriend a huge cast of strange and loveable NPCs, each with their own quests and storylines.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>This one's out sometime this year. It's from Oisol and Scumhead, who did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-you-like-short-steampunk-snes-style-rpgs-give-dystopian-freebie-franzen-a-shot">Franzen</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-snap">Marvel Snap</a> is back online, following its unexpected ban in the US.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-snap-gets-surprise-us-suspension-as-stateside-tiktok-ban-takes-effect">digital collectible card game was banned in the US alongside TikTok</a>, due to its publisher Nuverse being owned by TikTok owner ByteDance.</p>
<p>At this time, developer Second Dinner said the ban was every bit as much a "surprise" to the Marvel Snap team as it was to players, too. It went on to state it would do everything it could to get the game back up and running as quickly as possible. Second Dinner has now achieved this, and Marvel Snap is back online in the US.</p>

</figure>
<p>The developer is now "working to bring more services in-house and partner with a new publisher" to ensure this kind of surprise ban does not happen again.</p>
<p>Calling this move the "start of a new era" for the card game, the Marvel Snap team acknowledged players may have "more questions than answers". However, it assured its followers on social media that it would keep them updated with more details on the matter "as soon as possible".</p>
<p>There are still some remaining issues following Marvel Snap's suspension. Replying to users on X, Second Dinner said it is still working on restoring the game's App Store availability, adding this "may take some time".</p>
<p>It additionally noted "in-app purchases remain unavailable but the team is working on it". In the meantime, it said web shop purchases are all in working order, so players can go there for now.</p>

<p>Following its release, Marvel Snap won itself scores of fans, including many on the Eurogamer team. It was soon nominated for a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-sweeps-bafta-nominations">number of awards at prestigious events including the BAFTAs</a>.</p>
<p>Our Donlan was especially taken with Marvel Snap on its debut, praising the game for giving him some welcome moments to pause and reflect.</p>
<p>"Whenever I lose a game - and I lose all the time - I get to spend a pleasant few moments working out what went wrong, picking over my deck, and swapping cards in and out. There's a reward for being bad at the game. How kind," he wrote in his feature <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-2022-marvel-snap-offered-the-best-moments-of-reflection">Games of 2022: Marvel Snap offered the best moments of reflection</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/disney-lorcana-archazias-island-is-coming-this-march<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At this year's London Toy Fair, Ravensburger and The Walt Disney Company announced a new set of cards for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disney-lorcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Disney Lorcana</em></a>. The latest set for the popular card game, <em>Disney Lorcana Archazia's Island</em>, will introduce more beloved characters for collectors and players alike.</p>

<h2>The Disney Lorcana Archazia's Island Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Ravensburger showcased some card and product artwork for <em>Disney Lorcana Archazia's Island</em>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-archazias-island-booster-box.jpg?itok=NhG-0Zti 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-archazias-island-booster-box.jpg?itok=cNIMY_dm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first of these are the booster boxes. The artwork shows Encanto's Mirabelle, Bolt sporting a steampunk-esque leg attachment, Belle from Beauty and the Beast stepping into her father's footsteps with an engineer's outfit and an electric tool, The Mad Hatter brewing some tea, and Iago with his brazen scowl.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-archazias-island-product-artwork.jpg?itok=NG63Wdkr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-archazias-island-product-artwork.jpg?itok=fHPoWoUM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A more robust <em>Disney Lorcana Archazia's Island</em> image shows not just starter decks, but game mats and card sleeves. The card sleeves sport both Cinderella and Ursula. One game mat features Tigger in a pirate outfit covered in rope high in a crow's nest. The other features the superhero team, Big Hero 6, in full costume.</p>

<p>As for the starter decks, they are appropriately on theme. The first shows Belle and The Beast and appears to be a Ruby and Sapphire deck. The Beast is more dapper than normal, sporting a glowing quill and even a monocle. I suppose Belle has rubbed off on him in the best way. The second starter deck sports Iago and Jafar and is an Amethyst and Steel deck.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-reign-of-jafar-poster.jpg?itok=oWxoFeJn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-reign-of-jafar-poster.jpg?itok=HOHsczli 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Jafar's more regal appearance may be foreshadowing the next set after <em>Disney Lorcana Archazia's Island</em>. The aptly named <em>Reign of Jafar</em> involves the villain taking over Archazia's island, corrupting it into a menacing fortress.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-fabled-poster.jpg?itok=vCWMorkI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-fabled-poster.jpg?itok=jf5JFfYD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>What comes after this hostile takeover? Well, if the art of the next set is anything to go on, something more nostalgic. The third set, <em>Fabled</em>, features a more classical version of Mickey and Minnie Mouse in medieval garb riding horses. The set will most likely be fairytale-themed with some early 1920s animation deep cuts thrown in for good measure.</p>

<p>Disney Lorcana Archazia's Island will be released in March 2025. <em>Reign of Jafar</em> will be released on June 6, 2025, with pre-release events happening on May 30, 2025. <em>Fabled</em> will be released sometime in Q3 of 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-a-sequel-answered/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is set to be released on February 4, introducing the world to one of the best RPGs slated for 2025. On social media and across the internet, gamers have been abuzz about the impending release, causing all manner of questions to surface about the open-world RPG.</p>



<p>In this guide, I’m addressing one of those questions: ‘Is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 a sequel?’ That ‘2’ might be a bit of a giveaway, but let’s dive into the topic below and answer that question in full.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-set-after-kingdom-come">Is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Set After Kingdom Come?</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a> is a direct sequel to the first game. It’s set mere months after the ending of the first game, which was released in 2018. In Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, players assume control of Henry of Skalitz once again, slotting them into a very familiar perspective, provided they’ve played Kingdom Come Deliverance.</p>



<p>KCD2 is as instant a follow-up game as you could ever hope to play. Many themes from the first game roll over into the second title, and it’s as though you’re picking the story up right where you left it at the end of Kingdom Come Deliverance.</p>



<p>That means you’ll recognise returning characters, and understand various plots and quests, and you’ll also be familiar with many of the game’s mechanics, such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-lockpick-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lockpicking</a> or making potions <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-make-saviour-schnapps-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like Saviour Schnapps</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-you-need-to-play-kingdom-come-first">Do You Need to Play Kingdom Come First?</h2>



<p>In 2018, Kingdom Come Deliverance was released to a popular enough reception, despite being a relatively gruelling and realistic game that punished average gamers worldwide.</p>



<p>This story-rich, open-world game turned heads because it was so immersive and such a faithful representation of the setting, leaning on real people, places, and events to enrich the game.</p>



<p>That being said, it’s not <strong>necessary </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-you-need-to-play-kingdom-come-deliverance-before-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to play the first Kingdom Come Deliverance</a> before Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. This is because the developer, Warhorse Studios, has done a remarkable job with the writing of the second game, working in flashback sequences, conversations that dive into the first game’s history, and nods to the story of the opening title.</p>



<p>If you’ve not played Kingdom Come Deliverance (2018), you should be fine starting with Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<p>That being said, the first game is stellar, and it shouldn’t be missed.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘I Am a Living God of Video Games’: Elon Musk Has Admitted He Cheated in Diablo and PoE]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-cheated-diablo-poe-admit/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98i-am-a-living-god-of-video-games%E2%80%99-elon-musk-has-admitted-he-cheated-in-diablo-and-poe.1087458/</guid>

<p>If you’re an avid social media user, you might have heard the debate recently regarding the ‘legitimacy’ of Elon Musk’s gaming successes. In recent weeks, claims from the enigmatic and eccentric billionaire surfaced, suggesting that he’s one of the top-ranked players in both games – and he appeared to have the numbers to back those claims up.</p>



<p>However, his bold claims attracted the attention of content creators familiar with the games he plays, and the holes in his story started to show quite quickly. In a follow-up conversation with a YouTuber named NikoWrex, Elon Musk admitted that he cheated in both games to get to where he is.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-dishonest-conduct">Dishonest Conduct</h2>



<p>It’s no big secret that Elon Musk is an avid gamer. In the summer of 2023, Musk appeared in a live chat on Twitter (which was still <strong>named </strong>Twitter back then) and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">started talking about his obsession</a> with Diablo 4, which had just been released at the time.</p>



<p>A couple of months later, he became one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-stream-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most instantly successful streamers</a>, broadcasting his Diablo 4 gameplay to a concurrent viewer count of more than <strong>1.3 million </strong>users. That act alone marked him as one of the most-watched streamers in history.</p>



<p>Since then, Musk’s gaming habits have been relatively public, and weeks ago, the topic of him being a ‘top 20 player’ in Diablo 4 surfaced once again. He was quickly investigated and called out by streamers like Asmongold, who promptly fell into a social media beef with the tech billionaire and close friend of President Trump.</p>



<p>Now, in a series of DMs exchanged between Elon Musk and NikoWrex, it has been confirmed that all this time, Elon Musk was cheating.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-was-elon-musk-cheating">How Was Elon Musk Cheating?</h2>



<p>A bunch of screenshots have surfaced online showcasing the full conversation between Elon Musk and NikoWrex (thanks, <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/102692/elon-musk-confirms-he-cheated-to-become-top-player-in-path-of-exile-2-and-diablo-iv/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TweakTown</a>). In these screenshots, Musk admits that ‘it’s impossible to beat the players in Asia’ if you’re not <strong>sharing your account </strong>with other users.</p>



<p>Account sharing is a prohibited action under the terms of service for many online games, and if it isn’t, it’s a morally corrupt concept. It’s exactly what it sounds like – you share the details of your account with other users who play when you’re busy, sleeping, working, or something like that.</p>



<p>Musk said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The top accounts in Diablo or PoE require multiple people playing the account to win a leveling race.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Musk does insist that he’s still a cracked gamer, though:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>No matter how you cut it, a sub 2 min clear of the hardest level in Diablo is very fast. My run is posted to X. Very few mistakes were made.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Following the discourse, Elon Musk’s ex-wife took to social media to defend him, explaining:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Just for my personal pride, I would like to state that the father of my children was the first american druid in diablo to clear abattoir of zir and ended that season as best in the USA.</p>



<p>He was also ranking in Polytopia, and beat Felix himself at the game. I did observe these things with my own eyes. There are other witnesses who can verify this. That is all.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However you think of his exploits in Diablo 4 and Path of Exile, it seems that Elon Musk is a talented gamer. </p>



<p>Do you think his actions are reprehensible, or should everyone chill on Elon Musk? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals continues to turn heads since being released in December 2024. It has been a smash hit with tens of millions of players worldwide, which is aided by the fact that it’s a genuinely enjoyable, free-to-play hero shooter. NetEase is working hard to ensure the content pipeline remains stoked, and creators are locked in on the game.</p>



<p>One such creator is Shroud, one of the biggest streamers in the business. Recently, the former CSGO pro player gushed over Marvel Rivals and suggested he could be about to make an esports organisation focused exclusively on the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-in-jest-or-not">In Jest or Not</h2>



<p>Whether he was being serious or not remains to be seen, but if anyone can do it, Shroud can.</p>



<p>For years, Shroud has been one of the most popular streamers in the world, coming out of a relatively successful esports pro player career and opting to sit in front of the camera for years to follow. Today, he’s one of the biggest names in gaming.</p>



<p>During a recent stream, Shroud once again delved into his love for Marvel Rivals, explaining a potential goal for the near future:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If we raise a certain amount of money, I’ll make a Marvel Rivals team, slash org.</p>



<p>This game might just be it.</p>



<p>I might have to set a donation goal, for this number to hit something, and <strong>I will make an org</strong> for Marvel Rivals only.</p>



<p>I might be playing this game for the rest of my life. I genuinely might be playing this game for the rest of my life.</p>
</blockquote>



<div><article><p><span>Shroud says he might make an org just so he can have a Marvel Rivals team 

“This game might just be it…I genuinely might be playing this game for the rest of my life”</span></p></article></div>







<p>Marvel Rivals boasts a solid foundation that would easily support a competitive ecosystem. For now, it’s tied almost exclusively to a ranked platform, but recently, Twitch Rivals hosted a <strong>Marvel Rivals </strong>tournament, which was more or less a first for the game.</p>



<p>In the past, Shroud has dominated the likes of Counter-Strike, Overwatch, and VALORANT, so edging into the Marvel Rivals space is nothing but familiar territory.</p>



<p>Are you eager to see a more legitimate esports ecosystem for Marvel Rivals? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> what you’re waiting for.</p>

<p>The VALORANT rivalry between North American teams Sentinels and 100 Thieves has always been hot, but it reached unhinged levels just one week into the 2025 season. After some spicy photos hit the timeline this past weekend though, the two organizations asked their outspoken stars to tone it down.</p>



<p>Still, those photos will be seared into our memory for some time.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-sentinels-and-100t-requested-the-images-be-taken-down">Sentinels and 100T “Requested” The Images Be Taken Down</h2>



<p>Prior to the highly anticipated match between Sentinels and 100 Thieves at VCT Americas, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/100t-valorants-boostio-says-nrg-cant-win-championships-with-fns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">100T’s sparkplug in-game leader Kelden “Boostio” Pupello</a> posted a wild couple of photos on X. This included one of someone bent over in front of him wearing Sentinels’ Jordan “Zellsis” Montemurro’s jersey, with the caption “Banging @Sentinels today.”</p>



<p>However, it was Sentinels that got the last laugh, defeating 100 Thieves in three maps and knocking them down to the lower bracket of the VCT Americas Kickoff event. After the match, Boostio willingly posed in a similar bent-over position for Zellsis, who posted the image onto his Twitter account.</p>



<p>Eventually, both images were taken down, causing some on reddit to speculate that Riot forced the players to delete the photos. Some even claimed that both Zellsis and Boostio were fined for their tweets, but the Sentinels star has denied that speculation.</p>



<p>On X, Zellsis <a href="https://x.com/Zellsis/status/1881173481553101274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> “the internet [is] spreading misinformation as usual. I was not fined for that tweet, nor do I think Boostio was. The tweets were definitely out of pocket so Riot and our orgs politely requested we take them down.” Zellsis previously was fined by Riot Games back in 2023 for making a lewd gesture while on camera.</p>



<p>Should Zellsis and Boostio have received fines for their photos? Let us know down below and on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-updates-on-monster-hunter-wilds-performance-improvements-is-aiming-to-lower-pc-gpu-requirements</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-updates-on-monster-hunter-wilds-performance-improvements-is-aiming-to-lower-pc-gpu-requirements.1087272/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-updates-on-monster-hunter-wilds-performance-improvements-is-aiming-to-lower-pc-gpu-requirements<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Excitement continues to mount ahead of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>' release next month, but if there's one big question mark around the whole thing, it's just what sort of performance improvements Capcom has been cooking up since its rather wobby public beta. And the publisher has now given a brief update on performance, alongside confirmation it's "looking into" lowering the game's recommended GPU requirements on PC.
</p>
<p>
Monster Hunter Wilds' first public beta went live last October, and it immediately became clear there was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-beta-has-graphical-problems-but-capcom-promises-final-game-in-a-better-state">still work to be done</a> on the performance front. Players soon took to the internet highlighting everything from erratic framerates, even on decently beefy PCs, to unfortunate visual glitches making the whole thing look like Capcom's lead platform was the N64.
</p>
<p>
At the time, the publisher moved to remind players Monster Hunter Wilds was "still in development", offering assurances the full game was "already in a more improved state compared to the beta test", and that it was "committed to ensuring the quality of the final product." There was hope among fans some of these improvements might be evident in Monster Hunter Wilds' second open beta, scheduled to run from 7th-9th February, but Capcom recently confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-gets-second-open-beta-ahead-of-february-release">that wouldn't be the case</a>.

<p>
The company has, though, now provided a short update on performance, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a>'s <a href="https://x.com/DEMonsterHunter/status/1880661617249034446">official German social media channel</a> recently posting (as per Google translate) that the team "has been addressing rendering issues from the open beta test and is continually working on improvements for launch". These assurances were accompanied by a video offering what Capcom called a "look at our updated Prioritise Performance more for PS5", albeit not a particularly illuminating one given the less-than-stellar quality of X's video player. Prioritise Performance mode (AKA Prioritise Framerate) targets up to 60fps on PS5 and Xbox Series X, compared to 30fps when using Prioritise Graphics mode.
</p><p>
Capcom also noted it's aiming to improve PC performance in a "similar way", and that it's additionally "looking into whether we can lower the recommended GPU requirements". The publisher raised a few eyebrows last September, when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-specs-revealed">revealed</a> Monster Hunter Wilds would require an RTX 2070 Super/RTX 4060/RX 6700XT to reach 60fps (with Frame Generation) at 1080p, so word there may be improvements here - particularly given the open beta's erratic performance on mid-range hardware - is encouraging.
</p>
<p>
Monster Hunter Wilds launches for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 on 28th February, and the Character Creation, Story Trial and Slay Doshaguma Quest seen in last year's first open beta will all be available again when beta #2 kicks off earlier in the month.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale was quite taken with Monster Hunter Wilds' "familiar thrill of the hunt, player customisation, and extravagant combat" when he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-cuts-out-the-clunk-and-plays-like-the-most-streamlined-beginner-friendly-entry-yet">went hands-on in August</a>, so hopefully Capcom can iron our those remaining wrinkles before launch.

			<p>In a new report, NACON has announced their accessories that have been created with the Nintendo Switch 2 in mind. Just last week, people finally got their first look at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-hall-effect-diablo-iv/">long-awaited Nintendo Switch 2</a>. While it didn't reveal many details, it has been confirmed that people will get more information about the upcoming console in April thanks to a special Nintendo Direct dedicated to the console. NACON is a French publisher and accessory creator and has confirmed that it already has a bunch of peripherals for gamers to purchase when the Nintendo Switch 2 officially releases.</p>
<p>While we don't know the official release date yet of the console, NACON is expecting a significant rise in sales in the first half of the fiscal year of 2025/26, as that is when they are expecting the official release of the Nintendo Switch successor. In the report, they have also confirmed that they have a number of games ready to be published for the Nintendo Switch 2. This information comes from a snippet of the <a href="https://x.com/MauroNL3/status/1881421491285393857/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report posted on X by MauroNL</a>, which you can read for yourself on their social media.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can see the line-up of accessories for the Nintendo Switch 2 on the official NACON website, where you can see everything from foldable driving wheels to carrying cases and tempered glass protectors. So far, there are 16 items listed on the website, all for very reasonable prices. While they can't be purchased yet, they will be open to purchase as soon as the Switch 2 releases.</p>
<p>It's likely that once the console releases, NACON will continue to make even more products for the console, including themed accessories such as Mario and Zelda-themed items.</p>
<p>In the snippet of the report posted by MauroNL, NACON says that their business levels will be boosted thanks to the games and accessories that were created in 2024/25 but weren't released in that period and will instead be released in 2025/26. There will also be a NACON Connect Event taking place on March 6, where they will be showcasing some of the games that they have planned for this year. According to the post, they have 10 new games ready to be published, which will all be released at different points throughout the year. The most significant games out of the bunch will be revealed during their special event on March 6.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24346199/dynasty-warriors-origins-review-koei-tecmo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>In the doldrums of winter, I’ve reached for comfort media — which, for me, means Chinese historical dramas. And while the elaborate costumes and overly sweet romances are enjoyable, sometimes a girl wants something with a little more teeth. <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins </em>has given me exactly what I needed.</p><p><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>, developed by Koei-Tecmo’s Omega Force, adapts the famous Chinese historical novel <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em> into knock down, drag out, 1 vs 100 style battles. This is the tenth game in the series, coming at a time when the <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> franchise <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/21/16348298/dynasty-warriors-9-news-tgs-2017-koei-tecmo-omega-force">had gotten a reputation for being stale</a>. After all, there’s only so many times you can retread the same story with the same characters and the same general gameplay without getting one note. <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins,</em> however, is a welcome refreshment over its predecessors.</p><div><figcaption>Cao Cao can always be counted on to put his ambition on display.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Koei-Tecmo</cite></p></div><p>After releasing <em>Dynasty Warriors 9</em> in 2018, Omega Force took a break from the series to work on licensed games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572264/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-review-nintendo-switch-zelda-botw-prequel"><em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22303746/persona-5-strikers-review-ps4-pc-nintendo-switch-atlus-omega-force"><em>Persona 5 Strikers</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/8/23200053/fire-emblem-three-hopes-hack-and-slash-three-houses-nintendo-switch"><em>Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes</em></a>. That detour through games that I felt were excellent applications of Omega Force’s brand of hack-and-slash action gave the studio the new perspective it needed to come back to its signature franchise and shake shit up.</p><p>In <em>Origins</em>, instead of bouncing between different characters during certain battles as you had in previous games, you witness the story through a single character named the Wanderer. You have no memory of yourself, and as you progress, you slowly regain your memories and special powers. The Wanderer can use any type of weapon, which is another welcome change from previous games that locked weapons to a certain character. Each weapon has abilities you unlock through continued use, and the Wanderer himself has skills and perks he unlocks via skill trees.</p><p>Combat in <em>Origins </em>is simple to get the hang of. You have a light attack and a heavy attack that can be modified by using your dodge or jump. There’s also a suite of abilities that consume a resource called “bravery” that you earn by landing hits on your opponent. Finally, there’s block and parry mechanics and an ultimate ability called “musou” used when you’re impossibly surrounded or need to put extra hurt on an enemy general.</p><p>While this all sounds like your standard hack-and-slash game, I was pleased <em>Origins</em> made me work for my victories. Even on the standard difficulty and with years of experience playing <em>Warriors</em> games, I couldn’t just blindly hack my way through enemies. Generals hit surprisingly hard, and if I wasn’t using my various abilities to mitigate or counter their attacks, they’d continuously generate shields I’d have to keep chewing through to take them down. Unfortunately, your allied generals, whose deaths can result in an automatic loss, are made of tissue paper, so the longer enemy generals are alive, the higher your chances are of losing a battle. </p><div><figcaption>It’s great fun knocking around scores of enemies as The Wanderer.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Koei-Tecmo</cite></p></div><p>Battles take place on large, winding maps stuffed with bases to take over and enemy generals to defeat. Even though defeating the enemy leader while keeping your own leaders alive is generally the only win condition, I <em>loved</em> being a completionist. When I got a panicked cry for help from my allies, it was fun rushing to their defense even if helping didn’t make the battle end sooner. It made me feel like a big damn hero. And isn’t that the whole point of a game that lets you fight alongside the legendary characters of Chinese history?</p><p>Playing the hero is the best part about <em>Origins</em> and what’s been sorely missing from the franchise. Earlier games were burdened with unnecessary systems like the atrocious, poorly-paced open world of <em>Dynasty Warriors 9 </em>or the no-thoughts, head-empty button mashing of<em> Dynasty Warriors 8. </em>But in <em>Origins</em>, executing a special ability pulled you into an elaborate cutscene with animations that look like they were ripped straight out of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxia">wuxia</a> film. My choices in the game’s story moments let me build relationships with characters I have loved so much across so many different mediums. </p><p>I do understand other reviews’ <a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/507137/dynasty-warriors-origins-review-pc-xbox-ps5">criticisms of the Wanderer</a>. As a character he has no personality to speak of, and his quest to regain his memories isn’t compelling. But I can easily overlook that because this is <em>Dynasty Warrior</em>s.

<p>In a move that’s quite similar to Humankind, the relatively recent 4X strategy game that saw players leading a budding nation through history, Civilization 7 no longer requires you to pick a static faction and remain the same leader from start to finish. Instead, the game is divided into stages: Antiquity, Exploration, and Modern. During these ages, you’ll evolve your faction from a lowly tribe to a powerhouse with nuclear missiles. Here is a look at all the Civilization 7 civilizations available on day one!</p>



<h2 id="h-all-factions-in-civilization-7-at-launch">All Factions in Civilization 7 at Launch</h2>



<p>As you progress through the various eras in Civilization 7, you’ll expand your empire, bolster your troops, and inevitably evolve your culture from one, such as the Greek, to the next, such as the Norman, before inevitably finishing the game in the modern era as, say, the Prussian. It’ll offer players many opportunities to customize the experience and ensure replayability for quite some time!</p>



<h3 id="h-antiquity">Antiquity</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Aksumite</strong></li>



<li><strong>Egyptian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Greek</strong></li>



<li><strong>Han</strong></li>



<li><strong>Khmer</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mauryan</strong></li>



<li><strong>Maya</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mississippian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Persian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Roman</strong></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-exploration">Exploration</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Abbasid</strong></li>



<li><strong>Chola</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hawaiian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Inca</strong></li>



<li><strong>Majapahit</strong></li>



<li><strong>Ming</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mongolian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Norman</strong></li>



<li><strong>Shawnee</strong></li>



<li><strong>Songhai</strong></li>



<li><strong>Spanish</strong></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-modern">Modern</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>American</strong></li>



<li><strong>Buganda</strong></li>



<li><strong>Imperial French</strong></li>



<li><strong>Meiji Japanese</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mexican</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mughal</strong></li>



<li><strong>Prussian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Qing</strong></li>



<li><strong>Russian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Siamese</strong></li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-will-we-see-additional-civilizations-in-dlc">Will We See Additional Civilizations in DLC?</h2>



<p>Most likely, yeah. While it’s not guaranteed that we will receive DLC and expansions for Civilization 7, it’s highly considering the franchise’s overall track record for additional content. In the last game, Civilization VI, players were treated to Portugal, Vietnam, Byzantium, Gaul, and the Maya, to name a few of the leader packs that launched post-release.</p>



<p>For Civilization VII, which launches on February 11, we suspect 2K and Firaxis Games want to offer players even more content, keeping everyone satisfied for years to come!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-cs2-settings-and-options.1087224/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-settings-and-options/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Counter-Strike 2 settings menu is filled to the brim with different options that can change your gameplay, for better or worse. Newer CS2 players may be overwhelmed and will resign to going with the settings recommended by your system. While these options are fine, they can be better.</p>



<p>These are the best CS2 settings we can recommend you try out for yourself.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-video-settings">Best CS2 Video Settings</h2>



<p>Display Mode, Aspect Ratio, and Resolution are very dependent on personal preference. Players that alt-tab during matches or tab over to a program like Spotify, Discord, or a browser will have a more fluid time playing on Fullscreen Windowed. However, playing on Fullscreen Windowed means you can’t alter Aspect Ratio or Resolution. <strong>Playing in 4:3 stretched resolution</strong> is very popular amongst pros and long-time competitive players, as the game feels smoother and character models look wider.</p>



<ul>
<li>Under Video Settings, switch to Fullscreen, 4:3 Original, and 1280×960. By default, you’ll have black bars on the sides of your screen but these can be removed.</li>



<li>Tab out of CS2, and open the NVIDIA Control Panel. Under Display, click Adjust desktop size and position. 
<ul>
<li>Set the Scaling mode to Full-screen</li>



<li>Select GPU under “Perform scaling on”</li>



<li>Keep your resolution native</li>



<li>Set the refresh rate to your monitor’s maximum</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>When you tab back into CS2, you should have the stretched resolution that so many players prefer.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-advanced-video-settings">Best CS2 Advanced Video Settings</h2>



<p>As for your Advanced Video Settings, your goal should be improving FPS, reducing lag, and making CS2 look as clear as possible. Under the Advanced Video tab of your CS2 settings menu, make the following changes:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>V-Sync: </strong>Disabled</li>



<li><strong>Multisampling Anti-Aliasing Mode:</strong> None</li>



<li><strong>Global Shadow Quality: </strong>Very High</li>



<li><strong>Model/Texture Detail: </strong>Medium</li>



<li><strong>Texture Filtering Mode: </strong>Anisotropic 16X</li>



<li><strong>Shader Detail: </strong>Low</li>



<li><strong>Particle Detail:</strong> Medium</li>



<li><strong>Ambient Occlusion: </strong>Disabled</li>



<li><strong>High Dynamic Range: </strong>Quality</li>



<li><strong>FidelityFX Super Resolution: </strong>Balanced</li>
</ul>



<p>These settings in the Advanced Video section of the CS2 menu should provide a solid balance between performance and visual clarity. With these, you should get good FPS performance without sacrificing your visuals.</p>



<p>Have these settings improved your performance in CS2? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Did you know Escape From Tarkov has in-game achievements?</strong> Despite playing since Factory was the only available map, I didn’t for the longest time. It’s true, though. As part of the 0.14 content update, EFT now offers achievements. Some remain hidden; others are common enough to score during casual play. Here’s a look at all of them!</p>



<h2 id="h-all-achievements-in-escape-from-tarkov">All Achievements in Escape From Tarkov</h2>



<p>Escape From Tarkov features a ton of achievements, but don’t expect them to unlock anything special, like in-game rewards or transfer over to Steam if the game ever launches on Valve’s digital storefront. They’re primarily for show, a bit of bragging rights as you complete raid after raid, losing all of your equipment…is that just me?</p>

            <p>
<strong>UPDATE 21/1/25:</strong> On the matter of whether staff were told of Sony's project cancellation before the news was reported publicly, journalist Jeff Grubb has now <a href="https://x.com/JeffGrubb/status/1881548804354429148">posted</a> a correction to state that they in fact were.
</p>
<p>
Last night, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier weighed in via a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lg6yoxuvs22e">post</a> on BlueSky in which he stated: "People across the org were informed [of the cancellations] before my article went out last week." Sony is yet to respond to Eurogamer's request for comment, but we'll update the story if it provides clarity on the situation.
</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY 20/1/25:</strong>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> developer Bend Studio says it "still plans on creating cool shit", following Sony's decision to cancel its unannounced live-service game - amid claims Bend and the similarly affected Bluepoint only found out about the cancellations "at the same time as everyone else".
</p>
<p>
Word that Sony had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">cancelled two more first-party live service games</a> - this time in development at its Bend and Bluepoint studios - emerged via by Bloomberg last week. Sony, of course, announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">plans to invest heavily in live service titles</a> back in 2022, under the watch of then-PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, but the company has cancelled numerous live service games - including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/footage-of-insomniacs-seemingly-canceled-live-service-spider-man-the-great-web-appears-online">co-op Spider-man from developer Insomniac</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">The Last of Us multiplayer game</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-studio-firesprite-has-been-shedding-talent-amidst-accusations-of-toxic-culture-staff-say">Twisted Metal project at Firesprite</a> - since Ryan's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-two-playstation-ceos-to-replace-jim-ryan">departure last year</a>.
</p><p>
As for the latest casualties of Sony's apparent strategic rethink, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier claimed Bluepoint had been developing an unannounced live service God of War game. And while no details of Bend's canned project were shared, the studio previously said it was working on a new IP which would include multiplayer and "[build] upon the open-world systems of Days Gone". It's unclear, however, if this is the same game that's now been axed.

<p>
Regardless, Bend has now broken its silence following the news, thanking fans for their support and offering assurances it's not done yet. "I'll keep this short," Bend community manager Kevin McAllister wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/vikingdad278/status/1880403782976307623">message shared on social media</a>. "Thanks for the love and support everyone, especially to those that have reached out. P.S. We still plan on creating cool shit."
</p>
<p>
As to what's next for Bluepoint and Bend, that remains uncertain. According to journalist Jeff Grubb in his latest Game Mess Mornings video show (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bluepoint-and-bend-staff-learned-their-live-service-ps5-games-were-cancelled-at-the-same-time-as-everyone-else/">VGC</a>), both teams have had little time to process the news. "The two studios found out at the same time as everyone else," Grubb told listeners, "so people will be going into work today wondering, 'Hey, okay, what are we doing next?'. And what they're going to have to do next, very likely, is pitch something to Sony, and the landscape of that has changed pretty drastically.”
</p><p>
"A couple of years ago," he continued, "you'd bring to PlayStation your pitch, that is: 'It's a live service game, we know you want to hear that'... And now they have to go back to the drawing board, and come up with a pitch that PlayStation wants to hear, when no one really knows what they want to hear, and so it's a rough situation."
</p>
<p>
Following last week's cancellations, Sony told Bloomberg "neither of the two affected PlayStation studios will be shut down", adding that the "highly accomplished teams" would be "working closely with each studio to determine what are the next projects".
</p>

Sony's continuing shift away from live service titles follows the high-profile failure of last year's Concord, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">pulled from sale just two weeks after its launch</a> amid low player numbers. Back in 2023 it was reported the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-live-service-pivot-may-not-pay-off-the-way-jim-ryan-had-once-hoped-says-industry-insider">company was "uncomfortable"</a> about former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan's decision to focus heavily on live service games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/bend-studio-dev-says-we-still-plan-on-creating-cool-st-after-sony-live-service-cancelation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">What next for PlayStation Studios?</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> has said it still plans to create “cool s**t” after parent company Sony canceled its unannounced live-service game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games">Sony canceled two unannounced live-service games that were in development at Bend Studio and Bluepoint Games</a>. The Bluepoint game was reportedly a live-service God of War game, according to Bloomberg’s <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lfvfm2febc2e" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Jason Schreier</u></a>. Bend Studio’s live-service game remains unknown.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A Sony spokesperson confirmed the cancellations to Bloomberg, adding that neither studio will be closed and that it will work with each to determine next projects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony's live-service push has struggled significantly. While Arrowhead’s Helldivers 2 was a breakout hit, becoming the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks, Sony’s other live-service games were either canceled or suffered disastrous launches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Sony’s Concord is one of the biggest video game disasters in PlayStation history, lasting just a couple of weeks before it was brought offline amid drastically low player numbers. Sony later decided to kill the game entirely and shut its developer. The Concord flop came after Sony had already canceled Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us multiplayer game. Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-wouldve-tried-to-resist-sonys-live-service-push">former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida said he would have tried to resist Sony’s controversial live-service video game push</a>, were he in the position of current Sony Interactive Entertainment Studio Business Group CEO Hermen Hulst.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/vikingdad278/status/1880403782976307623" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, Bend Studio community manager Kevin McAllister issued a short message to the developer's fans: “Thanks for the love and support everyone, especially to those that have reached out. P.S. We still plan on creating cool shit.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As it stands, Bend Studio's last release was 2019’s Days Gone on PlayStation 4. It launched on PC in 2021.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent financial call, Sony president, COO and CFO Hiroki Totoki said the company had learned lessons from both the record-breaking launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a> earlier this year and Concord’s failure. On Concord specifically, Totoki said Sony should have run its development gates such as user testing or internal evaluation “much earlier than we did.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Currently we are still in the process of learning,” Totoki admitted. “Basically, with regards to new IP, of course you don’t know the result until you actually try it. So for our reflection, probably we need to have a lot of gates, including user testing or internal evaluation, and the timing of such gates, we need to bring them forward. We should have done those gates much earlier than we did.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The suggestion here from Totoki was that Sony should have noticed and reacted to Concord’s issues earlier in the development process, presumably so that it could have improved the game before launch — or canceled it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Totoki then went on to point fingers at Sony’s “siloed organization” and Concord’s release window, which may have caused cannibalisation. Concord launched in August, not long after smash hit Black Myth: Wukong hit PS5 and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have a siloed organization, so going beyond the boundaries of those organizations in terms of development and also sales, I think that could have been much smoother,” Totoki said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then going forward, in our own titles and in third-party titles, we do have many different windows. And we want to be able to select the right and optimal window so that we can deploy them on our own platform without cannibalisation, so that we can maximize our performance in terms of title launches.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the same financial call, Sony senior vice president for finance and IR Sadahiko Hayakawa compared the launches of Helldivers 2 and Concord, saying lessons learned would be shared throughout the business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We launched two live-service games this year,” he said. “Helldivers 2 was a huge hit, while Concord ended up being shut down. We gained a lot of experience and learned a lot from both.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We intend to share the lessons learned from our successes and failures across our studios, including in the areas of title development management as well as the process of continually adding expanded content and scaling the service after its release so as to strengthen our development management system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We intend to build on an optimum title portfolio during the current mid-range plan period that combines single-player games — which are our strengths and which have a higher predictability of becoming hits due to our proven IP — with live-service games that pursue upside while taking on a certain amount of risk upon release.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking to the future, a number of PlayStation live service games remain in the works, including Bungie’s Marathon, Guerrilla’s Horizon Online, and Haven Studio’s Fairgame$.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
