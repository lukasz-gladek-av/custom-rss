            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-fixes-coming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Heart Machine's action roguelite&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>has officially launched in Early Access, and the developer has promised fixes for some of the game's most pressing issues by the end of the week.</p>

<p><em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>'s Steam review rating is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">currently sitting at Mixed</a>, with negative reviews often pointing to problems like accessibility restrictions and performance dips.</p>

<p>Now, in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/heartmachine.bsky.social/post/3lfqn5mpqnk22" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a thread</a> on social media platform Bluesky, Heart Machine has promised that fixes for "performance issues and accessibility requests", such as mouse sensitivity options and the ability to invert the game's camera, will be introduced "by the end of the week".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-fixes-characters.jpg?itok=M66FpfHv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-fixes-characters.jpg?itok=80lHaCM1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fixes are on the way for some of&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>'s most pressing problems.</figcaption></figure><p>Addressing the Mixed review rating, Heart Machine says that Early Access games necessarily "take on the risk of negative early reviews and feedback" owing to different players' "expectations" for such a release.</p>

<p>The developer calls feedback received about&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>'s performance and accessibility problems "extremely reasonable" and says that receiving "large quantities" of such feedback "actually helps us determine how to prioritize future updates".</p>

<p>In closing, Heart Machine says it's heartening (that's my cheap pun, not theirs) to see accessibility concerns being raised, as the studio was "already planning" to add these features and the fixes required are "straightforward".</p>

<p>A more specific timeframe hasn't been given for the fixes to these issues, but given that we're already on Wednesday, the end of the week is fast approaching. We'll likely see an update in the next few days.</p>




<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>is, it's the third game by Heart Machine, following on from 2016's&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>-style action-adventure game&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hyper-light-drifter" rel="nofollow">Hyper Light Drifter</a>&nbsp;</em>and 2021's parkour platformer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/solar-ash" rel="nofollow"><em>Solar Ash</em></a>.</p>

<p>Unlike its predecessors,&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>is a roguelite that's designed to be replayed, and it supports co-op play too. You'll traverse a variety of procedurally-generated worlds with "incredible freedom", slaying enemies and gathering loot to create unique loadouts.</p>

<p><em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>.

In them, Batman and Superman show up to finish Braniac off and reveal that the Justice League members the player killed were actually just clones. Everyone except Wonder Woman seemingly, who ended up getting killed at the hands of the Superman clone. Batman’s pivotal death? Also a clone. It was all part of the caped crusader’s master plan, apparently. It sounds about as well put together as the live-service pitch for the underlying game. </p><p>The Suicide Squad members remove their bomb implants and leave the planet to explore outer space, while the remaining Justice League members travel to all of the universes Braniac ruined to set things right and “atone.” The whole thing last less than two minutes, and despite being entirely an exposition dump, still feels like it leaves a lot unexplained. It’s also hard to know how much ofthis was Rocksteady’s original plan for the story’s year-one conclusion, and how much of it was cobbled together last-minute as the studio pivots to new projects. </p><p>“That was the most disappointing ending I’ve seen,” wrote one commenter on YouTube. “Pissed off the entire fandom, sullied their legacy,  only for it to go the ‘none of it mattered’ route just for the sake live gaming and money,” wrote another. Many pointed out that Robin is also technically dead in the Arkhamverse now too. “I did kindaaaa hope that they would go out with bang but obv that didnt happen, just killed brainiac and im more confused then satisfied,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideSquadGaming/comments/1i18yte/that_was_kinda_ass_ngl/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideSquadGaming/comments/1i18yte/that_was_kinda_ass_ngl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> a player on Reddit. Even some players on the game’s official Discord who loved <em>Suicide Squad</em>’s gameplay and have stuck with it for nearly a year were let down by the ending. </p><p>The bizarre clone twist caps of nearly 12 months of rough going for a big-budget blockbuster from one of the most acclaimed studios in games. Bad reviews and fan frustrations with the base campaign’s main story rolled into underwhelming post-launch content plans that offered very little in the way of fresh mission types or new story beats. The new playable characters rotated into each season, beginning with the Joker and ending with Deathstroke, also didn’t win players back. </p><p>By June, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-hogwarts-legacy-rocksteady-arkham-1851522893?_gl=1*zkd93a*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjk1MDQyOS45MS4xLjE3MzY5NTI4MDUuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-hogwarts-legacy-rocksteady-arkham-1851522893?_gl=1*zkd93a*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjk1MDQyOS45MS4xLjE3MzY5NTI4MDUuNjAuMC4w"><em>Bloomberg </em>reported</a></span> that Rocksteady had already pivoted to other projects, like a <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> director’s cut, and in recent months the studio has suffered two rounds of layoffs. Despite <em>Suicide Squad</em> bombing, however, publisher Warner Bros. hasn’t suggested <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/warner-bros-free-to-play-suicide-squad-harry-potter-1851309669&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/warner-bros-free-to-play-suicide-squad-harry-potter-1851309669">it’s at all deterred by the sales disaster</a></span>, though it sounds like Rocksteady at least will go back to focusing on what it’s historically excelled at: immersive single-player action games. Where that leaves the <em>Batman: Arkham</em> universe remains to be seen. A VR spinoff, <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow </em>arrived just last year to decent reviews. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It very much looks like Mortal Kombat 1's T-1000 is based on Robert Patrick, who played the character in the film, and we understand Patrick voices T-1000, too.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/15/screenshot-2025-01-15-143119-1736951538114.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Mortal Kombat 1's T-1000.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Conan the Barbarian, due out January 21 as part of the standard DLC early access period for Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns Expansion owners before wide availability a week later, features the likeness of Arnold Schwarzenegger, who famously played Conan in the cult classic 1982 film, but does not feature his voice. The official Conan the Barbarian gameplay trailer will be debuted on tomorrow’s Kombat Kast, giving fans a deeper dive on this powerful fighter. Release timing and availability for T-1000 Terminator will be announced at a later date, Warner Bros. said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">T-1000 Terminator is the final DLC character added to the gory fighting game as part of the Khaos Reigns expansion, and follows playable fighters Cyrax, Sektor, Noob Saibot, Ghostface, and, later this month, Conan the Barbarian. Fans have been wondering for some time now whether developer NetherRealm plans a third set of DLC characters amid questions about Mortal Kombat 1’s sales success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For its part, Warner Bros. Games has announced Mortal Kombat 1 has sold more than four million copies, and in November Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav said that on the games side of things, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-ceo-namechecks-batman-as-part-of-its-new-video-game-focus-so-is-another-arkham-game-in-the-works-at-rocksteady">the company plans to double down on just four titles, including Mortal Kombat</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-ed-boon-says-netherrealm-knew-what-its-next-game-would-be-3-years-ago">NetherRealm chief Ed Boon said the developer decided on its next game three years ago, but promised to support Mortal Kombat 1 “for a long time to come.”</a> </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most fans of the studio’s work expect it to release a third game in its DC fighting game franchise, although neither NetherRealm nor owner and publisher Warner Bros. has yet to confirm that. The first game in the series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/injustice-gods-among-us"><u>Injustice: Gods Among Us</u></a>, launched in 2013, with its sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/injustice-2"><u>Injustice 2</u></a>, coming out in 2017. NetherRealm released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-11"><u>Mortal Kombat 11</u></a> in 2019 and for a time it seemed like the studio would alternate between Mortal Kombat and Injustice games, but it went on to release another Mortal Kombat, the soft reboot that is Mortal Kombat 1, in 2023 instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1s-ed-boon-says-door-not-closed-on-injustice-3"><u>an interview with IGN</u></a> in June 2023, Boon spoke in vague terms about this decision. "There were a number of factors, some of which I can talk about, some of which I probably shouldn't," Boon said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two reasons Boon was willing to discuss were the unfortunate onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the team's choice to switch to a newer version of the Unreal game engine (Mortal Kombat 11 runs on Unreal Engine 3, whereas Mortal Kombat 1 runs on Unreal Engine 4).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But we did go to a new graphics engine, Unreal," Boon said. "We really wanted to be careful with COVID and all that stuff and everybody staying safe. So there were a bunch of variables involved that eventually we realized, 'Okay, let's do another Mortal Kombat game and hopefully we'll get back to the Injustice games.' "</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just to be sure, we wanted to confirm with him directly that the door was not closed on the Injustice franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Not at all," Boon answered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

You even help a living finger work through anger issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where Promise Mascot Agency is punching above its weight is in the voice cast department. It’s nabbed PlayStation developer legend Shuhei Yoshida in his first ever video game voice role, and the announcement comes hot on the heels of Yoshida’s last day at Sony.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">At farewell party yesterday 😆 <a href="https://t.co/hpiPWQIO1z" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/hpiPWQIO1z</a></p>— Shuhei Yoshida (@yosp) <a href="https://twitter.com/yosp/status/1879264451079315564?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 14, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Shuhei Yoshida worked on PlayStation from the very beginning, playing a key role in the original console’s success from 1993. He was one of the more public-facing PlayStation executives while President of SIE Worldwide Studios from 2008 to 2019, championing indie and VR success in particular. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-veteran-shuhei-yoshida-retiring-from-sony-in-january">Yoshida announced his exit from Sony in November during his 31st year at PlayStation</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When I hit 30 years, I was thinking, hmm, it may be about time for me to move on,” he explained at the time. “You know, the company’s been doing great. I love PS5, I love the games that are coming out on this platform. And we have new generations of management who I respect and admire. And I’m so excited for the future of PlayStation."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Yoshida long-term plan remains up in the air, in the short-term he’s turned to video game voice acting, and that's where Promise Mascot Agency comes in. Yoshida plays Monouge, an odd-looking green-skinned former mascot who is opening their own game center.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yoshida isn’t the only big name joining the Promise Mascot Agency voice cast. Yakuza: Like A Dragon’s Takaya Kuroda, who plays series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu, and Legend of Zelda’s Ayano Shibuya also star, as do Eri Saito (Chainsaw Man, Metal Gear Solid 4, Way of the Samurai 3) and Swery, developer of Deadly Premonition, The Good Life, and Spy Fiction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see what Yoshida and co sound like in-game in the exclusive trailer, below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We can’t believe that our weird game managed to attract such a strong voice cast,” said game director Oli Clarke Smith.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When our lead Japanese localiser, Roppyaku Tsurumi, told us that Kuroda-san had auditioned, we just about lost our minds. All of the cast have brought our group of misfits to life wonderfully. After working on these characters for four years, they have become like friends to us, and we’re so happy that they have all been given a voice. The team at the recording studio, Xenorex, did an amazing job.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Takaya Kuroda voices the disgraced ex-yakuza Michi, exiled to the forgotten (and quite definitely cursed) Japanese town of Kaso-Machi with two goals: pay off his debt and restore glory to the town’s defunct mascot agency! Recruit the weird and wonderful mascots across town with help from your severed finger assistant manager and chaos goblin, Pinky☆ - voiced by Ayana Shibuya, negotiate their contracts and assign them jobs they love.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Promise Mascot Agency will be available on PC and consoles early 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Stuart Wilson/BAFTA/Getty Images for BAFTA.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p>"I've been with PlayStation from the beginning, and this is my 31st year with PlayStation," Yoshida said in November, announcing his departure. "And when I hit 30 years, I was thinking, hmm, it may be about time for me to move on.</p><p>"You know, the company's been doing great," he continued. "I love PS5, I love the games that are coming out on this platform. And we have new generations of management who I respect and admire. And I'm so excited for the future of PlayStation."</p>
<p>I'm not sure anyone expected him to move into voice acting, though.</p>

            <p>Chinese conglomerate <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> and Ubisoft's founding Guillemot family are reportedly considering a new venture using a foundation of Ubisoft assets.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-15/tencent-guillemot-family-are-said-to-mull-ubisoft-asset-venture?leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a> (paywall), the two companies will create this venture and then move select Ubisoft assets over, with sources close to the matter stating this is an attempt to give Ubisoft's value an overall boost.</p>
<p>Tencent and Ubisoft are said to be in the process of evaluating which assets to include in this venture. "A potential deal would allow Tencent to own a stake in the venture and gain more control over some of Ubisoft’s intellectual properties, while boosting its video game business outside of China," the report reads.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, no final decisions have been made with regard to this alleged venture between Tencent and Ubisoft. However, we already knew Ubisoft was looking at ways to try and increase its value.</p>
<p>As outlined earlier this month, the Assassin's Creed and Far Cry maker has appointed advisors to "review and pursue various transformational strategic and capitalistic options to extract the best value for stakeholders". Meanwhile, last October, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-considering-buyout-taking-the-company-private-report">Tencent and Ubisoft were considering a buyout</a>. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-discussing-buyout-options-with-tencent">similar report was then released in December</a>.</p><p>Last year was a particularly bumpy one for Ubisoft. The company suffered at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-suffers-third-round-of-job-losses-this-year">least three rounds of layoffs</a>, as well as staff walkouts, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">disappointing sales for titles such as Star Wars Outlaws</a>. Ubisoft additionally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-shutting-studios-laying-off-277-employees-as-it-pulls-plug-on-live-service-shooter-xdefiant">pulled the plug on live-service shooter XDefiant</a>, and shuttered a number of studios.</p>
<p>In the last week, Ubisoft delayed the next instalment in its Assassin's Creed series - Shadows - once again. The upcoming game was initially due to release in 2024, before its launch was then pushed to 14th February.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">Assassin's Creed Shadows will now release on 20th March</a>, Ubisoft announced last week.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yet another round of layoffs has hit Microsoft, affecting employees working at the tech giant's gaming division, as well as two of its other divisions.</p>

<p>A report by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-layoffs-hit-security-devices-sales-gaming-2025-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Business Insider</a> (which is paywalled; we're using additional reporting by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-to-lay-off-unknown-number-of-staff" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>) cites a spokesperson as saying that a small number of Microsoft employees would be affected, although the spokesperson stopped short of saying how many constitutes that small number.</p>

<p>Given that Microsoft is a massive company that employs hundreds of thousands of people, a small number could refer to tens of employees, a few hundred, or even a few thousand; anything short of thousands and thousands of employees being laid off would likely be a drop in the ocean for Microsoft.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025-flight-sim.jpg?itok=0Vm9UEUt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025-flight-sim.jpg?itok=KUruUp6Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Microsoft's latest round of layoffs affect employees in gaming, as well as other divisions.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the gaming division, the latest layoffs also affect employees in Microsoft's security and sales departments, although we don't know what proportion of employees were laid off across each division.</p>

<p>As noted by GI.biz, the spokesperson said that these layoffs weren't related to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/08/microsoft-confirms-performance-based-job-cuts-across-departments.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">performance-based job cuts</a> announced last week, so it doesn't sound like these employees are being let go because their performance is unsatisfactory (or not solely because of that, anyway).</p>

<p>Back in January last year, Microsoft apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">laid off almost 2,000 staff</a> solely from its gaming division, with Xbox head Phil Spencer reportedly claiming the cuts were part of reaching a "sustainable cost structure" to support Xbox's "growing business".</p>

<p>Of course, those layoffs didn't prevent CEO Satya Nadella from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">scoring a payrise</a> to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. Perish the thought that the C-suite could perhaps absorb some of the cost when it comes to considering layoffs.</p>

<p>Microsoft is kicking off the year the same way it did 2024, holding layoffs across the company. According to a new report from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-layoffs-hit-security-devices-sales-gaming-2025-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Business Insider</a>, Microsoft is letting go people from its sales, security, and gaming teams.</p>



<p>Business Insider sources say that employees started getting notifications of the layoffs on Tuesday. Microsoft told the outlet that the layoffs “are small” while not giving information on the number of cuts.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft about the exact number of people being let go from the gaming division in this latest round of layoffs. As of publishing, no response has been received.</p>



<p>In January 2024, Microsoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-microsoft-layoffs-affect-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">let go 1,900 people</a> from its gaming team after it closed on its purchase of Activision Blizzard. More layoffs were held throughout the year via studio closures and other mass layoffs, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-650-people-lay-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including 650 people</a> in September 2024. The company even shut down four studios in May 2024, including Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks. Tango Gameworks, however, would ultimately be purchased by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tango-gameworks-acquired-by-pubg-publisher-krafton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Krafton </a>and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tango-gameworks-rebirth-krafton-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relaunched</a>.</p>

<p>Last year saw nearly 16,000 people let go from their jobs in the games industry across more than 160 companies.  In the first 15 days of 2025, <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">there have been 10 known layoffs</a> and closures with at least 160+ people let go based on known numbers. With estimates, we are looking at well over 200 people thus far. </p>

However, just months later in January 2022, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/razer-removes-n95-grade-claims-from-rgb-zephyr-mask/1100-6499502/" data-ref-id="1100-6499502">Razer removed the N95 claims about the face mask</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">At the time of the settlement with the FTC, Razer stated that it disagreed with the agency's allegations and didn't "admit to any wrongdoing." Meanwhile, the FTC says checks must be cashed within 90 days for the Zephyr face mask refunds, while PayPal payments need to be redeemed within 30 days.</p><p dir="ltr">For more information about the refund, the FTC points people to call Simpluris at 1-833-285-3003 or to check out <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/recent-ftc-cases-resulting-refunds/refund-programs-frequently-asked-questions" rel="nofollow ">the agency's FAQ page</a>. This isn't the only notable gaming-related refund.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-ending-dumb</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-ending-is-really-dumb.1082832/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-ending-dumb<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rocksteady has released the final update for&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>, and it looks like the joke's on you if you're still invested in the game's narrative for some reason.</p>

<p>Over on social media platform X, content creator Synth Potato <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/1879239456320032790" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> the game's final cutscene in its entirety. It takes the form of a&nbsp;<em>Redfall</em>-style 2D animated storyboard cutscene, probably - as Synth Potato notes - "due to budget cuts".</p>

<p>The cutscene is narrated by Harley Quinn, who tells the story of how she and the Suicide Squad entered Brainiac's lair only to find Superman alive and well (and, notably, not Brainiac-possessed). It turns out that the evil Justice League wiped out in the main story were just clones. Of course.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-ending-superman.jpg?itok=-JFeShDJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-ending-superman.jpg?itok=0Phn5dIy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can't scare me, Superman. You're just a clone.</figcaption></figure><p>The whole thing turns out to have been one of Batman's characteristically complex plans, although when Batman asks how the Suicide Squad knew the Justice League were clones, Quinn says they didn't. Ha, and indeed, ha.</p>

<p>Superman then says the Justice League needs to "atone" and put as many worlds right as it can, while Harley and the Suicide Squad get their collars shorted by the "wonder trio of Hack, Lawless, and Toyboy", pledging to go on a "road trip".</p>

<p>It's all exactly as abrupt and nonsensical as it sounds. I'll put my cards on the table and admit I didn't play&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>, so I have no idea whether this is a satisfying ending to the story or not, but I'm going to hedge my bets and say that it isn't.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, Rocksteady <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-seasons-ending-in-january-offline-mode" rel="nofollow">announced back in December</a> that&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>'s fourth season would be its last, and that an offline mode would be added in order to allow players to play without an online connection.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-harley-gang.jpg?itok=bZwP6Owb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-harley-gang.jpg?itok=KkqqP2ok 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>'s ending is unlikely to have many fans.</figcaption></figure><p>This decision was almost certainly made due to&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>'s terminally small player base, as well as the fact that its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win" rel="nofollow">disappointing sales</a> contributed to a $200 million loss for publisher Warner Bros.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the best thing one can say about this ending is that it technically leaves the door open for another game in the&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham&nbsp;</em>series, although with longtime voice actor Kevin Conroy now sadly no longer with us, that might not be such a good idea. Stay tuned for more.</p>

In October 2024, Switch emulator <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-emulator-ryujinx-nintendo"><u>Ryujinx</u></a> ceased development following “contact from Nintendo.” In 2023, the developers behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dolphin-emulator-wont-release-on-steam-after-all"><u>Dolphin</u></a>, an emulator for Gamecube and Wii, were advised against a full Steam release by lawyers at Valve, who were contacted by Nintendo’s lawyers alongside “strong legal wording.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps most famously, in 2023 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-hacker-gary-bowser-released-from-prison-still-owes-millions"><u>Gary Bowser</u></a>, a reseller of Team Xecuter products that allowed users to bypass the Nintendo Switch’s anti-piracy measures, was charged with fraud and ordered to pay $14.5m back to Nintendo, a debt he will repay for life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, a patent lawyer representing Nintendo has lifted the lid on the company’s approach to piracy and emulation, and discussed how the propagation of emulators could lead to software piracy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a report from <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/kikakuthetower/250112a#i-2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Denfaminicogamer</u></a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/are-emulators-illegal-or-not-nintendo-lawyer-explains-why-its-been-taking-them-down/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>VGC</u></a>) at Tokyo eSports Festa 2025, “Intellectual Property Managers” from Capcom, Sega, and Nintendo gathered to discuss the laws designed to protect companies’ intellectual property. Speaking for Nintendo was a patent attorney and Assistant Manager of the Intellectual Property Division, Koji Nishiura. In a translation by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendos-attorney-weighs-in-on-what-makes-emulators-illegal/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>, he explained: </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“To begin with, are emulators illegal or not? This is a point often debated. While you can’t immediately claim that an emulator is illegal in itself, it can become illegal depending on how it’s used.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nishiura explained further that if an emulator copies a program from the game it is running, it may constitute copyright infringement, and this is also the case if the emulator can disable a console’s security mechanisms. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is largely down to Japan’s “<a href="https://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/en/laws/view/3629" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Unfair Competition Prevention Act</u></a>,” or UCPA, which is only enforceable in Japan itself. This makes it more difficult for Nintendo to pursue legal action overseas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The example given in a slide during the Tokyo eSports Festa talk was the Nintendo DS “R4” card, which allowed users of the cartridge to circumvent and run backed-up or pirated versions of games on a single cartridge. Ultimately, after Nintendo and 50 other software manufacturers cried out about the R4, Nintendo won a ruling that the manufacturers and resellers violated the UCPA, effectively <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-years-after-sales-ban-japan-finally-blocks-import-of-r4-cartridges" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>outlawing sales of the R4 in 2009</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nishiura further explained that tools that allow users to download pirated software within an emulator or piece of software would also constitute copyright law infringement. Named “reach apps” in Japanese law, these third-party tools like the 3DS’s infamous “Freeshop,” or third-party app installer “Tinfoil” for Switch, may also violate copyright laws.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In its Yuzu lawsuit, Nintendo claimed that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-tears-of-the-kingdom-was-pirated-1-million-times-pre-release-in-lawsuit-against-emulator-creator">pirated one million times</a>. Specifically, the filing claimed that Yuzu's Patreon page allowed its developers to earn $30,000 per month by providing subscribers with "daily updates," "early access," and "special unreleased features" to games like Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Sayem is a freelancer based in the UK, covering tech and hardware.

                <p dir="ltr">When Dr. Doot took the stage on the final day of AGDQ 2025, the pressure was on. The speedrunner, whose nickname is surprisingly descriptive--he has a doctorate in music composition--was attempting a live run of Elden Ring using a digital saxophone as a controller. Beating Elden Ring's toughest bosses via traditional methods is difficult enough, but Dr. Doot put that PhD to good use and quickly slayed the final boss, as well as the maddingly difficult optional boss Malenia.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot had the chance to chat with Dr. Doot (who wished to only use his handle rather than his real name), and we were surprised to learn how the saxophone speedruns came to be. Rather than coming about simply as another way to beat Elden Ring or Dark Souls, they were an extension of Dr. Doot's practice on his digital instrument, the Roland Aerophone.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Aerophone actually became a game controller initially as a joke," he explained. "I actually got the Aerophone to help me with my music composition, because I play saxophone. And then I found the program that you can use to translate MIDI input, which is what the saxophone sends to the computer, to [computer] keyboard input. Then I realized, 'Oh, you can play games that way then!'"</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaCvZd7iOkM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yaCvZd7iOkM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The setup is relatively intuitive and undeniably hilarious. The keys of the Aerophone are mapped to different functions in whatever game Dr. Doot is playing. In the case of Elden Ring, only his character's movement is handled via an analog nub on the back of the device. Everything else, including moving the camera, is accomplished by pressing down the corresponding keys and blowing into the mouthpiece. This produces a "doot" noise, which is funny on its own, but hilarious when it's accompanying violent sword attacks finishing off a deadly boss. This, naturally, elicited plenty of laughs from the packed Wyndham Grand in Pittsburgh, and there have been some occasions when he's accidentally composed a new melody on the fly.</p><p dir="ltr">"Every once in a while, something wacky will happen, where I'll have a very specific script, and I'll play a jazz lick out of nowhere--it's really funny. And it always catches me off guard, like, 'Wait, that actually sounds like music!'"</p><p dir="ltr">Other games have allowed for more literal applications of the Aerophone, such as The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, in which Dr. Doot matched the button inputs for the ocarina songs to the keys of the Aerophone. Still, it sounds like using the instrument for… unintended gaming purposes seems to be a priority now, and he has a very lofty goal.</p><p dir="ltr">"There are only a handful of people who have done a full hitless run of the Dark Souls trilogy back to back. So, playing through all three games back to back without taking a single hit in any of the games."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4428031-elden-ring-doot-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428031" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4428031-elden-ring-doot-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428031"></a><figcaption>Incredible image not at all doctored by Darryn Bonthuys</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4428031-elden-ring-doot-2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But that isn't his Mt. Everest: Dr. Doot's ultimate goal is to complete what the community calls "God Run 3." This consists of beating not only the three Dark Souls games, but also Demon's Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro, and Elden Ring--all without taking a single hit. Only a few people have been able to do this using traditional means, which would make a saxophone run one of the most legendary gaming accomplishments in history.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, one genre proves nearly impossible to play using this method for Dr. Doot: the shooter. Controlling the camera and weapons using the Aerophone proved to be maddening with playing Doom 2016, as did the third-person shooting in the Resident Evil 2 remake. Perhaps someone will create the first true FPS (first-person saxophone) game and allow him to finally cross the genre off his list. For now, however, beating some of the hardest games in the world in one of the funniest ways possible is plenty impressive. Doing so with thousands of people watching, both in-person and online, is even more mind-blowing.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> merch is releasing, even though we still don't actually have a date for the game itself.</p>
<p>Konami's upcoming remake was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-announced">first announced back in May 2023</a>, and will retain the 2004 original's story. This story follows Naked Snake on an operation deep within the Soviet jungle, some 31 years before the events of Metal Gear.</p>
<p>Around this time last year, it was then suggested by PlayStation that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-gives-2024-release-window-to-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-and-silent-hill-2-remake">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater would release at some point in 2024</a>. However, that obviously did not happen. We are now two weeks into 2025, and a release date still remains unknown. But, what we do have in lieu of a date for the game is a date for… Funko Pops.

<p>The Funko Pops in question are modelled on the two main characters in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater – Naked Snake and The Boss.</p>
<p>Naked Snake's figurine is wielding his combat knife. "This skilled soldier is sure to prove himself an invaluable asset to your POP! Games lineup," reads the Amazon description.</p>
<p>The Boss, meanwhile, has her signature The Patriot weapon in her hands and will also "prove herself an invaluable asset to your POP! Games lineup."</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0D98SHGXZ,B0D98W27ML&amp;linkCode=sl2&amp;tag=distrackers-20&amp;linkId=0ba0328aa880433028e4734d8a191b95&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Amazon sale's page</a>, these Funko Pops will be available on 25th March, in America at least (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/DisTrackers/status/1878859570199875716?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1878859570199875716%7Ctwgr%5E84317e71e7c588a514aa5a0a9e82664bf76eca54%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Fmetal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-funko-pops-before-release-date%2F">DisTrackers</a>). So, could we maybe see a release date for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater around then? Well, we will let you know as soon as Konami lifts the lid on the game's launch.</p>

<p>Last year, series producer Noriaki Okamura said Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is being remade as Konami believed that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-is-being-remade-as-konami-says-younger-generation-now-unfamiliar-with-the-series">"younger generation" was now unfamiliar with the series</a>.</p>
<p>Also, did you know that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/20-years-later-konami-confirms-fan-suspicions-metal-gear-solid-3s-eva-was-voiced-by-the-little-mermaid">Metal Gear Solid 3's Eva was actually voiced by the same actor who played Ariel in Disney's The Little Mermaid.</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>2024 was a year to remember for roleplaying games, and 2025 is looking to be no different. Whether you are looking into getting into a new series featuring a brand-new world, returning to a well-known universe, experiencing a well-known universe from another perspective, or enjoying a classic game with improved visuals and new quality-of-life features, the next 12 months will not fail to provide exactly what you are looking for.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Most Anticipated Games of 2025: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2025-excellence-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2025-retro-and-vibrancy/">Indie</a></em></p>
<h2>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II (February 4 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Kingdom-Come-Deliverance-2.png"></a></figure>

<p>The original Kingdom Come: Deliverance was almost a bolt from the blue. Developed by a relatively small team, the game set in 15th-century Bohemia, starring the young blacksmith apprentice Henry from Skalitz, is still to this day one of the most immersive roleplaying games ever released. Very few games managed to make players feel like they were indeed living in a medieval European kingdom as much as the game developed by Warhorse Studios did.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II will not revolutionize the formula of its predecessor, but this should be fine for the vast majority of fans, as the second entry in the series will turn every feature of its predecessor up to eleven, offering a lot more different ways to complete quests, better NPCs reactions to Henry's actions, an improved combat system and much more. With a game world twice as large as that of its predecessor, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II will provide plenty of content for players to get lost once again in 15th-century Bohemia and help Henry better shape his future and his destiny. Read our first impressions from a press preview <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Avowed (February 18 - PC, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Avowed_Wallpaper_3840x2160-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Obsidian Entertainment is a developer that needs no introduction, as it is the studio behind some of the best RPGs ever released, including the celebrated classics Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II, Fallout: New Vegas, and the Pillars of Eternity series, which, together with a few other games, rejuvenated the top-down roleplaying games that were seemingly being left behind in the early 2010s.</p>
<p>Instead of releasing a third entry in the series, Obsidian decided to expand the world of Pillars of Eternity with Avowed, a project that was pitched as the studio's take on the Skyrim formula but eventually became more in line with what the studio always offered: a more focused game with a smaller scope and heavier emphasis on story and characters. While the world may be smaller compared to other roleplaying games, Avowed will still offer plenty of opportunities to have fun as the player investigates the Dream Scourge plague that is scouring the Living Lands as an envoy of the Aedyr Empire, thanks to multiple recruitable companions, a combat system that will incentivize combining magic spells with weapon attacks, plenty of skills to learn and tons of different locations to explore. Our first hands-on with the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-hands-on-preview-eora-from-a-whole-new-perspective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very promising</a>.</p>
<h2>Elden Ring Nightreign (2025 - PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ELDENRING_NIGHTREIGN_Key_Art-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>By all accounts, Elden Ring was a massive success for FromSoftware. The open-world take on the Souls series formula captivated fans all over the world, and the excellent Shadow of the Erdtree expansion didn't sate their hunger for more adventures in The Lands Between. No one, however, would have thought that their next journey to those lands would be with Elden Ring Nightreign.</p>
<p>The new entry in the series will be a slightly different game than its predecessor, twisting its hardcore action roleplaying game formula with co-op mechanics and procedurally generated locations where up to three players will have to survive for three days and prepare for a massive boss battle while the playable area gets shrunk every time a minor boss is defeated. This battle royale-meets-co-op-meets-roguelite-meets-Monster Hunter experience sounds incredibly exciting on paper, and knowing FromSoftware, there's no doubt that they will be more than up to the challenge of expanding the experience of the original game in a rather unexpected way.</p>
<h2>Fable (2025 - PC, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/fable_logo_trailer-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Despite having been announced a while back, there isn't a lot we know about Fable, the next entry in the series since the Kinect game Fable: The Journey, released in 2012. Still, the game is among the most anticipated role-playing games <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-new-gorgeous-trailer-finally-shows-actual-gameplay-launches-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launching this year</a> for the simple reason that it is more Fable!</p>
<p>From the little we have seen so far, Playground Games will not deviate much from the formula seen in the first three entries in the series developed by the now-defunct Lionhead Studios, as the game will still be set in the luscious fantasy world of Albion, where nature and magic live in perfect harmony, where people talk with an unmistakable Shakespearean flourish, and where villains constantly attempt to disrupt peace and order to further their own nefarious ends. As the series has always been about becoming the hero, it will be very interesting to see how the morality system will return and if the player can decide to become not the paladin Albion needs, but a dark knight that still achieves salvation, but with less savory methods. A lot more will inevitably revealed throughout 2025, and we'll make sure to keep you informed of all the latest info.</p>
<h2>Monster Hunter Wilds (February 28 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Monster-Hunter-Wilds-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Monster Hunter Rise is among the most successful entries in the series, but those who got into CAPCOM's franchise with Monster Hunter World were looking for something more than the condensed, combat-centered experience the game offered. These hunters will get what they are looking for this year with the biggest entry in the series to date.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is not looking to reinvent the wheel in any way, but if the open beta is any indication, the game will offer a little bit for every sort of player, no matter what they are looking for. With huge open-world maps to explore teeming with life and danger, including different weather conditions that can massively affect hunts, massive monsters to take down using any of the 14 weapon types available, a huge number of craftable gear coming with skills to create unique builds, and new gameplay mechanics, which include the ability to bring two weapons and Focus Mode that will allow players to better target monster parts to disable certain attacks and obtain specific materials no matter the weapon they are using, Monster Hunter Wilds is setting out to be yet another landmark release in a series whose popularity is set to skyrocket once again, as we've glimpsed in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gamescom-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preview</a>.</p>

<hr><h2>Third Place -&nbsp;Destiny 2</h2>



<p>Developer: Bungie | Release Date: September 6th, 2017</p>

<p>Written by Tyler Chancey</p>

<p><em>Destiny 2</em> has reached a new era. After ten years of being the series that popularized the live service shooter, its current state is less a complete fall and more of a denouement. The main story regarding The Witness has been resolved, but there are still lingering story threads being set up by Bungie's team. Threads that are potentially less cosmic in scope.</p>

<p>Players have been given the most tools to explore the combat sandbox to date. Weapons with the most exotic support mods. Prismatic subclasses allowing for greater player expression. It is a gameplay loop the fanbase has become intimately familiar with, for better or for worse.</p>

<p>The state of the game is a far cry from where it started. But this year, Bungie can officially say that their decade-long story came to its conclusion</p>

<h2>Second Place - Fortnite</h2>



<p>Developer: Epic Games | Release Date: September 26th, 2017</p>

<p>Written by Blair Bishop</p>

<p>Three things in life are certain: Death, taxes, and <em>Fortnite</em>. As Epic continues to embellish and reinforce the creative aspects of what’s possible inside their game, what’s spawned is now a nearly-endless cavalcade of combat game modes, quirky reenactions of multiplayer hits like <em>Phasmophobia </em>and <em>Battlefield</em>, and it’s breathtaking to watch.</p>

<p>That isn’t to detract from its primetime Battle Royale mode, however, which continues to shake up and modify the formula in many different ways. With the re-introduction of <em>Fortnite</em>’s OG island towards the end of the year, it’s clear that Epic are looking to recognize the history of the game that brought them to the peak, and has continued to since 2017.</p>

<h2>Winner - Helldivers 2</h2>



<p>Developer: Arrowhead Game Studios | Release Date: February 8th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Dan Rockwood</p>

<p>When <em>Helldivers 2</em> dropped last February, it offered an impressive array of gameplay options with two battle passes (Warbonds), countless ship and stratagem options, and a wide assortment of maps on two fronts with a variety of mission objectives. Now, nearly a year later, the game has expanded multiple times, cementing its legacy from just another live service game to one of the most iconic titles of 2024.</p>

<p>Though there were issues along the way, like nerfing fire weaponry immediately ahead of releasing the Freedom's Flame Warbond, or requiring Steam players to create and link a PlayStation Network account, these have been largely rectified through patches, indicating to players that Arrowhead Game Studios is listening to their needs.</p>

<p>Today,<em> Helldivers 2</em> offers many more options for new and returning players. There's now a whole new enemy added to the frontlines: the Illuminate alien race, new planets to fight on, vehicles to commandeer, and multiple new warbonds that offer unlockable weapons, armor, and more. With so many changes that helped improve the game throughout 2024, it's exciting to see what the next year will bring.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fortune's Run Development Halted as Developer Sentenced to Prison]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortunes-run-developer-prison</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortunes-run-development-halted-as-developer-sentenced-to-prison.1082796/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortunes-run-developer-prison<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Development on sci-fi immersive sim FPS&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run&nbsp;</em>is being halted, and it's because the developer has been sentenced to three years in prison. Yes, you read that right.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240/view/532087801681805318" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news update on Steam</a>, developer Dizzie, who is now "the sole developer" of&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run</em>, shares that they've been "sentenced to prison for the next three years", describing the sentencing as "a long story".</p>

<p>According to Dizzie, they've been going through the legal process for their case all the time that they've been working on&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run</em>. They say that they were "a very violent person" and that they "hurt a lot of people in [their life]".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortunes-run-development-stopped-dev-prison-punch.jpg?itok=MBQpS2KX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortunes-run-development-stopped-dev-prison-punch.jpg?itok=beU8Mmhl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Development on&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run&nbsp;</em>has been halted for the foreseeable future.</figcaption></figure><p>Cryptically, Dizzie says that "the other developer" on&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run&nbsp;</em>has left the project, stating that after she recovered from "botched surgery", she decided she no longer wanted to work as a game developer.</p>

<p>Dizzie says that their case doesn't relate to&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run</em>'s other developer, Arachne, who is - or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240/view/4234028300480496465" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">was, at one point</a> - Dizzie's wife. They also say that their crime is not a "sex crime", but that they're not going to go into specific charges, simply stating that what they did was "wrong".</p>

<p>Before Dizzie's incarceration, however, they have released a major update for&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run&nbsp;</em>that contains plenty of new story content and gameplay changes. It will invalidate previous save files, though, so you'll have to start a new game if you want to experience it.</p>

<p>You can read the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240/view/532087801681805320" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes for that update right here</a>. Naturally, owing to Dizzie's prison sentence, it may be quite a while before another update for the game is released.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run&nbsp;</em>is, it's an immersive sim-style shooter inspired by the likes of&nbsp;<em>Deus Ex&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>EYE: Divine Cybermancy</em>. It also features what the devs call "the campy tone of space operas and titles like&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid</em>".</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run&nbsp;</em>right now on PC <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1692240/Fortunes_Run/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via Steam Early Access</a>. Again, though, it's probably going to be quite some time before any more content is added to the game, so bear that in mind before you make a purchase.</p>

<p>A Nintendo Switch 2 announcement feels imminent if rumors and leaks are to be believed. Every passing day feels like an excruciating wait for Nintendo fans, so we’ve collated every possible detail including the latest rumors, leaks, and Switch 2 speculation—including a potential Nintendo Direct in January 2025.</p>



<p>March 3, 2017, was a landmark day in the annals of gaming history. It was the official launch of the Nintendo Switch. A money-making phenomenon that has allegedly sold close to (if not more than) <strong>150 million units</strong>. The OG Switch has printed money for Nintendo, and after eight years, it’s about time we got its successor—the long-awaited <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/we-desperately-need-the-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 in 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Rumors and gossip have circulated for months about when its announcement could be. 2025 has picked up where 2024 left off, only, the speculation has intensified one millionfold. The Nintendo Switch 2’s announcement feels closer than ever, and evidence supports this.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-nintendo-switch-2-announcement-date">Do we Know the Nintendo Switch 2 Announcement Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What a line-up. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No official date has been officially or unofficially announced yet regarding the Nintendo Switch 2 announcement, but it’s believed it could arrive on Thursday, January 16.</strong></p>



<p>Nintendo hasn’t confirmed the existence of the console, but it has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-acknowledges-recent-nintendo-switch-2-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledged the Switch 2 leaks</a>. The company’s response was in retaliation to alleged <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-cons-have-seemingly-surfaced-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Cons surfacing</a>. </p>



<p>Nintendo has previously said the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 will be announced before April 2025</a>. Everything feels like it’s dovetailing nicely, and the rumors are only the beginning.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-direct-january-2025-rumors-amp-leaks">Nintendo Direct January 2025 Rumors &amp; Leaks</h2>



<p><strong>A January 2025 Nintendo Direct could be on the cards with the showcase happening as early as the week of January 13.</strong></p>



<p>As of writing, this means the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-revealed-this-week-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 is being announced this week</a>! This is the biggest <em>take with a pinch of salt</em> imaginable, but the source is a reliable one. YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NatetheHate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nate the Hate</a> says the console is going to be shown off, along with a reveal trailer.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Nate also says the Direct will “<strong>focus almost exclusively on the console itself</strong>” and is saving software reveals and information for a later date.</p>



<p>Again, <strong>January 16</strong> is being outed as the crucial date, but we’ll update you as and when we get new information or leaks.</p>

<p>2025 could be a big year for Nintendo Switch 2 games, and possible launch-day software includes <strong>Metroid Prime 4</strong>, <strong>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</strong>, and <strong>classic Xbox titles</strong> too.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-metroid-prime-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4 Beyond</a> seems like a logical choice to help shift units at launch.

<p>Arrowhead Game Studios CEO has recently stated that he would like to see A-list actors “get violently killed” in the upcoming Helldivers movie.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted on the r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1i1sa6p/arrowhead_ceo_on_actors_for_the_helldivers_movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Helldivers</a> subreddit (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/helldivers-2-movie-arrowhead-wants-hollywood-stars-die-opening-montage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>), the Helldivers 2 community has been discussing the upcoming movie in its official Discord channel, where the CEO, Shams Jorjani, recently shared some interesting thoughts. When asked whether the team knows details about the upcoming film, Jorjani responded that they do have some information, as the production keeps them “in the loop.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jorjani was also asked whether A-list actors like “Chris Pratt” will be featured in the upcoming Helldivers movie. He replied that the whole team is “hoping for as many A-list actors as possible—as long as they all get killed violently immediately.” </p>



<p>The essence of Helldivers 2 comes from giving your life for democracy, and the developers want this same form of hilarious self-sacrifice to be relayed in the movie, too.&nbsp;Players have already started making their predictions in the comment section, hoping to see the likes of Sean Bean, Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Tom Holland and more get killed. Fans also don’t mind joining in as nameless actors if they get the opportunity to be mowed down by friendly fire. </p>



<p>On the topic of the Helldivers movie, the creative director also revealed Arrowhead’s involvement in the upcoming film, explaining that they are unaware of what it takes to make a movie and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-director-talks-about-their-involvement-with-the-upcoming-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“don’t, and shouldn’t, have the final say.”</a></p>



<p>In other news, Helldivers 2 developers have already begun fleshing out the ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-dev-next-game-concept/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high concept’ for the team’s next game</a>. Also, the title was Insider Gaming Community’s&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-best-multiplayer-game-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Best Multiplayer Game” of 2024</a>.

                <p>Microsoft reportedly considered completely shutting down Xbox in 2021, prior to its acquisition of ZeniMax and Activision Blizzard.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsofts-gaming-business-falls-short-despite-activision" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Information</a>, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly had the choice in 2021 of winding down Xbox, or acquiring more studios to drive Game Pass subscriptions. He chose the latter, purchasing both ZeniMax for $7 billion in 2021 and Activision Blizzard for $75.4 billion in 2023.</p><p>Some big-name studios have also reportedly have not been swayed by Xbox Game Pass, which doesn't bode well for Microsoft's internal target numbers. Prior to its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft reportedly wanted to hit 100 million Game Pass subscribers by 2030, which would mean tripling its current base in five years. However, Microsoft has reportedly been unable to hit Game Pass internal growth targets in the past two years.</p><p>Microsoft also reportedly wanted other developers to rent its Azure servers after the Activision acquisition. Ironically, Activision reportedly still rents Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services while using its own servers for development, instead of utilizing Azure.</p><p>Since the launch of Xbox Series X|S, Microsoft has seen some ups and downs, including the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">closure of four of its own ZeniMax studios</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cuts-650-more-gaming-jobs-but-no-studios-closed-or-games-canceled/1100-6526439/" data-ref-id="1100-6526439">lay offs</a> last year. While many developers participate in putting their games on Game Pass, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said back in 2022 that it doesn't make sense to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-launching-new-games-into-a-subscription-service-like-game-pass-makes-no-sense/1100-6509015/" data-ref-id="1100-6509015">put new releases into the service on launch day</a>.</p>

                <p>A new report may contain fresh clues about the apparent partnership between Ubisoft and Tencent, Ubisoft's fortunes continue to slide and the company looks for a way forward.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-15/tencent-guillemot-family-are-said-to-mull-ubisoft-asset-venture" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> reported that Ubisoft and Tencent are considering, among other options, "creating a new venture" that could include "certain Ubisoft assets." The overall aim is to improve the company's value, sources said. The two companies are now "evaluating which assets to include in a new entity and their valuation," the report said, citing anonymous sources.</p><p>Should a deal come together, Tencent could "gain more control over" some of Ubisoft's franchises, the report said, adding that Tencent would also benefit from improving its own business results outside of China.</p><p>Sources told Bloomberg that no final decisions have been made and that conversations remain ongoing. None of this should be surprising, either, as Ubisoft said on January 9 that it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-refuses-to-comment-on-tencent-rumors-but-says-its-exploring-options-to-maximize-value/1100-6528718/" data-ref-id="1100-6528718">appointed advisors to examine opportunities for Ubisoft to maximize the value of its company</a> through a variety of possible business maneuvers. In a conference call, though, Ubisoft declined to comment on the reported Tencent discussions, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-reportedly-considering-a-major-change-to-its-structure/1100-6526909/" data-ref-id="1100-6526909">date back many months.</a></p><p>A spokesperson for Tencent declined to comment when approached by Bloomberg, while a representative for Ubisoft pointed to the January 9 announcement.</p><p>During a conference call, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said he sees "several potential paths" for the company and its franchises going forward to maximize shareholder value. It was previously reported that Ubisoft was considering numerous different possibilities for its future, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-reportedly-considering-a-major-change-to-its-structure/1100-6526909/" data-ref-id="1100-6526909">selling to Tencent.</a></p><p>On the call, Ubisoft declined to comment on the report of the company potentially selling to Tencent, but management said it is "exploring different options," adding, "We can't say more."</p><p>Ubisoft's share price rose on January 15, following the publication of Bloomberg's report. This came after periods of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-stock-sinks-to-10-year-low-as-star-wars-outlaws-underperforms/1100-6526262/" data-ref-id="1100-6526262">consistent declines.</a> Ubisoft recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20/1100-6528717/" data-ref-id="1100-6528717">delayed its next big game, Assassin's Creed Shadows, to March.</a></p><p>In related news, the Biden administration recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/us-blacklists-tencent-over-alleged-ties-with-chinese-military/1100-6528668/" data-ref-id="1100-6528668">added Tencent to a list of companies affiliated with the Chinese military.</a> Tencent said the US government "clearly" made a mistake, going on to deny that it is a military company or supplier for the Chinese government.</p>
