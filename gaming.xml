            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>New details regarding Xbox's cancelled Perfect Dark reboot have leaked online through a report on <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/gameplay-details-concept-screens-cancelled-perfect-dark-reboot">MP1st</a>, giving us a little more of an idea of what this game might have tried with its gameplay mechanics, the opportunity its developer The Initiative and Microsoft saw with it, and a few pieces of concept art.</p>



<p>When Microsoft announced that Perfect Dark was going to be the debut game for its new "<em>AAAA</em>" studio, The Initiative in <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-xbox-series-x-s-microsoft-game-awards-2020/">2020</a>, even if there was a sense that it was announced far too early, there was a buzz of excitement from fans. Jump ahead five years, and not only is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">Perfect Dark reboot cancelled, but The Initiative is gone</a>, with the studio and its would-be debut game being one of the many major casualties from Microsoft's <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">massive 9,000+ layoff</a> this past July.</p>



<p>Before any of that happened, per MP1st's sources, Microsoft saw bringing back Perfect Dark as a chance to take advantage of the fact that two other major videogame secret agent-types were missing from the industry, namely 007 and Solid Snake. Of course, that's no longer the case, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> putting the MGS series firmly back in players' minds and IO Interactive working up to its <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-uncharted-x-hitman-qa-narrative-drives-things/">007 First Light</a> release, but back in 2020, both series had been absent from gaming for some time.</p>



<p>Gameplay-wise, the documentation mentions three concepts called the Relentless System, the Reward System, and the Adrenaline System, though only the last of those three were detailed in the documents.</p>



<p>The Adrenaline system would have let players slow down time to dodge incoming bullets, line up their own shots, and move faster than surrounding enemies. It would also have let Joanna Dark do more damage to enemies, heal more, and reduce damage taken.</p>



<figure><figcaption>A piece of concept art from the cancelled Perfect Dark reboot via a report from MP1st.</figcaption></figure>



<p>There's also mention of a vertical slice that would have consisted of "<em>Season 1</em>" for the game, which gives some weight to rumors that the game would have had an episodic-style release, though at this point, who can say if they would have definitively gone that route.</p>



<p>Overall, to say it's unfortunate that this game never came to pass is an understatement, especially since it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-nearly-saved-take-two-deal-fell-through/">almost saved after Microsoft dropped the ball</a>. Yes, Joanna Dark no longer would have had the open window previously granted due to the absence of MGS and 007, but I doubt that anyone would have minded having three great modern stealth-action games to play. </p>



<p>Just <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-initiative-studio-head-leaves-xbox-feels-pride-perfect-dark-remake/">last week</a>, former studio head of The Initiative, Darrell Gallagher, left Xbox, and said he "<em></em><em>couldn’t be prouder of the talented and passionate team I had the privilege assemble and lead</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I leave with nothing but pride in what we accomplished together and excitement for what’s next — both for myself and for the amazing developers I was fortunate enough to work with.</em>"</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-fe-deal-throws-in-a-free-smarttag2-at-record-low-while-apple-never-bundles-airtags-2000627201</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-fe-deal-throws-in-a-free-smarttag2-at-record-low-while-apple-never-bundles-airtags.1304322/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Galaxy Buds 3 FE are a more affordable option to the their Buds 3 Pro counterpart, but what’s the real difference? first up is the drivers. The FE model employ just one 11mm driver in each earbud. With the Pro model, you get a dual-driver setup combining a 10.5mm dynamic driver with a 6.5 planar magnetic driver on each side. So as one would expect, you’ll get better sound on the Buds 3 Pro, but that’s not to say the FE model sound won’t be good.</p>
<p>Both sets of earbuds support active noise cancellation, but that on the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro is more robust—allowing you to fine tune the ANC strength based on environmental factors.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4219/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>SmartTag 2 Included</h2>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4219/">So if those aren’t deal breakers for you, you might as well save some cash. Plus, right now, Amazon is offering the Buds 3 FE for $30 off.</a> The price comes down from $180 to just $150, but that’s not all. Samsung is throwing in a SmartTag 2 free of charge when you order a pair.</p>
<p>These Samsung SmartTags can be a real life saver. We all know how Find My Phone functionality works. If you ever leave your phone behind, it’s not lost forever. You can pinpoint it’s exact location no matter where you are. Well, SmartTags brings that ability to anything you own. Stick it in your wallet or purse so you can always remember where you last set it down. Heck, you can even leave one in your glove compartment so you can always recall what block your parked your car on.</p>



<p>Back to the Galaxy Buds 3 FE, you’re getting a reliable set of earbuds without breaking the bank. This generation Samsung earbuds has an improved design and fit from the previous models. The rounded ear tips help keep them securely in place as you listen all day long.</p>
<p>With ANC turned off, you’ll get up to 8.5 hours of uninterrupted listening time on the earbuds alone. When you add in the charging case’s battery, you can receive up to 30 hours of playtime total.</p>
<p>Connect your Galaxy Buds 3 FE to your multiple devices at once. You can effortlessly switch between your phone, tablet, and PC as your needs change. You could be watching a video on your laptop when a call comes in. Answer it and have the audio come through your earbuds without changing a thing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4219/">This deal is only available through September 28, so make moves on it while you can.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/more-details-about-xbox%E2%80%99s-canceled-perfect-dark-reportedly-leak.1304319/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Like lots of canceled games, the more I hear about <em>Perfect Dark</em>, the cooler it sounds. Also is Tom Holland okay? And which Metal Gear should get the Unreal Engine 5 glow-up next? Face the new week with the latest edition of <em>Kotaku</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/morning-checkpoint">Morning Checkpoint</a> at your side. The daily roundup of gaming news and culture breezes you through some of the biggest headlines going around. I stayed up until 3 a.m. this morning reviewing video games because it’s that time of year. I’m very tired but not too tired to contemplate which movies would <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thegaychingy.bsky.social/post/3lze5vfxclk2q">make Carl’s top five in the Criterion closet</a>.</p> <h2>Some more <em>Perfect Dark</em> reboot details leak</h2> <p>Microsoft’s canceled Xbox exclusive <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-reportedly-cancels-that-cool-looking-perfect-dark-1851785531">might have been originally planned</a> as an episodic release. That’s according to a new <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/gameplay-details-concept-screens-cancelled-perfect-dark-reboot">report by<em> MP1st</em></a>. If accurate, that might have made the espionage shooter’s rollout similar to that of <em>Hitman</em> (2016). According to leaked development materials reviewed by the website, The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics were working on the game’s first robust vertical slice right up until it was canceled this summer.</p> <p>The report also details a planned Adrenaline System which would be a resource that let players pull off <a href="https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-xbox-showcase-gameplay-1851528864"><em>Matrix</em>-like abilities</a> ranging from healing and increased damage to slowing down time for aiming and dodging bullets. Leaked concept art points to an “Eco Sci-Fi” version of Cairo, the setting of an early teaser, as being one of the locations to ship in the first episode of the game. <a href="https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-canceled-take-two-embracer-xbox-crystal-dynamics-2000622400"><em>Bloomberg</em> recently reported</a> that 2K Games was looking to takeover publishing but couldn’t work out a deal with Microsoft and Embracer over rights to the IP.</p>

 <h2>Tom Holland rushed to hospital after botched <em>Spider-Man</em> movie stunt</h2> <p>Tom Holland has been doing <a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-brand-new-day-4-mcu-suit-tom-holland-set-2000616006">cool stunts</a> in London while filming <i>Spider-Man: Brand New Day</i>, Unfortunately at least one of them didn’t go as planned and he’s now recovering. “We were called at 10.30am on Friday to attend to a patient who had sustained an injury at Leavesden Studios in Watford,” an East of England Ambulance Service spokesman told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/36792761/tom-holland-hospital-spider-man-stunt/"><em>The Sun</em></a> yesterday. “An ambulance was sent to the scene, and the patient was transported to hospital for further care.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/tom-holland-hospitalized-spider-man-brand-new-day-1236552019/">According to <em>Deadline</em></a>, Holland suffered a concussion and filming has been paused for a couple of days as a precaution. Hopefully, he can make a speedy recovery even with out the real Spidey’s mutant super healing.</p> <h2>Which <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> should get the remake treatment next?</h2> <p>A poll has been recently <a href="https://x.com/MGSMGN/status/1969354623007014979/photo/2">shared on X</a> which looks to be one Konami intends to send out after a <em>Metal Gear</em>-focused livestream later this week from TGS. The poll asks fans which other <em>Metal Gear </em>games they’d like to see remade, following the recent release of <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>. <em>MGS 2: Sons of Liberty</em> is the obvious choice, though I could see the case for <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> as well.<em> Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</em>, meanwhile, remains trapped on PS3, though fans suspect the <em>Master Collection Vol. 2</em>, whenever it’s ready, will finally port it to modern consoles.</p>

 <h2><em>Nintendo vs. Palworld</em> is currently a debate about mods</h2> <p><a href="https://gamesfray.com/gross-in-palworld-patent-case-nintendo-tells-japanese-judge-mods-should-not-count-as-prior-art-because-they-cant-run-without-underlying-games/">According to <em>Games Fray</em></a>, part of Pocket Pair’s defense in Nintendo’s patent lawsuit is that certain mechanics Nintendo claims as its own were already in use in other games, including versions modded by players. Nintendo is reportedly arguing that mods don’t count as “prior art” because they can’t exist or run separate from the game’s they were made for.</p>

 <h2><em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> nerfs nudity in Japan</h2> <p>The open-world zombie adventure is reportedly censoring certain depictions in Japan. The tweaks include changes to female zombies and the removal of all nudity, according to <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/09/19/157365.html"><em>Game Spark</em></a> (via<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dying-light-the-beast-is-the-latest-game-to-be-censored-in-japan/"><em> VGC</em></a>). “These changes have resulted in an overall tone down on violent scenes, while still allowing Japanese players to enjoy seamless co-op play with friends playing the overseas version.”</p>

 <h2><em>Tomb Raider</em> remaster patches out AI voice performance changes</h2> <p>The French version of <em>Tomb Raider 4-6 Remastered</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/lara-croft-tomb-raider-francoise-cadol-aspyr-remaster-2000624934">was accused</a> of using AI to alter an actor’s performance. Those accusations appear to have been well-founded now, because Aspyr has gone and removed the AI alterations from the game. “We’ve addressed this issue by removing all AI voiceover content, while retaining the improvements made in the previous update,” the studio <a href="https://support.aspyr.com/hc/en-us/articles/39710879443853-Tomb-Raider-IV-VI-Remastered-Hotfix-for-Patch-2">wrote announcing a surprise hotfix update</a> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tomb-raider-lara-croft-lawsuit-aspyr-patch/"><em>The Gamer</em></a>). “We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. Please reach out to our customer support site with any issues.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149">Our big <em>Borderlands 4</em> review is here</a></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-rival-shadow-vector-cream-vanilla-2000627156"><em>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</em> might be better than <em>Mario Kart World</em></a></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-match-3-rpg-that-started-it-all-is-back-and-we-talk-to-its-legendary-creator-2000626834">The mastermind behind one of the best puzzle games ever talks about trying to bring back a classic</a></p> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"I wish I could shield them all from the sweats and bigots."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> Delulu, the game's new battle royale mode with proximity voice chat, has launched to big player numbers but also a surge of complaints around in-game abuse — prompting Epic Games to issue "thousands" of bans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Delulu enjoyed a concurrent peak of 126,553 players after its launch this past weekend, enough to make it one of Fortnite's most popular modes over the period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Set on the game's main battle royale map, Delulu sprinkles players evenly across its surface and allows them to team up and chat with anyone in their vicinity. Gameplay-wise, the mode is based around the new ability to form drop-in, drop-out squads (which have friendly fire disabled), while the ability to talk with others adds a fresh layer of social interactivity, as players encounter others and try to work out who's friendly — and who's not. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Experiences of the mode are wildly mixed, as is perhaps to be expected when dealing with something that relies entirely on the online behavior of others. Some have praised the positive experiences they've encountered while playing, but many have highlighted the frequent use of hate speech and slurs, and the targeting of players because of their accent, their age or because they're a woman.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reddit is awash with players trying Delulu and reporting back with their experiences and it's a mixed bag. In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1nmom8n/my_fellow_ladies_hows_delulu/?share_id=mVMbddjLxTuF5MU4jyEio" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thread</a> titled "My fellow ladies: How's Delulu," a woman asks others for their take. The responses detail a list of sexist comments that some women have received, though others state they had more positive experiences. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's been terrible for me so far," wrote Forever_Winter13. "I've been playing solo and there hasn't been one game where I haven't been told horrendous things I don't wish to repeat. I just want to have fun and enjoy the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For the most part, it's been completely fine," wrote Glitter_Fox_. "But there was one group of guys who kept appearing in the same lobbies as me that would purposely hunt down any female voice they heard. They literally would yell 'equality' as they shoot you."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Just as bad for guys," countered PlayfulBus8433. "Every French kid and his mother asks you to call him daddy or they will kill you."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">We Build the LEGO Fortnite Mecha Team Leader</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1nmq893/fortnite_delulu_mode_on_middle_east_server_is_a/?share_id=1FpegS2QRPZXbwjdZhhGo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thread</a>, a player on Fortnite's Middle East server highlighted their experience of "rampant" racism and discrimination attempting to play as an Indian in lobbies mostly filled by those speaking other languages. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's like a language gatekeeping squad rolled into a battle royale," wrote KatsukiNEO. "Worse, I’ve heard racist slurs thrown around casually. Proximity chat has turned into a tool for discrimination instead of fun."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Can't go a single game on EU [Fortnite's European server] without hearing at least three different people spamming the N-word," replied CareRarely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, before the weekend was out, Fortnite developer Epic Games <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1969845572325494908" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a> to remind players to "remember to report voice chat behavior in-game that violates our community rules. This gives us evidence to quickly take action against rule breakers." The post highlighted the game's relatively straightforward method of quickly reporting a conversation they've heard, and stated that the company was working on the matter, with "thousands banned already this weekend."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Remember to report voice chat behavior in-game that violates our community rules. This gives us evidence to quickly take action against rule breakers.</p><p>👉 Open the Sidebar and go to the Voice Chat tab<br>🎙️ Choose ‘Report Conversation’<br>📩 On the next screen hit ‘Submit’</p><p>Thousands… <a href="https://t.co/Bin5GaqRRV" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Bin5GaqRRV</a></p></div>— Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1969845572325494908?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 21, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Amid the toxicity, however, other players reported having a better time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I have some anxiety with talking to people online that I was expecting the worst out of this game mode," wrote SpadesofDarkness, in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1nn4suo/delulu_changed_fortnite/?share_id=9IwBgwCoGbZfUYUY5ueRu" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> post full of more positive experiences. "But man, this is genuinely some of the most fun I’ve had in Fortnite. While I definitely have seen a couple of people spamming the N-word, a majority of the people I've met have either been really chill or just a hoot to talk to."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I had so much fun this weekend," added meemii8. "My highlights were me running across the map to meet my son and getting shot at by a group. When I shouted 'no, no I'm just trying to find my son let me go,' one of them said 'wait, wait hold up, stop shooting.' They let me join them and said they'd help look and we went on a Finding Nemo-style hunt across the map looking for him and calling out for him amongst the groups. We found him haha. Also getting to the end and letting a little kid on our team get the umbrella, hearing him so happy made my day."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There are so many sweet kids in this mode," concluded racdcp. "I wish I could shield them all from the sweats and bigots."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic Games is yet to announce whether Delulu will become a permanent Fortnite offering, and will likely be looking over the feedback from this weekend as the game mode goes offline — for now. Delulu is next set to go live during the coming weekend — it'll be interesting to see if the continued bans (and visible threat of action) will have any impact on player behavior.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Trophies for an unannounced Tomb Raider: Anniversary PS4 port have popped up online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this may not sound too surprising given we've had a bunch of classic Tomb Raider games remastered recently — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tomb-raider-i-iii-remastered"><u>Tomb Raider I-III Remastered</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tomb-raider-iv-vi-remastered"><u>IV-VI Remastered collections</u></a> released in February 2024 and 2025, respectively — it looks like this may be a port rather than a remaster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How do we know that? Well, we don't for sure, but the trophies — which can be seen on PlayStation trophy tracking site <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/game/Tomb-Raider-Anniversary/trophies" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>True Trophies</u></a> — are limited, and the images are, too, which suggests this is a port coming to something like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/igneditorial/lists/playstation-plus-premium-tier-games"><u>PlayStation Plus game catalog </u></a>rather than a full-on remake.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Redditor VeldinX explained on their thread "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/1nmlwuc/anniversary_leaked_for_ps4/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Anniversary leaked for PS4</u></a>," "the style of this leaked list tracks with other games released for Sony’s classics catalogue, e.g. the small number of trophies and the design of the images.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <div> <p>Chrome Boba Fett and the little baby Yoda are here to help you forget all about Disney’s complicity in <a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-fallon-colbert-stewart-trump-kirk-2000627249">a grim attack on free speech</a>. Out in less than nine months, <em>The Mandalorian and Grogu&nbsp;</em>now has its first trailer, and the next<em> Star Wars</em> movie looks both incredibly unnecessary and also lots of fun.</p> </div>  <p>The film stars Pedro Pascal as the Mandalorian bounty hunter, with his Force-sensitive sidekick Grogu looking as adorable as ever. Set after the TV series, the film finds the pair back in the galactic hotseat, navigating post-war tensions between the New Republic (Sigourney Weaver plays a colonel named Ward) and remnants of the Empire (Jonny Coyne plays an imperial warlord). Also Jabba the Hutt’s son Rotta is in the mix too.</p>  <p>Here’s a brief look:</p>   <p>The whole 90 seconds flashes by in an instant, but in addition to the aforementioned characters you can also catch a glimpse of some alien guy messing people up with an electrostaff and Grogu speeding around with some other cute god-knows-whats (paging <em>Star Wars</em> lore master Zack Zwiezen). But like I said at the top, it looks fun and not mired down in a bunch of <em>Star Wars</em> naval-gazing mythbuilding, which is a good a thing.</p> <p><em>The Mandalorian and Grogu </em>is directed by Jon Favreau and co-written by Favreau and Dave Filoni, and marks the first in a fresh slate of upcoming<em> Star Wars</em> movies for Disney. With everything else, including a new Jedi-centric tale with <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-new-jedi-order-writer-replaced-rey-delayed-1851747797">Daisy Ridley returning as Rey completely MIA</a>, it’ll either feel like the start of something new or the death knell for the current streaming-wars-burnout incarnation of the franchise. The movie hits theaters on May 22, 2026, and can’t come soon enough for a <a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney-boycott-marvel-marisa-tomei-2000627135">company currently facing a boycott</a> from fans and celebrities over the Jimmy Kimmel controversy.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-sales-revenue</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-sales-reach-2-5m-as-revenue-climbs.1304256/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to new sales data,&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>has racked up quite a few sales for itself since launching earlier in September, and it's making a pretty tidy packet for its developer and publisher as well.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/borderlands-4-amasses-over-25m-players-since-launch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, data firm Alinea Analytics says that&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>has sold over 2.5 million copies since it was released on September 12th, resulting in revenues exceeding $150 million. That's a pretty impressive set of figures.</p>

<p>Alinea's data claims that around 1.3 million of the game's sales were on PC via Steam, and that over a million players have picked up&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>on both console platforms on which it's available. Honestly, that's a much more even split than I was expecting.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/borderlands-4-sales-shooting.jpg?itok=uV9qzfHf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/borderlands-4-sales-shooting.jpg?itok=cH0_nZ62 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>has sold pretty well.</figcaption></figure><p>If you want some demographic breakdowns, Alinea has those as well. Over half of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s player base on PC is based in the US, and the next most popular regions are China, Germany, the UK, and Canada.</p>

<p>However, on PS5, the story is a little different. Again, more than half of the game's players on PS5 are in the US, followed by the UK, Germany, France, and Canada. Alinea doesn't provide data for Xbox Series X|S players.</p>

<p>According to Alinea's data, 59% of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>players on PC played&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/borderlands-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Borderlands 2</em></a>, while 55% played&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/borderlands-3" rel="nofollow">Borderlands 3</a>&nbsp;</em>and just 22% played the spinoff title&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tiny-tinas-wonderlands" rel="nofollow"><em>Tiny Tina's Wonderlands</em></a>.</p>

<p>Those figures are higher on PlayStation; as Alinea points out, previous&nbsp;<em>Borderlands&nbsp;</em>games have been made available as part of PlayStation Plus, so 81% of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s player base on the console has checked out&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 3</em>.</p>




<p><em>Borderlands 4</em>'s strong sales performance comes despite widespread criticism of the game's performance on PC, which prompted Gearbox head Randy Pitchford to launch into an impassioned (and lengthy) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/randy-pitchford-borderlands-4-performance-comments" rel="nofollow">defense of his game on social media</a>.</p>

<p>Despite Pitchford's comments, 2K and Gearbox have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-pc-performance-top-priority" rel="nofollow">pledged to improve the game's PC version</a>, calling it their "top priority". Presumably, doing so will lead to even more sales for them.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/borderlands-4/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/borderlands-4/9MX6HKF5647G" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things&nbsp;<em>Borderlands</em>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-f/" data-ref-id="5000-574203">Silent Hill f</a> is the newest entry in Konami's long-running survival horror franchise, tasking players with navigating the fictional town of Ebisugaoka in 1960s Japan as they attempt to uncover the mystery of a creeping fog that has produced bloodthirsty monsters around every corner. With this change in setting, Silent Hill f manages to be a great onboarding spot for series newcomers while maintaining plenty of familiar themes long-time players will recognize. But whether you're new to Silent Hill or a returning fan, you'll probably want to know how much playtime you can get out of this horrifying adventure. So, here's how long it takes to beat Silent Hill f.</p><h2>How long is Silent Hill f - Campaign length and replayability</h2><p>An average playthrough of Silent Hill f should take <strong>between 12-14 hours on Hard (normal) difficulty</strong>. This includes time spent solving puzzles and exploring at least some of the game's optional paths for additional healing items, upgrade materials, and weapons. However, those looking to advance through the campaign with less resistance can use the Story (easy) difficulty to reduce the combat and puzzle challenges, potentially allowing for a quicker completion.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Silent Hill f - Official Story Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Silent Hill f is a game designed to be played multiple times, though. While you can beat the game just once if you wish, additional playthroughs--which let you carry over your health, stamina, and sanity upgrades--unravel even more story content. Not only do subsequent runs provide fresh cutscenes and boss changes, but they also provide the opportunity to see up to 5 total endings, revealing more and more of the unsettling story surrounding main character Shimizu Hinako.</p><p>Additionally, completionists will find that there are quite a few reasons to keep playing the campaign through multiple times, as getting every trophy or achievement won't be possible in a single playthrough. You'll need to continue into NG+ to keep earning consumable currency known as Faith so that you're able to purchase all the upgrades and omamori (accessories). And any one-off trophies or achievements you missed your first time or two through can always be tried again on a new run.</p><p>With so much replayability, Silent Hill f can provide dozens of hours of entertainment to survival horror enthusiasts. If that sounds like something you're eager to dive into yourself, you can pick up Silent Hill f now on PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) - Official Release Date Reveal | Trailer 2</p>
      </div>
<p>Instead, Ogg said he prefers books. He encouraged people to read Crime and Punishment from Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky.</p><p>"Someone said, 'At some point, you should play GTA 5.' I said, 'Why?' They said, 'Because it's so great.' And I said, 'Well, one day you should read Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment.' And then he went completely blank. Books are my thing," he said.</p><p>Ogg has previously discussed his inability to play video games, saying at one point he tried, but kept failing to progress and just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/tYo-zfFngfI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kept ramming into a wall with his character.</a></p><p>Ogg was said to have<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-have-had-a-james-bond-like-story-dlc-actor-says/1100-6522891/" data-ref-id="1100-6522891"> recorded lines for a James Bond-like story DLC for GTA 5</a> that would have seen Trevor going undercover. However, that add-on obviously never happened, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-is-why-gta-5-trevor-dlc-was-reportedly-scrapped/1100-6524713/" data-ref-id="1100-6524713">it was reportedly scrapped because of the success of GTA Online</a>. He's also said he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-trevor-actor-wants-a-very-definitive-exit-in-gta-6/1100-6529064/" data-ref-id="1100-6529064">hopes Trevor shows up in GTA 6 so the character can be killed off.</a></p><p>Ogg is best known in gaming for GTA 5, but he's also known for playing Simon in more than 20 episodes of The Walking Dead. He also had a recurring role in the Snowpiercer TV series and was in a pair of Better Call Saul episodes as well. Ogg is also known for his <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/steven-ogg-old-spice-commercials-indie-films-1235116757/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">series of absurd Old Spice commercials.</a></p><p>The actor had roles in the video games Alone in the Dark (2008) and Cursed Mountain (2009) prior to his breakout success as Trevor in 2013's GTA 5. He hasn't done another video game since, however.</p><p>GTA 6 launches in May 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. The game stars Jason and Lucia, but Rockstar has not yet announced the actors playing those lead roles. Check out the gallery below to learn more about Jason, Lucia, and all the other main characters in GTA 6's story.</p>

            <p>This year has marked Xbox's "largest investment in Game Pass to date", according to ID@Xbox boss Chris Charla.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-xboxs-increasingly-vital-indie-publishing-operation">Eurogamer</a>, Charla discussed the current state of the subscription service in the face of recent criticism, noting positive sentiment from developers and a desire to return for future projects.</p>
<p>"The majority of partners who've had a game in Game Pass want to bring their future titles to the service," said Charla. "As a result, we've signed deals with more than 150 partners to expand the catalogue. We continue to engage with hundreds of partners each year to review upcoming titles.</p>
<p>"Last year, we worked with over 50 teams to sign their first Game Pass deal. This year marks our largest investment in Game Pass to date, and we remain focused on delivering the most exciting and diverse catalogue in gaming."</p>
<p>Xbox has received criticism for Game Pass in recent months. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arkane-studios-founder-calls-game-pass-unsustainable-model-and-one-which-is-damaging-the-industry">Arkane Studios founder Raphael Colantonio</a> described the service as "an unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade".</p>
<p>In a back and forth on social media on the "cannibalisation" of sales, Larian director of publishing Michael Douse added "smaller teams with new or riskier" games can benefit from Game Pass, but he prefers "Sony's 'lifecycle management'" method of adding games following initial sales.</p><p>Former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden discussed the perceived profitability of Game Pass in a discussion with <a href="http://gamesindustry.biz/">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. "There's a lot of debates going on," he said. "Is Game Pass profitable? Is Game Pass not profitable? What does that mean? That's really not the right question to ask anyway.</p>
<p>"You can do all kinds of financial jiggery-pokery for any sort of corporate service to make it look profitable if you wanted to. You take enough costs out and say that's off the balance sheet and, oh look, it's profitable now. The real issue for me on things like Game Pass is, is it healthy for the developer?"</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/football-manager-player-numbers-are-through-the-roof-thanks-to-subscription-platforms-like-game-pass-and-netflix-series-boss-miles-jacobson-explains-how">Football Manager boss Miles Jacobson recently told Eurogamer</a> player numbers for the series have skyrocketed since being added to subscription platforms. </p>
<p>"We built a whole business model around it," he said. "You can't just turn around and do this - this was before we launched on the subscription platforms, we'd been talking about it. And we'd been working out what we were going to do for five years - it was a five-year journey before we went with the first experiment, and then we did another experiment, and then we did another experiment, and then we learned from those experiments, and that's when the full strategy was put in place."</p><p>In a broader interview with Eurogamer on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-xboxs-increasingly-vital-indie-publishing-operation">state of indie games on Xbox</a>, Charla noted the breadth of games showcased by Xbox at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a>. "It is just really a recognition by Xbox of the absolute crucial need for diversity in our portfolio," he said.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/canceled-perfect-dark-reboot-info</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-info-about-canceled-perfect-dark-reboot-surfaces-including-images-and-more.1304223/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>New details have emerged regarding The Initiative's canceled&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>reboot, including some of the locales the game would have taken you to and what kind of gameplay systems it would have offered.</p>

<p>Back in July, as part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">wider Microsoft layoff wave</a>,&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">was canceled</a>, and developer The Initiative's doors were closed for good (and that game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">wasn't the only casualty</a> of those layoffs either).</p>

<p>Now, a new report from <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/gameplay-details-concept-screens-cancelled-perfect-dark-reboot" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MP1st</a>&nbsp;details what kind of game The Initiative was working on, and it turns out that the studio was looking to fill a niche left open by the absence of newer&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>007&nbsp;</em>games. As MP1st points out, it's a little ironic that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-1m-sales" rel="nofollow">both</a> of those franchises are now <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/007-first-light-release-date" rel="nofollow">active</a> and&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>isn't.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-scanning.jpg?itok=2PdYYkAJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-scanning.jpg?itok=ws5FK6Qf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>No, that 2024 Xbox&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>trailer wasn't fake...mostly.</figcaption></figure><p>The report, which uses material obtained from "a former developer" on the project, also clarifies that contrary to rumor, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-xbox-showcase-2024-announcement" rel="nofollow">2024 Xbox showcase</a> trailer for&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>wasn't fake. Despite containing "fake stuff", the trailer did show a demo that was internally playable.</p>

<p>According to MP1st's report,&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>would have taken place in a variety of locales around the world, including the likes of Cairo. They'd have been depicted in an aesthetic internally referred to as "eco sci-fi", marrying futuristic visuals with green tech.</p>

<p>Additionally, one major gameplay system, the Adrenaline System, is detailed in the report. Apparently, Adrenaline would have been a resource that players built up over time, allowing access to skills like healing, reducing incoming damage, and more.</p>

<p>The report claims that the material featured within was intended to be part of&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark</em>'s "Season 1", which, as MP1st points out, could well lend credence to the idea that the game was intended to be episodic at one point.</p>




<p>Of course, all of this is moot given that&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>was canceled earlier this year, but who knows? Maybe some of the material in this report will make its way into another Xbox project somewhere down the line. Stay tuned for more.</p>

                <p>For the better part of a decade, French gaming developers Laurent Lechat and Boris Marmontel had their game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/planet-centauri/" data-ref-id="5000-453058">Planet Centauri </a>in early access on Steam. However, the game's 1.0 launch arrived last year with a resounding thud, and Valve is accepting the blame for not notifying the 100,000-plus players who had wishlisted it on Steam.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBf5mZFUbpU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hBf5mZFUbpU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In a recent post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1nfd2ji/this_is_how_steam_can_ruin_more_than_10_years_of/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/valve-steam-alpha-centauri-launch-bug-daily-deal-terraria/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>), Lechat shared excerpts from an email sent out by Valve that explained why Planet Centauri's launch failed to get much traction.</p><p>"We found a bug that impacted a very small number of game releases (less than 100 since 2015) where wishlist email notifications for the launch of a game were not sent," wrote a Valve spokesperson. "Unfortunately, your game Planet Centauri was among those included. We intend for this feature to work for every game and we're inviting you to a Daily Deal as a way to help make up for lost visibility from your launch day."</p><p>Lechat explained at length how the dismal response to Planet Centauri disheartened himself and Marmontel. He also seemed wary about Valve's offer before other users on Reddit urged them to accept the added visibility of a Daily Deal on Steam's homepage.</p><p>Since Planet Centauri's story has been making the rounds, there has been a small uptick of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/385380/charts/#max" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">concurrent players to 105</a>. That's not a huge number, but some players have given the game a shot and shared largely positive reviews. Although some of the other reviews on Steam have noted that <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/twilightdusk/recommended/385380/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Planet Centauri has noticeable flaws</a> and still feels like an early-access release.</p><p>Lechat and Marmontel are currently working on a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-roguelike-games/2900-6522/" data-ref-id="2900-6522">roguelike game</a> that uses the engine they built for Planet Centauri. The duo said that they have a financial obligation to finish that game before they'll be free to work on future patches for Planet Centauri.</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, Team Ninja <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nioh-3-revealed-at-state-of-play-free-demo-out-today/1100-6532108/" data-ref-id="1100-6532108">debuted the first look</a> at a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nioh-3/" data-ref-id="5000-680916">Nioh 3</a>, the latest game in the action-RPG series. Players will assume control of a fictionalized version of Japan's first shogun, Tokugawa Takechiyo, as he rises to power by taking on supernatural threats. In a departure for the series, Tokugawa can switch back and forth between samurai and ninja fighting styles. Now, Team Ninja has explained how its Ninja Gaiden games inspired this shift in Nioh 3's gameplay.</p><p>"We wanted to create a new kind of action that would act as a major centerpiece, making players feel that the game has taken a step forward," said Nioh 3 general producer Fumihiko Yasuda during an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-nioh-3-is-changing-the-game-with-ninja-style-and-the-distinctive-mist-system-ign-first" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "Team Ninja also has the experience of creating the Ninja Gaiden series. In other words, we have just about as much experience and knowhow when it comes to creating ninja action as we do with Nioh's samurai action. Ninja are very popular overseas, and we thought that this would excite those players as well. Nioh's Japanese world and setting is also something we value, which made ninja seem like the best possible answer."</p><p>Yasuda noted that previous Nioh games have already referenced the Ninja Gaiden games in the DLC, but added that Team Ninja is looking "into creating the sort of action that fans of both series will enjoy."</p><p>Players will can favor one fighting style over another, although there will be key differences between them. Samurai style will allow players to use Ki Pulse after attacking to recover their stamina. However, that ability won't be available to players using ninja style. Instead, ninja style players can use the mist ability to temporarily create a duplicate of themselves to better strike at their enemies. </p><p>Nioh 3 is currently expected to hit PlayStation 5 and PC in early 2026. In the meantime, Team Ninja's next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4/" data-ref-id="5000-659496">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, is coming on October 21 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. That sequel was also co-developed by Platinum Games.</p>

<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza / Mario Odyssey Pauline" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d91b0cb478cbd/donkey-kong-bananza-mario-odyssey-pauline.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>From the second Nintendo revealed Pauline was in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, a timeline theory began to take shape in our heads. But then we wrapped the game up, and our prequel presumptions weren't as nailed on as we'd expected.</p>
<p>We still don't have an official answer for how Bananza Pauline is related to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Odyssey</a> Pauline, and according to producer Kenta Motokura, we ain't going to get one any time soon.</p>
<p>This stems from a recent <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/50508">Famitsu</a> interview (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stealth40k.bsky.social/post/3lzbwv3as5c2w">@Stealth40K</a>), in which some of Bananza's key creatives sat down to chat all things DK. The answers cover many of the same topics we saw in the game's Ask the Developer series, but the question of Pauline's timeline is a newbie — albeit one that was somewhat brushed aside.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4polqni&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>When asked about Bananza Pauline's connection to Odyssey's New Donk City mayor, Motokura deftly dodged the topic, saying (via Google Translate), "That's... Of course, the developers have a plan for it, but I'm sorry, but I'd like you to use your imagination". <em>Gah</em>! And there we were, thinking an answer was on the horizon.</p>
<p>And what about that Grandma that 13-year-old Pauline brings up so often in Bananza's Getaway naps? There must be a connection there, right? "Sorry, this too", said Motokura. <em>Double gah</em>!</p>
<p>Now, that little tease of the developers having "a plan" for Pauline's heritage has us wondering if we're going to return to this timeline topic again in the future — we'd be amazed if we don't get another 3D DK game somewhere down the line. Alternatively, of course, Motokura could just be implying that the dev team has their theories, just like we all do, but we're never going to hear 'em. The latter seems all the more realistic, knowing Nintendo.</p>
<p>Okay, so Nintendo isn't going to spill the beans on this one just yet, but that doesn't mean we can't keep on theorising. Don't worry, we won't spoil the end of Bananza here, but if you want to read all about the game's finale and how we reckon it may/may not tie into Odyssey, you can find a full rundown in the guide below.</p>

</header>
  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s hitherto <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-second-patch-is-live-in-steam-beta-includes-fix-for-bug-caused-by-dying-to-bosses-while-killing-them">beta-only update 1.0.28650</a> is now a fully public release that any dang fool can download without switching to a Steam playtest branch. I'm still noodling my way through the lower levels of Team Cherry's new metroidvania, blissfully unbothered by any pressure to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-review">review it</a> or write <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong walkthroughs</a>. As such, I asked our reviewer James to have a look at the patch notes and pluck out any important changes, based on his many, many hours in Pharloom. 
</p>
<p>
A shadow glided over James's face, then returned and took up residence in one earhole. Wordlessly he outstretched a gnarled finger towards item 3 on the list: "Fixed Savage Beastfly in Far Fields sometimes remaining below the lava."
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Thus my introduction to the Savage Beastfly, an optional <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-bosses">Silksong boss</a> that has two iterations. I've now done some background reading on Savage Beastfly and - inasmuch as it's safe to extrapolate from all-caps forum posts - it appears to be Silksong's most-hated NPC. Not simply a challenging fight but a crushingly unfair and unpredictable one, in the eyes of many players, with complaints lodged against the inconsistency of the creature's hitbox, its two-mask damage output, its habit of summoning minions, and the whiteknuckle RNG effect of mixing all these things together.</p>
<p>It doesn't even look that good, the detractors howl. It's not like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-malenia-walkthrough">Malenia</a> in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>. It's just a mallet with wings. Nobody wants to Rule 34 that thing. Well, some people probably do, because that's the point of Rule 34, but this particular intersection of masochism and formicophilia seems like a rare gift, indeed.
</p><p>
And all of this merely describes the first iteration of the boss. The second introduces lava and destructible platforms, just for funsies. As such, the now-fixed technical issue above with the Savage Beastfly diving into lava and never returning could be styled a positive. Let the bastard stay in the magma, if it loves magma so much. Let it burn forever in a hell of its own creation.
</p>
<p>
The loathing is so extreme that there is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fucksavagebeastfly/">a whole subreddit dedicated to Savage Beastfly</a> and all its works, with 34,000 weekly visitors. Be warned that the subreddit contains a lot of fake reporting about undiscovered, even tougher Savage Beastfly variants, because if there's one thing Silksong players like doing, it's rustling each other's jimmies.
</p>
<p>
While the Savage Beastfly does appear to savagely beastfly in the face of sporting boss design, I do inevitably wonder whether a piss-boiling abomination like this is a marketing asset for a game such as Silksong. Bosses that are merely 'good' and 'well-designed' don't tend to attract dedicated subreddits. Malenia doesn't have one, as far as I can tell. Nor do Giygas, Psycho Mantis or Sephiroth. I'm surprised I haven't seen Savage Beastfly cited more in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yes-hollow-knight-silksong-has-some-moments-of-steep-difficulty-team-cherry-admit-but-have-you-considered-going-for-a-pre-boss-walk">the on-going discussion</a> of whether Silksong's overall difficulty is key to the mood, or just contrived.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, the full patch notes are below. They are essentially unchanged from the beta test last week.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added Dithering effect option in Advanced video settings. Reduces colour banding but can slightly soften the appearance of foreground assets. Defaults to 'Off'.</li>
<li>Updated Herald's Wish achievement description to clarify that players must both complete the wish and finish the game.</li>
<li>Fixed Savage Beastfly in Far Fields sometimes remaining below the lava.</li>
<li>Fixed rare cases of Shrine Guardian Seth getting out of bounds during battle.</li>
<li>Fixed rare case of Second Sentinel knocking the player out of bounds during battle.</li>
<li>Added catch to prevent Lugoli sometimes flying off screen and not returning during battle.</li>
<li>Further reduced chance of Silk Snippers getting stuck out of bounds in Chapel of the Reaper battle.</li>
<li>Fixed various instances of dying to bosses while killing them causing death sequences to play messily or out of sync.</li>
<li>Fixed Shaman Binding into a bottom transition causing a softlock.</li>
<li>Cocoon positions in some locations updated to prevent it spawning in inaccessible areas.</li>
<li>Fixed Liquid Lacquer courier delivery not being accessible in Steel Soul mode.</li>
<li>Fixed some NPCs not correctly playing cursed hint dialogues in certain instances.</li>
<li>Fixed Pondcatcher Reed not being able to fly away after singing.</li>
<li>Fixed Verdania memory orbs sometimes replaying layered screen-edge burst effects.</li>
<li>Fixed the break counter not working for certain multihitter tools eg Conchcutter.</li>
<li>Fixed Volt Filament damage multiplier not applying for certain Silk Skills.</li>
<li>Fixed Cogflies and Wisps inappropriately targeting Skullwings.</li>
<li>Fixed Cogflies incorrectly resetting their HP to full on scene change.</li>
<li>Fixed Curveclaw always breaking on the first hit after being deflected.</li>
<li>Fixed Plasmium Phial and Flea Brew sometimes not restoring as intended at benches.</li>
<li>Various other smaller tweaks and fixes. </li>
</ul>

            <p>The now-cancelled Perfect Dark reboot had an "eco sci-fi" aesthetic, an Adrenaline System, and may have been released episodically.</p>
<p>That's according to internal documentation from a former developer on the project at The Initiative shared with <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/gameplay-details-concept-screens-cancelled-perfect-dark-reboot">mp1st</a>, revealing new artwork and gameplay details.</p>
<p>The document highlighted an opportunity to capitalise on the secret agent genre, due to the absence of Metal Gear Solid and James Bond 007 during development. Ironically enough, both franchises have since returned.</p>

<p>This may somewhat point to why <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">Perfect Dark was ultimately cancelled</a> - perhaps this reboot of the N64 classic from Rare wasn't able to differentiate itself enough.</p>
<p>Still, this newly unearthed documentation - which dates back to a period close to the game's cancellation this year - hints as to what players could have expected. The creative vision for the reboot aimed to reimagine the franchise while retaining the core DNA of the N64 original, with the HBO series Westworld providing inspiration for giving a classic property fresh themes and concepts.</p><p>While several systems are briefly mentioned, only the Adrenaline System is detailed. This would've been a resource regenerated over time to provide various abilities like healing and increasing damage dealt, as well as slowing time to aim with precision. Killing multiple enemies in quick succession would have extended this effect.</p>
<p>Until April of this year, the studio was working on a vertical slice (a playable proof-of-concept) that belonged to "Season 1", suggesting the game would have been released episodically.</p>
<p>Perfect Dark was properly revealed at last year's Xbox Games Showcase, with in-game footage of protagonist Joanna Dark exploring a futuristic Cairo (above). Later,<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lsypye2edk2v"> reports suggested this gameplay was fake</a>, though a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adammcdlt.bsky.social/post/3lt23bz2dwk2z">designer on the game responded</a> it was in-engine despite "some fake stuff in it".</p>
<p>The new documentation includes further artwork for the game, including an alternate design for Joanna, as well as various futuristic environments to show off its "eco sci-fi" aesthetic.</p>
<p>Perfect Dark was cancelled back in July, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">layoffs across Microsoft</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Rare's Everwild was also cancelled</a>.</p>
