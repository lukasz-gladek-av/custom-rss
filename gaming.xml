Yes, it's GOTY time.</p>
<p>2025 has been a bumper one across the board, with brilliant games big and small — indie, are-they-indie?, and absolutely-definitely-not-indie — launching every single month. This is the year that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> <em>finally</em> came out, for heaven's sake! Oh, and Nintendo launched a whole new platform. Just looking at the software, the quality in 2025 has been top-shelf.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067uotnir&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>If you've joined us only recently, we here at Nintendo Life have our own staff GOTY list encompassing all of our personal top fives, but top GOTY billing goes to our community-ranked Top 50 Switch games of the year - this year featuring Switch 2, too.</p>
<p>We've got one for every year of the Switch's life so far, each ordered according to the corresponding games' User Rating in our database.</p>
<p>These real-time lists, based on the User Ratings in our database, are a living ranking of each year's finest video games. Looking back over the Switch generation, here are the winners from the previous eight(!) years:</p>

</ul>
<p>Not a bad octet, is it? So, it's time to start looking through the gems we've played in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>Below you'll find <strong>every Switch game we've reviewed in 2025 awarded a 6/10 or higher.</strong> To rate any games you've played, registered users can click the star next to the corresponding title and give them a score out of 10. <strong>We encourage you to use the search bar</strong>, but otherwise you can browse at your leisure.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT: All Switch 1 and 2 games released in 2025 are eligible and available to rate in our database.</strong> We've limited the ones shown below to cull endless pages of shovelware, but if there's something we didn't review (or just didn't enjoy as much as you), find it by heading to the search bar at the very top of the page and going directly to that game's page.</p>
<p>We'll go live with the results later in the month, and due to the real-time nature of the list, games launched between now and the end of the year still have every chance of showing up in the Top 50, too. No one's left behind!</p>

<hr>
<p><em>Thanks for 'voting'! Our database should contain every game released in 2025, but please let us know below if anything is missing and we'll get it added. Happy rating!</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/community-its-time-to-rate-your-switch-1-and-2-games-of-the-year]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">After the huge success of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/fallout-the-series">Amazon Fallout TV show</a>, some have wondered whether The Elder Scrolls, Bethesda’s fantasy video game franchise, might be next in line for an adaptation. But what does Bethesda boss Todd Howard think?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-elder-scrolls-tv-series-cant-be-ruled-out-todd-howard-teases-but-remains-tight-lipped-on-the-status-of-the-wolfenstein-adaptation" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a> ahead of the launch of Fallout Season 2, Howard refused to rule out the possibility of an Elder Scrolls TV show, but did suggest the post-apocalyptic sci-fi franchise Fallout was better suited to an adaptation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I will say this, the Fallout journey was like a 10 year one," Howard replied to the suggestion of an Elder Scrolls adaptation. "After Fallout 3, people were asking to do a movie or show for Fallout, and we really took our time."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Howard "can't rule in or rule out an Elder Scrolls thing in the future," Eurogamer said, but he also believes the Fallout franchise was "more uniquely suited" and had "more to say in its genre.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Howard continued: "But, you never know. I think the impact of the show on Fallout as a franchise has been bigger than I expected, so it does make you think like, 'Hey, is there a path?' But, nothing today... [and] I'm willing to say 'no' for a decade."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Fallout series is wide-ranging in tone and content. Indeed, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-knew-what-i-was-walking-into-fallout-season-2-star-macaulay-culkin-already-knew-all-about-the-lore-from-watching-youtube-videos">Season 2 star Macaulay Culkin touched on this in a recent interview with IGN</a>, explaining why he’s so big into the Fallout lore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You could have zombies in it, you have deathclaws, you have monsters and things like that,” he said. “I mean, gosh, you have aliens. You name it, you can throw it at the wall. Even Fallout 76, I mean, the Mothman is now fair game. It is that kind of stuff. There's no really shape to it. You can kind of stick any kind of shape piece into that hole.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fallout Season 2: Who's Confirmed to Return and Who's New?</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And in any case, there’s no sign of Fallout slowing down when it comes to the TV series. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-2-premieres-december-2025-renewed-for-season-3">Season 3 is already confirmed</a>, and its stars have indicated they’d be willing to continue playing their characters for many more series beyond that. In May, Aaron Moten, who plays Brotherhood of Steel hopeful Maximus, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-tv-show-has-a-season-5-or-season-6-type-of-endpoint-maximus-actor-says">said the Fallout series’ “endpoint” runs until Season 5 or Season 6</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When I signed on to do the series, we would have a starting point and they gave me the endpoint,” Moten said. “And that endpoint hasn’t changed. But it is Season 5, 6 type of endpoint.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve always known that we were gonna take our time with the development of the characters.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps when that is done and dusted, Bethesda might turn its attention to an Elder Scrolls adaptation. Will <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> be out by then? One can only hope.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Shock, horror, I'm playing Metroid. I'm still a relative noob to the series, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Prime Remastered</a> had me in a chokehold back in 2023, and Beyond is doing exactly the same so far. Sure, it's <em>technically</em> my brother's birthday celebrations this weekend, but he won't mind if I bring my Switch along and pad out the old scan logbook at dinner, will he?</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>Hello, yes, I am also playing the big new Nintendo Switch 2 release of the week… Octopath Traveler 0. Wait! Don’t boo me!</p>
<p>Sorry Samus, I’ve opted for cosy turn-based gameplay for the holiday season, in true Alana fashion. Don’t worry, I will get to Viewros once the dust has settled, but right now, the price tag is a little too steep for something that might not be my cup of tea.</p>
<p>I’ve also got back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>, and I’m trying to finish up the DLC and tidy my island a little before the big update. It’s coming along! Have a good one, folks.</p>

<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>This weekend. Hmmm. I want to say I'm going to play loads of Metroid like everyone else, and I've very much really enjoyed what I've played so far, but I'm actually fully distracted by Assassin's Creed Shadows and am therefore very likely gonna end up stuck in that.</p>
<p>Otherwise, yes Prime 4 it is. With a side-helping of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> because I'm genuinely addicted to the multiplayer City Trials.</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>December came out fighting with me still clobbering punks in the streets of the belt action game of the year, MARVEL Cosmic Invasion, over the weekend. I doubt I will actually have time to give Assassin’s Creed Shadows the attention it deserves, and the same goes for the wonderful (gatcha-free!) Octopath Traveler 0, because I want to keep roaming the streets in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a>, wrap up Melinoë’s quest in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a>, and kick the ball around in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inazuma_eleven_victory_road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a> (Do publishers realise there are eleven other months in the year!?).</p>
<p>To space pirates’ disappointment around the galaxy, my game of the week is obviously Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. Indeed, beyond my wildest dreams, Samus' first-person adventure is back after a hiatus of eighteen years and straight to being a very strong contender for my personal GOTY 2025. I will make the most of this extended weekend in Portugal to dutifully scan everything the game throws at me.</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>A new <a href="https://hermitcraft.com/">Hermitcraft</a> season (check it out on YouTube, it's the best) means <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">MINECRAFT</a> TIME, so I've spun up a server to play with my pals using the new(ish) Copper Age stuff. We're still pre-diamonds, so early days, but it's fun.</p>
<p>I've also been playing <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/outer_worlds_2">Outer Worlds 2</a>, and having a surprisingly good time! It starts real slow and boring, which is baffling, since it's a game that's all about comedy and wacky hijinks, so I'm not sure why they decided to have such a serious beginning. But there's some incredibly clever narrative and game design stuff in there, like unlocking "flaws" based on your behaviour — I kept stealing, because it's basically <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/elder_scrolls_v_skyrim_anniversary_edition">Skyrim</a> In Space, so the game asked me if I wanted to become a Kleptomaniac, which would make all my stolen stuff sell for more (yay!) but also add a chance that I automatically steal something just by looking at it. Unsurprisingly, it's gotten me into a LOT of trouble, but that's what makes the game fun!</p>
<p>Aaaaand I finally got to the (story) end of Hades II, and... mmm, yeah, it's not great. Actually quite disappointing how almost all the plot gets dumped right at the end, rather than being sprinkled throughout the game. I can only assume that Supergiant wanted to keep it secret for as long as possible while in Early Access, so they left it right to the end? I don't know! It's not a good ending, even with the update! It's still an incredible game, so I'm not really all that bothered, and I don't regret my purchase... I'm just disappointed. But I'll keep playing!</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Duct Tape Challenge monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Pets, Potions and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are you a fan of racing games with a quirky side? If so, Duct Tape Challenge is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-death-ball-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game that will definitely be worth your time. Despite being a car-related game on paper, Duct Tape Challenge offers an alternate experience to players, with the main objective being to tear through multiple layers of duct tape. Players must upgrade their cars to make them faster and give them more destructive power, as the number of layers destroyed determines how many coins they earn at the end of the run.&nbsp;</p>







<p>These coins can be used for various things within the game, including upgrading cars, buying pets, stat multipliers and a lot more. These rewards encourage players to keep grinding and beat their personal bests, as the power spikes from even the smallest of upgrades are clear to see. Although simply playing through the game will give players the resources they need to progress, using redeem codes can be a good way to get ahead of the competition.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-expired-duct-tape-challenge-codes">Expired Duct Tape Challenge Codes</h2>



<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired Duct Tape Challenge codes. However, considering the popularity the game has garnered in recent months, new codes are likely to be released. When new codes drop, old ones tend to expire, and when that happens, this section of the article will be updated to reflect as such.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Redeeming codes in Duct Tape Challenge is a simple process with no prerequisite steps. It’s as simple as navigating through the menus and inputting one of the active codes into the correct text box. For players who may be new to the game, however, here’s a ste-by-step guide:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li>Open Roblox and launch Duct Tape Challenge.</li>



<li>Click on the Shop button on the left side of the screen.</li>



<li>Scroll to the right until you see the “Codes” section with a text box.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes listed above into the text box.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Click on the yellow ‘Redeem’ button to claim your rewards.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>New codes are usually released through the game’s official Discord server, or sometimes through the developers’ socials as well. However, keeping track of these can be a hassle, especially considering that players are not notified when a code expires. That’s where this page can be a lifesaver, as we update this article as soon as any new codes drop. Bookmark this page to never miss out on any free rewards again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With this in mind, the same Switch title has now <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/12/04/pikmin-4-listed-as-having-switch-2-enhancements-on-eshop-update-incoming/">reportedly popped up</a> in a section on the eShop, which focuses on first-party Nintendo "games with free updates" and also notes how select titles are enhanced when played on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>This discovery was originally shared on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pikmin/comments/1pe84ll/pikmin_4_is_listed_as_having_a_switch_2_update_on/?share_id=PHUUC4t9ZRTKsLLq2QdcD&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">Pikmin subreddit (via My Nintendo News)</a> and has also surfaced in other regions, as highlighted by <a href="https://x.com/necrolipe/status/1996721280351904211">Universo Nintendo editor Felipe Lima</a>. Here's the attached description along with a look:</p><div><figure data-videoid="AsYPINDc4Aw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AsYPINDc4Aw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytAsYPINDc4Aw" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AsYPINDc4Aw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AsYPINDc4Aw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed34c7a8pqvxon&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Enhance select games when played on the Nintendo Switch 2 system"</p>
</blockquote>


<p>As you can see, the game featured alongside Pikmin 4 is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, which <em>did</em> receive a free Switch 2 upgrade in June – optimising the game's visuals and adding HDR support.</p>
<p>We've taken a look at the page, and it appears Pikmin 4 has now been removed from this section. The other titles listed here are based on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/12-free-switch-2-game-upgrades-are-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">the 12 free upgrades</a> released alongside the launch of the Switch 2, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a> (which also got a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/video-heres-how-splatoon-3-on-switch-2-improves-visuals-and-performance">Switch 2 update in June</a>).</p>
<p>So, what might all this mean? As mentioned in the post above, it could just be a "mistake" on Nintendo's end, so it's probably best not to get too excited. And now that it's been removed, it seems this might be the case. Of course, this hasn't stopped <em>some</em> <a href="https://x.com/MyNintendoNews/status/1996709298651779139/quotes">Pikmin 4 enthusiasts from getting their hopes up</a> – suggesting it could be a sign of a future update.</p>
<p>For now, Pikmin 4 hasn't received a dedicated Switch 2 update. If we do hear any significant developments, we'll let you know.</p>

            <p>Waking up at the crack of dawn today, I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices did not have a comments thread in which to badger us to play Troubleshooter Colon Abandoned Children. I burst from the covers, ran weeping to my PC (this happens most mornings, to be fair) and discovered that I had forgotten to finish the intro for our latest What Are We All Playing This Weekend article. And now I have. So, what are you all playing this weekend?</p><!--more-->
<p><strong>Jeremy</strong><br>I've come down with a bit of a cold, so it's highly likely that this weekend will mostly be spent in bed trying to recover from the whirlwind of house repairs and other chaos that has dominated life since October. I shall resume my hunts in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xii">Final Fantasy XII</a> and let the auto-battling Gambit system take over for me, most likely. Go on, my brave Ivalice squad - kill some things while I shuffle your macros from behind the scenes in order to alleviate the aches in my bones!</p>
<p><strong>Callum</strong><br>This is like turning up to a biker bar and loudly announcing you’ve bought a vintage Volvo, but I picked up an old PS3 on eBay this week purely so I could play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> 4: Guns Of The Patriots. I’m sorry, PC brethren. I’m one of you, I promise! But I’ve given up hope they’re ever freeing this game from its PS3 prison, and paid my way to spending the weekend hiding in cardboard boxes and doing cool spy shit. Well, I’ll do that for 10 minutes before Kojima wrestles me down and forces me to watch my fifth subsequent feature-length movie masquerading as a cutscene.</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong><br>Right, so Raceroom has just gotten a new car pack featuring the Mercs, Audis and Opels of the 2002 DTM series. As you might have read in the RPS 100, I love me some German touring cars, so you’ll probably find me blasting around Hockenheim or the Norisring in a pitched battle with Bernd Schneider, Laurent Aiello or Manuel Reuter this weekend.</p><p><strong>Ollie:</strong><br>It's been a rough time for me recently. My anxiety has been hitting me so hard that I feel like half a person. So this weekend, I'll be splitting my time between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trackmania">Trackmania</a>, and a couple of hours stroking some of my favourite cats in the nearby cat cafe. And all three of those activities will be shared with some of my favourite people in the world. Hopefully together it can help soothe my frayed nerves.</p>
<p><strong>James</strong><br>I continue to enjoy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-six-hours-of-tweaker-gunslinging-and-trench-warfare-im-sold-on-darktides-imminent-hive-scum-update">Hive Scumming</a> around <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a>. Myself and a couple of friends have formed a shouty little triumvirate of mohawked wrong'uns, each specialising in one of the three pillars of grimdark hoodlum combat doctrine: guns, knives, and methamphetamine.</p>
<p><strong>Julian</strong><br>After a week of working perhaps too many 7am - 11pm days, I'm relaxing by going to an 11pm - 7am Wong Kar Wai marathon. As such, I have no plans to play games this weekend.</p>
<p><strong>Edwin</strong><br>I'm spending time with my partner this weekend, then I'm off for three days helping my dad with a house move. I might find some time for a go at Total Chaos, the new horror game from the Turbo Overkill developer. Although I've played a lot of horror games recently. Maybe I'll read a book? Maybe I'll read some books recommended by a game developer, even?</p>
<hr>
<p><em>And you, reader dear, what are you playing this weekend?...</em>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Skybound Game Studios, the gaming subsidiary of Robert Kirkman’s Skybound Entertainment, is facing a sizeable lawsuit filed by iam8bit. This lawsuit alleges fraud, a breach of contract, and theft of original designs, and it was taken to the LA Superior Court for consideration.</p>



<p>The filing claims that Skybound has failed to explain financial discrepancies logged over the years of the partnership between the two firms, amongst other things. This has left iam8bit to file a considerable claim against Skybound.</p>







<h2 id="h-skybound-faces-allegations-of-financial-misconduct">Skybound Faces Allegations of Financial Misconduct</h2>



<p>Skybound Game Studios and iam8bit entered into a partnership in April 2021, and according to the complaint, Skybound has always failed to deliver monthly financial reports as agreed and has added ‘millions of dollars in fake line items’ to expense reports.</p>



<p>It <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/iam8bit-is-suing-skybound-game-studios-alleging-fraud-and-theft-of-designs-000822886.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was explained</a> that an impartial auditor was introduced to the debate, and even then, Skybound couldn’t explain the finances.</p>



<p>Beyond financial woes, iam8bit has accused Skybound Games of cutting it out of a deal related to Stray, the dystopian indie smash hit that launched on PlayStation in 2022. It was claimed that Skybound used original designs created by iam8bit for promotional purposes to secure a separate deal for a Nintendo Switch release of the game.</p>



<p>It has been argued that Skybound has exploited trade secrets while scalping iam8bit’s creative output for marketing purposes.</p>



<p>This leaves iam8bit’s legal team to seek monetary damages, some kind of punitive reform, and compensation for legal fees.</p>



<p>Skybound Games has refused to comment on the lawsuit thus far.</p>







<p>Do you think Skybound Games should be held accountable to this extent if found guilty of these financial discrepancies? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/furia-budapest-perfect-push-secure-playoffs/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>FURIA has stormed into the playoffs of the StarLadder Budapest Major, completing a flawless 3-0 run through the tournament’s third stage to cement their dominance over rivals G2 in Hungary. Heading into the series, the head-to-head between the two was locked at 3-3, but FURIA shattered that ratio with a decisive 2-0 win.</p>



<p>It was an intense series that left FURIA one step closer to lifting the trophy in Budapest.</p>



<p>The predictions don’t end with this article, though. Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the Starladder Major Budapest 2025. Visit <a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gg.bet</a> to dive deeper, place your bets, and feel the adrenaline of esports!</p>



<figure><a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"></a></figure>







<h2 id="h-furia-in-the-fight-for-first">FURIA in the Fight for First</h2>



<p>The opening map in the series, Inferno, provided FURIA with early leverage, as the team secured a commanding 13-5 win over G2. It was a shock-and-awe mission for FURIA, with FalleN and YEKINDAR putting out multi-kills that left G2 flailing in the wind for much of the map.</p>



<p>Overpass came next, and again, FURIA was swinging around the map with reckless abandon. Even a brief respite provided by SunPayus with a clean pistol clapback wasn’t enough to recover those lost rounds.</p>



<p>In a post-match statement, Sid ‘sidde’ Macedo explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We were still deciding if we would full buy or not. I knew we needed a pause to organize our ideas, and FalleN came up with a very good plan of playing off the stacks, playing with numbers, and playing with smokes. Everyone contributed, and I’m glad I called the pause to bring it together.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This victory effectively breaks the deadlock with G2 and extends FURIA’s dominant streak at the Budapest Major in Hungary. The Brazilian side scooped trophies going into the Major, and now they’re looking to add another to that cabinet.</p>

<p>Nintendo released a new system firmware update for the Switch 2 last week, and it's once again led to a bunch of Switch games receiving compatibility updates.</p>
<p>We've already covered the updates for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/chrono_cross_the_radical_dreamers_edition">Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/crypt_of_the_necrodancer">Crypt of the NecroDancer</a>, and it appears one other game that's also been fixed is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mega_mall_story">Mega Mall Story</a> from the Kairosoft series.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/en-US/details/0100bbc00cb9a000">Nintendo's official compatibility page</a>, the management simulation title was updated earlier this week, with "previously identified issues" now resolved.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yqlksz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mega_mall_story_2">Mega Mall Story 2</a> is still apparently "unsupported" on Nintendo's platform, and other Kairosoft titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/game_dev_story">Game Dev Story</a> also appear to have issues.</p>
<p>Apart from this fix for Mega Mall Story, some issues have also reportedly been identified some other titles. This includes a problem with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/streets_of_rage_4">Streets of Rage 4</a>, which abruptly closes the game if you select 'Extra' from the menu. And, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hazel_sky">Hazel Sky</a> also has some graphics issues.</p>
<p>If you didn't already see it, a compatibility update was also released for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">NieR:Automata The End of YoRHa Edition</a> and multiple other games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/doom_plus_doom_ii">DOOM + DOOM II</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a>'s 1.1.3.0 update is bringing the fog of war into winter. As part of the new Winter Offensive, players will be able to access a new version of the Empire State map called Ice Lock Empire State. This map will only be around for a limited time, but it swaps out the standard map with frozen streets and other examples of cold and hazardous weather.</p><p>The new map will also have a themed event mode, allowing you to play Domination, Conquest, and Gauntlet mission variations that utilize the new "Freeze" mechanic. Players will also be given access to the ice climbing axe through the Winter Offensive Bonus Path. Once they have the axe, players can unleash it as a melee weapon on unlucky foes. That bonus path also features an 11-tier, time-limited reward track featuring event cosmetics, and XP Boosters.</p><p>According to Battlefield Labs, the new update has "a broad range of fixes and refinements across Battlefield 6." Some of the improvements include weapon reliability, vehicle behavior, and quality-of-life bug fixes. You can find the complete notes for this update below.</p><h2>Battlefield 6 1.1.3.0 Update Notes</h2><h3>Audio</h3><p>With this update, we’ve made a wide range of audio improvements, including a dedicated tuning pass on footsteps to make movement clearer, easier to locate, and more readable at different distances.</p><p>We’ve also continued addressing performance and memory issues that could cause sounds, such as footsteps or vehicle audio, to drop out or fail to play, especially during large-scale Battle Royale matches. To get ahead of this as we add more audio content to the game, we’ve adjusted the memory priorities for most sounds in the game and optimized how some larger audio assets load. In practical terms, this means that important combat, movement, and vehicle sounds should play more consistently even under heavy load.</p><p>These changes are part of an ongoing effort to improve the overall stability of the soundscape. While this isn’t a complete overhaul, and there may still be edge cases depending on hardware and match conditions, it's a big step toward more reliable and predictable sound across the game.</p><h2>Changelog</h2><h3>Players</h3><ul><li>Fixed a clipping issue when dragging a soldier on an inclined surface when being prone.</li><li>Fixed a clipping issue with character shoulders when jumping.</li><li>Fixed a rare issue where fall damage wouldn’t be applied immediately after being revived.</li><li>Fixed snapping and aggressive camera movements when performing takedowns on prone enemies from specific angles.</li><li>Fixed an issue allowing players to use vaulting to avoid being roadkilled by an enemy vehicle coming at high speed.</li><li>Fixed an issue causing controller haptic feedback to continue indefinitely when a reload was interrupted by swapping to another weapon or gadget.</li><li>Fixed an issue causing hit registration to fail when firing while making extremely rapid aim adjustments.

<p>Electronic Arts (EA) isn’t looking to bring back Dead Space in the near future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As first reported on the latest episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/tM8RcRXnHX8">Insider Gaming Weekly,</a> sources have told Insider Gaming that the series has been put “on ice”. That’s based on internal messaging happening within the company.</p>







<p>Sources added that with the direction of EA, they don’t expect the series to be picked back up anytime soon. That includes the idea of a remake, reboot, or sequel. </p>



<p>That said, there is still of a future for the 17-year-old series. With reports that the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Funt being in a tough spot financially after the EA sale, those who spoke under the condition of anonymity are hoping that EA, under the new ownership, would want to sell the IP.</p>



<p>This isn’t saying EA is actively looking to sell the series. This is from talking with a few people in the company that feel EA could sell it to try and pay off the debt and recoup some of the money after the deal closes next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield Studios has published the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> update 1.1.3.0 patch notes ahead of next week’s Winter Offensive update, revealing a detailed list of audio improvements, soldier visibility tweaks, a range of map adjustments, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patch notes for the third major Season 1 update were published in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-game-update-1-1-3-0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a post</u></a> on the EA shooter series’ website today. The full breakdown follows up on promises made by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-outline-upcoming-audio-fixes-and-multiplayer-mode-adjustments-ahead-of-update-1130"><u>BF Studios’ outline from earlier this week</u></a> and touches on every notable change coming to Battlefield 6 and REDSEC when Winter Offensive reaches its December 9 release date.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield 6 Season 1 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though today’s patch notes cover everything from audio to Sector sizes, players may be happy to see the studio continuing to adjust an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-outline-upcoming-aim-assist-and-weapon-bloom-adjustments-for-what-could-be-the-biggest-update-yet">issue that has wormed its way to the front of online discussion</a> since launch: hit registration. BF Studios says the 1.1.3.0 changes should result in more predictable bullet impact and easier-to-read damage feedback thanks to tweaks to quick aim, pre-zoom firing, and close-quarters gunfights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other elements the Battlefield 6 developers took aim at with the Winter Offensive update include better weapon handling, improved character highlights and animations for visibility, gadget reliability, and refined gameplay for vehicle-savvy players. Launch players will also notice relatively extensive changes to Sectors and vehicles across seven Breakthrough maps: Manhattan Bridge, Mirak Valley, New Sobek City, Operation Firestorm, Liberation Peak, Siege of Cairo, and Empire State.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It may be some time before players get a handle on whether many of these changes correct the balance of the average Battlefield 6 multiplayer match. Those audio tweaks, however, will likely be noticeable from the get-go, with the hope being that infantry noise is clearer and easier to read at different distances.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve also continued addressing performance and memory issues that could cause sounds, such as footsteps or vehicle audio, to drop out or fail to play, especially during large-scale Battle Royale matches,” BF Studios says in the update 1.1.3.0 patch notes. “To get ahead of this as we add more audio content to the game, we’ve adjusted the memory priorities for most sounds in the game and optimized how some larger audio assets load. In practical terms, this means that important combat, movement, and vehicle sounds should play more consistently even under heavy load.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“These changes are part of an ongoing effort to improve the overall stability of the soundscape. While this isn’t a complete overhaul, and there may still be edge cases depending on hardware and match conditions, it's a big step toward more reliable and predictable sound across the game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each change arrives in addition to new weapons, limited-time winter events, and more new content that players have been told to expect since launch. Highlights include the Ice Lock Empire State map, the Ice Lock multiplayer and Gauntlet modes, the Ice Climbing Axe melee weapon, Portal updates, and a mini–Winter Offensive-themed battle pass bonus path. It’s the latest in the run of Battlefield 6 Season 1 chapter updates, which saw Rogue Ops bring Blackwell Fields and battle royale to the experience October 28, while California Resistance added Eastwood November 18.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Battlefield Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Plans for Season 2 remain under wraps for now.

This update also includes several quality-of-life improvements across UI, HUD, and controller aiming options, along with map-specific updates designed to stabilise objective play and reduce round-end matchmaking frustration.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also made improvements to reduce cases where player settings could be reset when updating the game to the newest version. While this behaviour should now occur less frequently, we are still seeing isolated instances and expect to fully resolve the issue in an upcoming update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As always, thank you for continuing to share your feedback which helps us refine and evolve the Battlefield 6 experience.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>New Content: Winter Offensive</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>New Time-Limited Map:</strong> Ice Lock Empire State<strong>.</strong> A winter-shrouded version of Empire State featuring frozen streets and seasonal environmental visuals.</li><li><strong>New Time-Limited Multiplayer and Gauntlet Mode:</strong> A themed event mode playable across Domination, Conquest, and Gauntlet mission variations on Ice Lock Empire State featuring the event-limited “Freeze” mechanic.</li><li><strong>New Melee Weapon:</strong> the Ice Climbing Axe<strong>.</strong> Unlocked through the Winter Offensive Bonus Path.</li><li><strong>Portal updates:</strong> Ice Lock Empire State is available for use in supported Portal experiences during the event window.</li><li><strong>Battle Pass:</strong> Winter Offensive Bonus Path: an 11-tier, time-limited reward track featuring event cosmetics, XP Boosters, and the Ice Climbing Axe.</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Major Updates for 1.1.3.0</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Improved hit registration across situations that previously felt unreliable</strong>, including quick aim adjustments, firing before a zoom completes, and close-quarters fights with many players. These updates make bullet impacts more predictable and damage feedback easier to read in the moment.</li><li><strong>Enhanced close-range soldier visibility</strong>, with stronger character highlights and improved prone animations to help soldiers stand out more clearly in low-contrast or visually busy areas.</li><li><strong>Refined weapon handling for more consistent accuracy</strong>, addressing issues with first-shot behaviour, recoil interaction, and attachment alignment so weapons feel more stable and predictable during firefights.</li><li><strong>Improved reliability across several core gadgets</strong>, including updates to the LWCMS Portable Mortar, Supply Pouch, Smoke Cover, and traversal tools to ensure they behave consistently and provide clearer feedback.</li><li><strong>Strengthened vehicle clarity and interaction</strong>, fixing issues around damage zones, HUD overlaps, seat reticules, and camera behaviour to make vehicle play more stable for both drivers and passengers.</li><li><strong>Updated Breakthrough and Rush layouts on multiple maps</strong> to improve attacker–defender balance, smooth out sector flow, and adjust vehicle distribution based on match outcome data and player feedback.</li><li><strong>Delivered a broad audio pass improving combat readability</strong>, including clearer footsteps and movement cues, more reliable armour-break feedback, and tuning across several high-priority gameplay sounds.</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>AREAS OF IMPROVEMENTS</strong></h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>AUDIO</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">With this update, we’ve made a wide range of audio improvements, including a dedicated tuning pass on footsteps to make movement clearer, easier to locate, and more readable at different distances.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve also continued addressing performance and memory issues that could cause sounds, such as footsteps or vehicle audio, to drop out or fail to play, especially during large-scale Battle Royale matches. To get ahead of this as we add more audio content to the game, we’ve adjusted the memory priorities for most sounds in the game and optimized how some larger audio assets load. In practical terms, this means that important combat, movement, and vehicle sounds should play more consistently even under heavy load.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These changes are part of an ongoing effort to improve the overall stability of the soundscape. While this isn’t a complete overhaul, and there may still be edge cases depending on hardware and match conditions, it's a big step toward more reliable and predictable sound across the game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>CHANGELOG</strong></h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>PLAYER:</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed a clipping issue when dragging a soldier on an inclined surface when being prone.</li><li>Fixed a clipping issue with character shoulders when jumping.</li><li>Fixed a rare issue where fall damage wouldn’t be applied immediately after being revived.</li><li>Fixed snapping and aggressive camera movements when performing takedowns on prone enemies from specific angles.</li><li>Fixed an issue allowing players to use vaulting to avoid being roadkilled by an enemy vehicle coming at high speed.</li><li>Fixed an issue causing controller haptic feedback to continue indefinitely when a reload was interrupted by swapping to another weapon or gadget.</li><li>Fixed an issue causing hit registration to fail when firing while making extremely rapid aim adjustments.

Giger’s designs from the classic sci-fi movie <em>Alien</em>. This is especially evident in <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>‘s first large level, <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-impressions-first-level-volt-forge-titanfall-2-factory-2000650657">Volt Forge</a>, which contains a lot of Giger-esque architecture and environmental details. But other parts of <em>Prime 4</em>, like the famous artist, seem inspired by other parts of human anatomy, like vaginas. What I’m trying to say is there are a lot of doors in this game that might make your more prudish grandparents uncomfortable.</p>    <p>“Lotta vaginas in this game,” bluntly, but accurately, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aidanmoher.com/post/3m7733nyj4k2a">declared critic Aidan Moher on Bluesky</a>. And he’s right! In the early portions of <em>Prime 4</em>‘s campaign, you’ll encounter a few different doors that seem inspired by vulvas.&nbsp; Fans online are now sharing screenshots of doors that look very vaginal online.&nbsp; Some are large, and some are small. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyvagina/comments/1pe7opb/the_doors_in_metroid_prime_4/">One of these doors</a> even popped up on a subreddit dedicated to highlighting objects and locations that look a bit like vaginas.</p>   <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why is all the discourse on Metroid Prime 4 about Miles and not how all the doors are extremely vaginal?

			<p>Wreckreation, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-is-a-sandbox-racing-game-set-in-a-400km%c2%b2-open-world/">the open-world sandbox</a> driving game <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-release-date-open-world-sandbox-racing-game/">that lets you edit the world as you go</a>, which was developed by Three Fields Entertainment, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-criterion-devs-reveal-first-details-on-their-new-game-coming-out-soon-has-couch-co-op/">a studio made up of former Criterion developers</a> who worked on the Burnout series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sandbox-racer-wreckreation-out-now-pc-ps5-xbox-series/">released on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this past October</a>. Now, chief executive officer Fiona Sperry has announced that the entire staff at Three Fields Entertainment has been told they could potentially lose their jobs.</p>



<p>Wreckreation's launch has been marred by technical issues, though Sperry doesn't directly cite a lacklustre launch for the game as a reason for putting the entire staff at risk of redundancy. </p>



<p>"<em>Today I am having to share one of the hardest messages of my career. After twelve years of building and nurturing Three Fields Entertainment, I am forced into the situation of today placing our entire team on notice of redundancy</em>," Sperry <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fiona-sperry-601a0530_today-i-am-having-to-share-one-of-the-hardest-activity-7402348277788057600-slcG?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">began in her post on LinkedIn</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>Since the launch of Wreckreation, our small studio has worked incredibly hard — with heart and dedication — to update the game, listen to our community, and deliver the fixes and features players asked for. I could not be prouder of the people I’ve worked alongside or the passion they’ve poured into this project. But the reality we now face is stark. As an independent studio, we will not see revenue from game sales for the foreseeable future. We have had to self-fund most of this year and all of the post launch content. Without the enthusiasm or financial support from our publisher to continue development, we simply cannot sustain the studio in its current form. Making this decision has been unbelievably painful.</em>"</p>



<p>Sperry's post also includes a video featuring post-launch content the studio is adding to Wreckreation in the hopes that it will bolster the game's audience while the team also works to correct the technical problems players faced at launch.</p>



<p>"<em>My hope is that by showing this work publicly, someone out there might also see that potential and perhaps an opportunity could still emerge," </em>Sperry continued<em>. "But even if that hope does not materialise, we want this to stand as a testament to our vision and to the strength, passion, and skill of our tiny team. I truly believe in the potential of this game and in the brilliance of the people who built it."<p>"To everyone who has supported us, played our games, or believed in our studio: thank you. Your support has meant the world -&nbsp;&nbsp;We will, again at our own cost, ensure the&nbsp;next update that includes a Crossplay feature does get published before Christmas and we hope you and your friends can enjoy the world that we have built together, whichever platform you play on.</p></em>"</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this is the second major release from Three Fields Entertainment to miss its mark. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dangerous-driving-high-speed/">Dangerous Driving in 2019 earned a 5/10 from Wccftech</a> and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dangerous-driving/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-4">stands at a 62 on Metacritic</a>. At the time, Wccftech's Nathan Birch wrote, "<em>Dangerous Driving is, at best, a rough early prototype of a proper Burnout successor. The basic mechanics and sense of speed are there, but they’re badly undermined by bland track design, infuriating AI, a lack of features, and a host of other issues. Those feeling nostalgic for Burnout would be best served taking the classics out for another spin, rather than taking a chance on this lemon.</em>"</p>

              <p>Netflix’s co-CEO, Ted Sarandos, doesn’t believe that the streaming giant is a negative force in the film industry. Instead, the soon-to-be owner of Warner Bros.&nbsp; believes Netflix is more of a savior.</p> <p>Netflix announced its <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875">$82 billion bid to gobble up Warner Bros</a>., the legendary film and media company, earlier today. If it clears regulatory hurdles, the deal will position the supreme ruler of streaming services as a God Emperor of a massive TV and film catalog, as well as the properties belonging to Warner Bros. Games, which include the Lego games, as well as DC adaptations like the <i>Arkham </i>series of <i>Batman</i> games, and the <i>Mortal Kombat</i> games.</p> <p>During an interview with <i>Time </i>magazine editor-in-chief Sam Jacobs <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/netflix-ceo-ted-sarandos-movie-theaters-outdated-1236376565/">earlier this year</a>, Sarandos was asked point-blank: “Have you destroyed Hollywood?”</p> <p>“No,” Sarandos replied, “we’re saving Hollywood.”</p> <p>The CEO then casted doubt on the role of movie theaters moving forward. Though the streaming giant will need to premiere some films in theaters to be considered for certain awards, Sarandos doesn’t see the theater experience as something accessible for most folks. He said:</p>

 <blockquote><p>If you’re [fortunate enough to live in] Manhattan, and you can walk to a multiplex and see a movie, that’s fantastic. Most of the country cannot.</p></blockquote> <p>It’s a bit of an odd statement considering that cars exist. Still, Sarandos sees the industry’s reliance on theaters as an arbitrary limitation he’s happy to dispense with, much to the displeasure of Hollywood veterans <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-academy-awards-mean-nothing-to-me-if-they-dont-mean-theatrical-avatar-director-james-cameron-says-netflix-films-should-not-qualify-for-the-oscars-because-theyre-not-in-theaters">like <em>Avatar</em> creator James Cameron</a>.</p>

 <p>The industry remains concerned over the impact Netflix is likely to have should its purchase of Warner Bros. go through. <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875">According to <i>A Shot</i></a>, the Director’s Guild of America, led by director Christopher Nolan, is going to meet with the streaming company to address “major concerns.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Directors Guild of America, led by president Christopher Nolan, plans to meet with Netflix to address major concerns regarding the streamer’s acquisition of Warner Bros. <a href="https://t.co/EcwdZ0A0Qz">pic.twitter.com/EcwdZ0A0Qz</a></p> <p>— A Shot (@ashotmagazine) <a href="https://twitter.com/ashotmagazine/status/1996978975311364261?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Theaters have been in a bit of a bind ever since the global pandemic made it hard to convince people to leave their homes to go see a movie. Should Netflix’s Warner Bros. acquisition go through, it’s all the more likely that even fewer movies may hit the literal big screen.</p> <p>And with that, let’s <a href="https://youtu.be/wKiIroiCvZ0">reflect on some wise words</a> about experiencing movies from one of the all-time greats.</p>

			<p>Russia is off the board for Roblox, as the country's media regulatory body, the Roskomnadzor, blocks the game from Russian citizens. Included in its reasons for the block is the safety of children with regard to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/texas-attorney-general-sues-roblox-claims-it-puts-pedophiles-and-profits-over-safety-of-children/">multiple reports</a> of <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-sued-louisiana-lack-safety-protocols-against-sex-predators/">abuse and child predators</a> on the platform and the Roskomnadzor's concern that children will be exposed to what it defines as "<em>inappropriate content</em>," including in-game LGBTQ+ content.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://tass.ru/obschestvo/25806963">local Russian publication TASS</a> and spotted by <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn41q11gy58o">BBC News</a>, the Roskomnadzor cited the platform being "<em>rife with inappropriate content that can negatively impact the spiritual and moral development of children</em>."</p>



<p>In response, a Roblox spokesperson said, "<em>We respect the local laws and regulations in the countries where we operate and believe Roblox provides a positive space for learning, creation and meaningful connection for everyone.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We have a deep commitment to safety, and we have a robust set of proactive and preventative safety measures designed to catch and prevent harmful content on our platform</em>."</p>



<p>Roblox may be one of the more high-profile titles to be blocked by the Roskomnadzor, but it is hardly the first. Just last week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-accused-of-removing-games-from-steam-at-russia-request-flick-solitaire/">a solitaire game was banned on Steam in Russia for its LGBTQ+ content</a>. And while much of the world would not agree with Russia's assessment that LGBTQ+ content is negative for the moral development of children, the overwhelming amount of reports and litigation that Roblox has faced over its lacklustre protections for children, which have resulted in predators abusing and assaulting kids, is not an unfair reason to block the popular game.</p>



<p>Roblox has been trying to make the platform a safer place for kids, and<a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-will-require-age-verification-with-facial-recognition-to-unlock-chat/"> just last month introduced age verification via facial recognition to unlock the ability to use in-game chat features</a>. Despite its issues and ongoing litigation, Robox continues to grow, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-sets-record-concurrent-users-gaming-platform/">recently set a peak concurrent users record that surpassed Steam's overall concurrent record</a>.</p>
