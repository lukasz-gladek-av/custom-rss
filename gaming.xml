		<p>It’s been a mixed year for Monster Hunter. Wilds released to much furore, hardly surprising when it’s the most visually impressive, mechanically complete, and approachable entry in the series to date, but Capcom have really struggled to nail down the game’s performance on PC, and players soon realised that with the lowered difficulty and small-scale updates, it was a shorter-lived game. But maybe Monster Hunter Outlanders can be the antidote?</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Outlanders Tokyo Game Show 2025 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gPiHE4-UvIY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Capcom, Level Infinite and developers Timi are hoping to change Monster Hunter’s fortunes in 2025 with Monster Hunter Outlanders. This all-new, original title is coming to Mobile (and perhaps PC if you’re smart enough to do some Android emulating), bringing with it the whole Monster Hunter experience, rather than a cut-down mobile version you’d have expected even a few years ago.</p>


<p>Oho ho. This <em>is</em> Monster Hunter. If you’ve played any of the games before, the action is immediately recognisable and fluid, and specifically, it feels like a proper Monster Hunter title. It starts, though, with choosing a character, and there’s a mix of all-new characters with their own look and special skills, alongside the traditional adventurer who’s capable of using any of the included 14 weapons.</p>
<p>They range from Pepe, who uses a Heavy Bowgun, leaping into the air and attacking freely while she’s airborne, through to Madelyne, who attaches spores to monsters while attacking with her Bow, detonating them when they reach a high enough stack. Midori is pegged as an ideal choice for Monster Hunter veterans, using a Long Sword, and retaining the classic Spirit Gauge mechanic, though with better mobility and more ways to build Spirit Gauge.</p>


<p>Staying true to type, I went with Great Sword, though after Wilds, I’m also thoroughly happy playing with the Bow. The character design is once again clearly Monster Hunter, though there’s a perhaps a slight move towards a more Eastern-influenced design rather than Western. It looks like the pre-built characters have been designed to pick up and play a little easier, and as the ones in our demo are largely ranged combatants, it feels like they’re supposed to stay out of danger.</p>
<p>I definitely did not stay out of danger. Our hands-on gave us two monsters to fight, the Radiant Pukei Pukei and the Radiant Rathalos. Both of them were instantly recognisable, but while much of their moveset remains unchanged, there’s a few new moves that will surprise and delight returning fans and veterans. That saw Pukei Pukei raining down poison in a larger AOE attack, while Rathalos’ flame attacks became even more dangerous.</p>

<p>Timi might have eyed up a little bit of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/24/wild-hearts-s-review/">Wild Hearts</a> when it was creating Outlanders too, and there’s some new traversal mechanics to help you get around the levels faster, starting with the zipline, which takes you from A to B with ease. There’s also the Ballista, which can fire you semi-gracefully into the sky, from where you can make use of the Breath of the Wild-style glider to get above your prey before hammering down on them with a weapon blow.</p>
<p>There’s also a grappling hook, and maybe even more things that we haven’t seen, but they help to make getting around much easier, even without a Palamute or Seikret to ride on, which has recently become my biggest worry for any future Monster Hunter games. Seriously, do you remember when we had to run everywhere? Outlanders seems to be getting this right, and there’s also fast travel back to camp to keep frustration at a minimum and the hunts coming thick and fast.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing about Outlanders is that playing on a touchscreen still worked well, though if you have the option of a controller, you’re going to take that every time. Alongside your regular attacks, with standard combos coming through repeated presses, there’s a series of more mobile moves, a dodge, and then the special move, which lets you dish out some major damage as well as looking very cool.</p>

<p>We were joined through this hunt by an AI character, and I hope that remains an option in the full release, as it’s not always convenient to play with others, something only amplified by the mobile format. There’s also your Palico, and an owl pal called a Trillan, who can help out with some airborne healing, and other support skills, if you need it. He kept me alive once or twice in the heat of battle, and he’s pretty cute to boot. I assume you’ll be able to dress him up with some finery like the rest of your crew.</p>
<p>Visually, Outlanders looks smart and detailed, with lush greenery stretching off into the distance, and the monsters look as good as they have done elsewhere, at least as good as the Hi-Res PS5 version of Monster Hunter Ride. Outlanders is clearly pushing the current crop of mobile hardware pretty hard. Our test unit was an iPhone 16 Pro, and even with a cooling fan, they were running pretty warm – something the 17 Pro has tried to solve that problem. That said, they were also pulling all-day duty on the Tokyo Game Show floor, and by the time I played, they’d have been running for at least four hours, so maybe we shouldn’t put too much stock in that.</p>
<p>I’ve been left impressed and hopeful by Monster Hunter Outlanders. It seems like a true entry in the Monster Hunter franchise, and one which marries classic action with a more recognisable hunting loop. If they get the customisation and crafting right – and there’s not too much in the way of aggressive monetisation – then I can see it being a huge hit on mobile when it launches for iOS and Android.</p>

It seems Sega has managed to assemble a dynamic, colourful racer to rival <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> in many respects, a feat which was far from a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>Yes, Sega was confident enough to directly reference Mario's all-conquering kart series <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/sega-reignites-its-nintendo-rivalry-in-new-sonic-racing-crossworlds-trailer">in a cheeky trailer</a>, and everything seems peachy on other platforms.

<p><em>But what about Switch 1?</em> you cry. <em>It's out now on Switch 1!</em></p>
<p>Well, unfortunately we don't know how the game holds up on the elder Switch just yet because we weren't able to get code prior to launch day. This is something that's only become more common over the previous generation, as Switch ports often arrive scorching hot at release. It's happened more than once with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/10/site-news-so-wheres-our-sonic-superstars-review">blue hedgehog</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/11/site-news-so-wheres-our-sonic-frontiers-review">games</a>, too.</p>
<p>Rest assured that we'll do our best to have our verdict on the Switch version live as soon as we can. Until then, let us know if you — <em>shock! horror!</em> — picked it up on Switch before reading our review, and how you've been getting on with it. In the meantime, why not get up to speed with our <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades 2</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/pac-man-world-2-re-pac">Pac-Man World 2</a></strong> reviews?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has officially announced&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 6</em>, the next installment in the&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon&nbsp;</em>series of simcade racers, and as well as PC and Xbox, the game will also be coming to PS5.</p>

<p><em>Forza Horizon 6&nbsp;</em>was unveiled during Xbox's spot at the Tokyo Game Show, so it feels particularly appropriate that the game will take players to Japan as its setting. The trailer shows off a number of Japanese accouterments, including a maneki-neko and a katakana license plate.</p>

<p>We didn't learn too much more about the game during the initial announcement, but we do know that after launching on PC and Xbox Series X|S in 2026,&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 6&nbsp;</em>will be coming to PlayStation 5. Whether it'll be available on Sony's console next year, however, remains to be seen.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/forza-horizon-6-announcement-forza-horizon-5.jpg?itok=NmC_VKte 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/forza-horizon-6-announcement-forza-horizon-5.jpg?itok=fZ7s6dvn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>After&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5&nbsp;</em>took us to Mexico,&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 6&nbsp;</em>will take place in Japan.</figcaption></figure><p>The next&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon&nbsp;</em>game is just the latest in a string of Xbox titles to make their way to PlayStation; it follows the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5-release-date-enhancements" rel="nofollow"><em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sea-of-thieves-grounded-and-pentiment-officially-announced-for-playstation-platforms" rel="nofollow"><em>Sea of Thieves</em></a>, among others.</p>

<p>It's not just Xbox crossing the divide, though; Sony is also reciprocating (to a degree, at least), since popular live-service shooter&nbsp;<em>Helldivers II&nbsp;</em>was released for Xbox Series X|S <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-xbox-series-xs-august" rel="nofollow">on the same day</a> as&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em>'s launch.</p>

<h2>What else did Xbox reveal at Tokyo Game Show?</h2>

<p>It's not just&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 6&nbsp;</em>that Xbox showed off during its Tokyo Game Show spot. We also got to see what else the studio is up to, including new trailers for&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>,&nbsp;<em>007: First Light</em>, and a first reveal for&nbsp;<em>Gungrave Gore Blood Heat</em>, a remake of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/gungrave-gore" rel="nofollow">the 2022 shooter</a>.</p>

<p>IO Interactive also revealed a brand new mission for&nbsp;<em>Hitman: World of Assassination&nbsp;</em>during the show, and it'll star none other than legendary Chinese martial artist and actor Bruce Lee, whom you must protect as he infiltrates a high-stakes martial arts tournament.</p>

<p>Launching next week</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Just like clockwork, The Pokémon Company has revealed the next <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Trading Card Game Pocket</a> expansion, 'Deluxe Pack ex', and it's a blingy one.</p>
<p>The upcoming set will arrive in the app on <strong>29th September</strong>, and brings new 'Parallel Foil' cards to the table. These glistening offerings feature new art for pre-existing cards, and come with a unique shine effect to really make them pop.</p>
<p>The big news from this new set, however, is that rare cards from previous expansions are <em>guaranteed</em> with every pack. Each pack contains four cards, one of which will be a ♦♦♦♦ rarity card or higher from the Genetic Apex set through to Wisdom of Sea and Sky. So, if you're still chasing shinies from all those months ago, this might be your chance to nab 'em.</p>
<p>Here's a closer look at a handful of the Deluxe ex cards we've seen so far:</p>


<p>In addition to the new set, TPC has also confirmed that a bunch of in-app events will be heading our way next month. These include a Raichu ex Drop event on 6th October and a Parallel Foil Cards Mass Outbreak Event on the 23rd.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/fox-hunt-multiplayer-mode-in-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-arrives-in-october/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-fox-hunt-multiplayer-mode-in-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-arrives-in-october.1308666/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During Konami's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQMxcCpkI44">Metal Gear Production Hotline presentation</a> at Tokyo Game Show 2025, we finally got a release date for the Fox Hunt multiplayer mode coming to Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, which is due to arrive on October 30, 2025.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/konami-debuts-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-multiplayer-mode-fox-hunt/">multiplayer mode was first debuted back in June 2025</a>, ahead of Metal Gear Solid Delta's launch this past August. Before its announcement, it wasn't clear if there would be a multiplayer mode in the remake like what was previously included in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. When it was revealed, it became clear that the answer to that question was still no; there wasn't going to be a multiplayer mode like what players had in MGS3.</p>



<p>Fox Hunt is markedly different than the old multiplayer mode, a change that, per what Konami said when it was first revealed, came out of a desire to "<em></em><em>broadens the franchise’s core stealth element where players must utilize their environments to camouflage and evade opposing players</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="METAL GEAR SOLID Δ: SNAKE EATER - FOX HUNT Extended Look | Konami Press Start" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4xGBiC4K9ME?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Granted, it doesn't look like it's a bad change. The mode seems like it'll take good advantage of the stealth mechanics available in Metal Gear Solid Delta. What's perhaps most unfortunate about the coming mode, is that just ahead of MGSD: Snake Eater's launch, Konami <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-fox-hunt-multiplayer-fall-no-crossplay/">confirmed it would not include support for crossplay.</a> </p>



<p>We'll see if that changes in the future, potentially if players continue to ask for it to be added. In the meantime, at least we have a date to look forward to for when we can all try out Fox Hunt.</p>



<p>In other Metal Gear Solid news, Konami put out a survey for Tokyo Game Show 2025 asking players <a href="https://wccftech.com/konami-wants-to-know-which-metal-gear-solid-game-you-think-should-be-remade/">which MGS game they thing should get the remake treatment that MGS3 got with Delta</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>studio HoYoverse has officially unveiled&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em>, and it is indeed the studio's first foray into cozy gaming, with closed beta signups available now if you want to get a chance to try it out.</p>

<p>We got our first glimpse of&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>earlier this week when HoYoverse <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-petit-planet-teaser" rel="nofollow">updated the game's socials</a>, and just as expected, a full reveal wasn't far behind. In a press release, the studio describes its new game as a "cosmic life simulation" that "blends the joy of creation, discovery, and community-oriented experiences".</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em>, you'll nurture your very own planet, tending to its ecosystem and shaping it as you see fit. As you play, you'll form a galaxy "by connecting with different planets scattered across the starry sky".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/petit-planet-announced-flower.jpg?itok=xwolBn44 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/petit-planet-announced-flower.jpg?itok=K-xQ9vCY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>represents HoYoverse's first foray into cozy gaming.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will feature a variety of the kinds of activities you'd probably expect from a cozy game, like fishing, mining, and cooking, as well as "beachcombing" and "harvest[ing] exotic crops".</p>

<p>It looks like you'll also be able to fill up your planet with&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>-style Neighbors, who will move in and populate your little corner of the galaxy. You can also build connections with these Neighbors and form relationships with them "through heartfelt conversations, thoughtful gift exchanges, and unique interactions".</p>

<p>You'll also be able to venture beyond your planet by visiting the Galactic Bazaar, described as "an ever-bustling social hub where conversations spark over coffee" and you can meet other players to forge friendships with them.</p>

<p>You can take a look at the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>right here. It should give you a good sense of what you can expect when HoYoverse's cozy game eventually lands on our planet.</p>




<p><em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>is coming to PC and mobile devices, although HoYoverse says "additional platforms [are] currently in development".

            <p>A former developer on massive Elder Scrolls mod project <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a> who called its current 2025 release goal "unachievable" has suggested March 2026 as a "fitting" release window for the task of remaking Oblivion in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>'s engine.</p>
<p>Around the time of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivion-project-lead-says-release-date-reveals-finally-getting-closer-as-oblivion-remake-mod-shows-off-revamped-intro">mod's most recent showcase</a>, ex-Skyblivion level and world designer Dee Keyes put out a tweet <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivions-2025-release-goal-is-pointless-and-unachievable-claims-longtime-dev-accuses-two-leads-of-rushing-the-mod-out">accusing its project lead and implementation lead of rushing the mod out the door</a> to meet a 2025 release goal that Keyes dubbed "pointless and unachievable". The modder also accused the pair of mismanaging the project by not keeping up communication between leads and other developers in terms of key decisions. Keyes' claims and very public split from the Skyblivion team naturally led to questions being asked of the remaining Skyblivion devs, with the mod's comms lead telling fans: "Our aim is that it will be by the end of the year, if we as a team decide that it isn't we will be sure to share that."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Speaking in an interview that'll be arriving in video form on RPS sister site Eurogamer's YouTube channel soon, long-time Skyblivion dev Keyes has now shared more about what he considers a reasonable release timeline for the mod, as well as his reasons for airing his concerns in the very public fashion he did. Asked what he'd consider a reasonable release goal for the mod in terms of avoiding crunch, Keyes said the following:  </p>
<blockquote>Whenever I wanted to delay, I wasn't even thinking of a year. I was thinking of a handful of months [extra]. Personally, I would love to see, this is just me wishing, but I would love to see March 2026 because that would make [it] the 20th anniversary of Oblivion. It'd be a nice fitting release date, I think. That would give an extra three months and that's like gold to us [developers]. So, I definitely feel like early 2026 would be nicer on the developers. But yeah, I'm on the outside now.</blockquote>
<p>Given the strength of the language Keyes used when dismissing 2025 as an ideal release goal, I'm a tad surprised he reckons a few more months would be all it'd take to polish Skyblivion to a satisfactory degree. That said, the dev had made clear he was only pushing for extra polishing time, rather than a longer delay that might lead to feature creep.</p><p>As for whether making the 2025 release goal was something that other Skyblivion devs were worried about, Keyes said: "I think it was definitely a concern a number of people had. Quite a few of them were leads as well, but I noticed that just for some reason, nobody was saying it. It was just more of like sort of a heavy feeling that was surrounding a lot of developers. And I'm always kind of the, for lack of a more elegant term, sometimes a bit of a shit stirrer. If nobody's saying anything, I'm going to try and get people to say something, because I hate miscommunication. It can ruin so many things."</p>
<p>In terms of corner cutting, the dev said his concerns stemmed from the idea that "if we're putting out assets or environments that don't even look as good as Oblivion, we're not living up to the whole point of the project".</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Keyes dismissed the official Oblivion Remaster as a factor in any desire to make sure Skyblivion releases in 2025. On the other hand, he suggested that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-6">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> is a release that could have consequences for Skyblivion, since it might lead to questions about starting from scratch in that game's engine. Though unless Bethesda suddenly push the big TES VI go button soon, odds are that won't be an issue - in 2023, Microsoft's Phil Spencer estimated that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-6-announced-five-years-ago-is-still-five-plus-years-away">the next numbered Elder Scrolls won't launch before 2028</a>.</p>
<p>Despite no longer being part of the mod's team, Keyes was also clear that he's hoping its release will go positively, whenever it comes. The modder said he hopes Skyblivion'll avoid major bugs at launch. "I do genuinely believe people are going to absolutely love what they're playing," he continued. "It's going to feel like a very unique thing they're playing because very rarely do you get to play something that's in production for this long. Not because of any development hell, but because they just wanted to take that amount of time to really focus on every detail."</p>
<p>We've reached out to the Skyblivion team for comment.</p>
<p>If indeed Keyes is right to claim that a lack of communication has plagued Skyblivion, here's hoping that its remaining devs can stay on the same page from here on out. The rest of us won't know how much time it ideally needed in the oven until we've got our hands on it, but with a volunteer project that's been in the works this long, I'm crossing my fingers that the modders produce a game that lives up to their own expectations.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>What does it mean for a game to take your breath away? For me, it’s when what I’m being shown on screen makes me forget, no matter how briefly, to suck oxygen into my lungs or let the spent CO2 slowly exhale. The normal, mundane rhythms of my biology become interrupted in some way. For a moment or two I’m jarred out of the ordinary. This happens a lot in </span><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i><span>. To what end I’m still not sure. Sucker Punch Productions has outdone itself, but is all that beauty and artistry in service of yet another impressive Sony blockbuster of the type we’ve come to expect, or something more?</span></p> <p><span>I’ve ridden horseback through a number of fields, killed hundreds of foes, and spent an inordinate amount of time picking through the game’s open-world distractions, compelled by both pleasure and the irksome strain of obsessive completionism unique to games. Many of the things I’ve encountered in </span><i><span>Ghost of Yotei </span></i><span>I’ve done or witnessed before, but the sheer craftsmanship with which they’re recreated leaves me struggling to turn away.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Set hundreds of years after the events of </span><i><span>Ghost of Tsushima</span></i><span>, the sequel follows wandering outlaw </span><span>Atsu as she returns to her homeland on the outskirts of Shogun rule looking for the Yotei Six, a group of ruthless killers who tortured her and murdered her family when she was still a child. Played by Erika Ishii, she makes for a much more grounded and compelling lead than </span><i><span>Tsushima</span></i><span>’s honor-bound aristocrat Jin Sakai.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000628702" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628702"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628702">Sucker Punch Productions / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Where the original game was a war story, </span><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i><span> is situated more like an American Western with Atsu and her wolf companion navigating a lawless frontier where samurai, raiders, and bounty hunters dish out competing forms of justice in a changing world. Nearing what I understand to be around the halfway point of the game (look for my full review closer to launch), </span><i><span>Yotei</span></i><span> is already a much more strongly written and engrossing cinematic adventure than its predecessor.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>A tale of revenge might sound clichéd–will she outgrow her past trauma or be forever chained by it?–but a rich cast of multidimensional characters with their own motivations, struggles, and backstories keeps </span><i><span>Yotei</span></i><span> from being </span><i><span>just</span></i><span> a violent campaign against those who wronged you. Atsu thinks killing the Yotei Six will revolve her past, when really it’s just another way of running from it.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Combat feels much the same as that in the first game, but with new weapon types substituted in for particular schools of fighting. The highlight here are dual katanas that let Atsu cut enemies to pieces in the blink of an eye, but each tool is still governed by its effectiveness against particular enemy types. It’s fun and beautiful when everything comes together, but </span><i><span>Yotei </span></i><span>still makes a number of trade-offs in service of the spectacle.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000628705" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628705"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628705">Sucker Punch Productions / Sony</figcaption></figure> <p><span>It’s not as fluid as the rhythmic juggling of</span><i><span> Spider-Man</span></i><span> or the </span><i><span>Batman: Arkham </span></i><span>games and not as responsive and tightly tuned as more arcadey action games. The camera can still be a pain to manage as enemies nip at you from off-screen with arrows or unblockable attacks. This friction is meant to be overcome with new upgrades and skills, but boss fights especially still feel like cinematic events first, with the gameplay elements grafted onto them second.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>This is where the breadth and visual splendor of </span><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i><span>’s world comes in. Built from the ground-up for PS5 unlike the first game, there’s a whole new level of depth, detail, and polish in how Sucker Punch has rendered the wilderness of its Japanese setting. I’m constantly mesmerized by smoke lilting over trees and small villages in the distance, or how the wind lavishly frolics across a field of tall grass or yellow flowers. No screenshot or video clip and truly do it justice, even on the base PS5.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It’s also clear that a lot of effort has gone into masking the fact that this game leans heavily on the same kinds of repetitive tasks that other open world some games openly taunt you with, cluttering their maps full of icons that threaten to induce burnout with their sheer volume and sameness. While gold birds still lure you to points of interest and you frequently encounter camps, fortresses, and other areas waiting to be “liberated” from surrounding factions, </span><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i><span> tries very hard to make all of this stuff feel like it’s just unfolding naturally, rather than being just a scavenger hunt of perfunctory tasks to complete during lulls in the main story.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000628704" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628704"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628704">Sucker Punch Productions / Sony</figcaption></figure> <p><span>One big question for </span><i><span>Yotei</span></i><span>, and the trajectory of Sucker Punch’s games over the last two decades, is whether it wants to compete directly with the best open world adventures around like </span><i><span>Red Dead Redemption 2</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>The Witcher 3</span></i><span>. From where I currently sit, I’m not sure. At times its main story feels like it wants to be an action-packed interactive movie, a la </span><i><span>Uncharted</span></i><span>. At other times it’s lavishly trying to gamify mundane chores like cooking and bathing to make the world seem more realistic, natural, and immersive.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The result is a lot of variety that keeps things fun but doesn’t always coalesce into something more. I’ve yet to encounter a side story that left me especially surprised or moved, or a particular stealth sequence, battle, or mini-game that made me desperate to find the next. </span><i><span>Ghost of Yotei </span></i><span>does so many things at such a high bar of craft and quality but doesn’t always justify its particular mix of mechanics and gameplay concepts.&nbsp;</span><span>It can feel like </span><i><span>Westworld</span></i><span>: an immersive theme park of attractions still searching for the connective tissue that can turn it into something more. So far it feels like </span><i><span>Ghost of Tsushima </span></i><span>but more and better. </span></p> <p><span>Is that enough in 2025? Maybe. It’s still a massive achievement from a production standpoint. Many have tried and failed to turn out superb big-budget games with such predictability. But I’m still searching for the part that shows the core experience at the heart of </span><i><span>Yotei</span></i><span> has leveled up just as much as each of its constituent parts. And with a game this pretty, I’m happy to keep looking. </span></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/farthest-frontier-understands-the-best-moments-of-city-builders-are-the-beginnings">I was really impressed by Farthest Frontier when I played it in early access a few years ago</a>, so much so, I've been keeping an eye out for the full release ever since. And we now finally know when it will be: 23rd October, which isn't far away at all.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1044720/Farthest_Frontier/">Farthest Frontier is a city-building game</a> spun around the idea of a group of settlers heading into a wilderness in medieval times and establishing a settlement of their own there, growing it from a handful of huts and shacks into something resembling a town.</p>
<p>What's different about this game is how up-close the action is. You get to know settlers on a personal level, seeing details about who they are and what they're like, and the game delights in the minutiae of surviving in a period like this. For instance, you'll assign someone to fish and then have to build a little smokehouse nearby for them to smoke and preserve the fish in, but if you build the smokehouse too near people's houses, they'll complain about the smell, and rightly so. But if you don't smoke the fish, they'll go rotten in your stores.</p>

<p>Expect to think a lot about crop rotations and farming, to think about water supplies and how to keep them clean and away from your town's organic waste, lest you spread disease. And to think about making sure everyone's wrapped up to survive the very present seasonal weather. (There are difficulty options to nudge the complexity down if you want.)</p><p>This zoomed-in approach brings a great deal of calm with it. This is a slow game about the aspects of day-to-day life we now take for granted - that are handled automatically for us - and it is very connected to nature and the land around your settlement. Bears can roam into your settlement and attack your people, brilliantly. Well, it's not brilliant for the people living there and getting mauled, but it's entertaining to watch. Generally, though, it's a very peaceful and gently absorbing game, full of forgotten intricacies of a time gone by.</p>

<p>But enough about that! Farthest Frontier has been in early access for three years now, and the success it's enjoyed there - 1.2 million sales - has allowed developer Crate Entertainment to significantly beef-out the game. The 1.0 release will bring a significant amount of new content as well, including revamped progression, dozens of new building types, bridges (I hope there's some troubled water to cross), a new policy system, updated animations, and more.</p><p>Note that the game's selling price will increase when it launches, too, to reflect it being a fully rounded game. It will rise from $30 to $35 (the price here is currently £25, which I expect means it'll rise to £30 at launch). Those existing prices will dip again before launch in a Steam Autumn Sale, which begins 29th September. Potentially, there's a deal to be had.</p>

<figure><a title="Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159166/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>I admit it. When this review came along, my gaming patience was being tested to its limit by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a>’s brutal difficulty. So I rolled pretty enthusiastically towards an alternative I hoped would be more relaxing. (I genuinely regret the hours I spent defeating The Last Judge.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pac-man-world-2-re-pac">Pac-Man World 2: Re-Pac</a> seemed the ideal pellet-shaped breath mint to freshen things up. But while this ground-up remake will likely please fans of the 2002 original, it’s ironic that I found myself haunted by similar frustrations that I was experiencing elsewhere – including bosses that crossed the line from being challenging to becoming a bit of a chore. For newcomers more generally, you’ll have to decide whether the price point of £34.99 at launch fits your budget for what is, at its core, a six-to-seven-hour experience in a genre where there are so many other options.</p>
<figure><a title="Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159175/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>First, let’s address the concerns of those primarily interested in the <em>quality</em> of this refresh. For the most part, the new additions are incredibly positive. The inclusion of a landing target as you jump — a circle that shows you where you’re heading and makes platforming pain-free — is extremely welcome and gets rid of some of the frustration a game with its heart in the early noughties might give its players.</p>
<p>The graphical upgrade impresses, too. This is no ‘sharper’ re-release like we’re getting elsewhere with certain galactic competitors. In comparison, the older version now looks a little primitive, with some garish shadows. Finally, Pac-Man and the inhabitants of Pac-Land have been brought to life in a way that more lives up to the franchise’s promise, longevity, and sense of fun. From the sun-drenched town that serves as the level hub (and gives access to retro-inspired challenge mazes), to the longer draw distances, everything looks good. Only some moments of retro game design — camera frustrations, mostly — undermine the overall impression.</p>
<figure><a title="Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159169/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Performance on Switch 2, except for two very brief stutters, is 30fps in 'Quality' 4K docked mode, or 60fps at 1080p (docked or handheld). I didn’t have the chance to play on the original Switch, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/pac-man-world-2-re-pac-switch-and-switch-2-performance-and-resolution-detailed">but 30fps is the max there in any mode</a>. A word of caution, though: anyone planning to play this game on Switch Lite might find the presentation too small. I’m not sure it would be comfortable. The presentation here doesn’t suit small screens quite like other platformers.</p>
<p>This second ‘Re-Pac’ (the previous <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pac-man_world_re-pac">Pac-Man World: Re-Pac</a> came out in 2022) has a decent amount of other new features. Now a second player can join in as a ‘Pac-Drone’ – ideal for a young child or anyone else happy to limit their gaming to shooting pellets at boxes and enemies. Changes to cut scenes and the level design also show up. The final boss, for example, is noticeably different to the original; the battle takes place in a slightly remixed arena with new enemies and attacks, and a more ambitious sheen to the presentation.</p>
<p>Then there are additions like the new mission mode. Here, the game asks you to fulfil three optional challenges on every stage, usually to pick up all the fruit (over 20 items – there’s a lot of fruit) and to achieve a medal on the time trial, plus one more random task.</p>
<figure><a title="Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159167/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>For me, the levels were just too long to make going back and collecting such a high number of items actually fun, especially when the collectables reset every time you play, so there’s no chance of diving back in for a solitary melon or a strawberry. But there are scenarios (playing with your children, maybe) where the extra content will be appreciated, I’m sure. Gather all the collectibles and you’ll end up unlocking new mazes, costumes, and figurines to display around your home village.</p>
<p>During its stronger moments, Pac-Man World 2: Re-Pac really is a lot of fun. I enjoyed the submarine and swimming levels. I enjoyed skating away from a giant snowball. I enjoyed all the moments when Pac-Man gulped down a giant pellet and turned into a chomping head, reminiscent of his classic games, and turned the tables on the otherwise invincible ghosts. I liked the sense of momentum and the surprise that the platforming was much more challenging than I expected (one famously difficult lava level used up over 20 lives). I had my work cut out for me at times, and that was fine.</p>
<figure><a title="Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159168/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>At a lower price, I might recommend the game more readily, but even then I would still lean into framing the review as assessing a slice of gaming history that’s been refreshed and renovated, rather than a game that truly earns its place alongside contemporary heavy hitters like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. There’s no shame in that, but let’s be clear – at its heart this is a much better-looking and smoother-playing version of a 23-year-old game. This story of the demonic Spooky stealing all of Pac-Land’s golden fruit, and the short little adventure that ensues, is a little old-school.</p>
<p>And, via moments of cumbersome difficulty reminiscent of a game from 2002, that’s my cue to tie this review back to the opening, specifically my self-indulgent use of Silksong as a reference. Let me say that I was grossly mistaken: I might have thought I was escaping frustration by playing a colourful Pac-Man game – surely it would be easy, right? But boy was I wrong during the finale. And not necessarily in a ‘fair’ kind of way.</p>
<p>I’d already had a little trouble with one of the bosses in the middle of the game, where I fell off the arena multiple times via a camera quirk that a modern platformer wouldn’t allow. I felt the same kind of unfairness here, too. Principally with some jumps I had to make rapidly in order to damage the boss – they erred on the side of being frustrating more than challenging and came after a sequence of attacks that were difficult to avoid and left me with barely any life left.</p>
<figure><a title="Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159172/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In a yellow-tinged irony, this boss had more than a passing resemblance to the Last Judge – and here’s the thing, I literally couldn’t kill it. I could not complete this game.</p>
<p>I don’t know what I was doing wrong. After 30 attempts, dying every time, having to go through the three stages of the boss fight over and over again, losing all my lives, suffering eight Game Overs, switching in desperation to the kid-friendly ‘fairy mode’ (that makes you invincible), and somehow <em>still</em> failing to succeed (I made the sequence of jumps <em>once</em>, then died at the top by flying off the arena), I was thrown back to the very start once again.</p>
<p>And I just had to stop. Honestly, maybe it’s time to go back to Silksong.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I don’t want to let my moan about the final boss overshadow the review. There’s still a fun game here, and a lovely remaster of a well-loved platformer. The things it does well — the personality of Pac-Man, friends, and enemies in the cut scenes, the variety in the gameplay — shine brightly. For those with nostalgia for the original, I’m sure you’ll enjoy your ‘Re-Pac’-aged version. It’s been made with love. For non-fans, however, this is a more difficult purchase to justify.</p>
<p>Arguably, the price is a little steep for what’s on offer, and some lingering retro-frustrations in the execution of the 3D platforming and boss fights might sit badly with an audience expecting a game with the finesse of more modern alternatives. Sure, even Donkey Kong Bananza has its share of cheap deaths, but the truth is Pac-Man World 2: Re-Pac isn’t in the same league. Short, sweet, prettified, retro, and not for everybody; those are the keywords here.</p></section>

<p>The limited-time store will be opening on <strong>22nd October until 16th November 2025</strong> and it'll be located on the ground floor of the <a href="https://www.westfield.com/en/united-kingdom/london">Westfield London Shopping Centre</a> in Shepherd's Bush, opposite the LEGO Store.</p>
<p>Fans will be able to get their hands on lots of official merchandise, and there will be a handful of exclusive items available only at the London store.</p>
<p>Those who want to get in on the first week/weekend (22nd-26th October) will need to reserve a slot. Reservations will go live on <strong>7th October</strong>, and given how fast those temporary Pokémon Center stores, you might want to get in fast here, too.</p>
<p>After that, from 27th until closing day on 16th November, you won't need a reservation and instead a queueing system will be in place.</p>

<p>The store will be open from 10am - 9pm Monday through Saturday, and between 12pm - 6pm on Sundays.</p>
<p>Nintendo describes the pop-up as "the first-of-its-kind shopping centre-based Nintendo store in Europe." If only we could get a permanent one...</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced the next major&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>expansion set, and this one works a little differently to the others.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/deluxe-pack-ex-is-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Deluxe Pack ex&nbsp;</em>expansion is coming on September 29th, and unlike previous&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-expansion" rel="nofollow">expansions</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-secluded-springs-booster-pack" rel="nofollow">booster packs</a>, it looks like you won't find any brand new cards contained within this one.</p>

<p>Instead,&nbsp;<em>Deluxe Pack ex&nbsp;</em>will introduce new booster packs that are guaranteed to contain one card from previous expansions (<em>Genetic Apex&nbsp;</em>through&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-expansion" rel="nofollow"><em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</em></a>) with a four-diamond rarity rating or higher.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-deluxe-pack-ex-cards.jpg?itok=CXCostXN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-deluxe-pack-ex-cards.jpg?itok=jjHLJwit 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s new expansion puts a fresh spin on old classics.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as offering up guaranteed high-rarity cards from previous expansions,&nbsp;<em>Deluxe Pack ex&nbsp;</em>will also feature brand new art for several older cards, including new full-art designs for cards that previously didn't have them.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to being able to "collect 'parallel foil' cards with a unique shine effect", according to The Pokemon Company, as well as a new Raichu ex drop event that will occur during the period in which&nbsp;<em>Deluxe Pack ex&nbsp;</em>is available.</p>

<p>That's right: this isn't a permanent expansion. The Pokemon Company says you'll be able to grab packs from&nbsp;<em>Deluxe Pack ex&nbsp;</em>until October 30th, at which point they'll be removed. However, the trailer does promise that these packs will be available again at some point in the future.</p>

<p>You can check out the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Deluxe Pack ex&nbsp;</em>expansion right here. It shows off some of the new art for existing cards, as well as some gorgeous ex designs.</p>




<p>News of the latest&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>expansion comes after The Pokemon Company promised Mega Evolution would make its way to the mobile card game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-evolution-fall" rel="nofollow">sometime this fall</a>; presumably, it'll be part of the next expansion set after&nbsp;<em>Deluxe Pack ex</em>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however,&nbsp;<em>Deluxe Pack ex&nbsp;</em>launches on September 29th and runs until October 30th. You can download&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>right now for free on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a> devices.</p>

            <p>Firaxis and 2K Games are working on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> update that revamps the game's map generation, while adding a couple of city states and rounding out Napoleon's skillset. It's <a href="https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/update-1-2-5-is-loading.699971/">slated to land sometime in the week of September 29th</a>. Why am I writing about it right now? Because senior graphics engineer Ken Pruiksma has just posted a little blog about the intricacies of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> map generation that caused Beethoven's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kcOpyM9cBg">Ode To Joy</a> to play tinnily in my head.</p>
<p>This is almost certainly a reflection of emotional diarrhea brought on by minor insomnia brought on by a nagging foot injury. Still, there's something... uplifting about the motions of plate tectonics as approximated by computer code. Perhaps you, kind stranger, will be similarly moved.
</p><!--more-->
<p>"When Civilization VII first shipped, the map generation technique we used focused on ensuring balanced play while following some new gameplay rules around things like Deep Ocean and Distant Lands," Pruiksma explains on <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/from-the-devs/map-generation/">the game's official site</a>. "This technique, which has its roots in previous Civ games, created fair maps, but also made them predictable." 
</p>
<p>That predictability led to complaints of repetitiveness during Civ 7's exploration phase. Players are also unhappy about "the straight-edged coastlines that could occur between the two major halves" of each map, as Pruiksma goes on. Firaxis are trying to address that in update 1.2.5 with two new map types - "Continents and Islands (two large continents, with islands) and Pangea and Islands (one large continent, with islands)". Both these map types use Voronoi diagrams to grow their landmasses, rather than fractal noise.
</p><p>Being a clueless humanities grad, I won't try to explain Voronoi diagrams - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram">Wikipedia page</a> calls them "a partition of a plane into regions close to each of a given set of objects". I'm not qualified to walk you through "fractal noise", either, other than to theatrically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_noise">repeat</a> that it "sounds like a waterfall". Thankfully, Pruiksma jumps straight to explaining the impact of these unsettling math demons on Civilization map generation. 
</p>
<p>Fractal noise, he notes, "works really well when it can be applied uniformly to the whole map. That said, it can be hard to steer towards specific gameplay needs. Voronoi diagrams, on the other hand, give us structure we can build rules on top of, so maps can stay organic while still meeting the gameplay requirements of Civ VII." 
</p>
<p>Now, here's the walkthrough of how the new generator operates that had me hallucinating Beethoven. If you're not into Beethoven, maybe play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTJjQj6PkrY">this track from Gorillaz album Demon Days</a>.
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Randomly spray a bunch of points onto the map. The more points we spray, the higher the resolution. We'll start low res.</li>
<li>Draw lines around each point dividing them into "cells." You end up with something that looks a bit like cracked glass.</li>
<li>Select some starting cells. These are the seeds of tectonic plates in the game map, similar to the tectonic plates that form our Earth.</li>
<li>Each plate grows, one cell at a time, following some configurable rules, until the whole map is filled. Each plate gets a rotation and movement direction. This is your map's crust, and will be used to help influence the growth of continents later.</li>
<li>Now spray many more dots for a higher resolution version! Draw those lines again to get another shattered-glass look sitting on top of your tectonic plates.</li>
<li>Choose some new starting points for the primary landmasses, and grow them once again following a custom set of configurable rules. These rules can do things like influence landmasses to grow along plate boundaries (especially if they're colliding), avoid the poles, and prefer certain latitudes, just to name a few. This is also where we can apply gameplay-based restrictions, like ensuring Homelands and Distant Lands are separated by a Deep Ocean.</li>
<li>Based on the map's settings, we then grow islands, erode the coastline, add mountains and volcanoes, and perform other finishing touches. Many of these steps involve the same set of generic rules used earlier to determine where features are placed.</li>
<li>Once finished, we overlay the hex grid and then hand the map off to the gameplay layer to determine tile types, Yields, Resources, starting location, and more.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Wonderful! I think it's wonderful? I wish devs posted this stuff more often. Ah, remember when "generation" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">used to be a happy, magic word</a>, rather than the harbinger of cost-cutting. 
</p>
<p>We've only got his word for it, but Pruiksma says that the new Voronoi-derived maps appear "far more varied and look much more natural", with oddities or "impossible" features appearing more regularly, such as chains of islands between Homelands and Distant Lands.
</p><p>The tuning of the new generator is designed to produce "natural-feeling maps with standard gameplay" about "95% of the time", he comments, so every 1 in 20 games you might encounter something totally bizarre. If you're concerned about broken terrain, especially in multiplayer games, you'll still be able to play the old map types and generation processes after update 1.2.5.
</p>
<p>Do you have a favourite map or terrain generator in a game of any genre? I have fond memories of certain pre-acquisition eras of Minecraft, when the invisible sandworms hired by Mojang to sculpt the geography would produce huge surface-level caves and giddy rock bridges a couple of pickaxe swings away from being floating islands.
</p><p>
Also yes, regulars who know who they are - this is your cue to once again recommend <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-v">Civilization 5</a>'s <a href="https://forums.civfanatics.com/forums/community-patch-project.497/">Vox Populi mod</a> as a vastly superior alternative to Civilization 7, which continues to divide players. I'm not avoiding writing about that mod, I'm just short of time. I never have enough time!</p>

              <p>Tokyo Game Show continues, and following on from September 24’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/state-of-play-playstation-5-sony-stream-youtube-twitch-2000628258">PlayStation State of Play</a> it was Microsoft’s turn to reveal brand new games and show new footage of those we already knew about. The event had a strong Japanese theme, featuring Japanese-developed action and RPG titles as well as games set in Japan, including <em>Forza Horizon 6.</em></p> <p>Japan has always been a tricky region for Xbox, where PlayStation and Nintendo are home favorites. But Phil Spencer kicked off the show in positive spirits, calling Japan “a source of inspiration for Xbox.” He added, “Our commitment to Japan and the broader Asia-Pacific region is unwavering. For years we have championed local game creators and connected them to a global audience through Game Pass and the Xbox platform.” Things then took a slightly odd turn as it began to sound more like a corporate apology with, “Together we’ve built strong momentum and growth in Asia, and will continue to listen, learn and thrive with these creators and communities.”</p> <p>You can watch the full showcase below, or read on to see absolutely everything that was shown.</p>

  <h2><em>Gungrave G.O.R.E. Blood Heat</em></h2> <p>Third-person shooter series <em>Gungrave</em> began with the eponymous title in 2002, followed by 2004’s <em>Overdose</em>, before an enormous 13-year hiatus and the opportunistic 2017 VR title <em>Gungrave VR.&nbsp;</em>However, in 2022 the series came back properly with <em>Gungrave</em> <em>G.O.R.E</em>., before a 2023 Nintendo Switch version called <em>Gungrave G.O.R.E. Ultimate Enhanced Edition</em> that made over 100 changes to the previous version. Well, it’s getting overhauled again!</p>

   <p><em>Gungrave G.O.R.E. Blood Heat</em> is a “fully rebuilt version,” with a new engine, improved assets and a “modernized system,” whatever that might be. Beyond the Grave, the exquisitely well-named main character, returns to shoot squillions of enemies while carrying his own coffin on his back. Video games! Reviews generally found the 2022 version mediocre, with complaints of repetitive enemies and difficulty spikes, so this new version feels a lot like an attempt at yet another do-over. No word on a release date yet.</p>

 <h2><em>007 First Light –&nbsp;</em>Gemma Chan Reveal</h2>  <p>IO Interactive’s James Bond game, <em>007 First Light</em>, revealed a new character. <em>Eternals</em>‘ Gemma Chan is a part of the cast of the spy thriller, playing Dr. Selina Tan, “a brilliant and passionate academic with a background in psychology and game theory whose role at MI6 is critical in Bond’s journey to earning the 00 status.”</p>

 <p>As part of the reveal we got to see a bunch more of the game itself, including cars tearing around corners and through market stalls, as well as some gunplay and hand-to-hand combat, before seeing Tan in her MI6 office, asking Bond if he has any questions. “Please have questions.”</p>

 <p><em>First Light</em> is due out March 27, 2026.</p> <h2><em>Double Dragon Revive</em></h2>  <p>It’s been 8 years since there was a new mainline <em>Double Dragon</em> beat ’em up, which is crazy. Although given how awful 2017’s&nbsp;<em>Double Dragon IV</em> proved to be, perhaps people didn’t miss it that much. Aside from 2023’s crossover spin-off&nbsp;<em>Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons</em>, the franchise has been quiet since, until the recent announcement of&nbsp;<em>Revive</em>.</p> <p>It’s being published by Arc System Works, the company that developed the botched <em>DD4</em>, but this time is being developed by veteran developers Yuke’s, the studio behind many <em>WWE&nbsp;</em>games as well as recent&nbsp;<em>Earth Defense Force</em> entries. This is their first try with the&nbsp;<em>Double Dragon</em> license, so it’ll be interesting to see which way it falls. Not long to wait, given it’s out on all systems October 23.</p> <h2><em>Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly Remake</em></h2>  <p>Koei Tecmo Games’ Makoto Shibata, the director of every&nbsp;<em>Fatal Frame&nbsp;</em>game since 2001, introduced the remake of 2003’s sequel, <em>Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly</em>. The horror game has been completely rebuilt in Koei Tecmo’s modern engine, with a big emphasis on sound quality and improvements to the camera technology you use to photograph, and thus destroy, the game’s ghosts. The game also adds holding hands with your sister as a core element, and if <em>Ico</em> taught us anything, it’s that this makes everything 700 times more emotional.</p>

 <p>It’s due out early 2026.</p> <h2>Animo</h2>  <p>Nintendo’s lawyers might want to pick up their pens, because&nbsp;<em>Animo</em>‘s trailer features about 37 very familiar-looking creatures running around in the creature-capturing action-RPG. Here we go again.</p> <h2><em>Sudden Strike 5</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000628670" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628670"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628670">© Kalypso / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It seems Microsoft forgot to upload the trailer for this one alongside all the others to their YouTube account, which hopefully is no commentary on the game itself being forgettable. <em>Sudden Strike 5</em> was announced a couple of months ago, and isn’t out until next year, but we got to learn that the real-time tactics game has not only a “new doctrine system” but also an “armored train.”</p>

 <h2><em>Fallout 76</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000628671" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628671"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628671">© Microsoft / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Bill Lacoste and Jon Rush popped up to give us an update on&nbsp;<em>Fallout 76</em>, listing the new features that have been added to the game this year, with the segment focusing on camps built by Japanese players. Nothing new here, however.</p> <h2><em>Monster Hunter Stories </em>Series</h2>  <p>Capcom’s cuddlier end of the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em> series appeared, with glimpses of turn-based <em>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</em> as well as the two previous games in the offshoot. You know what, this trailer is so joyfully colorful that it just made my eyes happy.</p> <h2><em>Bruce Lee </em>in<em> Hitman: World of Assassination</em></h2>  <p>Thank goodness, no, you’re not being sent to assassinate Bruce Lee in <em>Hitman</em>&nbsp;<em>World of Assassination</em>‘s latest Elusive Target. Instead you’re protecting the man, as if he would ever need that. It’s all set at an international martial arts tournament at the Himmapan Hotel in Bangkok, where Lee has infiltrated the event as an agent <em>and</em> fighter. You have to aid him in his win, and indeed help him take out a vital target. Which all…I dunno, it seems a bit patronizing. Bruce Lee, who clearly couldn’t give permission to be in this, shouldn’t need baldy’s help at all.</p>

 <h2><em>Hotel Barcelona&nbsp;</em>multiplayer</h2>  <p>Xbox president Sarah Bond popped up to summarize things so far, as well as boast that everything at the show is playable on the Xbox Ally when it comes out in October. She then introduced a game launching tomorrow, the new game from SWERY and SUDA51,&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona,</em> and showed off a trailer for its multiplayer.</p> <h2><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake –&nbsp;</em>Ocean Floor Playthrough</h2>  <p><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> producer Masaaki Hayasaka appears, showing us a brand new area of the forthcoming remake that didn’t appear in the original versions, the Ocean Floor.</p> <p>The combined games are out October 30.</p> <h2><em>Rhythm Doctor</em></h2>  <p>One-button rhythm game&nbsp;<em>Rhythm Doctor</em> looks nothing short of extraordinary. It’s out December 6.</p> <h2><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator&nbsp;</em>World Update 20: Japan</h2>  <p>Huge sections of Japan have now received the extraordinary&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em> treatment, as shown off in the trailer. It looks as mindblowing as everything else in the game, and is only spoiled by needing me to figure out how to fly planes to experience it. Given the game is still so state-of-the-art, and the updates are so new, it does seem odd that it’s persisting with the “2024” in its title. Seems like an odd marketing move to me.</p>

 <h2><em>Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven</em></h2>  <p>1993’s&nbsp;<em>Romancing SaGa 2</em> was remade in 2024 and released for Switch, PC, and PlayStation, with the Xbox snubbed. That’s changing today, as the Square RPG completes the set with an Xbox Series X/S version, and it’s out right now.</p> <h2><em>Starsand Island</em></h2>  <p>Nauseatingly cute&nbsp;<em>Starsand Island</em> is out February 1 on Xbox, as well as PlayStation and PC. (Oddly nothing about Switch 2.) As is the case in approximately 53 percent of all life-sim games, you’ve left your job in the EVIL big city, in this case moving to the PERFECT IN ALL WAYS rolling hills and sandy beaches of Starsand Island. So farm, fish, and have relationships like you do, while butterflies flit around your head and a bluebird probably delivers your mail. BOO CITIES! BOO!</p>

 <h2><em>Project Evilbane</em></h2>  <p>You’ll have to forgive me, but after a while these action-RPGs all start to look astonishingly similar to me, just a big whirling mess of swords, explosions, and purple lights. Still, if you need more, <em>Project Evilbane</em> has you covered. It’ll offer up to four-player co-op for missions and giganto-boss fights, but this reveal trailer doesn’t get too much into specifics. It’s still a fair way off, due in the second half of 2026.</p> <h2><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></h2>  <p>A hefty four minutes were devoted to October’s&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> and its approach to difficulty. Like the previous games in the action game series, it promises to be punishingly hard, boasting an AI that will scale with harder difficulty levels to better place enemies in stages and increase their numbers to adapt the challenge. However, at the same time there’s to be a “new hero mode” with “adjustable assists,” to help introduce new players to the franchise and get them, quite literally, up to speed. All the assists can be toggled off as you get to grips with things, or obviously can be ignored entirely if you’re an old pro. And the game’s not going to throw a fit if you decide you just want to switch to Normal or Difficult, even if you start in Hero Mode.</p>

 <p>Not long to go now, as the game is out on October 21.</p> <h2><em>Mistfall Hunter</em></h2>  <p>This latest information on&nbsp;<em>Mistfall Hunter</em>, which is sure to be one of the bigger soulslikes of the year, explores the game’s second playable map, The Solemn Needles. Glydhunters (that’s you) will explore this grim and bleached former forest to root out all its evils, and then take on the region’s mighty False God. There was no mention of a release date, but the game is still listed as 2025.</p> <h2><em>Winter Burrow</em></h2>  <p>November 12’s woodland survival game <em>Winter Burrow</em> really does look like nothing else in the show, its cute and cozy cartoon graphics looking like a forgotten favorite cartoon you had on a VHS tape. It’s all about being a little mouse, trying to restore a childhood burrow, and then—like all mice—knitting sweaters, baking pies, and making friends with your neighbors. Oh, and you’re also trying to find your missing aunt.</p> <h2><em>Terminull Brigade x Evangelion</em></h2>  <p>More swords, explosions, and purple noise in free-to-play co-op shooter <em>Terminal Brigade</em>, which comes to Xbox October 31. The trailer also reveals a crossover with <em>Evangelion</em>, due to come to the game November 30.</p> <p>However,&nbsp;<em>Terminull Brigade</em> has been out on PC since the end of July, where it has a terrible reputation on Steam. It’s apparently riddled with in-game currencies, loot boxes and in-app purchases, but even more damningly for a game that requires you to want to keep playing, people report that it’s woefully brief and repetitive. Who knows, maybe the Xbox version will be more promising?</p>

 <h2><em>Age of Mythology: Retold – Heavenly Spear</em></h2>  <p><em>Age of Mythology</em>‘s 2024 reboot has proved a big success, and new additions have gone down well with fans of the original and newcomers alike. It’s nice when something works out! The next addition to the old-school real-time strategy game is <em>Heavenly Spear</em>, a Japanese-themed entry that arrives September 30 across Xbox, PS5 and PC.</p> <h2><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>‘s Japanese multiplayer maps</h2>  <p>Following Tuesday’s reveal of the next <em>CoD</em>‘s multiplayer, the Tokyo Game Show stream revealed more that will be set in Japan. They look astonishingly well made, and apparently Japan will be an integral part of <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s multiplayer. It looks like a lot of work has gone in to properly representing the country, rather than just sticking a cherry blossom tree in the corner.</p> <h2><em>Forza Horizon 6</em></h2>  <p>While already pretty much established through leaks and rumors, and then <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-location-microsoft-tokyo-game-show-2000628658">even accidentally leaked by Microsoft itself</a>, the show finished with the reveal that&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 6</em> will take place in Japan. Beyond that, we learned nothing useful, other than a very splendid-looking vista with Mount Fuji as its backdrop. And yes, brilliant, bring it on! We all want&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 6</em>! But it would maybe have been nice to see, I dunno, a car? Maybe driving along a road? It’s due next year, bar major slips.</p>

The mode puts players into "cat-and-mouse encounters" as players must sneak around and survive.</p><p>Fox Hunt supports online matches with up to 12 players, and there will be two modes. The first of these is called Survival Capture, and it's described as a "tense, multi-phase mission" where players must capture Kerotan frogs. The number of frogs decreases as the match continues.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xGBiC4K9ME" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4xGBiC4K9ME" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The second mode is called Survival Intrude and it has players attempting to capture and hold zones, with the number of zones decreasing as the match plays out.</p><p>Players deploy with an AT-CAMO suit that allows them to camouflage themselves in different environments to blend in. Players also get an ability called Naked Sense, which detects nearby enemies and items.</p><p>Fox Hunt does not support cross-platform multiplayer, but players can creative private matches with friends on the same platform. Fox Hunt does not include any microtransactions.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review-youre-pretty-good/1900-6418396/" data-ref-id="1900-6418396">Metal Gear Solid: Delta Snake Eater review</a> scored the game a 9/10.

            <p>New packs in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> are an almost monthly occurrence now, but its next booster pack will be a look backwards.</p>
<p>Available for a limited time only, Deluxe Pack: ex will include a load of rare cards from across all previous booster packs to help you collect 'em all.</p>
<p>Each pack will only include four cards, but one is guaranteed to be of four diamond rarity or higher. Some will even have new illustrations.</p>

<p>Remember <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-dont-forget-to-spend-your-pokemon-tcg-pocket-pack-points">Pack Points won't last forever</a>, so perhaps that time is approaching?</p>
<p>As usual, there will also be a number of events coming to the game over the next month:</p>

<li>Bonus Week missions (12th - 19th October)</li>

<p>Marvel-ous</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>It feels like we're learning more about IO Interactive's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007 First Light</a> by the day, and today, the team has added another big name to the game's ever-growing cast list.</p>
<p>As revealed in the above trailer, Gemma Chan is joining the cast as Dr. Selina Tan, MI6's Head of Tactical Simulation. According to the official IO blurb, Tan is "a brilliant and passionate academic with a background in psychology and game theory whose role at MI6 is critical in Bond’s journey to earning the 00 status".</p>
<p>Here's a little bit more info about this brand-new Bond character from an IO Interactive blog post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/25/007-first-light-adds-gemma-chan/">Xbox Wire</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Selina oversees a cutting-edge program designed to test and refine the skills of MI6’s most promising recruits. With her background in psychology, strategy, and immersive technologies, she is as formidable as she is innovative.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We don't get to see all that much of Chan in action from the above trailer, but we do get the confirmation that this is a voice <em>and</em> likeness role, so expect to see a lot of this familiar face as you make your way through the spy adventure.</p>
<p>And if you're wondering where you've seen that face before, Gemma Chan is probably best known for her big-budget roles in the likes of Marvel's <strong>Eternals</strong>, <strong>Crazy Rich Asians</strong> and <strong>The Creator</strong>. That said, fans of British TV will likely recognise Chan from her starring role in the Channel 4 sci-fi series <strong>Humans</strong>, or her turn in the excellent 2009 <strong>Doctor Who</strong> special, 'The Waters of Mars'.</p>
<p>Chan joins the likes of <strong>The OA</strong>'s Patrick Gibson and <strong>The Walking Dead</strong>'s Lennie James in the upcoming Bond action adventure, which arrives on Switch 2 on <strong>27th March 2026</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday, Sony held a brand new PlayStation State of Play showcase, during which we got to see around 40 minutes of new announcements and reveals for upcoming PlayStation games. Here's everything that was announced during the show!</p>

<hr><h2>Housemarque kicks things off with&nbsp;<em>Saros</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/state-of-play-september-2025-saros_0.jpg?itok=FaXM9nII 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/state-of-play-september-2025-saros_0.jpg?itok=LBEy-fv6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Saros&nbsp;</em>is a lot like&nbsp;<em>Returnal</em>, it turns out.</figcaption></figure><p>When the State of Play was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-state-of-play-september-2025-confirmed" rel="nofollow">first revealed on Tuesday</a>, Sony promised that we'd get to see more of Housemarque's upcoming&nbsp;<em>Saros</em>, and indeed we did. It looks like a supercharged&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/returnal" rel="nofollow"><em>Returnal</em></a>, so if you liked that game's frantic third-person action, you'll probably like this too. It's coming on March 20th.</p>

<h2><em>Zero Parades - For Dead Spies&nbsp;</em>looks a lot like&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zero-parades-for-dead-spies-state-of-play-september-2025.jpg?itok=al5HL_IE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zero-parades-for-dead-spies-state-of-play-september-2025.jpg?itok=IDyzZk3R 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hey, ZA/UM's next game looks a lot like&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>, too. Is a theme emerging?</figcaption></figure><p>ZA/UM (or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-developer-zaum-confirms-game-cancellation-and-layoffs" rel="nofollow">what remains of it</a>) is up next, and it turns out that its painterly isometric RPG&nbsp;<em>Zero Parades - For Dead Spies&nbsp;</em>looks a lot like&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>. Whether it can maintain its predecessor's widespread love remains to be seen, however.</p>

<h2><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024&nbsp;</em>hits PS5 in December</h2>

<p>Next, we got to see footage of the rather impressive-looking&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-dune-expansion-announced" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a>&nbsp;</em>running on PS5, and it's hitting Sony's console on December 8th. Not only that, but it's getting a PS VR2 update next year for that extra immersion.</p>

<h2><em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>sure is a&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>game</h2>

<p>Do you like shooting guys? How about shooting guys...on a battlefield? Well, I'd imagine that if you answered yes to both of those questions,&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>is for you. We got to see some gameplay footage of it on PS5, and it's coming on October 10th.</p>

<h2><em>Deus Ex Remastered&nbsp;</em>revives a PC classic</h2>




<p>If you've ever found yourself wanting to play the original&nbsp;<em>Deus Ex&nbsp;</em>but being put off by its admittedly old-school potato-head graphics, then you'll want to check out&nbsp;<em>Deus Ex Remastered</em>, which revamps the classic im-sim on February 5th.</p>

<h2><em>Halloween&nbsp;</em>sounds ridiculously ambitious</h2>

You'll be able to take part in either "a standalone single-player story" or "dynamic asymmetrical multiplayer matches".</p>

<h2><em>Last Epoch&nbsp;</em>is coming to PS5</h2>

<p><em>Diablo</em>-esque hack-and-slash action RPG&nbsp;<em>Last Epoch&nbsp;</em>is coming to PS5, and developer Eleventh Hour Games took this opportunity to also reveal a brand new expansion, which will launch on the same day as the game itself does on PS5.</p>

<h2><em>The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin&nbsp;</em>is coming in January</h2>

<p><em>The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin</em>, an action RPG based on the iconic manga and anime series, is landing on January 28th, and we got a new look at some of its very anime-looking gameplay during the State of Play as well.</p>

<h2>Mega Man joins&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</em>' roster</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-racing-crossworlds-mega-man-state-of-play-september-2025.jpg?itok=gnmNmeON 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-racing-crossworlds-mega-man-state-of-play-september-2025.jpg?itok=moy0A1cN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Well, if Capcom won't do it...</figcaption></figure><p>With no brand new&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>game anywhere on the horizon, it seems it falls to Sega to keep the Blue Bomber's legacy alive. He'll appear as a playable character in&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</em>, which is out...well, today, as it happens!</p>

<h2><em>Nioh 3</em>&nbsp;gets a release date reveal, surprising nobody</h2>

<p>Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo's hack-and-slash Soulslike&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>is up next, and it's launching on February 6th on PC and PlayStation 5. Then again, we already knew that thanks to an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nioh-3-release-date-leak-amazon-japan-listing" rel="nofollow">accidentally-uploaded Amazon Japan listing</a>.</p>

<h2><em>Dynasty Warriors 3 Complete Edition Remastered&nbsp;</em>brings the nostalgia</h2>

<p>Remember that remaster of a classic&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors&nbsp;</em>game Koei Tecmo teased back in August? Well, it turns out that remaster is for&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors 3</em>, and you'll be able to check it out on March 19th.</p>

<h2><em>Code Vein II&nbsp;</em>brings more anime Soulslike goodness in January</h2>

<p>Next up, we got a release date for Bandai Namco's anime Soulslike <i>Code Vein II</i>, which will bring more stylized hack-and-slash action (and probably more incomprehensible plotting as well) when it arrives on January 30th.</p>

<h2><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles&nbsp;</em>gets a spotlight</h2>

<p>This one's not new, but it's nice to get a look at Square Enix's upcoming&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Tactics&nbsp;</em>remaster nonetheless. The revamped version of the iconic tactics RPG is heading your way on September 30th, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-chronicles-review-timeless-classic" rel="nofollow">read our review here</a>.</p>

<h2>Somehow,&nbsp;<em>Let It Die&nbsp;</em>returned</h2>




<p>I bet the return of roguelite hack-and-slasher&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/let-it-die" rel="nofollow">Let It Die</a>&nbsp;</em>wasn't on your bingo card, and yet here we are.&nbsp;<em>Let It Die: Inferno&nbsp;</em>revives the original game's "twisted, darkly funny dystopian world", and you'll be descending into the titular abyss when it arrives on December 3rd.</p>

<h2><em>Chronoscript: The Endless End&nbsp;</em>has a silly name, but it looks fun</h2>

<p>Next, it's an action RPG from the folks behind <em>RPG&nbsp;</em><em>Time: The Legend of Wright</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Chronoscript: The Endless End</em>&nbsp;brings a similar hand-drawn vibe, as well as a rather ridiculous name that evokes the halcyon days of PS1 JRPGs.</p>

<h2><em>Crimson Desert&nbsp;</em>launches in March</h2>

<p>Are you looking forward to Pearl Abyss' open-world action-adventure title&nbsp;<em>Crimson Desert</em>? Well, you won't have too much longer to wait for it, because the game is launching on March 19th, and more gameplay was revealed during this State of Play as well.</p>

<h2>PlayStation Plus gets some love</h2>

<p>Sony revealed some games heading to the PlayStation Plus subscription service next, including&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part II&nbsp;</em>(and its <i>Remastered&nbsp;</i>counterpart on PS5) tomorrow, as well as&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Goat Simulator 3</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Cocoon</em>.</p>

<h2>A big&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>update is coming</h2>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo&nbsp;</em>series has sold 100 million units around the world, it turns out, and to celebrate the milestone, creator Kazunori Yamauchi says a big update is coming to <i>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</i>in December, bringing new cars, new tracks, and more.</p>

<h2><em>God of War&nbsp;</em>is getting...a limited-edition controller</h2>

<p>How would you choose to celebrate the 20th anniversary of one of the most influential action franchises in gaming? If you said "with a limited-edition DualSense controller, of course", then you're on Sony's wavelength, but I'm not sure everyone else is. It's coming in October.</p>

<h2>Insomniac's&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Wolverine&nbsp;</em>gets some new gameplay and a release window</h2>




<p>At last! Insomniac took to the...er, the virtual stage next to reveal some gameplay footage (albeit some fairly heavily scripted footage) from&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Wolverine</em>, which, it turns out, is launching in fall next year. The reveal was followed by a neat little vignette about the making of the game.</p>

<hr><p>That's all from the September 2025 State of Play! Stay tuned for the next one, whenever that will be, and make sure to check back with us for all the other major publishers' events as and when they happen.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Things have been weird for PlayStation of late. After years spent cultivating an image akin to the HBO of video games through single-player franchises like <em>The Last of Us</em>, <em>God of War</em>, and <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, the company shifted focus, jumping on the live-service bandwagon to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games">mostly disastrous effect</a>. Aside from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22929852/horizon-forbidden-west-ps5-review">a few standouts</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24035730/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-review-ps5">a number of remasters</a>, those beloved single-player games have slowed to a trickle: which is what makes <em>Ghost of Yōtei</em> so notable. Like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21323144/ghost-of-tsushima-review-ps4-game-developer-samurai">its predecessor <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a>, it’s an attempt by studio Sucker Punch to merge the freedom of an open-world game with the style and drama of a classic samurai movie. More importantly, it’s exactly the kind of game that PlayStation needs more of.</p><p><em>Yōtei </em>isn’t a direct sequel, but rather a follow-up that tells a new story. This time around, you play as Atsu, whose family was killed when she was young by a group of outlaws known as the Yōtei Six. After barely surviving, she left her island home of Ezo and spent 16 years training to become a warrior capable of getting revenge. When she arrives on the island at the outset of the game, she has a very clear goal: to kill each of the Yōtei Six and then, ultimately, herself. She has each of their names written on a piece of fabric and plans to mark them off with blood after each kill. It’s both badass and unsettling.</p><p>What’s great about this setup is that it keeps the experience focused on that core theme of revenge. Like <em>Tsushima</em>, <em>Yōtei</em> doesn’t deviate too much from the typical open-world action game, and so it can feel very familiar at times. But with this idea of hunting down targets, there’s a flexibility as you approach each of the six in almost whatever order you choose. And most of what you’re doing, whether it’s looking for clues at a local tavern or learning a new weapon technique, contributes to this goal. You never lose the sense of the fact that you’re out for revenge, even when you’re dabbling in side quests. Over time, the people of Ezo start calling you <em>onryō</em>, a vengeful spirit, and that’s really how Atsu feels.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Sony Interactive Entertainment</cite></p></div><p>This structure makes <em>Yōtei</em> feel surprisingly fresh, despite that it’s not all that different from its predecessor otherwise. Many of the changes are subtle refinements. For one thing, the leap to the PS5 means the game looks incredible, and <em>Yōtei</em> takes advantage of that with some stunning set-pieces. The epic samurai duels take place in burning buildings, rain-drenched mountaintops, and fields of snow covered in golden leaves. It’s the kind of game where it’s hard not to constantly stop and take screenshots — which is very easy, as you can jump into photo mode with a single button press.</p><p><em>Yōtei</em> also has much more interesting side quests. They really vary in tone and gameplay; some involve an investigative element, as you seek out shrines in hard-to-reach areas to unlock new skills, while others are just plain funny, like an evolving series of quests about a hapless would-be samurai who is desperate to defeat Atsu. At one point, I even befriended a bear. It reminded me a lot of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/12/8586515/witcher-3-wild-hunt-review-ps4-xbox-one-game"><em>The Witcher 3</em></a>, where even seemingly simple stories proved to be deeper and more interesting, often with a haunting twist (the friendly bear story takes a <em>very</em> dark turn).</p><p>One element that separates the <em>Ghost</em> games from other, more bombastic open worlds is their moments of calm and reflection. As with the previous game, Atsu can seek out hot springs to relax and think back on her adventures, and there are new elements like cooking and playing a shamisen by the fire that have a similarly cozy vibe. At almost any point in the game, you can camp to replenish your spirit and cook some food, and other characters will often stop by your campsite for a chat. Given how bloody and violent the rest of the experience is, these moments of respite are very welcome.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Sony Interactive Entertainment</cite></p></div><p><em>Yōtei </em>is largely an improvement from its predecessor, in terms of both structure and story. But because the two games are so similar, <em>Yōtei</em> naturally shares some of the same flaws, which mostly stem from the sometimes incongruous mix of open-world action and the tone of a classic samurai flick. Combat is the biggest offender. When you’re fighting a few enemies — or just one of the more powerful foes — the swordplay is incredible, forcing you to be patient and strategic as you decide when to parry or attack and what kind of weapon to wield. But often, the game devolves into huge battles where the nuances of the combat get lost, and I found myself button-mashing my way to victory.</p><p>Worse still is that these battles can get in the way of the more laid-back exploration. As Atsu gains notoriety by killing her enemies, bounty hunters and other outlaws start seeking her out. Often, I would find myself repeatedly attacked by these would-be samurai while I was just trying to ride to my next destination. It became tedious and actively discouraged me from exploring the landscape, because I didn’t want to get tied up in another pointless conflict.</p><p>Mostly, though, <em>Yōtei </em>smooths out many of the issues of its predecessor, while rearranging itself to sharply focus on its epic tale of revenge. Atsu’s quest starts out violently straightforward, but things naturally become more complicated along the way thanks to some genuinely surprising twists that I won’t spoil for you. That combination of refined gameplay and cinematic story is exactly what PlayStation owners have come to expect, and <em>Ghost of Yōtei </em>shows that Sony can still pull it off. Which is good news, because <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/784746/playstation-state-of-play-september-2025-news-trailers">the pendulum appears to be swinging back to these kinds of games</a>.</p><p><sub>Ghost of Yōtei <em>launches on the PS5 on October 2nd.</em></sub></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/784888/ghost-of-yotei-review-ps5#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/784888/ghost-of-yotei-review-ps5]]></content:encoded>

In a launch week update, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2272540/announcements/detail/536605349656920275">the studio admitted</a> that “Several things have gone well. Clearly, not everything has.” Now Remedy has detailed a major, free update that aims to fix some of those problems.</p><p>It’s called “Breakpoint” and it’s launching on all platforms on September 29th. According to Remedy, “this update is more than just new content — it’s a refresh of how the core game is played.”</p><p>First up is a revamp of the job board, which is now known as the crisis board. Here’s how Remedy explains the change:</p><div><blockquote><p>The new Crisis Board replaces the old Job Board and presents curated Crises to play, making FBC: Firebreak feel more dynamic, less predictable, and closer to its first-responder fantasy.</p><p>At any given time, 4-6 Crises are active globally, ranging from full runs to shorter Jobs or Corrupted Jobs, each with randomized rewards, objectives, and length. The Crisis Board refreshes every 30 minutes.</p><p>Crises in Zones 1-2 have streamlined requirements and can occasionally swap in unique Alternative Objectives for added variety. The Quick Reinforce feature lets you jump into active runs to help other teams.</p></blockquote></div><p>And to deal with the lack-of-variety issue, <em>Firebreak </em>is getting five new enemy types, six new weapons (three grenades, three heavy weapons), and a total of 27 gun mods to add further customization. Perhaps most notable is a new mission called “Outbreak,” in which “a Mold infestation creates unique challenges, enemies, and a dangerous new condition.”</p><div><p>There are a handful of other changes to the experience. Yesterday <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F2272540%3Femclan%3D103582791474781150%26emgid%3D530984095140809424" rel="sponsored">Remedy detailed more simplified economy and progression systems</a>, and the studio says the onboarding has been improved as well with, among other things, a new tutorial level.</p></div><p>Whether or not these changes are enough remains to be seen, but the studio has further changes planned as well. An update in November will add a new game mode and cross-platform voice chat, and a third major update is expected in March. “We hope that these changes and additions make <em>FBC: Firebreak </em>more welcoming to new players while deepening the challenge and customization for veterans,” Remedy says.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/784967/remedy-fbc-firebreak-update#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/784967/remedy-fbc-firebreak-update]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dell%E2%80%99s-flagship-laptop-bundle-64gb-ram-2tb-ssd-crashes-to-71-off-while-lower-specs-still-cost-more.1308552/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re in the market for a new laptop, be it your a student, a small business owner, or just someone who’d like to access the internet on something other than your phone, turn your attention to this Dell Inspiron 15. It’s got touchscreen controls and comes with some free accessories. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4301/">Amazon has it listed at $3,000, but is currently marked down to just $880. That’s a whopping 71% discount equating to a savings of $2,120</a>. That sounds too good to be true?</p>
<p>Well, before you get too excited, most things that sound too good to be true generally are. If we look at the price history of this laptop bundle, it’s only been listed on Amazon for about a month. After just a few days, it shot down in price to $900, back up to full price for one day, then dropped again to where it is now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4301/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>So what’s going on here? Some sellers like to artificially inflate the list price and then immediately mark it down so it get that big red shiny button that says “Limited time deal” next to a huge percentage discount. Truthfully, when looking at the specs of this computer, it’s not worth nearly $3,000. The discounted price is way more reasonable for what your getting, even when considering the bonus gifts.</p>
<p>What we have here is a 15.6-inch laptop from Dell with a touchscreen display, allowing you to operate it like either a laptop or a tablet. It displays in 1080p HD. The machine is powered by an Intel 10-core i5 processor with an integrated graphics card. It’s packed with 64GB of RAM plus a full 2TB of storage on its SSD. It comes pre-installed with Windows 11 Pro.</p>



<p>As far as connectivity is concerned, the Dell Inspiron 15 is equipped with a USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C port, one USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A port, and a standard USB 2.0 Type-A port. You can also connect an SD card through the SD card reader to either expand your storage or access camera photos. The HDMI 1.4 slot allows you to connect to a second display. Plus, you get a headphone jack.</p>
<h2>Bonus Gifts</h2>
<p>The seller has thrown in some extra goodies you may find useful to you. With the laptop, you’ll also get a set of webcam covers, a cleaning cloth, and USB port covers. Those are just meh in my opinion, but it does also come with a laptop sleeve, a USB flash drive. and a stylus pen for the touchscreen. Those you might actually end up using.</p>
