		<p>Paradox Interactive has announced that Stellaris Season 9 launches today with the Stargazer<br>
Species Portrait pack out right now. Following on from this release there will be a lot more coming along over the year including two expansions and another pack. That includes the BioGenesis Expansion on May 5th, the Shadows of the Shroud Expansion in Q3 2025, and and the Infernal Species pack in Q4 2025. The Stellaris Season 9 expansion pass is priced at $44.99/€44.99/£37.99.</p>

Engineer living ships, terraform entire ecosystems, and wield advanced genetic tools to shape the destiny of your empire. Will you create a utopia of adaptation and growth or weaponize biology to dominate the stars?</em></li>
<li><em>Shadows of the Shroud Expansion (Q3 2025): The psionic plane holds untold power—but at what cost? Shadows of the Shroud is a complete overhaul of the Psionic Ascension path, introducing new moral dilemmas, patron allegiances, and the ever- present temptation of ultimate destruction.</em></li>
<li><em>Infernals Species Pack (Q4 2025): Forge your destiny in the Infernals Species Pack. Adapted to relentless heat and volatile landscapes, you wield the power of extreme environments to reshape the galaxy.

</ul>
<p>Alongside the release of the BioGenesis Expansion will be the free Stellaris 4.0 “Phoenix update, and this will rework the Trade experience as well as adding new population and workforce groups.

So imagine the feeling of sticker shock (complimentary) to spot one of Alienware’s models with a fast 360Hz refresh rate for hundreds of dollars off, which is the case <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/cty/apd/210-bljd" rel="sponsored">right now at Dell’s website</a>.</p><p>Originally $899.99, this monitor’s final price plunges to $599.99 when you use promo code <strong>AW27300 </strong>at checkout. With tax, my checkout total rang up to a cool $653.24. An OLED gaming monitor that costs less than a mid-range GPU? Hell yeah. At this price, there’s no need to wait for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/623428/dell-alienware-oled-monitor-aw2725d-price-release-date">Alienware’s forthcoming AW2725D</a>, which the company hopes (but isn’t promising) to launch for $549. It’ll have 1440p resolution with a 280Hz refresh rate, so it’s actually slower than Alienware’s discounted AW2725DF.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->600</span></p><div><p>The AW2725DF has a 360Hz refresh rate, 1440p resolution, and a decent PPI to ensure that text looks clear.</p></div></div><p>In terms of the specs, Alienware’s 27-inch AW2725DF sports AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, plus support for VRR via either its HDMI 2.1 port or through either of its DisplayPort 1.4 ports. That’ll ensure that the screen looks smooth and tear-free, even during moments when the frame rate fluctuates wildly. While the panel can achieve up to a 360Hz refresh rate — equating to 360 visible frames per second, if your GPU can keep up — it’s only supported via the DisplayPort. Through HDMI 2.1, the monitor’s refresh rate tops out at a respectable 144Hz.</p><p>The AW2725DF has an anti-reflective coating, but since I haven’t used this exact display, I can’t vouch as to whether it’s fully matte or slightly on the glossy side (the<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/623428/dell-alienware-oled-monitor-aw2725d-price-release-date"> newer AW2725Q</a> is more glossy than matte, in turn letting more contrast through). It has 111 pixels per inch (PPI), which should be enough clarity to avoid seeing pixelated text. A low PPI dampened my enthusiasm for other OLED monitors, including the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23509955/corsair-xeneon-flex-oled-gaming-monitor-features-price-hands-on">Corsair Xeneon Flex</a> that I reviewed in late 2022.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While we wait for season three, fans are left to ruminate on the end of season two and they’re very divided, particularly on the finale’s unforgettable last five minutes. The moral conundrum Mark S. (Adam Scott) deals with in those final moments is fascinating to debate, but the reactions to it may also indicate that some people aren’t engaging with the show’s themes, and are instead viewing it through a tunnel-visioned “ship wars” lens.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re just tuning in and want a quick recap as to why your timeline is yelling about some asshole named Mark and him not going home with his wife Gemma (Dichen Lachman), let’s break down the basics of <em>Severance</em>. In this show, people who work at a company called Lumon have their brains bisected so that they have two distinct memory banks. Their “innie” only has memories of their time within their office on the severed floor, while their “outie” doesn’t remember anything from their work day and goes about their life without a care in the world. The show sometimes explores questions about whether or not certain parts of one’s personality or inclinations are innate, but as far as the world of <em>Severance </em>is concerned, these are two individuals who share a body. Innies are only allowed to see or know about the outside world in controlled environments, and the show’s biggest mysteries are born out of this division. When those walls come down and Mark’s innie and outie are able to communicate in “Cold Harbor,” it becomes clear that the two share a body and little else.</p><p>Outie Mark asks his innie to save his wife from the depths of the severed floor’s testing facility, likely leading to the exposure of Lumon’s corruption, the dissolution of the company, and the “deaths” of every innie who works there. Mark tries to soothe his innie self into a sense of security by explaining that he’s in the process of “reintegrating” and combining both their memories, but not only does this sound like a half-measure to someone who wants to be more than a tagalong on someone else’s life, he doesn’t even know if he can trust his outie to finish the process. Throughout their conversation, it’s clear Mark views his innie as a means to an end, rather than as a complete person with his own hopes, dreams, and desires. So when it comes to carrying out the plan, which requires cooperation from both Marks as they move across floors, the innie is conflicted as he weighs whether or not he’s willing to essentially commit suicide, along with killing the rest of the innies, in order to save his outie’s wife and give them a happily ever after.</p><figure id="" data-id="8537ecb12b43aa29a4b629cceb0716e8" data-recommend-id="image://8537ecb12b43aa29a4b629cceb0716e8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1919" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ms. Casey and Mark S. face each other in an elevator." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ms. Casey and Mark S. face each other in an elevator." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Apple</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8537ecb12b43aa29a4b629cceb0716e8" data-recommend-id="image://8537ecb12b43aa29a4b629cceb0716e8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1919" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ms. Casey and Mark S. face each other in an elevator." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>All of this builds up to the final moment, in which Gemma has been successfully escorted outside of Lumon and all innie Mark has to do is leave with her and give control back to his outie. But then he hears Helly (Britt Lower) call his name. This is the woman he loves, the one whose name his outie couldn’t even be bothered to get right in their conversation. Why should he give up even a few more moments with her so his outie can have the life he wants? His decision made, Innie Mark goes to Helly and takes her by the hand, and together they run into the depths of the severed floor with no plan beyond fighting for every second they have left with each other. Meanwhile, Gemma cries out to her husband, seemingly unaware that he’s been severed, and begs him to join her on the other side. It is a brutal, tragic, and romantic declaration of the innies’ personhood, separate from their outside world selves.</p><p>It is a tough scenario, and it’s got <em>Severance </em>fans split down the middle. Did Mark S. do the right thing? It’s certainly not the most satisfying conclusion for those who wanted Mark and Gemma to live happily ever after, but it is the most thematically appropriate conclusion for a season focusing on innie autonomy and how outies view their workplace selves as second-class citizens.</p><p>Debating the morality of everyone involved is worthwhile, but what’s surprising is that discussing Mark’s decision has somehow boiled down to a shipping war, with some <em>Severance </em>fans putting on their Team Helly or Team Gemma t-shirts and pitting two women against each other. Friends, it feels like we’ve lost the plot once more. <em>Severance </em>has spent two seasons establishing that innies and outies are different people with separate identities, goals, and lived experiences. The Mark we see make this decision isn’t picking Helly over Gemma, he’s choosing himself over his outie. Gemma is collateral damage, but the Mark who exists inside Lumon isn’t her husband, and she is not his wife. Mark’s inner turmoil is illustrated by these two women on the opposite ends of an office hall, but he’s not literally deciding between them. That hasn’t stopped the debates from becoming ship war fodder, filled with fans who are missing the forest for the trees.</p><p>Yes, Gemma will likely have some more trauma to work through, having watched her long-lost husband walk away with another woman, but boiling down Mark’s decision to “picking one woman over the other” or “abandoning his wife” is both missing the point and shows that some viewers don’t see innies as individuals, but merely parts of someone else. The whole season finale shows innies declaring their autonomy over Lumon and their outies’ wishes. It’s not even subtext. Helly stands on a table and rallies a group of severed workers by saying that they’re only given half a life but it’s one worth fighting for. The notion that Mark is choosing Helly over Gemma is a frustrating reading both because it’s deeply unsympathetic to the plight of an oppressed class, and because it dilutes the season’s complex thesis into a petty love triangle.</p><p><em>Severance</em>’s season finale is not the satisfying conclusion some fans were likely hoping for, one that ended with Mark and Gemma reunited and his outie making a noble sacrifice to ensure it happened. But it was one consistent with everything <em>Severance</em> has ever said about how innies have only ever been tools in the eyes of their outies. You can only be treated as an afterthought by those who brought you into the world for so long before you fight back. And sometimes fighting back is choosing yourself, even for a few moments. That’s a much more interesting lens through which to debate the ending than one that erases all the nuance of the show just to pit two women against each other.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is Ubisoft’s second-biggest launch to date, just behind Assassin’s Creed Valhalla.</p>



<p>That’s according to Insider Gaming sources, who have provided data for the last three mainline Assassin’s Creed titles. The information was <a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1904177799419634137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted public on my ow</a><a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1904177799419634137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">n</a><a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1904177799419634137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> X</a> (formerly Twitter) account a few hours ago. </p>



<p>According to our sources, who have obtained the information via Ubisoft’s own tracking tools (and have provided such data on past titles), it shows that Assassin’s Creed Shadows is behind that of Valhalla, but ahead of Odyssey.</p>



<p>Last week, Ubisoft announced that Assassin’s Creed Shadows had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-surpasses-odyssey-and-origins-launch-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">past two million players just two days after launch</a> and one million players one day after launch.</p>



<p>According to the data, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla achieved 2.55 million players on its first day, whereas Odyssey achieved just shy of 1M (roughly 430,00 during early access).</p>



<p>At the time of writing (March 24), Shadows is tracking to hit three million players in the coming days. According to its trajectory, Shadows could hit roughly six million players within its first month, but its worth pointing out that the game has released in Q1, compared to other successful Assassin’s Creed games that release in the holiday season.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla did 8M in its first month, whereas Odyssey did 3.4 million. </p>



<p>At the time of writing, Odyssey currently has the most unique players of any Assassin’s Creed title sitting at over 40 million.</p>



<p>As always pointed out online, these are <strong>player numbers and not sales</strong>, but we should here more on the games performance from Ubisoft themselves in the coming months. </p>



<p>Have you played Assassin’s Creed Shadows? What do you think of the game so far? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <p>Paradox have announced that 4X space strategy game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellaris">Stellaris</a>'s next major overhaul will launch on 5th May, alongside the game's BioGenesis DLC pack.

<p>It doesn't sound nearly as exciting on the surface as living spaceships, I'll grant you, but this is a 4X game, don't forget - the mythological firebird is in the detail.</p><!--more-->

<p>Stellaris 4.0 was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/281990/view/577123891031310365">announced back in January</a>. Let's start by talking about the promised performance boosts, which are the result of copious rewiring of various empire systems.</p>
<p>"Stellaris has many moving parts, and an incredible number of calculations are performed every month," reads the announcement post. "Many of those calculations rely on others, forcing them to be performed sequentially rather than in parallel. This causes the game to slow down as the number of calculations increases throughout the game and is especially noticeable in large galaxies - more planets and empires means more pops filling more jobs, producing more resources, with more pathfinding for the fleets, and so on."</p>
<p>Paradox are trying to lessen the load of the pop and job systems by, essentially, grouping pops later in the game rather than handling them individually. Trade is another system "that has a disproportionately high impact on performance compared to the benefit" so they're "simplifying that one significantly and making Trade act as a standard resource." The devs are also looking to streamline how Fleets work, though this'll likely happen after the release of the 4.0 update.</p>
<p>As for the new player guidance and game pacing element, the Steam post continues that "much of the feedback we've received from newer players indicates that Stellaris has become overwhelming in the early stages of the game, providing a flood of decisions and a seemingly endless barrage of notifications." </p>
<p>They're addressing this by "reviewing events and notifications to ensure that any interruptions are meaningful" - that's to say, that they present you with a choice of some kind rather than being "purely informational". A number of events that are "purely informational", including Anomalies discovered by Science Ships, have been demoted to smaller "toast" notifications down the righthand side of the interface. Empire Leaders will also be less "needy", as they're planning to merge the first two tiers of leader traits and reduce the number of levels at which you're asked to pick traits.</p>
<p>The game's galaxy generation, meanwhile, will be tweaked to reduce the odds of encountering solar systems with pre-scripted elements that bump up the number of habitable worlds past the maximum you choose in the settings. There are, of course, a lot of these pre-scripted systems nowadays, because Stellaris has become a quintessentially Paradoxical cauldron of downloadable add-ons, free or paid.</p>
<p>Paradox are also trying to give the average game of Stellaris more backbone by means of "suggested tasks" that are filed under Conquest, Exploration, or Development categories. These reflect a player-chosen "focused aspiration" for your empire, and might involve building a Dyson sphere or, at the top level, becoming Galactic Custodian. Veteran players can probably ignore them, as "they're primarily intended to teach new players how to play like you and guarantee that you'll be able to force access to those important technologies." You'll be able to trace completed tasks and other endeavours on a new empire timeline, found within the situation log. </p>
<p>As for more general quality of life improvements, they've gone through the genetic modification process during species modification and assimilation "to remove many pain points and make the overall flow much smoother". Truly, a dystopian sentence.</p>
<p>They're also changing the "Colony" designation to a temporary modifier, and letting players pick a colony designation and "even" turn on automation when giving the colonization order, so that mid-to-late game players don't have to choose between using automation and losing the amenity and stability bonuses of the default designation. Oh, and they've given the ship designer screen a haircut as well.</p>
<p>Read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/281990/view/577123891031310365">Steam</a>. This is the tip of the iceberg, of course, with later posts adding many pounds of flesh to the details sketched out here. The eventual full changelog is going to be an abyssal monster indeed, or my name isn't Locutus of Borg.</p>
<p>I realise all this probably sounds quite dry to the new players the "phoenix update" is designed to woo. If you're among them, congrats on making it to the last paragraph of this article - that's a Dyson Sphere-sized accomplishment right there. Still, I'm always fascinated by attempts to trim and tighten the workings of games as unavoidably baggy and exhausting as this. It reminds me of Civilization 7's efforts to get around the problem of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/most-civilization-players-dont-finish-a-single-game-going-by-civ-6-data-and-perhaps-thats-the-best-way-to-play">most players not completing a single game</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-rebuilt-ground-up-technology-when-release-date/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Activision has revealed the evolution of Verdansk, which was first released in March 2020 as the first Call of Duty: Warzone map. It’s coming back in just a few days, and fans are excited… Mostly.</p>



<p>In a new video published online, Activision’s teams uncovered everything that went into creating Verdansk all over again, breaking down the technical upgrades made to make it feel like an all-new game while retaining the classic feel of Warzone. Of course, the game will use the new movement engine, so that won’t feel the same as it did five years ago.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-new-about-verdansk-2025">What’s New About Verdansk 2025?</h2>



<p>Verdansk has been rebuilt for 2025, five years after it first surfaced.</p>



<p>The team has upgraded the technology powering Verdansk in Warzone. It has better quality overall and better rendering, and things like grass, foliage, mud, and water are more accurate, realistic, and have better physics.</p>



<div><article><p><span>The map that started it all, rebuilt from the ground up 💥

Take a deep dive with </span><a href="https://twitter.com/BeenoxTeam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@BeenoxTeam</a><span> at this first look at Verdansk – returning April 3 🪂 </span></p></article></div>







<p>Lighting has had a boost as well, with the global lighting ambience undergoing several changes. The team has added a new high-resolution sky box, upgraded bounces, light-map quality, and better transitions between interiors and exteriors. Shadows, backlighting, and indoor lighting have all undergone substantial enhancements.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-studio-is-making-verdansk-2025">Which Studio Is Making Verdansk 2025?</h2>



<p>It was noted that Beenox, Raven, and High Moon Studios all worked collaboratively on Verdansk 2025, bringing together the ‘best technology available today’ to ensure the map is ‘better than ever’. At the same time, it was stressed that it remains ‘faithful’ to Infinity Ward’s 2020 creation which changed the face of the battle royale genre forever.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-verdansk-come-back-to-warzone">When Does Verdansk Come Back to Warzone?</h2>



<p>The Verdansk release date will arrive with Season 03 on April 3, 2025. It’s almost five years to the day since Warzone first launched, when COVID-19 was driving millions of people into their homes and onto Call of Duty.</p>



<p>It was a different world back then, and Warzone would come to make content creators overnight sensations and turn average gamers into battle royale beasts with the hottest meta weapons on the block. I have fond memories of Verdansk, but it helps that I had a great crew to play with and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-vibes-warzone/">the vibes were immense</a>.</p>



<p>All that’s left now is to kick off your Verdansk countdown and start deciding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-tac-map-reveal-pois/">where you’ll land</a> when the map comes back to Warzone on April 3.</p>

Weird how, in the moment of this fiction being realized, we’re instead using it to force people into poverty and destroy all art. But also, it turns out, online recipes.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Online recipes have long been <em>weird</em>. Anyone who’s looked up the best way to make fluffier pancakes or slow roast a brisket will know that instead of just being told how, you’re treated to the author’s entire life story for page after page of utterly pointless text, before eventually reaching an ingredients list just before you’ve scrolled to the core of the Earth. Now imagine that, but the recipe at the end is entirely fictional, the images of the food are imagined into existence by a plagiarism machine, and the method is entirely untested and deeply unlikely to work. Welcome to now!</p><figure id="" data-id="437858c6502ad2565f424876914149dc" data-recommend-id="image://437858c6502ad2565f424876914149dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A plate of sad-looking churros based on an AI recipe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A plate of sad-looking churros based on an AI recipe." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->How To Cook That / YouTube / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="437858c6502ad2565f424876914149dc" data-recommend-id="image://437858c6502ad2565f424876914149dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A plate of sad-looking churros based on an AI recipe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I always feel it’s important to distinguish what sort of AI we’re talking about when it comes to these rants because there’s the very real likelihood that “AI” could be bringing us massive breakthroughs in medicine, given its ability to manage vast amounts of information in ways humans, and even regular computation, cannot, and thus save millions of lives. This, however, is not the sort of “AI” techbros are currently losing their collective minds and wallets over. That’d be Large Language Models, which are fed all of human creativity and then spit out weird, gloopy slop. Whether it be ChatGPT and its incessant outpouring of drivel (if you know anyone who trusts it, get them to ask it to create an anagram), or image creating tools that can’t count to five, or the deeply unsettling sloppy videos in which no one’s face remains the same for more than a few seconds, LLMs are art-in-garbage-out machines, and they’re wrecking <em>everything</em>.</p><p>Including, as the wonderful YouTuber Ann Reardon points out in her latest video, recipes.</p><p>Reardon and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@HowToCookThat&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@HowToCookThat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">her channel How To Cook That</a></span> is best known for her debunking videos, in which she is alerted to dubious recipes posted to the internet and then attempts to recreate them in her kitchen. It’s always a joy, as she not only demonstrates how content farms and wannabe TikTok influencers alike just make up any old crap they feel like for clicks but also then shows you how to successfully create the same food! But wow is her job about to get harder with the current flooding of socials with AI-created recipes, where every element, from ingredients to method to images, is the delusion of an LLM.</p><p>As Reardon points out, alongside trying to make a couple of the recipes, this is not only a problem social media companies aren’t trying to address, but rather one being actively encouraged! Facebook is working on something called “inverse cooking,” where its AI will “create” a recipe based on a photograph, driving such utter rubbish on its own site.</p><p>It’s worth noting that while there will almost certainly be examples of AI-generated recipes that would create lethal meals, the vast majority of them will be <em>almost</em> right. That’s the magic of plagiarism, as the LLMs have been fed every single legitimate recipe on the internet, and will approximate an average of them all. Ask it how to make pancakes, and via taking everyone else’s efforts without paying for it, it is capable of blindly reproducing an approximated median method for making pancakes. But, given it’s not “intelligence” in any meaning of the word, it’s also not capable of checking for accuracy. Hence the “not quite right” results in Reardon’s video above.</p><p>The issues arise because we now have no means of knowing what’s a legitimate, tested recipe written by a human and what’s an android dream with faked, photorealistic images before pages and pages of machine-generated life story atop a predictive-text recipe. It’ll only be in the act of trying to follow it will we realize we’ve been duped.</p><p>And thus, online recipes—unless posted by a writer you’ve followed for a long time and can trust—are ruined. Googling for the best way to make a butter chicken curry could be gambling with food poisoning, and that might just be the Gemini result it insists on forcing on you before you can click on any of the links. Thank god for actual, physical recipe books, but what a blow for a more recent massive convenience, even if you did wear through the skin on your finger scrolling to find the actual recipe.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, it seems like we might be heading back to the Creek.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In its most recent update, Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Studios announced in-game that players had failed the most recent Major Order. The Automaton Incineration Corps, armed with powerful flame weaponry, made significant gains.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The enemy remains at large," the notification read.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/how-a-nephews-cd-burner-inspired-early-valve-to-embrace-drm/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Back in 2004, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/how-half-life-2-helped-sell-steam-to-a-skeptical-pc-gaming-market/">the launch of <em>Half-Life 2</em> would help launch Steam</a> on the path to eventually becoming the de facto digital rights management (DRM) system for the vast majority of PC games. But years before that, with the 1998 launch of the original <em>Half-Life</em>, Valve cofounder and then-CMO Monica Harrington said she was inspired to take DRM more seriously by her nephew's reaction to the purchase of a new CD-ROM burner.</p>
<p>PC Gamer <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/valves-drm-was-inspired-by-the-cmos-nephew-who-used-a-usd500-check-id-sent-him-for-school-expenses-and-bought-himself-a-cd-rom-replicator-he-sent-me-a-lovely-thank-you-note/">pulled that interesting tidbit</a> from <a href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/how-valve-became-valve-an-insiders-account/911257">a talk Harrington gave at last week's Game Developers Conference</a>. In her remembering, Harrington's nephew had used funds she had sent for school supplies on a CD replicator, then sent her "a lovely thank you note essentially saying how happy he was to copy and share games with his friends."</p>
<p>That was the moment Harrington said she realized this new technology was leading to a "generational shift" in both the availability and acceptability of PC game piracy. While game piracy and DRM definitely existed prior to CD burners (anyone else remember the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Tz0YpDa6o">large codewheels</a> that cluttered many early PC game boxes?), Harrington said the new technology—and the blasé attitude her nephew showed toward using it for piracy—could "put our entire business model at risk."</p>
<p>Shortly after <em>Half-Life</em> launched <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Half-Life">with a simple CD key verification system in place</a>, Harrington said the company noticed a wave of message board complaints about the game not working. But when Valve cofounder (and Monica's then-husband) Mike Harrington followed up with those complaining posters, he found that "none of them had actually bought the game. So it turned out that the authentication system was working really well," Harrington said.</p>

When I realized this, I started to think about the role soccer had played in my life and I decided to make a game to explore this idea. I had always played big triple A sports games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FIFA</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but the soccer you play there didn't represent the kind of soccer I actually grew up playing which took place in neighborhoods and parks—not in big stadiums in front of millions of people. I found that everything that happens around the sport is just as interesting as the sport itself, so we set out to make a game that focused on that.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What development tools were used to build your game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unity, Fmod, Scaniverse and Polycam for 3D scanning, Blender, Ableton, and Photoshop.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-making-assassin-s-creed-shadows-strengthened-ubisoft-s-process-for-bringing-history-to-life" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Assassin's Creed Shadows strengthened Ubisoft's process for bringing history to life</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into creating a world that would offer so much fun, secret stories, and mischief for an eight-year-old to get into?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game is set at a very particular time in the recent history of Ecuador. In 2001, the country had just gone through a big economic crisis and it was very easy for everyone to latch on to the national soccer team for hope since they were on the brink of qualifying to the world cup for the first time ever. This is one of my earliest memories, but it is very hazy and a lot of it is reconstructed from stories I've heard. So when designing the world, we decided to integrate many perspectives into this depiction by having friends and family improvise all the dialogue in the game. We came up with some basic scenarios and told people to pretend like they are 2001 so that they could bring whatever memories they had about it into the recording sessions. The results were always surprising and integrating them into the game became an interesting design challenge.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Not writing any of the dialogue allowed me to be a spectator of these moments, so it was very fun to pretend to be eight years old and come up with ways of being mischievous around them. For example, a couple having an anniversary picnic in the park was a lovely conversation from a real-life couple who brought stuff in from their actual relationship into the recording. Wouldn't it be great to be eight years old and use their orange juice as target practice? Maybe the fight that ensues after it splashes has a hint of their real relationship too.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/-it-s-okay-to-make-a-small-game-astro-bot-director-nicolas-doucet-says-tiny-ideas-contain-huge-potential" target="_self" data-discover="true">'It's okay to make a small game:' Astro Bot director Nicolas Doucet says tiny ideas contain huge potential</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kicking the soccer ball is pretty satisfying (and not just because you've booted it at someone). What thoughts went into making the soccer ball kicking/dribbling mechanics fun and appealing on their own? Into making them fun in a first-person perspective?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I remember some of the balls I played with as a kid and how deeply I got to know them. A beaten-up soccer ball has so many stories to tell; it is such a simple object, but it is so versatile. When thinking about how to depict this, our instinct was to try to make it feel very physical. We tried to avoid using magic forces to keep the ball in front of you and instead embrace the unexpected nature of it. The ball bounces around your feet; you never have full control of it, but you can sort of guide it to where you want. The first-person perspective allows the player to have a direct connection and ensure that the ball is always in the foreground. And when the ball is in the foreground, the background conversations and ambiences can slowly seep in.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>despelote</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> uses a striking mixture of stylized realistic visuals (drawn from photographs) and animated characters. What appealed to you about this visual mixture? How do these visuals work with your vision for this exploration of Ecuador in 2001?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sebastián had been playing with this kind of aesthetic for a few years before I approached him to be part of the game. I was very inspired by some of his </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyd7YLiWM1M">2D animations</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but he had never worked in 3D, so it was a challenge to bring his style into a first-person exploration game. However, when we started experimenting with the art, we quickly realized that the mix of black and white hand-drawn elements with a noisy background established a clear visual language that was intuitive for the player. We committed to this contrast and it gave us much liberty to play around with each style.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What drew you to work with photographs while creating the world? What effect did you feel this had on the game and how the player will experience its vision of Ecuador in this time period?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Similarly to how we wanted to "source" the dialogue from the real world by having friends and family improvise, we wanted to "source" the environment from the real world. The design of the map is not exactly an actual place in Quito, but we bring in assets from the real world to try to ground the game in a specific setting. It made a lot of sense to use photographs and 3D scans because the textures have so much personality built into them already, which gives the environment a very raw feeling.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Games have a tendency of trying to avoid depicting the real world, probably because it is technically just as difficult to create a fantasy world as it is a real-life city block. But we have so many ways of capturing the world nowadays, and I think games are the perfect vessel to combine them together.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>You also work with audio to give the player a real sense of place while exploring </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>despelote</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>. Why was it important to capture the sounds of the world alongside the photographic visuals?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think that the more specific a depiction of a place is, the more relatable it can be even for people who have never been to that place. This is especially true for audio, because certain sounds can trigger nostalgic feelings without us fully understanding it. I live in NYC now, but hearing specific birds chirping that Ian recorded brings me back to being a kid in Quito. This is why we really wanted the game to sound like Quito, and Ian did an incredible job recording and mixing it all together.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> studio ZA/UM continues development on its espionage follow-up C4, staff have described the friendly competition with rival projects from developers who have since left the studio in the wake of messy lawsuits.</p>
<p>Key team members from ZA/UM left in 2021 prior to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-lead-files-lawsuit-against-developer-zaum">multiple lawsuits filed against the studio</a>, which have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studio-says-lawsuits-from-former-members-have-been-resolved">since been resolved</a>. In the wake of this, a number of studios have been newly founded and are releasing projects all claiming to be spiritual successors to Disco Elysium - that includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-disco-elysium-alumni-join-former-staff-at-longdue-working-on-spiritual-successor">Longdue and its "psychogeographic RPG" Hopetown</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/detective-rpg-in-the-works-from-breakaway-group-of-former-disco-elysium-developers">XXX Nightshift from Dark Math Games</a>, a developer which describes itself as a "breakaway group from the original development team of Disco Elysium".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studio-zaums-new-rpg-c4-is-part-espionage-thriller-part-psychedelic-sci-fi">ZA/UM itself is working on C4</a>, as well as a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-is-being-reimagined-for-mobile-devices-to-captivate-the-tiktok-user">mobile adaptation of Disco Elysium</a> to "captivate the TikTok user". I had the chance to speak to lead producer Ruudu Ulas and principal writer Siim (Kosmos) Sinamäe at this year's Game Developers Conference (GDC).</p>

<p>"This, let's say, situation has really built the character of the team in a good way," said Sinamäe. "Each artist faces certain hardships in their artistic practice. This is what makes them better."</p>
<p>"But of course, I'm really excited to see what each one of the studios that has grown out of ZA/UM will show over the next months and years," added Ulas.</p>
<p>I asked the pair if there was friendly competition between the studios. "For us, always we think it's friendly competition," said Sinamäe. "We're going to really think about what the other writers are doing, or the studios... how can I be better at my own craft? We're competing essentially against ourselves in this way of can we take it further? Do we have to make any compromises? I think it absolutely sets us apart."</p>
<p>So what makes a ZA/UM game unique? For Ulas, it's the wide range of people with different skill sets that makes the team unique. "We have a lot of people who come from different walks of life, rather than just video games," she said. "I'm trained as a contemporary artist, there are people who come from a fashion background and traditional 2D art and so on.</p>
<p>"Working together is what sets us apart, I think, and also going through these difficult and challenging times as a studio and growing as a team throughout. When I wake up in the morning and log on to do my work, that's what motivates me."</p>
<p>In a presentation, the pair showed me the contrasting subjective and objective worlds of C4, each with their own art style and gameplay elements. The objective world, for instance, includes a greyed overlay as the player character checks his watch, while the subjective world is full of surreal art to convey the psychology of the player.</p>
<p>Indeed, with C4, the team is intending to explore the human mind and its complexities as the protagonist operant adopts multiple covers and struggles with his sense of self. Inside his thought cabinet, players will be able to reinforce or suppress thoughts, which will not only impact how the narrative plays out, but provide dissonances as it progresses - perhaps adopting a new cover will cause reinforced perceptions to change. Choices will be influenced not only by dice rolls but by three key limits: anxiety, deliriousness, and fatigue.</p>
<p>All of which is to say that C4 looks set to be another wildly intellectual video game from ZA/UM, with a gritty espionage tone far removed from the typical James Bond-esque fare. The remaining team at the studio seems capable of a worthy Disco Elysium follow-up, but whether it can stand above its peers remains to be seen.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Much to many people's surprise, Assassin's Creed Shadows is knocking it out of the park. While Monster Hunter Wilds was an incredibly big game, with it selling eight million copies in just a matter of days. On top of that, it reached 1.3 million concurrent players on Steam. However, Assassin's Creed Shadows is hot on the trails of Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows has already reached around<a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-reached-2-million-players-besting-origins-and-odyssey/"> two million players</a> and is continuing to increase. Compared to Monster Hunter Wilds, Assassin's Creed takes the lead in physical copies sold in the UK. At present, Shadows is the biggest physical launch of the year in the country, as noted by <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1903885728821674283" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameIndustry.biz's Christopher Dring</a>.</p>
<p>This feudal Japan title saw it reach over one million players on launch day, despite the ongoing <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-responds-to-damning-reports-of-abuse-by-assassins-creed-shadows-studio/">controversy</a> throughout the advertising period of the game. It was also delayed multiple times, but it seems that was for a good reason, as most audiences who have played the game seem to be happy with what they've gotten from it.</p>
<p>With Assassin's Creed Shadows reaching over two million players, it means that it has now bested the performance of Assassin's Creed Origins and Assassin's Creed Odyssey, two of the newer titles that performed incredibly well for Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Dring also mentions that it has sold more boxed copies in one week than <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> did in three months, which is a bit of a harsh statistic for Ubisoft. However, for most, it won't come as a surprise, as even Ubisoft has acknowledged that Star Wars Outlaws did not perform in the way they wanted. In some aspects, Assassin's Creed Shadows was their final hope to produce something in recent years that had the chance to be majorly successful, as Assassin's Creed Mirage didn't quite hit the mark for some players, either.</p>
<p>However, there are still plans for the<a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-is-reportedly-getting-its-first-dlc/"> first DLC</a> to be released for Assassin's Creed Mirage, with ongoing support and <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-gets-a-free-dlss-3-mod-thanks-to-lukefz/">mods</a> being released for the title.</p>
<p>While the game holds this very impressive information at the moment, it is likely that it will have it snatched from them by releases such as Call of Duty, Mario Kart 9, or Grand Theft Auto VI, should it be released this year.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about this game, you can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Francesco De Meo's review</a> of the title, where he gave it a generous score of 8.7, calling it a "gorgeous dive into feudal chaos."</p>

Mountainous town-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/laysara-summit-kingdom">Laysara: Summit Kingdom</a> has received a Sandbox update that, essentially, turns a game about settling the slopes of precisely <em>one</em> mountain into a lightweight trading empire simulator. Where the early access game's existing modes have you doing up one Bonsai Everest at a time, Sandbox lets you switch between several and export goods for other alpine mayors to buy. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It's a significant addition to an early access project that had our Nic Reuben in fits of ecstasy, smashing his Grinchy heart asunder to reveal the wholesome yak fanboi lurking within. "Possibly the prettiest city builder I've ever seen," he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/laysara-summit-kingdom-is-a-stunning-mountainous-city-builder-thats-out-now-in-early-access">declared</a> back at the game's early access launch, like a judge at a yak contest waving around a yak-hair bagful of yak-hair rosettes. Nic is away this week, so I am reasonably safe from repercussions over painting him as a smelly weirdo yak enthusiast. That said, I might ban him from the comments in advance, just to be safe.
</p>
<p>
I played a bit of Laysara: Summit Kingdom's demo last year myself, and yeah, it's good, though its fantasy world seems heavily informed by caricatures about Himalayan communities and Tibetan monasteries. Its town construction is shaped by elevation, with different kinds of vegetation and other resources and perils at higher altitudes. There's the omni-present risk of avalanches, but you can fortify your towns and plant forests to redirect the vengeful ice.</p>
<p>I never did a lot of it in the demo, but I do like this subliminal "avalanche sculpting sim" element. It makes me wonder if Polish developers Quite OK Games harbour any systemic aspirations of the "get lava computers working inside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a>" variety.

<p>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1823950/Laysara_Summit_Kingdom/">As detailed on Steam</a>, Sandbox Mode adds a World Map for switching between towns. You'll have a few unlocked to begin with, expanding your empire of peakvilles by raising temples on summits. Building temples also increases your research level across your entire empire. "Six new mountains!" the Steam changelog adds, like somebody forgetting the lyrics for The Twelve Days of Christmas. If they'd put that in a footnote I could have made a joke about foothills.
</p>
<p>
The changelog includes various smaller tweaks. They've added the option to construct ice altars during Free Build on certain maps, "a more detailed UI research panel, showing where does research comes from", and "more precise cursor detection when clicking on Advanced Yak Breeding". Got to be surgical, when match-making yaks.
</p>
<p>
The developers comment in the post that Sandbox Mode is about "expanding your kingdom in whatever way you see fit" with only "a few tiny story bits and a single global objective to provide a general sense of purpose". That said, it's also a taste of their plans for the game's forthcoming campaign, which will be "a more 'directed' sandbox experience with more detailed objectives (similar to what you've seen in the Scenarios)". The campaign will arrive with the game's 1.0 release later this year.

<p>Pocketpair will consider releasing Palworld for the Nintendo Switch 2 if the console is ‘beefy enough’.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-is-palworld-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">Is Palworld Coming to Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>



<p>Pocketpair communications director John ‘Bucky’ Buckley spoke about Palworld on the Nintendo Switch 2 during an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-says-nintendo-switch-2-version-100-worth-considering-if-the-console-is-beefy-enough" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> at GDC San Fransisco. Bucky first talked about the console’s specs, stating that he has been “walking around GDC”, hoping that someone will reveal Switch 2’s specs to him. However, everyone he has interacted with has said, “They haven’t even seen them”. He stated they couldn’t make the game for the original Switch as Palworld is “a beefy game”.</p>



<p>Bucky added that Palworld on Nintendo Switch 2 is “100% worth considering”, provided the console is “beefy enough.” The developers already have experience with handheld optimisations with their release on the Steam Deck and are “happy with how it turned out”, even though there’s still some work to do. Pocketpair would like to get Palworld “on more handhelds if possible.”</p>



<p>At the same time, Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit against Palworld continues, with recent updates stating that the former has received a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-anti-palworld-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new patent</a> that might help their case. Pocketpair recently spoke about the lawsuit, saying it “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-devs-were-shocked-by-nintendos-patent-infringement-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came as a shock</a>” for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Pocketpair publishing has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pocketpair-publishing-warn-not-more-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">warned players</a> not to expect ‘more Palworld’. Also, the game recently released its much-awaited <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworlds-cross-play-update-is-now-available-on-all-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cross-play update</a>. What are your thoughts on Palworld releasing for the Switch 2?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

New warm and cold mob variants, sounds, and flora are all set to appear in the game with the release date.</p><h3 id="Mob_variants">Mob variants</h3><p>Chickens, pigs, and cows now have more variants, and will spawn in specific areas. The three variants, Temperate, Cold, and Warm, have different colors and different biome specifications. The Temperate versions will spawn by default where Cold and Warm do not spawn. The Cold variants will spawn in, well, anywhere that's cold. That includes the Taiga, Windswept Hills, Snowy Plains, and even the Deep Dark and The End. The Warm variants spawn in the opposite, so places like the Savanna, Jungle, Badlands, Mangrove Swamps, and the Nether's biomes.</p><p>They're not the only mobs getting attention, as the Wolf gets six new sounds. Each wolf will receive a random sound variant when it spawns, and will stick with that for its existence. The existing wolf noises are used for the Classic variant, and Minecraft is adding Big, Cute, Puglin, Angry, Grumpy, and Sad.</p><h3 id="New_Minecraft_blocks">New Minecraft blocks</h3><p>As well as the attention to mobs, Minecraft's blocks are becoming more diverse. Bushes will generate in the Plains, Windswept Hills, River and Frozen River, and all Forest biomes. They are tinted by the grass color of the biome that they are placed or spawn in, and can be used in the composter. Using bone meal on a bush generates a neighboring bush if there is space. Harvesting bushes can be done using any tool with Silk Touch, or the shears.</p><p>The Cactus Flower is a new type of flower that has a chance of generating cacti. It can be placed on cactus blocks, or any block which has center support at the top. If a cactus is one or two blocks high, there is a 10% chance of a Cactus Flower growing on it, instead of the cactus getting taller. If the cactus is three or more blocks high, the growth chance increases to 25%, but they'll only grow if there is space on all sides. Any tool can mine it, and it can also be used to craft pink dye.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4464147-minecraft-next-update.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4464147" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4464147-minecraft-next-update.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4464147"></a><figcaption>Minecraft Firefly Bushes emit light and ambient sounds</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4464147-minecraft-next-update.jpg"></figure><p>The Firefly Bush is a long-awaited addition after Minecraft controversially removed Fireflies from the game following concerns that they were toxic to frogs in real life, and that by eating them in-game, it was a potential issue. The Firefly Bush is being added now, which will generate in swamps, near rivers, near water in Mangrove Swamps, and rarely in the Badlands. When it's dark, you'll spot glowing firefly particles up to five blocks from a Firefly Bush. It will play immersive, ambient sounds as long as it's not blocked from above and it's nighttime. Using bone meal on a Firefly bush will generate a neighboring one as long as there is space. It also emits a light level of 2, but will be instantly broken without any particular tool.</p><p>Leaf Litter is another block being added to Minecraft to improve the immersive nature of the game. It's a decorative block that can be found in forests and wooded badlands biomes. It works in a similar way to the petals blocks, and up to four can be placed on the same block, increasing the density of the Leaf Litter the more you place per block. Smelting any type of leaves block will create Leaf Litter, and it can also be used as fuel for smelting. It also comes with unique block sounds--we can't wait to trample through the leaves in Fall.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4464148-minecraft-next-update%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4464148" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4464148-minecraft-next-update%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4464148"></a><figcaption>Minecraft Leaf Litter is a new decorative block</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4464148-minecraft-next-update%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>Short Dry Grass is one block high and generates in the desert and badlands biomes. Tall Dry Grass is also one block high, but aesthetically taller. It can be placed on sand, terracotta, and dirt blocks similarly to the dead bush. You can collect Short or Tall Dry Grass using shears or any tool with Silk Touch. Using bone meal on Short Dry Grass turns it into Tall Dry Grass. Sheep can eat it to regrow their wool, too.</p><p>Wildflowers are a new type of flower exclusive to birch and old growth birch forests as well as meadows.

These change the way that trees can appear throughout the game. Now, you may find Oak, Spruce, Birch, or Jungle trees horizontally across the ground. The Birch version can be short or long, and all variants can be found anywhere in the game apart from the Meadow, Bamboo Jungle, River, Grove, or Flower Forest. Fallen trees can even be decorated with mushrooms or vines.</p><h3 id="Sounds">Sounds</h3><p>New sounds being added to the game include dead bush blocks playing ambient sounds when placed on top of two blocks that are any color terracotta, sand, or red sand blocks in any biome.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> won't include a minimap for its exploration, though a compass will be added to the explorable world map for release.</p>
<p>The game's producer, and developer Sandfall Interactive COO Francois Meurisse confirmed this to me at an Xbox event during this year's Game Developers Conference (GDC), following some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playing-clair-obscur-expedition-33-for-three-hours-has-confirmed-all-my-hopes-and-fears-about-this-gorgeous-new-action-rpg">criticism during previews that environments were hard to navigate</a>.</p>
<p>"There won't be mini maps in the levels," said Meurisse. "When there's a mini map, you can end up relying on it. And we want players to discover the world as the expedition does it. They don't have a map because every previous expedition failed. So yes, sometimes it can be difficult to find their way."</p>

<p>He continued: "What we added on the world map that wasn't in the preview demo is just a compass, so you can find north easily and get your direction more easily." There will also be an overview map of the entire game world.</p>
<p>Since the game's first reveal, much has been made of its JRPG influences from the likes of Final Fantasy and Persona, with its turn-based battle system and stylish menus. But what particularly struck me from the preview was the influence of FromSoftware, both from Dark Souls and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sekiro-tips-and-tricks-6009">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a>. There are obvious parallels: the sense of satisfaction from a successful parry as the camera zooms for a big slow-motion hit, as well as the weapon attribute scaling based on character stats. But it's also there in the aforementioned level design - it may be more linear, but it offers a similar sense of getting lost in an overwhelming, dangerous environment.</p>
<p>Meurisse explained the game is balanced between fairly linear, or semi-open levels with side path opportunities, which are accessed through the JRPG-style explorable world map. This is intended to tell a focused story. "The design approach has some links with FromSoftware games," he said, "where it's very linear levels but really intense ones. We don't have the mastery of ideas that they have, but it was part of the inspiration."</p>
<p>The Souls influence was definitely intentional, said Meurisse. What's more, the game's director, Guillaume Broche, is not just a big fan of FromSoftware but was also a Sekiro speedrunner. "I hope we'll have some good feedback and players from that community playing the game," said Meurisse. "I can't wait to have some players doing no damage runs, because technically it's achievable."</p>
<p>The game's turn-based battles are heavily-inspired by RPGs, but with action elements to allow players to parry and dodge enemy attacks. And rather than mana or skill points for character abilities, the system gives characters a certain number of action points to spend each turn. This was inspired by deck-building games, as Broche is also a huge Magic the Gathering player.</p>

<p>Beyond all these influences, though, the game has a distinctly and authentic French tone, from its costume design to the inclusion of French swear words in the script - after all, the Montpellier-based team is predominantly French. While the gameplay is clearly Japanese-inspired, the team didn't want to mimic manga or anime graphics, but instead find its own unique style. "When you tell a story or imagine a world, it's usually good to start with something you're familiar with," said Meurisse, which led to the Belle Epoque and Art Deco references.</p>
<p>"The will for searching for something more unique made it natural to link with the art references we knew the best, for being French," he added," but it wasn't a specific studio guideline to say 'we are French, we want to do something French'". Still, he's "happy and proud" of the French inspiration.</p>
<p>Unlike its 60-80 hour JRPG peers, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is smaller in scope, despite its epic feel. After all, it's being made by just 30 people. Broche had a strong vision for the game from the start, with decisions like no online mode and no open world ensuring that vision remained achievable. What's more, advancements in technology can allow indie studios to achieve outstanding results.</p>
<p>"New technology allows smaller teams to do big AA 3D hits, whereas five or 10 years ago, it wasn't really achievable," said Meurisse. He cites <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hellblade">Hellblade</a>, A Plague Tale and Mortal Shell as examples of smaller teams creating AAA-looking realistic games, but outside of these most indie studios previously had to use stylised or 2D graphics. "Now, thanks to new studios and new tools and great people, it makes a game like this very possible," he said.</p>
<p>And while the game is coming to Xbox Game Pass and was first revealed during an Xbox Partner Showcase, which Meurisse described as "the right opportunity to reach new players", he stated it's not considered an "exclusive partnership". "The most important thing for us is most people that would like to play the game, or would like to know about it, have the opportunity to play it," he said.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 will release across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on 24th April.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
