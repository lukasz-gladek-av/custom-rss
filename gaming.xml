<p>Donnie Yen has taken to an interview with Polygon to confirm that the Sleeping Dogs movie that was announced in 2017 is officially dead in the water. Sleeping Dogs was released in 2012 as a spiritual successor to the True Crime games, and it allowed players to explore an open-world rendition of Hong Kong.</p>



<p>The game was universally praised and highly enjoyable, scoring great reviews before being ultimately overshadowed by GTA 5 just one year later. In the recent interview, Donnie Yen, who was set to star as protagonist Wei Shen, confirmed that it’s ‘an unfortunate thing’ that the project has failed.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-sleeping-dogs-lie">Sleeping Dogs Lie</h2>



<p>In the interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/action/506279/sleeping-dogs-movie-donnie-yen-release-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, Donnie Yen explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I spent a lot of time and did a lot of work with these producers, and I even invested some of my own money into obtaining the drafts and some of the rights.</p>



<p>I waited for years. Years. And I really want to do it. I have all these visions in my head, and unfortunately… I don’t know, you know how Hollywood goes, right? I spent many, many years on it. It was an unfortunate thing.</p>



<p>Well, on to better things.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since being ‘announced’ in 2017, almost nothing was mentioned about the live-action adaptation of Sleeping Dogs. It comes as a surprise that it was canned, and it’s likely someone, somewhere is kicking themselves. Right now, live-action representations of video games are going like gangbusters, soaring up the charts and winning awards worldwide.</p>



<p>The likes of Fallout and The Last of Us are testaments to that fact.</p>



<p>When the news dropped that Donnie Yen would be serving as the frontman in Sleeping Dogs, fans everywhere were slightly confused. After all, Wei Shen was originally played by Will Yun Lee, who served as the voice, face, and motion capture artist for the character – and Lee is also a renowned actor.</p>



<p>Regardless of those creative decisions, the Sleeping Dogs movie will never see the light of day.</p>

As a result, PC gamers in over 100 countries won’t be able to buy the game on Steam because Sony does not operate PlayStation accounts in those markets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PSN is available in just 73 countries, leaving many out in the cold. The Baltics, including states that are part of the European Union (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania), and the vast majority of countries in Africa are also excluded. For years, some players in these countries have created a PSN in a supported region to get around the restrictions, but there are concerns that Sony could ban the accounts of those who do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony’s PC push has been controversial to say the least, with most of its games suffering negative Steam reviews as a result of the PSN requirement regardless of whether the games themselves are great or run well. In September, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnark-launches-to-mixed-steam-user-reviews-with-most-complaining-about-the-playstation-network-account-requirement"><u>God of War Ragnarök</u> met with a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam following its PC launch</a>, with most of the complaints revolving around the PSN requirement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-mod-removes-controversial-psn-requirement-and-its-creator-has-vowed-to-maintain-it">One disgruntled fan even created a <u>God of War Ragnarök</u> mod that removed the requirement</a>, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nexus-mods-says-creator-of-god-of-war-ragnarok-psn-bypass-mod-has-pulled-it-offline">it was pulled down out of fear of reprisal from Sony</a>. Exacerbating the backlash is that Sony has doubled down on this policy even for single-player games, such as God of War Ragnarök, Until Dawn, and now The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony’s PSN account requirement for its PC games was thrust into the limelight with the release of Arrowhead’s explosive PC and PS5 co-op shooter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a> earlier in 2024. Helldivers 2 suffered a review bomb campaign on Steam after Sony made PSN accounts mandatory for PC gamers on Valve’s platform (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-psn-review-bomb-cape-mia-as-arrowhead-awaits-clarity-on-game-being-sold-in-more-countries"><u>Arrowhead subsequently decided to turn the user review history graph into a cape, which is ready for launch but has yet to release</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-reverses-course-on-helldivers-2-psn-account-requirement"><u>Sony eventually backed down and reversed Helldivers 2’s PSN account requirement</u></a>, but the game remains unavailable in the many countries that lack PSN. And indeed all Sony’s games on PC now suffer from this problem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it announced the PSN requirement for Helldivers 2, Sony said it had to do with player security. “Account linking plays a critical role in protecting our players and upholding the values of safety and security provided on PlayStation and PlayStation Studios games,” Sony said in a statement issued at the time. “This is our main way to protect players from griefing and abuse by enabling the banning of players that engage in that type of behavior. It also allows those players that have been banned the right to appeal.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps bracing itself for a backlash it knew was to come, Sony added: “We understand that while this may be an inconvenience to some of you, this step will help us to continue to build a community that you are all proud to be a part of. “Many thanks for your continued support of Helldivers 2!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered likely faces a similar backlash on launch that Sony’s other PC games have seen, despite the Steam warning months in advance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-naval-combat-looks-even-better-than-skull-and-bones/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During yesterday's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viAEO_cMqfU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio Direct</a>, the Japanese developer shared a lot of new info on their next game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-new-trailer-shows-more-of-goro-majimas-new-pirate-adventure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a>, which is slated to launch next month. The 13-minute video demonstrated ground combat, but its highlight was certainly naval combat, which fans have commented looks even better than Ubisoft's naval-only title <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/skull-and-bones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skull and Bones</a>.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you agree or not, naval combat in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii certainly sounds quite deep. To begin with, players will get to fully customize the Goromaru pirate ship, including hull, armor, sails, and figurehead. The game also lets them hire their crew among a roster of over a hundred sailors, who have their own attributes and can subsequently be improved by deepening the crew's bonds through song, drink, adventure, and victory. They will then have to be optimally assigned to attack or defense operations.</p>
<p>Of course, a key component of naval combat is installing, upgrading, and firing cannons. This is where the IP's outlandish nature shines, offering options for energy cannons, laser cannons, and even 'shark cannons'. Of course, boarding is also available in the game, allowing the crews to come to blows in frenetic melee combat. Before the end of the video, the developers also confirmed that the New Game Plus mode will be added to the game for free after launch.</p>

<p>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is a spin-off set after the events narrated in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-end-of-yakuza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>. Series mainstay Goro Majima is the lead character. At the start of the story, he washes on Rich Island with no recollection of his previous life.</p>
<p>The game is scheduled to be released on February 21 for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <p>One or two lumps of annoyance in your morning coffee? Okay, here's one. You'll need to link to a PlayStation Network account to play The Last Of Us Part II on PC, say Sony. The requirement was reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-last-of-us-part-2-on-pc-will-require-a-psn-account/">Video Games Chronicle</a><a></a>, and sure enough, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2531310/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_Remastered/">Steam page</a> for the "Remastered" version of the third-person fungus fighter includes a footnote in the game description that confirms it in plain language - "Account for PlayStation Network required". For a lot of people this is a minor nuisance, for others it more likely means that the game won't be on sale in your country at all. Sony's reasons for enforcing the requirement remain obscure. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The requirement for a PSN account to play certain games on PC became controversial after Sony tried to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-pc-players-will-soon-need-to-link-their-steam-accounts-to-playstation-network">push the requirement</a> on players of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, who were so miffed they review-bombed the game on Steam. In that case, the decision <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">was overturned</a>. </p>
<p>Since then, Sony has applied the mandatory account linking in an irregular way. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut">Ghost Of Tsushima</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-of-tsushimas-psn-login-requirement-will-stop-you-playing-multiplayer-on-steam-deck">didn't require it</a>, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God Of War Ragnarock</a> did. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a> didn't make it mandatory, but tried to sweeten the deal by giving players bonus cosmetics for linking their Steam and PSN accounts. Now it looks like Sony are confident <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">The Last Of Us Part II Remastered</a> is big enough to cause only annoyed tuts when it comes to this requirement. </p>
<p>One of the biggest reasons this mandatory account smooshing annoys folks is that it means the game will not go on sale in certain countries where PSN doesn't operate for legal or business reasons. Insider Gaming have compiled <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/countries-that-dont-have-psn/">a list of countries</a> which don't have PSN. In Europe alone this list includes Baltic countries Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as well as Moldova, Georgia, Kosovo, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. If you live in any of these PSNless places, you basically can't play the affected game. This is despite the fact that many of these games are entirely single player. </p><p>As for the reasons behind it, well. Sony's chief financial officer Hiroki Totoki recently spoke about the requirement in an investor call, and said the account linking was done "so that anybody can enjoy the game safely" (<a href="https://www.vg247.com/sony-not-giving-up-on-its-psn-requirement-on-pc">as reported by VG247</a>). But this hardly explains it. The more likely reasoning comes down to digital rights management - they want players to be online so they can check if the game is a legal copy. And this has become such a dogmatic part of their legal and technical process that it now requires cutting off entire markets. It seems a stupid strategy to exclude entire countries of possible sales just to enforce a DRM policy, but corporations are cash-huffing monsters, and do not necessarily value the sales numbers - projected or real - in some nations. </p>
<p>All in all, another example of corporate interest making things worse for everyone, thanks to the arcane legalities and unseeable arithmetic of business. For more lumps of news, please keep reading our website. I promise some of the lumps are actually good. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-%E2%80%93-10-to-6.1078827/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-10-to-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s top ten time… kind of. We’ve got one final group of five, from ten down to six in our list, before we break things out and tackle the final bunch individually. But what games are going to be in this little group? Well, there’s a AAA selection here (if only through alliteration), and potentially a “quadruple-A” game that actually means it. But first, in at number 10…</p>
<h2>10 – Citizen Sleeper 2 Starward Vector</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, NSW, PC – 31st January 2025</em></p>
<p>Sequel to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/04/citizen-sleeper-episode-purge-review/">one of the most acclaimed indie games of 2022</a>, Citizen Sleeper 2 looks to take the same approach to its tabletop RPG narrative stylings, giving you a set of tools with which to navigate its rich narrative. There’s an overhauled dice system, new skills and, most significantly, a ship and a crew that you can customise for each Cycle as you take on jobs within the star system.</p>
<p><iframe title="Citizen Sleeper 2 - Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3DdETwG_eyo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Still set in the Helion system, Citizen Sleeper 2 lets you hop into your ship, recruit a crew of characters to go with you and head out to explore the Belt, do jobs and get paid. You’re trying to escape your past, in which you fell under the control of a local criminal gang, rewriting your body’s code to do so, but introducing malfunctions to your system and having to run with a price on your head and no memories.</p>

<h2>9 – Avowed</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC – 18th February 2025</em></p>
<p>Will you save the world or doom it? That’s the choice that runs through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/avowed">Avowed</a>, as you gain more and more power on your journey as an envoy of the Aedyr Empire, tasked with investigating a spiritual plague that threatens the whole world.</p>
<p><iframe title="Avowed Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AYvTNAaXMUA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Avowed takes us back to the Living Lands, a mysterious islands in the fantasy world of Eora, which it shares with Obsidian’s previous&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/08/29/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review/">Pillars of Eternity</a> games. However, where those games were both top-down CRPGs and part of the genre’s revival over the past decade, Avowed is shifting back to one of Obsidian’s areas of expertise: first person action RPG adventuring. Avowed is not a fully open world game, but has several large open areas that you can explore and, in that regard, it might be comparable to one of Obsidian’s other acclaimed hits, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/22/the-outer-worlds-review/">The Outer Worlds</a>.</p>
<p>Originally set for release at the end of 2024, Xbox decided to hold off on Avowed’s launch in a busy release window to try and find a little bit of breathing room in early 2025. That…. hasn’t necessarily worked out, but with more time to polish and the promise of a first party Xbox game, this is certainly one to watch.</p>
<h2>8 – Atomfall</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, XBO, PC – 27th March 2025</em></p>
<p>Oh sure, Chornobyl and Three Mile might the most infamous nuclear plant accidents in history, but we can do good old fashioned meltdown with the best of them in old Blighty. OK, so the Windscale Fire wasn’t a meltdown, but as it burned for several days, sprinkled nuclear material across the UK and to the continent, and was part of a government cover up, it’s pretty up there.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Atomfall - Release Date Trailer | Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, PS5 &amp; PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n_07x5LvQiA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But what were they covering up, <em>really</em>? <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/atomfall">Atomfall</a> spins us off into an alternate version of events where the surrounding area was rapidly locked down, the locals kept in line and monitored by the military group Protocol, and advanced retro-futuristic technology the order of the day. Can you unpick the mystery?</p>
<p>It might look like a very English Fallout, but this is a rather different style of game, where scarcity of resources plays a big factor in pushing you to melee – you get to fight roving bands of bandits dressed like Morris dancers – and investigating the story will be a bigger part of the experience.</p>
<h2>7 – Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/09/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-20th-march-2025/">20th March 2025</a></em></p>
<p>Fans have been demanding an Assassin’s Creed set in Japan pretty much since 2007, and they’re finally going to get what they want with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> – even if it’s been embroiled in a disappointingly inevitable amount of internet discourse, thanks in no small part to featuring a black immigrant samurai as one of the two playable characters. That’s something that Ubisoft has at times struggled to communicate well with fans and gamers around the world.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: World Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zKua34QXhMA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows takes us back to 16th century Japan during the Azuchi-Momoyama era, featuring a female ninja and a male samurai for its lead characters. That man is a historical character based off Yasuke, a man of African origin who was one of the rare immigrants to Japan and who served Oda Nobunaga. The female ninja is named Naoe from Iga Province, who is inducted into the local Assassin’s order to battle all those persky Templars. Their stories will be intertwined, letting you master complimentary playstyles as both characters have contrasting abilities – Naoe for stealth, Yasuke for direct combat. This will be a fresh take on the twin protagonists that we’ve seen on occasion through the Assassin’s Creed series.</p>
<h2>6 – GTA 6</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – Late 2025</em></p>
<p>It might almost seem sacrilegious for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">GTA 6</a> not to be topping our most wanted chart, and yet here we are. We’ve no doubt that, for the global gaming population, GTA 6 is set to be another defining cultural event, much like GTA 5 was back in 2013, but it’s not quite got our juices flowing the same way as the games that have made it into the top 5. Still, we’re as keen as anyone to see that second trailer…</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 1" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QdBZY2fkU-0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI takes us all back to Vice City for another crime story, featuring Lucia as the first female protagonist in the series, getting out of prison at the start of the game after a bit of “bad luck”.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/tencent-fights-against-its-designation-as-a-chinese-military-company-by-the-us-department-of-defense/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Chinese corporation Tencent has <a href="https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2025/01/07/ed277c23e9fe0fc870fb9f02350e7658.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it will fight its inclusion in the list of Chinese military companies <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-00070.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided by the US Department of Defense</a>. Earlier this week, the news caused a significant drop (around 10%) in the company's stock.</p>
<p>Tencent is seeking a negotiation with the US Department of Defense but may also initiate a lawsuit if it cannot reach an agreement. Here's the full official statement:</p>
<p><em>As the Company is neither a Chinese military company nor a military-civil fusion contributor to the Chinese defense industrial base, it believes that its inclusion in the CMC List is a mistake. Unlike other lists maintained by the U.S. Government for sanctions or export control measures, inclusion in the CMC List relates only to U.S. defense procurement, which does not affect the business of the Group.</em></p>
<p><em>The CMC List is also distinct from the Non-SDN Chinese Military-Industrial Complex List (NS-CMIC List) maintained by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, and inclusion in the CMC List will not prohibit any persons (other than the Department of Defense) from business dealings with the Company, including transacting in the securities of the Company.</em></p>
<p><em>The Company intends to initiate a Reconsideration Process to correct this mistake. During the process, it will engage in discussions with the U.S. Department of Defense to resolve any misunderstanding, and if necessary, will undertake legal proceedings to remove the Company from the CMC List.</em></p>
<p>Tencent offers various online products and services in China, like the messaging apps Tencent QQ and WeChat, though it is perhaps best known in the Western world for its gaming division. For a while now, it's been the largest gaming publisher in the world by revenue, well ahead of Sony and Microsoft, although the latter has reduced the gap following the acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</p>
<p>Tencent also invested heavily in game studios located outside China. It owns Riot Games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-offers-to-fully-acquire-funcom-scope-of-dune-survival-game-to-be-increased/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Funcom</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-the-division-devs-create-sharkmob/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sharkmob</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-to-buy-sumo-digital-for-919-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sumo Group</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-majority-grinding-gear-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grinding Gear Games</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-imminent-acquisition-leyou-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leyou</a> (owner of Athlon Games, Splash Damage, and Digital Extremes). It also holds majority stakes in <a href="https://wccftech.com/turtle-rock-studios-is-the-latest-studio-acquisition-made-by-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turtle Rock Studios</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-acquired-techland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Techland</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-becomes-a-majority-shareholder-at-rime-developer-tequila-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tequila Works</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dont-starve-mark-of-the-ninja-klei-entertainment-acquired-by-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Klei Entertainment</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-acquires-1c-entertainment-polish-group-to-be-rebranded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fulqrum Publishing</a> (previously known as 1C Entertainment), <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-acquires-wake-up-interactive-teases-new-multiplayer-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wake Up Interactive</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nightingale-inflexion-games-bought-tencent-spatialos-not-being-used/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inflexion Games</a>, 10 Chambers Collective, <a href="https://wccftech.com/yager-spec-ops-the-line-gets-strategic-minority-investment-by-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yager Development</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-purchased-36-percent-fatshark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fatshark</a>, Miniclip and Supercell, as well as minority stakes in Don't Nod, Shift Up, Epic Games, Bloober Team, Marvelous, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftware-gets-new-investments-by-sony-and-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FromSoftware</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-is-getting-a-e15-million-loan-from-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remedy</a>, Krafton, Kakao, Paradox Interactive, Frontier Developments, and Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Rumors about the potential acquisition of the latter company have <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-planning-ubisoft-buyout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intensified</a> lately. Just yesterday, Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20-while-ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-review-potential-company-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appointed</a> advisors to review potential sale options. A couple of years ago, Tencent reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-is-reportedly-shifting-its-ma-strategy-to-majority-deals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shifted</a> its M&amp;A (mergers and acquisitions) strategy to majority deals only.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-this-weeks-switch-2-leaks.1078821/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-this-weeks-switch-2-leaks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>There has been a flurry of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>-related news in recent days, but not from Nintendo itself. Now, the Mario maker has broken its silence on the week's reports.</p>
<p>During this week's CES trades show in Las Vegas, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-leaks-turn-into-deluge-as-dummy-units-shown-at-ces">reportedly-accurate models of Nintendo's under-wraps Switch 2 were shown off</a> by accessories manufacturer Genki. Several images and videos of this model were subsequently shared across social media (as you can see below). It is worth noting that Genki has since said <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/01/10/148376.html">its model was created based only on leaked information from the industry</a>, and it has not actually seen a Switch 2 console. </p>
<p>Nintendo has now issued a statement to Japanese newspaper <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20250110-XHI3U6QWZ5CZ7IFGTGUGJUVH4A/">The Sankei Shimbun</a>, telling the world that those images and videos making the rounds are "not official".</p>

</figure>
<p>Here's the very to the point, translated statement from the article: "The images and videos, they are not official."</p>
<p>While this statement is fairly innocuous in a lot of ways, and not exactly surprising given we already knew it was not Nintendo itself showcasing the hardware, this marks the first acknowledgement by the company that these leaks are even happening at all.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nintendo has not actually said anything about the accuracy of the third-party Switch 2 model which has been shown.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>In addition to that mock Switch 2 model, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fresh-switch-2-leaks-suggest-microsd-express-support-lack-of-switch-1-dock-compatibility">yesterday we had some further console leaks</a>. Purported retail listings for Switch 2 MicroSD Express cards started showing up. Meanwhile, another report suggested Nintendo's upcoming console won't be compatible with the Switch 1 dock. There were also some new murmurings over the Switch 2's optical sensor.</p><p>Nintendo will be sharing something official on its Switch successor soon enough, though. It previously confirmed we would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-switch-2-still-on-course-for-announcement-before-end-of-fiscal-year">receive a proper announcement before the close of the fiscal year</a>, which ends 31st March. What we do know for sure is that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">new console will be backwards compatible with Switch 1 games</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Bald headed assassin simulator Hitman: World of Assassination has amassed an impressive body count of 75 million players.
</p>
<p>
World of Assassination was originally launched in 2021 for PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S under the name of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-3">Hitman 3</a>, and was then retitled two years later when content from the trilogy's other games was added in. 
</p>
<p>
Today, developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> is celebrating the game's continued success. A million players logged on in December alone, the studio said, lured in by a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitmans-next-elusive-target-is-jean-claude-the-splitter-van-damme">fresh mission starring 90s action hero Jean-Claude Van Damme</a>.

<p>
Many of those players will likely be people sampling the game via its Free Starter Pack option, which also currently lets you take down Van Damme as one of the game's limited-time Elusive Targets. 
</p>
<p>
Amusingly, IO says that only 40 percent of players who attempted to take down Van Damme have been successful at doing so. (The developer tracked the longest successful attempt at seven hours, with the shortest just 21 seconds.)
</p>
<p>
Van Damme disappears from the game as an Elusive Target at the end of this weekend, on Sunday 12th January, but you can buy permanent access to a mission featuring the star in a £4 DLC mission pack.
</p>
<p>
Behind the scenes, IO says it is working on more content for Hitman to release later this year - though there's no details yet on what. 
</p>
<p>
IO is also working on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-says-james-bond-game-will-hopefully-be-the-start-of-a-trilogy">its under-wraps James Bond 007 game</a> and a mysterious fantasy game project. Additionally, the company is now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-studio-to-publish-former-rockstar-and-gta-producers-mysterious-blockbuster-mindseye">handling publishing duties for MindsEye</a>, the AAA game from former GTA producer Leslie Benzies.

            <p>The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sleeping-dogs">Sleeping Dogs</a> film adaptation, set to star Star Wars actor Donnie Yen, has been canned.</p>
<p>That's according to Yen himself, who confirmed the cancellation to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/action/506279/sleeping-dogs-movie-donnie-yen-release-update">Polygon</a>.</p>
<p>"I spent a lot of time and did a lot of work with these producers, and I even invested some of my own money into obtaining the drafts and some of the rights," he said. "I waited for years. Years. And I really want to do it. I have all these visions in my head, and unfortunately... I don't know, you know how Hollywood goes, right? I spent many, many years on it. It was an unfortunate thing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-donnie-yen-says-sleeping-dogs-movie-in-production">Yen confirmed the film was in development in February 2018</a>, but little has been heard since and no release date was given, so it's not particularly surprising to discover its cancellation.</p>
<p>Sleeping Dogs was a 2012-released open world game published by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, which was something of a GTA-style game set in Hong Kong but with martial arts combat and parkour.</p>
<p>Though received well by critics, it criminally remains a cult classic.</p>
<p>Still, a film starring and directed by Hong Kong filmmaker Yen would've been a natural fit. And the live-action reveal trailer above certainly hints at what we're missing.</p>
<p>Plenty of other film adaptations have been revealed recently. Sony confirmed earlier this week both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">Horizon Zero Dawn and Helldivers will be adapted to film</a>.</p>

<p>It has been confirmed that The Last of Us Part II Remastered, scheduled to be released on PC in April, will require a PSN account to function, despite having no online features. This follows the trend established by many PlayStation-centric games that found their way to PC platforms in the last year or so, but it doesn’t make it any less irritating for players.</p>



<p>This disruptive inclusion means that The Last of Us Part II on PC won’t launch in the several countries where the PlayStation Network doesn’t operate, which is one of the chief issues at play.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-backlash-continued">Backlash Continued</h2>



<p>Last year, a sudden change brought this requirement into the Helldivers 2 universe, with players being prompted to link a PSN account to continue playing the game. It caused a monumental downfall for the game, with tens of thousands of negative reviews being cast against the title.</p>



<p>That situation was rectified, but Sony would go on to make it a base requirement for further ports, such as God of War Ragnarok and Horizon: Forbidden West.</p>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-last-of-us-part-2-on-pc-will-require-a-psn-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a> discovered the requirement after wishlists went live. The Last of Us Part II Remastered will hit PC platforms – such as Steam and Epic Games Stores – on April 3. Instead of a Last of Us Part III, players are once again being forced to satisfy themselves with the iterations that have been re-released so many times over the years.</p>



<p>The game will arrive just as the second season of the popular HBO live-action adaption is set to drop. It was recently confirmed – along with a new trailer – that The Last of Us season two will hit screens worldwide in April. While a date wasn’t stressed, it’s expected to coincide with the PC release of The Last of Us Part II.</p>



<p>Tactics.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-sony-studio-la-jason-blundell/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-sony-studio-la-jason-blundell/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Recently, a job listing surfaced for a ‘Project Senior Producer’ in Los Angeles, working at a new PlayStation studio in Los Angeles. In the listing, it’s explained that the office is part of a ‘newly established AAA studio based in Los Angeles, driven by a team of seasoned industry leaders’.</p>



<p>It’s expected that this is Jason Blundell’s studio, the legendary developer who departed Deviation Games in September 2022. It was mentioned in December 2023 that Blundell was set to lead a PlayStation studio, and later rumours suggested that he would be partnering with Bungie to produce a new action game in a sci-fi universe.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-rumours-galore">Rumours Galore</h2>



<p>In the job listing discovered on the PlayStation site and shared by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-has-a-new-studio-in-los-angeles-working-on-a-new-ip.1078485/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">users on Restera</a>, it was written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are a newly established AAA studio based in Los Angeles, driven by a team of seasoned industry leaders and experienced game developers. </p>



<p>Our mission is to create the next groundbreaking AAA original IP while reimagining the development process with a lean and highly efficient approach.&nbsp;We’re&nbsp;seeking talented individuals who share our vision and are eager to join us on this journey.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/sonyinteractiveentertainmentglobal/jobs/5413216004" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The listing</a> is all business and doesn’t mention anything to identify the game, nor does it confirm the name of the studio or who is leading it, but the strongest possibility is that it’s Jason Blundell’s studio.</p>



<p>Blundell boasts a stunning career that saw him march through high-profile roles at Treyarch during Call of Duty’s peak. He was instrumental in the success and popularity of the franchise’s Zombies ecosystem, but in February 2020, he departed the company to found Deviation Games.</p>



<p>Deviation would later be shut down before it could ship a single game.</p>



<p>It was <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-linkedin-ex-deviation-games-employees-set-up-a-new-studio-with-sony-led-by-jason-blundel-new-ip.868227/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">rumoured a while ago</a> that former Deviation Games employees would be funnelled into a new Sony-backed studio with Jason Blundell at the helm, and this could be that claim brought to fruition.</p>



<p>What do you think about this? Do you have high hopes for Jason Blundell’s next project? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>It was just announced that HITMAN: World of Assassination has passed a unique threshold, securing 75 million players worldwide in just under a decade. In the words of IO Interactive, this has increased ‘its status as the most successful Hitman game of all time’. </p>



<p>In December 2024 alone, one million active players were recorded assuming control of Agent 47 and hunting down all manner of targets across a range of maps, missions, and modes. On December 12, Jean-Claude Van Damme was added to HITMAN: World of Assassination as a new and challenging elusive target.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-huge-numbers">Huge Numbers</h2>



<p>HITMAN: World of Assassination is a live-service title firmly rooted in the universe that debuted way back in 2000 with Hitman: Codename 47.</p>



<p>This decades-old franchise has maintained a solid following over the years, transitioning through the various gaming generations and touching everything from mobile to VR. It’s an industry staple and features an instantly recognisable protagonist and concept.</p>



<p>In a recent press release, IO Interactive explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Since its release, HITMAN World of Assassination has continued to introduce a vast array of live content, including new locations, contracts, seasonal events, and collaborations, expanding HITMAN’s narrative. </p>



<p>With 1 million active players in December 2024, HITMAN World of Assassination remains as popular as ever thanks to its constant additions and a dedicated community. With more content planned to come to HITMAN World of Assassination in 2025, players can continue to look forward to more and more hours of HITMAN to enjoy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The report explained just how challenging the most recent update was, which is an element that most Hitman fans appreciate. In their attempt to hunt down Jean-Claude Van Damme’s character, only 40% of players have been successful, and it took one player a whopping seven hours to complete the mission.</p>



<p>Have you managed to eliminate the latest elusive target? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>



<p>HITMAN: World of Assassination is available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve-fans-desperate-for-half-life-3-news-say-they-have-evidence-its-hidden-in-steams-back-end.1078770/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-fans-desperate-for-half-life-3-news-say-they-have-evidence-its-hidden-in-steams-back-end<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
As expectation grows of a new Half-Life game announcement, fans believe they can now see evidence of the project on Steam.
</p>
<p>
Firstly, let's address the obvious. Yes, the decades-long wait for Half-Life 3 has become something of a meme and all suggestion of its existence is to be treated with caution. That said, there's strong evidence that Valve is once again working on a major new Half-Life project of some kind, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-evidence-of-fully-fledged-half-life-game-revealed-by-valve-dataminer">a trustworthy report last summer detailing datamined assets and code snippets</a> backing up a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-3-may-have-been-announced-by-a-voice-actor-who-probably-has-never-heard-of-steam">leak from an actor</a> likely involved.
</p>
<p>
All signs point to something being afoot, and now Steam seems to show Valve has a second unreleased game lurking behind the scenes (as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-finally-admits-deadlock-exists">Deadlock</a>, which is still listed as an 'upcoming release' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-croaks-down-on-deadlock-cheaters-by-letting-you-turn-them-into-frogs">despite being in beta</a>). 
</p>
<p>
A thread on the Valve <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/valve/comments/1hw5kx6/i_could_be_onto_nothing_here_but_is_this_new">reddit</a> has highlighted the recent change that now lists two games from the developer as 'upcoming', with some sleuthing work by fans using the Wayback Machine pointing to this change occuring sometime within December 2024.
</p>
<p>
Searching for Valve on Steam and filtering via upcoming releases and then specifically games does indeed list two projects - with only Deadlock visible.
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
It's unlikely this project is In the Valley of the Gods - the next game from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/firewatch">Firewatch</a> developer Campo Santo that was put on indefinite hold. For starters, its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/687440/In_The_Valley_of_Gods/">Steam page</a> is publicly visible, and its developer and publisher are both listed as Campo Santo still rather than Valve.
</p>
<p>
A warning on the search page suggests that search results may exclude some products based on content or language preferences, but even with all filters disabled, Valve's second upcoming project does not appear. So, what gives?
</p>
<p>
This year will mark the fifth anniversary of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a>, Valve's most recent entry in its legendary shooter series that was designed specifically for VR. But Half-Life has certainly been on Valve's mind more recently than that. 
</p>
<p>In November, Valve made a big deal out of celebrating <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a>'s 20th anniversary, with a big update that added a director's commentary, a documentary, and packed in the game's two episodes of DLC. We even learned a bit more about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-2-just-got-a-special-20th-anniversary-update-with-a-new-documentary-commentary-and-more">why Valve never made Half-Life 2: Episode 3</a>, as well.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Aaron Callaway decided to beat the game without any weapons by relying only on emotes, including the Hadoken fireball popularized by Street Fighter's Ryu and Ken.</p><p>Callaway posted a video on YouTube that demonstrated how an emote-only Monster Hunter: World run works. He notes that the other two emotes used were Street Fighter's Shoryuken and Devil May Cry's guns. However, the Shoryuken drained too much stamina and the DmC emote wasn't ideal either. That's why Callaway came to rely on the Hadoken, even though it's also comparatively weak and can only dish out 13 points in damage at most.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFHmXH1YPig" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zFHmXH1YPig" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It's one thing to say you've done something and another to show it.

            <p>
It's probably not a huge surprise to hear at this point, but Sony has confirmed The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered will - like numerous other single-player PlayStation games before it - require a PSN account in order to play when it launches for PC this April.
</p>
<p>
Sony, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">faced a major backlash last May</a> when it announced it would be making PSN accounts mandatory for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> on PC - a move that meant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">players in the 177 countries where PSN is unavailable</a> would no longer be able to play the game they'd purchase. Ultimately, the outcry was significant enough that Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">relented</a>, but that hasn't stopped it from implementing PSN requirements for an increasing number of PC ports since then.
</p>
<p>
It's a decision that's continued to draw criticism given the requirement - which was originally justified as being necessary for the "safety and security" of online play - is now being implemented across both multiplayer and single-player games. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, for instance, <em>does</em> have a multiplayer component, despite being a predominantly single-player title, while other PC releases requiring PSN - such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Remastered, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a>, and Until Dawn - are purely single-player experiences.

<p>
And now The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered (as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-last-of-us-part-2-on-pc-will-require-a-psn-account/">spotted by VGC</a>) has joined the steadily expanding list of predominantly single-player PlayStation titles - online leaderboards <em>are</em> supported in its roguelike No Return mode - requiring a PSN log-in on PC.
</p><p>
For most, that requirement is probably little more than a somewhat irritating inconvenience. But for others - namely, those based in one of the aforementioned 117 regions where PSN is unavailable - it means The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered simply won't be purchasable on PC. And given Sony previously confirmed this month's PC port of the single-player <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> also requires a PSN account, it appears this is a path it's now determine to follow.
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered launches for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2531310/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_Remastered/">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">Epic Games Store</a> on 3rd April, the same month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-2-trailer-teases-two-of-the-games-most-impactful-scenes">season two of HBO's acclaimed The Last of Us television series begins airing</a>. Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-ps5-tech-analysis">called the remaster</a> - which includes the likes of increased texture resolution, increased level-of-detail distances, and improved shadow quality - the "best way to play a genuine classic" when it arrived on PlayStation 5 last year.

<h2 id="h-counter-strike-major-records">Counter-Strike Major Records</h2>



<p>The Astralis organization holds the record for the most Major wins as an organization with four. Notably though, the organization has struggled in recent years, and has failed to qualify for the past four Majors. Astralis has not reached the playoffs of a Major since winning StarLadder Berlin 2019.</p>



<p>Peter “dupreeh” Rasmussen has won the most Majors as an individual with five, having won four with Astralis and one with Vitality. Dupreeh is tied with Dan “apEX” Madesclaire and Finn “karrigan” Andersen in total Major appearances with 19. However, dupreeh has the sole distinction of having attended all 19 of the CS:GO Majors.</p>

                <p>Earlier this week, the ongoing saga of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-review/1900-6416758/" data-ref-id="1900-6416758">Destiny 2</a> reached a new turning point with the release of Revenant Act 3. But the conclusion of that chapter means that players are getting new weapons and other improvements going forward.</p><p>Bungie has shared <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid-01-09-25" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the details about Destiny 2's latest updates</a>, including a pair of legendary weapons. The first is called Red Tape, and it's a stasis scout rifle; while the second is a stasis rocket launcher named Heretic's Fervor. You can see both weapons in action in the new trailer below, as well as a glimpse of the new exotic mission, Kell's Fall.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pVboiodni8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-pVboiodni8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Completing Kell's Fall will give players access to yet another weapon: A powerful exotic shotgun called Slayer’s Fang. Players can also replay Kell's Fall to upgrade Slayer's Fang with up to four catalysts. Starting with the next episode debut, Heresy, on February 4, Destiny 2 will also increase the caps for Strange Coins to 199, while Osirian Ciphers and Nightfall Ciphers will be bumped from 10 to 30. Bungie has also invited players <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/fotl2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">to begin voting</a> for next fall's Festival of the Lost Armor. </p><p>Earlier this month, the original Destiny <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-destiny-game-gets-strange-update-for-new-years/1100-6528649/" data-ref-id="1100-6528649">got a holiday-themed update</a>, which surprised players since the focus has been on Destiny 2 for years. Late last year, players also discovered an exploit that gave them the Dawning Event Card Upgrade for free. Bungie <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/players-who-found-a-destiny-2-exploit-can-keep-their-free-loot-says-bungie/1100-6528364/" data-ref-id="1100-6528364">was pretty cool about that</a> and allowed players to keep the upgrade even though it ordinarily costs $10.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-first-expansion-claws-of-awaji/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows First Expansion ‘Claws of Awaji’ has been revealed to contain over 10 hours of additional content.</p>



<p>The new information comes courtesy of the Assassin’s Creed Shadows <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3159330/Assassins_Creed_Shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam page</a>, which was updated after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s recent delay</a>. </p>



<p>As a part of the update, the new description reads, “Pre-purchase now to get a bonus mission and the upcoming Claws of Awaji expansion. Travel to a new region, get over 10 hours of additional content, and unlock a new weapon type, new skills, gear, and abilities.”</p>



<p>In addition to the Claws of Awaji, Insider Gaming also exclusively reported in October 2024 that Ubisoft is planning to release a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-assassins-creed-shadows-co-op-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-op mode for Shadows</a> and is currently under the codename ‘League’.</p>



<p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/analysis-ubisoft-faces-its-most-challenging-year-in-its-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ANALYSIS: Ubisoft Faces Its Most Challenging Year in its History</a></strong></p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is now set to release on March 20, 2025, after an announcement from Marc-Alexis Côté said that the game needs a few additional weeks to implement changes based on feedback.</p>



<p>Speaking with sources, Côté’s statements reflect what is being handled internally, with staff saying that the delay is to ensure that the game is as polished as possible. </p>



<p>Last year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows had its first delay to February 14, 2025</a>, after it was announced that the game needed further polish, with sources behind the scenes also revealing that the team needed additional time to improve the authenticity of the game to its setting.</p>



<p>As for media previews, which were set to take place next week, those are still set to go ahead, but it’s unclear on when the embargo will be lifted.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to playing Assassin’s Creed Shadows? What do you think the future holds for Ubisoft as a company in 2025? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.&nbsp;</p>

Director Timo Tjahjanto was also approached to <a href="https://x.com/Timobros/status/1837930312476885040" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">direct</a>, giving this project a real pedigree for anyone who loves hardcore Asian action films.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, since about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/05/sleeping-dogs-movie-donnie-yen-confirms-its-still-in-production">2018 </a>almost any mention of this movie disappeared. And now <a href="https://www.polygon.com/action/506279/sleeping-dogs-movie-donnie-yen-release-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polygon </a>confirmed with Yen that this movie is no longer in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I spent a lot of time and did a lot of work with these producers, and I even invested some of my own money into obtaining the drafts and some of the rights," Yen tells Polygon. "I waited for years. years. And I really wanted to do it... And unfortunately... I don't know, you know how Hollywood goes, right?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yen calls it an "unfortunate thing," but says he's ready to move "on to better things."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sleeping Dogs was released back in 2012 and was developed by the now defunct United Front Games and published by Square Enix. The open world action game was effectively Grand Theft Auto in Hong Kong, with plenty of influences from Hong Kong crime cinema like Infernal Affairs and Hard Boiled. Starring undercover cop Wei Shen as he infiltrated the local Triad, Sleeping Dogs became something of a cult hit thanks to its mix of action, world design, and star-studded voice cast (including Emma Stone and Lucy Liu). The Definitive Edition received an 8.5 in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/08/sleeping-dogs-definitive-edition-review">review</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately a sequel and planned spinoff, Triad Wars, never entered into production before United Front shut down, and now the movie adaptation joins the dormant game series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Luckily for fans of Yen, he's been keeping himself quite busy both at home and abroad. Alongside the action movie The Prosecutor, Yen was last seen stateside as the blind assassin Caine in John Wick: Chapter 4, and according to <a href="https://collider.com/john-wick-spinoff-donnie-yen-directing-caine/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Collider</a>, is in talks to star and direct a<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/john-wick-spinoff-film-centered-on-donnie-yens-caine-officially-in-the-works"> Caine spinoff movie.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>It's the start of a new year, and if you're looking to ring it in with discounts on several games, then you can check out <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fdiamond-collection-build-your-own-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-control-ultimate-edition-on-pc-for-just-5-in-fanaticals-latest-bundle-deal%2F1100-6528716%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fanatical's January 2025 edition of its Diamond Collection bundle</a>. Like previous versions of this build-your-own-bundle deal, you'll choose from a list of games to build your very own bundle, and pricing depends on how many games you pick, with the price per code dropping the more you add. The bundle starts at three games for $15 ($5 per game), and scales up to five or more games for $23 ($4.60 per game), and at seven or games you'll only pay $4.50 per game. If you add all 16 possible games to your bundle, you'll only pay $72 total.</p><p>There are some great titles here like Control: Ultimate Edition. This paranormal-themed action adventure game melds third-person shooting with Metroidvania-style level design. It comes from Remedy, the same studio behind the Alan Wake series, which happens to share the same fictional universe with Control. In fact, some of the bonus content included in Control: Ultimate Edition ties into the recent Allan Wake II.</p><p>Another strong recommendation is Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night. The game is a spiritual successor to the 2D Castlevania games and is even directed by Koji Igarashi, who popularized the "Igavania" style of Castlevania games that started with Symphony of the Night. </p><p>Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 is also on offer and is a great choice if you're looking to scratch your itch for a Smash Bros-style fighting game. This one features plenty of iconic cartoon characters like SpongeBob SquarePants, Danny Phantom, and Jimmy Neutron, and the Ultimate Edition comes with a ton of extra content.</p><p>Plenty of other games are available in Fanatical's Diamond Collection for this month, including the open-world crime sandbox Saints Row: Gold Edition, the satirical alien planet exploration FPS Journey to the Savage Planet, multiplayer brawler TMNT Arcade: Wrath of the Mutants, and many more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-warhammer-40000-astra-militarum-army-box-features-death-korps-of-krieg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has revealed its latest <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a> Astra Militarum army box. However, this newest army box does not showcase the army's usual mascot, the Cadians. Instead, as part of the tenth edition, the Death Korps of Krieg has the spotlight.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/rlzyczbw/death-korps-of-krieg-whats-in-the-new-army-box/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop showcased the Death Korps of Krieg units in the upcoming <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Astra Militarum army box.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-astra-militarum-krieg-artillery.jpg?itok=cdbFS_u8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-astra-militarum-krieg-artillery.jpg?itok=GaH5dNq4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The post covers the new datasheets for the new Krieg units, their Command Squads, Heavy Weapons, and Troopers. The key focus on the post was on the named unit, Lord Marshal Dreir, and the new Artillery Units.</p>

<p>Lord Marshal Dreir maintains the Krieg's sci-fi trappings of German WWI frontline infantry. He charges into battle on a Krieg steed called ES819 with a sabre drawn. He is so attached to this horse it has been brought back from the brink of death several times.</p>

<p>Dreir shares this diehard nature. Dreir is Tough To Kill with six wounds, a 4+ save, and a 4+ Invulnerable Save. In addition, his Leading the Charge ability gives melee attacks Devastating Wounds.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-astra-militarum-lord-marshall-dreir.jpg?itok=Y3tlZI13 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-astra-militarum-lord-marshall-dreir.jpg?itok=qJu6FoO1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>These abilities pair well with his Death Rider bodyguards. Their Screening The Line ability allows them to reposition when a unit advances or falls back within 9 inches of them. When used effectively, this can set up devastating countercharges.</p>

<p>His men believe he is actually immortal, and given the grievous injuries he can shrug off and the units he has felled, can you blame them for that?</p>

<p>Of course the Death Korps of Krieg wouldn't be iconic if they didn't have artillery. The new <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Astra Militarum army box has that in spades. Each team mans four massive cannons. Siege Cannons lobs D6 Strength 12 Rend -2 shells, great for blasting enemy units and artillery. The Multiple Rocket Launcher fires D6+3 Anti-Infantry+3 explosives, perfect for shredding ground units.</p>

<p>The <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Astra Militarum Krieg army box will be available for pre-order this Saturday.</p>

            <p>
Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii - the swashbuckling new instalment in Sega's long-running crime saga - is getting a New Game Plus as part of a free post-launch update.
</p>
<p>
Sega shared the news during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viAEO_cMqfU">15-minute Like a Dragon Direct showcase</a> focusing on the imminent Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. It marks a notable shift in strategy for the publisher, after last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a> caused controversy among fans by making New Game Plus exclusive to its pricier Deluxe and Ultimate Editions.
</p>
<p>
Sega hasn't said much else about Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii's newly announced New Game Plus mode just yet, only that it'll arrives as part of a "post release patch" at some unspecified point following the game's launch on 21st February.

<p>
Elsewhere in today's Like a Dragon stream, developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio dove a little deeper into some of Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii's systems, offering a closer look at the likes of land and sea combat, ship customisation, crew building, side activities, and more.
</p><p>
Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii  - which charts the swashbuckling adventures of fan-favourite series regular Goro Majima after he wakes up with amnesia on the remote Rich Island - will be available for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on 21st February.
</p>
<p>
Alongside the £54.99 standard edition, Sega's releasing a £64.99 Deluxe Edition featuring the Legendary Pirate Crew Pack, Legendary Outfit Pack, Ship Customisation Pack, and Extra Karaoke &amp; CD Pack. There's also a physical Collector's Edition containing a selection of real-world gubbins, and all pre-orders receive the Ichiban Pirate Crew Set and Ichiban Special Outfit Set.

			<p>After choosing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2024-gaming-delivers-another-solid-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best games of 2024</a>, it's finally time to look forward. Most major fighting game franchises are not set to receive new entries in 2025, so it could very well be a bit of an off-year for the genre. Having said that, there are still some interesting releases in the schedule. Not only will beloved franchises from CAPCOM and SNK finally make their return, but Riot will also make its debut in the fighting game space with its League of Legends fighting game, which has the chance to shake up the fighting game scene considerably, especially if its free-to-play approach proves to be successful.</p>
<h2>FATAL FURY: City of the Wolves&nbsp;(April 21st - PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Fatal-Fury-City-of-the-Wolves-key-art.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Fatal Fury series is one that should need no introduction for real fighting game aficionados, having been, for quite a few years, one of the top 2D fighting game series besides Street Fighter. Despite its popularity, however, the series has been left dormant since the release of 1999's Garou: Mark of the Wolves, but the series' absence from the fighting games' main stage, however, is about to end with the release of FATAL FURY: City of the Wolves this year.</p>
<p>The new entry in the series, which will feature a total of 22 characters for its first season, including both familiar faces and newcomers, will evolve the series' mechanics further with the introduction of the REV system that will offer unique offensive and defensive options. Following in the footsteps of the latest entries in other franchises like the Street Fighter and Tekken series, FATAL FURY: City of the Wolves will also feature a simplified Smart Style control scheme that will let players perform special moves and combos using only single button presses and directional inputs. With the help of this new accessibility feature in place, there's no doubt that FATAL FURY: City of the Wolves will stand out as one of the most popular fighting games of 2025.</p>
<h2>2XKO (TBA 2025 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2XKO.png"></a></figure>

<p>Originally announced in 2019 as Project L, Riot Games' fighting game set in the League of Legends universe has the potential to revolutionize the fighting game scene. With a proven track record of creating compelling multiplayer experiences with lasting appeal, Riot now has the chance to demonstrate its expertise in a genre that has historically been challenging to master.</p>
<p>Even if we don't take Riot Games' multiplayer games expertise into account, 2XKO will have plenty to offer to fans of traditional 2D fighters. Developed by Radiant Entertainment, the studio founded by Tom and Tony Cannon, two respected figures in the fighting game community for having launched Evo and created the rollback netcode that powers the vast majority of modern fighting games' online features, there's little doubt that the strategic team play approach to the tag fighter formula made popular by the MARVEL vs. CAPCOM series, the simplified control scheme, the varied character roster which will feature some of the most popular League of Legends champions and the faithful recreation of their signature special moves will deliver one of the best fighting games of the year, if not of the entire generation.</p>
<h2>CAPCOM Fighting Collection 2 (2025 - PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Capcom-Fighting-Collection-2-Key-Art.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Last year, CAPCOM brought back the MARVEL vs CAPCOM series with a new collection, but the Japanese publisher is not yet done bringing back some of its most beloved franchises. This year will see the return of another series that has long been considered one of the benchmarks for 2D fighting games: the CAPCOM vs SNK franchise.</p>
<p>Besides including the two main entries in the franchise mentioned above, the CAPCOM Fighting Collection 2 will bring back other series that haven't seen a new entry in a very long time, such as the Power Stone and Rival Schools series. Rounding up this collection is the inclusion of Plasma Sword: Nightmare of Bilstein and CAPCOM Fighting Evolution, as well as rollback netcode support, which should breathe new life into these all-time classics. Hopefully, this won't be the last time we will hear and see more of them.</p>
<h2>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact (Summer 2025 - PC, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Hunter-x-Hunter-Nen-x-Impact-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Anyone who has had the pleasure of reading Hunter x Hunter or watching the anime knows how the series created by Toshihiro Nagoshi was ripe for a fighting game based on it. The wait has been long for such a game to be released, but it is finally almost over.</p>
<p>Despite not being part of CAPCOM's Versus series, Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact will feel familiar right from the get-go to fans of Tatsunoko vs. CAPCOM and Ultimate MARVEL vs. CAPCOM 3, as the game is being developed by the same studio, Eighting. The combination of mechanics lifted from these two games, such as assist attacks, Advancing Guard, the X-Factor-like temporary power-up called Overgear, and the character roster, which includes some if the most popular characters in the series, such as Gon, Killua, Kurapika, Leorio, Hisoka, Chrollo, Meruem, Kite and others, will make for an explosive fighting game that has the potential to appeal even to those who are not into Hunter x Hunter.</p>
<h2>BLEACH Rebirth of Souls (March 21 - PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Bleach-Rebirth-of-Souls-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Much like Dragon Ball, plenty of fighting games based on Tite Kubo's Bleach have been released on consoles in the past. None of them, however, managed to reach the high level of quality of games like Dragon Ball FighterZ and Dragon Ball Sparking! ZERO, but this is set to change this year with the release of BLEACH Rebirth of Souls.</p>
<p>The first proper game based on the series to hit PC promises to be an extremely faithful adaptation of the intense battles of the manga and anime show, as Ichigo, Rukia, and every other playable character will be able to decide the outcome of a battle with a single strike after building up enough power. With a combat system that will let players take advantage of 3D movement, take the fight into the air, and unleash all sorts of special techniques, BLEACH Rebirth of Souls shouldn't disappoint those eagerly anticipating a fighting game that can finally give justice to Tite Kubo's popular series.</p>
