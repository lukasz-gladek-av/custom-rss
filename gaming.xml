<figure data-uuid="0fe7749d0966c"><a title="RE Villains 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0fe7749d0966c/re-villains-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>Warning: this article contains scenes of explicit spoilers.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> launches on the Switch 2 in just under three months, but even now, the game is heavily shrouded in mystery (well, a little less so after the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/leon-kennedy-is-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem-via-psn-store-image">accidental reveal of Leon</a>).</p>
<p>Judging from the trailers so far, one of the biggest draws of this new title is the inclusion of Raccoon City, the primary location of the original trilogy, and a town now in ruins following a calculated nuclear explosion.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that Raccoon’s return is to partially evoke a sense of nostalgia with long-time fans, but there also needs to be a legitimate reason as to why the series is going back to its roots. What evil is lurking in the decimated ruins? What secrets can still be unearthed? And who is behind what will no doubt prove to be a deadly new viral threat?</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067gtlnox&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>That last question is going to be particularly crucial, as the series has, in my opinion, suffered from a severe villain problem since the death of Albert Wesker in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_5">Resident Evil 5</a>. Ever since Chris Redfield and Sheva Alomar fired two rockets at the slick-haired scoundrel while he was <strong>*checks notes*</strong> floundering in a pool of lava, it seems Capcom has struggled to settle on a new, enduring antagonist.</p>
<figure data-uuid="6f7c1a63d53ab"><a title="RE Villains 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6f7c1a63d53ab/re-villains-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Things got off to a rocky start with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_revelations">Revelations</a> in 2012, during which it was revealed that Morgan Lansdale was the architect behind the game’s events. Remember him? No, no one else does either.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_6">Resident Evil 6</a> launched the same year and featured dual antagonists: Derek C. Simmons and Carla Radames, the latter of which had mutated to become an exact replica of Ada Wong. While the game certainly dumped a healthy load of exposition on you to explain Simmons and Radames' roles, you’d be forgiven for thinking that their presence was a mere afterthought from Capcom. They added nothing of substance to the story, and Simmons in particular felt like the most generic evil-doer in the series’ history. A poor showing, indeed.</p>
<p>There was a glimmer of hope with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_revelations_2">Revelations 2</a>, which introduced Alex Wesker to the series. As the sister of Albert, Alex demonstrated a similar sense of mystique and menace, even if some of her lines were ripped straight from her sibling. Alas, it wasn’t to be, with Alex mutating into a grotesque monster and winding up on the receiving end of yet another rocket launcher. Like brother, like sister, I suppose.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil VII</a>, the Baker Family proved to be a solid set of villains that genuinely stoked fear in my heart as I roamed about their dilapidated estate. Yet as the story would eventually reveal, the Bakers were merely pawns acting under the influence of Eveline, a bioweapon presenting itself as a young girl who just wants a family to call her own. Cool, I guess?</p>
<figure data-uuid="043876a6c220b"><a title="RE Villains 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/043876a6c220b/re-villains-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yes, it’s an interesting hook, but it hardly leaves much room for development. And, much like previous titles, Eveline is dispatched at the end of the game, proving to be yet another disposable ‘monster of the week’ villain. I’m sensing a bit of a pattern here.</p>
<p>Finally, we have <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil Village</a>. Oh boy. This one introduced Mother Miranda as the primary antagonist, a cult leader who, in an effort to revive her lost daughter, infected the local populous with 'Mold' and — because Capcom simply <em>has</em> to tie everything back to Umbrella — supposedly mentored Oswell E. Spencer, the company’s founder.</p>
<p>Okay! That sounds pretty neat actually, right? Well, no, because RE Village put far too much focus on Miranda’s assistants: the Four Lords of the Village. Chief of these was Lady Dimitrescu, who gained so much popularity in the weeks and months leading up to release that Capcom focused almost all of its marketing efforts on her. Surely that means that she’ll take over as the overarching villain of the franchise, right? Again, no. She dies very early in the game. <em>Poof</em>, gone.</p>
<p>As for Miranda, she — like every major villain since RE5 — perished at the hands of the protagonist at the end of the game. Since then, Capcom seems to have finally recognised the value in having a compelling villain, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/jill-chris-would-be-more-befitting-resident-evils-obsession-with-lady-d-is-getting-fans-riled-up">going right back to Lady Dimitrescu</a> to market Requiem, a game that, as far as we know, has absolutely nothing to do with the events of Village.</p>
<figure data-uuid="a7775a75dc2d6"><a title="RE Villains 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a7775a75dc2d6/re-villains-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Something needs to change – we can’t just keep starting from fresh with every mainline entry. There’s a reason the original trilogy (and, by extension, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil_code_veronica_x">Code Veronica</a>) remains so popular. There's a clear through line with those games; a shadowy organisation at the heart of the narrative with Umbrella, and an incredible villain with Albert Wesker, who returned stronger than ever in Code Veronica after being presumed dead.</p>
<p>So, can we expect something similar with Requiem? Is Lady Dimitrescu actually dead? Or is there yet another member of the Wesker family waiting in the wings? The pre-release footage so far has focused quite heavily on what fans are referring to as 'The Hooded Man', and it seems clear that Capcom is keen to keep the real identity of this mysterious figure a complete secret for the time being.</p>
<p>Whatever the potential solution, Capcom needs to not only make us care about the events of Requiem, but keep us excited for the future of the series after the credits roll. If we get yet another disposable mastermind who bites the dust in the last act, I'm not sure how much longer I can stay invested.</p>

			<p>After two of the games included in December 2025's list of PS Plus Extra and Premium games <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-on-connait-les-tetes-daffiche-des-ajouts-de-decembre-2025-60803">joining the game catalog leaked early</a>, PlayStation has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/10/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-december-assassins-creed-mirage-wo-long-fallen-dynasty-skate-story-and-more/">now officially confirmed</a> all ten of the games coming to PlayStation Plus for subscribers at the Extra and Premium tiers.</p>



<p>There are three big headlining titles for the month, one of them being a day-one release that is actually already available for Extra and Premium subscribers. That game is, of course, Sam Eng's Skate Story, which puts you in the Vans of a demon made of glass and pain who must skate through Hell to try and eat the Moon. It's a fever dream of a story if there ever was one, and it's one of the more exciting indies to end off 2025.</p>



<p>The other two big headlining games are <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-mirage/">2023's Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-shadows-dont-die-twice/">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a>, which were also the two games that leaked courtesy of Dealabs. As for the rest of the games joining the catalog, other notable titles include <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/granblue-fantasy-relink-exceeding-expectations/">Granblue Fantasy: Relink</a>, Lego Horizon Adventures (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-five-games-december-2025-lego-horizon-adventures-neon-white/">which is also one of the PS Plus Essential games for the month</a>), and Planet Coaster 2.</p>

<p>PS Plus Premium subscribers only get one addition to the Classic's Game Catalog for the month of December, but at least it's a game that has no trouble standing out on its own, as Soulcaliber III is now available for Premium subscribers.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games coming to PS Plus Extra and Premium for December 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li>Assassin's Creed Mirage (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Skate Story (PS5)</li>



<li>Granblue Fantasy: ReLink (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Planet Coaster 2 (PS5)</li>



<li>Cat Quest III (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Lego Horizon Adventures (PS5)</li>



<li>Paw Patrol: Grand Prix (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Paw Patrol World (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Soulcaliber III (PS5, PS4) - <strong>PlayStation Premium subscribers only</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The other notable inclusion for what PS Plus subscribers are getting in December 2025 is a credit for the Sony Pictures Core store. The number of credits you receive will depend on which tier you are subscribed to, though PlayStation does not make it clear how many credits PS Plus Extra and Premium members get, or if PS Plus Essential subscribers get any credits at all.</p>



<p>The promotion also claims to only come as part of a purchase for a 12-month PS Plus subscription (any tier), though it doesn't clarify if this offer is available to those already subscribed to an annual plan. The promotion is active from December 11, 2025, to January 12, 2026, so perhaps more information will become clear once it's live. Hopefully, the offer is available to all subscribers, regardless of when they purchased their subscription.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC is out now, and one of the less publicized things the expansion adds is new Research Requests. These are mini-quests that, upon completion, raise your Research Level and unlock new rewards like attacks to teach your monsters and items to help you level up faster. At the final level, you’ll unlock the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-shiny-hunting-despawn-sound-effect-2000636142"><span>Shiny Charm</span></a><span>, which raises the rate at which alternate-colored critters show up in the overworld. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>made acquiring the Charm a notorious grind, and now </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>makes it much simpler, but this handy bit of rebalancing is locked behind the $30 paywall of the DLC’s asking price.</span></p> <p><span>To unlock the Shiny Charm, you have to reach Research Level 50. At a glance, this doesn’t seem that difficult, until you complete all but the last request and realize that you’ve come up short of reaching the final level. The remaining request you have is to complete 1000 battles. To put the scale of that accomplishment into perspective, I’ve put about 60 hours into </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>and have only hit around 570 battles. I’m not trying to get the Shiny Charm, so I haven’t been grinding to try and complete this request, but some folks have, and it’s a major time investment.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">It looks like if you have the DLC, you may not have to do 1000 battles <a href="https://t.co/3BxmF9dv7D">pic.twitter.com/3BxmF9dv7D</a></p> <p>— Austin John Plays (@AustinJohnPlays) <a href="https://twitter.com/AustinJohnPlays/status/1998623037290156227?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Now that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-x-y-gorochu-scrapped-2000652133"><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i></a> <span>is out, if you progress through the early bits of the story, you’ll unlock a wave of new Research Requests, allowing you to make your way to Level 50 with relative ease. That’s cool for anyone who hasn’t put a ton of effort into the grind. If you have already done it, though, you’re probably feeling some type of way. If you don’t want to do that grind and still want the Shiny Charm, you’re also probably angry that you have to pay a sizable chunk of change to get it more easily</span></p> <p><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>has had no shame when it comes to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-raichu-ranked-2000625708"><span>paygating some pretty major stuff</span></a><span>. </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>is one side of the problem; the other is that Mega Stones for popular Pokémon are rewards for online ranked battles, which require a subscription to access. I guess the silver lining on this particular one is that you don’t </span><i><span>have </span></i><span>to pay for this to get the Shiny Charm. Maybe boot up a show you’ve been wanting to consume as second-screen content as you grind, though.</span></p>

			<p>Today, AMD <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-redstone-official-200-games-supported-3x-performance-boost-available-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched its long awaited FSR Redstone update</a>, which includes FSR Upscaling (formerly known as FSR 4), FSR Frame Gen, FSR Ray Regeneration, and FSR Radiance Caching.</p>



<p>The first two are improved versions of previous technologies. The third one, Ray Regeneration, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-redstone-sees-an-unexpected-debut-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was actually already introduced by Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. Developed in partnership with Microsoft, Ray Regeneration is a machine learning-powered denoiser that focuses on restoring details to ray traced effects, which can be troublesome in upscaled scenes. It is, essentially, AMD's version of NVIDIA DLSS Ray Reconstruction.</p>



<p>However, FSR Radiance Caching is not yet available in any game. During today's presentation, AMD showcased a tech demo of the feature in Warhammer 40K Darktide, Fatshark's first-person online action game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fatshark-presents-darktide-new-hive-scum-class-confirms-no-pvp-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just got the new Hive Scum class DLC</a>. Viewers assumed this meant Darktide would also be the first game to implement FSR Radiance Caching, but in a press release, the Swedish developer clarified that  the tech is 'experimental' and therefore not currently planned for release in Darktide's live build, as it requires 'further development, optimization, and quality verification before it could be integrated into a live service game.'</p>



<p>That said, Fatshark was eager to jump at the opportunity to develop the tech demo when AMD approached them about it this past Summer. Their Chief Technology Officer, Mikael Hansson, said in a statement: </p>



<p><em>Technology is meant to be built and shared together. Working with innovative powerhouses like AMD keeps us sharp, encourages diversification in game technology, and strengthens the entire industry. It’s fun, it’s challenging, and it’s a long-term investment, not just in Fatshark’s future, but in the future of gaming.</em></p>



<p>In the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-redstone-sdk-unreal-engine-plugin-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newly released FSR Redstone SDK</a>, AMD describes FSR Radiance Caching as a 'state-of-the-art illumination cache designed to work in tandem with Monte Carlo path tracing to boost rendering performance. At its core is an online machine learning model that continuously trains on complex, multi-bounce global illumination (GI) on-device and in real-time. The result is richer, more immersive lighting environments that respond dynamically without the need for pre-computation or baking.'</p>



<p>It sounds fairly similar to NVIDIA's RTX Neural Radiance Cache, another technique that <a href="https://wccftech.com/neural-radiance-cache-technique-aims-to-make-path-tracing-faster-on-nvidia-gpus-thanks-to-tensor-cores-and-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aims to make path tracing faster with the help of machine learning</a> by inferring an infinite amount of bounces after the initial one or two bounces from path traced rays. RTX Neural Radiance Cache was released through the RTX Global Illumination SDK <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-kit-shows-how-neural-rendering-will-power-the-next-visual-leap-in-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at CES 2025</a>, though it is only available in Portal with RTX so far.</p>

              <p>Steam’s Next Fests, where developers share hundreds of demos, tend to get most of the focus allotted to playable pre-release morsels of various games each year, but it’s definitely worth noticing that Microsoft frequently does the same over on Xbox. <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/browse/Indie-Selects-Demo-Fest">The ID@Xbox Indie Selections Demo Fest</a> (catchy) has been running on and off for a few years, offering a few dozen trials across a limited time, often featuring some stunning games. The latest features 36 free demos to check out until the end of December, mostly for Xbox consoles, and has some bangers. But that’s a lot of games to sort through, so we’ve picked out nine of the most interesting you might want to check out.</p> <p>ID@Xbox’s continual promotion and support of indie games is very welcome, especially given how easily they can be lost on the Xbox Series’ clumsy store pages, usually only picked up by the casual shopper if they show up on Game Pass. So all power to efforts like this, giving a push to small teams in an overwhelming marketplace. You can browse the full selection over on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/09/xbox-indie-selects-demo-fest-starts-now/"><em>Xbox Wire</em></a>, or of course <del>you can look through them on your Xbox console</del>… No, extraordinarily, there’s no presence for the Fest on the console UI anywhere I can find, not even in the heavily buried “Demos” section. This seems like something of an oversight. Instead, to find any of the listed games, you need to search for them individually on the store, where their demos will then appear. Here are a few worth grabbing first:</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/cash-cleaner-simulator-piggy-bank-demo/9NBJR3JSR989">Cash Cleaner Simulator</a></h2>  <p>Just the title alone tells you everything you need to know about this demo. Yes, it’s absolutely a spoof of post-<em>PowerWash Simulator</em> cleaning games, and yes, it really is about laundering money. But even better, it conflates the two into a game about literally washing money in the name of crime. <em>Cash Cleaner Simulator</em> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2488370/Cash_Cleaner_Simulator/">came out on Steam</a> earlier this year, and has been met with a jubilant reaction.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/deck-of-haunts-demo/9NMVCHBBF1XF">Deck of Haunts</a></h2>  <p>Another game that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3179730/Deck_of_Haunts/">came out on Steam</a> earlier this year,&nbsp;<em>Deck of Haunts</em> combines deckbuilding roguelite gameplay with literally <em>being</em> a haunted house. It’s all about being truly dreadful, luring humans into your creepy rooms and then exploiting their fears to drain them of their essence! Despite proving popular on PC, it’s gone under-noticed by the press—hopefully an Xbox release will see that put right.</p>

 <hr>   <p>The second game from Canadian team Thousand Stars, <em>Aikyam</em> is a Bollywood-inspired third-person RPG, where characters Vishva, Ramli, and Guruji battle demonic attacks in a game about the rippling effects of kindness! There’s a whole Diwali-looking vibe to the art, and the combat is presented like bombastic Bollywood fight scenes, and seriously, how are you not already downloading this demo?</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/pathologic-3-demo/9N6RDKD38WL9">Pathologic 3</a></h2>  <p>Ice Pick Lodge’s&nbsp;<em>Pathologic</em> was one of the most extraordinary indie games ever made, with its dream-like delivery of a plague doctor simulator, translations so poor as to become genuinely poetic, and gameplay broken to the point of barely being held together all adding to the experience. Its sequel was similarly broken, but didn’t possess the same magic, but hopefully the series can rebound for this third entry. The trailers certainly suggest something utterly bemusing and hauntingly alluring.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/cassette-boy-demo/9P830VNBHM29">Cassette Boy</a></h2>  <p>I’m pleased to report that there is no sign of any shortage in fresh ideas when it comes to puzzle RPGs, and&nbsp;<em>Cassette Boy</em> looks to be further proof. This is a game in which anything you’re not looking at ceases to exist. Despite looking like a 2D game, it is in fact 3D in a way that’s somewhat reminiscent of <em>Fez</em>, but where rotating the isometric 2D world causes everything that becomes hidden to literally no longer be there. Still confused? Just play the demo!</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/knuckle-jet-demo/9PPC608C3CD0/0010">Knuckle Jet</a></h2>  <p>Side-scrolling platformer&nbsp;<em>Knuckle Jet</em> looks like a combination of old-school acrobatic jumping and punching, combined with a stunning stop-motion-esque aesthetic, and perhaps even a little bit of bullet-hell. I especially love that it describes itself as featuring “scientifically inaccurate flight action.” This is from Rain Games, who previously gave us the splendid&nbsp;<em>Teslagrad</em> series, so there’s good reason to be very hopeful.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/relooted-demo/9N1TC30FZTLT/0010">Relooted</a></h2>  <p>2018’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-semblance"><em>Semblence</em></a> was an inspired and ingenious puzzle platformer, but after its release developer Nyamakop went very quiet. Now they’re finally back,with <em>Relooted</em>, a game about repatriating African artifacts from Western museums. A group of thieves from a number of different African countries team up to commit cunning heists to recover items museums have hidden in their vaults. It looks like it’s lifted all the right ideas from <em>Gunpoint</em>, with a mixture of pre-planning and improvised escapes, with a bunch of parkour movement thrown in for good measure.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/limbot-demo/9NVQVM8KR1D9/0010">Limbot</a></h2>  <p>The reason <a href="https://kotaku.com/tesla-robot-optimus-kojima-od-boys-season-5-trailer-2000651373">modern robots are all so rubbish</a> is because everyone’s forgotten to make them out of cardboard boxes. Clearly that’s the only sensible medium from which to build, as proven by local co-op party game <em>Limbot</em>. Up to four players can take control of one limb each of this person wearing a robo-guy costume, and attempt to work together to control it as it stomps through a very easily broken cardboard world. You can have a go at this extreme silliness right away, which the makers boast is the “ultimate physics-based city stomping experience.”</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/worshippers-of-cthulhu-demo/9P9JLD62B12B/0010">Worshippers of Cthulhu</a></h2>  <p><em>Worshippers of Cthulhu&nbsp;</em>came out earlier this year on PC, and despite proving <em>very</em> popular with those who played it, went completely under the radar. So let’s hope this Lovecraftian colony sim has a second chance at success with its Xbox outing. It’s all about leading a cult hell-bent on raising Cthulhu and bringing about the cosmic obliteration of the current order, so y’know, normal Wednesday. Very much inspired by the <em>Anno</em> series, but with a somewhat more malevolent approach.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[World Of Warcraft Players Are Making Houses Fly And Blizzard Approves]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/wow-world-of-warcraft-player-homes-floating-trick-update-blizzard-2000652188</link>
            <guid>1378684</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/wow-world-of-warcraft-player-housing-homes-blizzard-mmo-1851697796">after two decades of waiting</a>, Blizzard finally added player housing to its popular MMORPG <em>World of Warcraft.</em> And pretty quickly after it was added, players figured out how to make houses float in the air. Instead of patching out this unintended feature, Blizzard is making it official, but with some warnings.</p> <p>On Wednesday, <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/housing-development-notes-updated-december-9/2207508/5"><em>World of Warcraft</em> community manager Randy Jordan aka Kaivax explained in a post</a> that shortly after <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-patch-11-2-7-official-patch-notes-379455"><em>WoW</em> update 11.2.7</a> went live on December 2, crafty players discovered unlisted hotkeys that allowed them to move their homes up into the air. <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/please-fix-the-floating-houses/2211847/117">The community is still debating whether this was a bug or not</a>, but regardless, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1pd603o/so_houses_can_float/">levitating homes</a> weren’t an intended feature. Still, Blizzard isn’t patching out the hotkeys and grounding player creativity. Instead, it’s making the feature official and adding UI elements to allow everyone to easily move their homes into the sky.</p>

 <p>Kaivax did include two warnings for those looking to live in the clouds: “The underside of houses isn’t modeled or textured. Players who lift their houses may decide to hide that part behind other things,” explained the community manager. And also, “If you lift your house up, clicking on the door could become difficult. You might want to consider building a ramp or a jumping puzzle, or a mount landing spot, etc.”</p>

 <p>It’s cool to see Blizzard recognize that people are having fun with floating houses–crafting all sorts of stuff like flying ships and magical hovering towers–and deciding to not only leave the feature in, but make it an official part of the game that anyone can use.</p> <p>And to help people decorate these flying homes more elaborately, Blizzard has also upped the number of items players can place on the exterior of their domicile from 200 to 250. These changes are now live in <em>World of Warcraft</em> following a scheduled bit of maintenance.</p> <h2><a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/housing-development-notes-updated-december-9/2207508/5#p-28364924-inside-out-2" name="p-28364924-inside-out-2"></a></h2>

<p>Things that make you go Vroom</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We reported a little while back on Switch 2 timed-exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/gear-club-unlimited-3">Gear.Club Unlimited 3</a>, and how it was delayed from an initial release date in 2025 to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/gear-club-unlimited-3-speeds-onto-switch-2-later-this-year">sometime in 2026</a>.</p>
<p>Now, Nacon and Eden Games have announced pre-orders for the delayed racer for Switch 2, with a release date of <strong>19th February</strong> next year. Hooray and/or VROOOOOM!</p>
<p>According to Nacon, "this new instalment promises a more immersive experience than ever before, powered by the new console and enhanced with two completely new regions."</p>
<div><p>It's also the first Japan-focused <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/gear_club_unlimited">Gear.Club</a>, with players invited to recruit the best local drivers, assemble teams and immerse themselves in the country's unique automotive culture. The Story mode, "will be punctuated by trips back and forth between France and Japan, highlighting the shared passion that unites car enthusiasts on both continents."</p><p>

This third entry also introduces a new Highway Mode, which promises "unprecedented thrills", like that one time this writer got on his bicycle and rode at speed with no trousers. Speaking of trousers, you'll need some, as Highway mode sees you challenged with perfecting furiously fast sections of urban raceway at speeds "over 300 km/h through the dense traffic of Japanese highways." (That's 186mph+, imperial folks.)</p><p>

The game is available in two flavours, standard and deluxe, with the latter giving three days early access, a “Performance Cars Pack” DLC, and there's also a “Career Starter Pack” and “Customization Pack” thrown in for this version. Pre-orders of either version will come with the Honda and BMW in the pic below:</p></div>
<figure data-uuid="c51139e9e5817"><a title="gear.club 3 pre-orders" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c51139e9e5817/gear-club-3-pre-orders.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: NACON</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here's a little more detail and some pics from the press kit for all you motorheads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>True to its DNA, Gear.Club Unlimited 3 retains the elements that made the series so successful:</strong></p>
<p>Prestige: a selection of legendary vehicles under official licenses;</p>
<p>Customization: players can customize and upgrade their vehicles to their liking to impose their style on the roads;</p>
<p>Adrenaline: more than 50 tracks in France and Japan, with a local split-screen multiplayer mode for 2 players. Players can compete in races, sprints, or duels, but also cooperate in highway mode for an even more intense shared experience!</p>
</blockquote>


<p>All that said, try as we might, we can't find pre-orders live beyond the Standard Edition pages retailers have had for some time. It's <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Gear-Club-Unlimited-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0G162MLJD?tag=nlife-21" rel="sponsored noopener">£44.99 on Amazon</a> at the moment, but there's no sign of the fancy-pants Deluxe version at the time of writing, nor word on the price, and nothing on the eShop. We'll update this when we find out more.</p>

<p><em>Looking forward to Gear.Club Unlimited 3? Let us know!</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-loses-14-billion-in-value-as-memory-shortage-fears-rise/</link>
            <guid>1378660</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Across the board, the tech industry is currently still rattled by issues surrounding memory chip shortages. Companies like <a href="https://wccftech.com/memory-shortages-are-so-terrible-that-samsung-is-shifting-hbm-production-towards-ddr5/">Samsung are making major shifts in their production lines,</a> and other companies like <a href="https://wccftech.com/framework-announces-laptop-memory-upgrade-price-hike-but-insists-it-wont-overcharge-customers/">Framework have opted to directly tell consumers that prices will rise due to shortages</a>. Now, a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-10/nintendo-sheds-14-billion-value-after-chip-squeeze-fears-grow">Bloomberg</a> points to Nintendo losing $14 billion in share value as fears around memory shortages continue to rise.</p>



<p>Nintendo's shares have declined on almost every trading day in December so far, dropping to their lowest level since May 2025. According to the report (via <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/">TrendForce</a>), Nintendo now has to spend <strong>41% more</strong> on the 12GB RAM chips it uses to make Nintendo Switch 2 consoles. NAND storage prices also rose by <strong>8%</strong>, and with the drop in share value, the question quickly turns to 'when,' not 'if,' Nintendo will raise prices on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>And of course, it's not just the rising price of the console that's a concern. Pelham Smithers of Pelham Smithers Associates told Bloomberg that Nintendo has already passed on the rising costs of memory chips to consumers through the cost of express microSD cards. "<em>The rise of NAND prices is starting to really impact express SD card prices. A 256GB express SD card costs $89.99 on Amazon. This is effectively a cost that Nintendo has passed on to the gamer</em>," said Smithers.</p>



<p>Of course, you don't need to buy an express microSD card for your Switch 2; you can try to make do with the console's built-in storage, but with the increasing number of developers turning to Game Key Card versions of their games for Switch 2 and the current landscape of digital games increasing in the amount of storage they consume, even the Switch 2's increased amount of internal storage compared to the original Switch doesn't go as far as it could for most players. </p>



<p>It's also worth noting that <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-players-trouble-finding-microsd-express-cards-microsd-shortages/">MicroSD Express Cards are simply getting more difficult to find</a> as these shortages continue, so while Smithers isn't wrong in pointing to the increase in their price as a total increase to the cost of buying a Switch 2, it may not factor in for some buyers simply because they can't find a MicroSD Express card to overpay on.</p>



<p>Smithers also claims that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-friday-2025-nintendo-switch-2-deals-save-on-console-accessories-and-games/">recent Black Friday sales for Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundles</a> were one of the seasonal sales "<em>surprises</em>," claiming, "<em>You wouldn't expect it [Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle] to be discounted this close to the holiday season</em>."</p>



<p>Sure, the Switch 2 was one of the best-selling consoles this Black Friday (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-battlefield-6-black-friday-eu-sales/">even though, at least in the EU, PS5 still claimed the top spot</a>), but there's concern it can keep up with its popularity, Black Friday discount or not, with its current stock and how much more expensive every single Switch 2 unit is to manufacture now.</p>



<p>Even with Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa doing his best <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-remain-stable/">to reassure shareholders and consumers that the cost of the console will "<em>remain stable</em>" for the immediate future</a>, last month, that could quickly change in the new year, after the holiday season winds down.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
All these massive, multi-billion dollar acquisitions are getting a bit scary, aren't they? The one on everyone's minds at the moment is of course Netflix's proposed takeover of movie studio giant Warner Bros, offering up a cool $82.7 billion in exchange. This, of course, has an indescribably massive potential to ruin mainstream cinema, but we won't get into that right this second, because there's another concern: how much the streamer does not seem to care about the games side of Warner Bros.
</p>
<p>
When asked about Warner Bros' games arm in a recent Netflix <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4851311-netflix-inc-nflx-presents-at-ubs-global-media-and-communications-conference-2025-transcript">investors call</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/netflix-didnt-attribute-any-value-to-warner-bros-games-business-in-83bn-mega-deal/">Pocket Gamer</a>), and whether the Warner Bros "assets enhance or accelerate the success in the gaming side," co-CEO Gregory Peters said that it does, with a caveat. "While they definitely have been doing some great work in the game space, we actually didn't attribute any value to that from the get-go because they're relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things," Peters explained.
</p>
<p>
"Now we're super excited because some of those properties that they've built, Hogwarts is a great example of that, have done quite well, and we think that we can incorporate that into what we're offering. They've got great studios and great folks working there. So we think that there's definitely an opportunity there. But just to be clear, we haven't built that into our deal model."
</p>
<p>
Warner Bros haven't exactly been doing great broadly speaking with games in recent times. Earlier this year they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-bros-close-monolith-creators-of-fear-condemned-shadow-of-mordor-and-wonder-woman">outright closed Monolith</a>, developer of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fear">F.E.A.R.</a> and Shadow of Mordor, cancelling the studio's Wonder Woman game in the process. Plus there were the flops that were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-failed-for-all-the-reasons-you-could-have-guess-it-failed-report-says">Suicide Squad</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-and-dc-smash-em-up-multiversus-joins-the-pile-of-dead-live-service-games">MultiVersus</a>.
</p><p>
Netflix haven't exactly smashed it on the games side either, having recently sold Spirit Crossing studio Spry Fox <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-sells-game-studio-spry-fox">back to its owners</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-has-laid-off-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">laying staff off at Oxenfree developer Night School Studio earlier this year</a>. And there's been no obvious breakout hits that aren't based on previously existing series.
</p>
<p>
This leaves a lot of room for concern over how Netflix may handle all of these new properties. Will it be the games companies Warner Bros own that get hit with the inevitable layoffs that come from massive acquisitions? Will these developers be forced into making <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stranger-things">Stranger Things</a> and Squid Game adaptations, and whatever show trends next, ad infinitum?
</p>
<p>
These questions won't be answered for years yet, let's not forget how long Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard took, not to mention the anti-trust process it went through. Perhaps we should cross our fingers for the individual developers involved, come what may.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Would PS VR2 have sold better if the games looked and played more like PlayStation 2 classics? Will John Romero’s next game also get suddenly canceled? And can a <em>Cyberpunk</em> trading card game bring back those awesome <em>Netrunner</em> vibes? It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint,&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. It’s Game Awards Eve and I’m celebrating by remembering the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-rA5LzFc9I">special kind of hell</a> that was Joel McHale co-hosting the 2013 VGX.</p> <h2><em>The Boys</em> is getting a VR game that looks like a PS2 game</h2> <p><em>The Boys</em> is coming to Meta Quest just in time for season 5. The licensed tie-in is called <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/the-boys/5661258417332116/?srsltid=AfmBOoo8okddGts-VWwafdidPQDXpRHiKIOe81sLpIEKTA65ljxAbGVV"><em>The Boys: Trigger Warning</em></a>, drops in spring 2026 for $24, and features Butcher and Mother’s Milk “guiding from the shadows” as game protagonist Lucas Costa “sets off on a no-mercy hunt” to kill “a washed-up but still lethal family of Vought Superheroes.”</p>

 <p>As <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-boys-trigger-warning-vr-game-ps2-graphics/"><em>The Gamer</em> notes</a>, it somehow looks like something that would have come out in 2003. Despite weird, lifeless depictions of Karl Urban and Laz Alonso, the VR spin-off by Arvore Immersive Games, which is inexplicably published by Sony Pictures Virtual Reality, promises “brutal boss fights” and “partial nudity.”</p>

 <h2>Minecraft has a big new content drop</h2>  <p><a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/mounts-of-mayhem-official-release-date"><em>Mounts of Mayhem</em></a> arrived December 9 and added new creatures for players to ride and a new weapon. Spears are finally in the game, too. They bring a new lunge capability to mounts. Fans are already fantasizing about recreating the<span dir="auto" role="text"> “Charge of the Rohirrim” in <em>Minecraft</em>.</span></p>  <p>The developer was speaking at Salón del Videojuego de Madrid (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-cancelled-shooter-has-been-saved-with-fresh-redesign-inspired-by-elden-ring"><em>Eurogamer</em></a>) when he confirmed that Romero Games is working on a new project that “incorporates a lot of the elements” from a game that was cancelled earlier this year when Microsoft <a href="https://kotaku.com/romero-games-xbox-layoffs-shut-down-canceled-game-1851785765">suddenly pulled funding</a>. “We’re not starting at ground zero,” he said. “We can take pieces out of and put into a brand new indie game. We have a lot of stuff we can put in the game. The design is completely different, but the team is very excited about the new design.”</p>

 <h2>Switch Online is getting two more N64 adventures</h2>  <p><em>Rayman 2: The Great Escape</em> and <em>Tonic Trouble</em> are getting added to the Expansion Pack on December 17. It’s the first time the Ubisoft classics will be available on a modern console, which may help get fans primed for the eventual new<em> Rayman</em> game Ubisoft is reportedly working on.</p>

 <h2>Microsoft is reportedly working on getting legacy Xbox games running on PC gaming handhelds</h2> <p>That’s according to industry leaker NateTheHate. “There exists a hope to make legacy Xbox (OG and Xbox 360) games [backwards compatible] on ROG and Windows. Whether they succeed is the unknown; but there is an effort being made,” he wrote on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/jason-ronald-on-25th-anniversary-we-want-to-celebrate-the-legacy-of-xbox-as-well-as-define-the-future-of-where-the-xbox-ecosystem-is-going.1376665/#post-148633819">gaming forum ResetEra</a>. “The other unknown would be how extensive will the initiative be in offerings. Will it be what we currently have on Series or will BC expand to add more titles across the Xbox ecosystem.”</p>

 <h2><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> is getting turned into a trading card game</h2>  <p>The<em> Cyberpunk TCG</em> is a collaboration between CD Projekt Red and TCG newcomers WeirdCo. Characters like Johnny and Panam will make the cut for the starting set, as will<em> Edgerunners</em> characters like Lucy. It’s still not entirely clear what the mechanics of the game will be, but it looks like it will revolve around cybernetic enhancements, as you’d expect. The game will be crowdfunded through Kickstarter.</p> <h2>Warner Bros. is reportedly sticking with the Netflix deal</h2> <p>Despite Paramount’s 11th-hour bid of over $100 million, which included financing from Saudi Arabia and Jared Kushner, <a href="https://x.com/Lucas_Shaw/status/1998550897232880032"><em>Bloomberg</em>‘s Lucas Shaw</a> says Warner Bros. Discovery isn’t interested. The company is expected to stick with Netflix’s bid after the streaming platform shored up support among its board. Maybe it’ll bring back <em>Succession</em> for a bonus season to celebrate.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-theft-card-store-phantasmal-flames-2000651666"><em>Pokémon</em> card thieves went on a $100,000 burglary spree</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-3-game-awards-statue-theory-2000651769">The Game Awards hell statue is probably for a new Larian Studios RPG</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-review-switch-sakurai-2000651657"><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> isn’t shy about being a Switch 2 sugar rush: our review</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-lenovo-15-laptop-with-good-everyday-specs-drops-75-off-but-only-on-amazon-not-official-site-2000652164</link>
            <guid>1378636</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Basic computing needs haven’t changed much over the years, and most people don’t need gaming rigs to handle their daily digital lives. Email, web browsing, video streaming, and video calls represent the bulk of what typical users do with their laptops, and the <strong>Lenovo V15 G2</strong> handles these tasks without breaking a sweat or your budget.</p>
<p>This 15.6-inch machine packs enough power (8GB DDR4 RAM, 256GB PCIe SSD, WiFi 6) for anyone who needs a reliable Windows 11 laptop for everyday productivity and entertainment. The good news is that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6337/">Amazon has just slashed the price to a record low of $299, down from the typical $1,199 asking price</a>, while Lenovo’s official website maintains full pricing without similar discounts available.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6337/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Real-World Computing Performance</h2>
<p>The <strong>Intel Celeron N4500 dual-core processor</strong> runs at base speeds that can go up to 2.8GHz when applications need more processing power and it is enough power for most people’s everyday computing tasks. This chip won’t beat high-end processors in benchmarks, but it starts Chrome quickly, can handle a lot of browser tabs without slowing down too much, and runs Microsoft Office apps smoothly. The built-in Intel UHD Graphics handle video encoding without any stuttering or lag that would interrupt conversations, so video calls through Zoom or Teams work well.</p>



<p>The 8GB DDR4 RAM gives you enough room to comfortably multitask with normal application loads: You can keep your email open while you work on a word processor, a spreadsheet, and several browser tabs without having to close applications all the time to keep performance up. This 8GB setup leaves enough free memory for your actual work, but power users who often work with dozens of tabs or apps that use a lot of memory may eventually run into problems.</p>
<p>A <strong>PCIe SSD gives you 256GB of storage space and fast boot times and instant application launches</strong> that make modern computers feel responsive: You can keep a good number of documents, photos, and media files on your computer, but people with a lot of videos or games will need to be more careful about how they use their storage or buy external drives. The PCIe interface makes it possible to quickly back up files or move large folders instead of taking a long time and the lack of moving parts means that the device will run quietly and be more durable when it is moved.</p>
<p>The <strong>Full HD display is 15.6 inches wide and has a resolution of 1920×1080</strong> which makes text easy to read without straining your eyes and gives you enough space to work comfortably. Anti-glare coating cuts down on reflections from windows and overhead lights, so you can see clearly no matter what kind of lighting you have at home, at work, or at a coffee shop. The laptop’s thin bezels around the screen give it a modern look while making the most of the display area. The Dolby Audio speakers make the sound clearer than the cheap laptops’ tinny sound which makes the laptop more fun to use for streaming shows, listening to music, or video calls where you need to hear everyone clearly.</p>
<p>The 720p webcam has a <strong>physical privacy shutter that blocks the camera lens</strong> when you’re not using it which solves security issues without needing tape or third-party covers that leave residue. The video quality is good enough for casual video calls and meetings, but content creators who want high-quality streaming will need to use external cameras. What’s more, WiFi 6 support gives you faster wireless speeds and better performance in busy network areas than older WiFi 5 standards.</p>
<p>There are a lot of ways to connect<strong>, including USB-A ports for older devices, USB-C ports for newer accessories</strong> and data transfer, HDMI output for external monitors or presentations, and an Ethernet jack for when wired networking is more reliable than WiFi. The keyboard has a full-size numeric keypad that is useful for anyone who works with spreadsheets or enters data. The layout of the keyboard follows standard spacing, so there is no need to get used to it.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Home comes with a familiar interface for Windows users: It gives you access to the Microsoft Store, built-in productivity apps, and works with the huge library of Windows software. This hardware runs the operating system smoothly, without the lag that comes with underpowered machines. It stays responsive during normal daily use.</p>
<p>When entry-level Windows laptops from big-box stores often cost more and have similar or worse parts, spending $299 on a laptop with these specs is a great deal. Lenovo usually charges $1,199 for Celeron-based hardware, which seems high. However, even when compared to realistic market rates, this 75% discount gives you a complete, working laptop for a price that is only slightly higher than a basic Chromebook.</p>

                <p>At the end of October, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-accused-of-firing-grand-theft-auto-devs-over-union-organization/1100-6535862/" data-ref-id="1100-6535862">Rockstar fired over 30 employees</a> at Rockstar North in the United Kingdom and contended that they were let go over "gross misconduct." The Grand Theft Auto developer has since been accused of union busting, since many of the fired devs were either members of the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain or organizing for it. Now, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Keir Starmer, and a member of Parliament, are keeping up the pressure on Rockstar.</p><p>"It's a deeply concerning case," said Starmer. "Every worker has the right to join a trade union and we're determined to strengthen workers rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union. Our ministers will look into the particular case the member raises and will keep him updated."</p><p>The case was brought up by Edinburgh East and Musselburgh MP, Chris Murray, who met with Rockstar on behalf of the workers. Murray noted that Rockstar initially refused to meet with him unless an NDA was signed, but the company relented following his refusal. Murray also stated that he was unconvinced by Rockstar's account of the firings.</p><p>"Rockstar fired 31 employees without providing evidence or union representation," said Murray. "The IWGB alleges union busting. Having met Rockstar, they failed to reassure me they are following law and I share concerns about union busting ... The meeting only entrenched my concerns about the process Rockstar used to dismiss so many of their staff members. I was not assured their process paid robust attention to UK employment law, I was not convinced that this course of action was necessary, and alarmingly, I did not leave informed on exactly what these 31 people had done to warrant their immediate dismissal."</p><p>A subsequent report suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-emerge-about-fired-rockstar-devs-and-the-messages-they-shared/1100-6536482/" data-ref-id="1100-6536482">Rockstar fired the devs over messages on Discord</a> about the company's revised internal Slack policies. Over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/over-200-rockstar-devs-sign-letter-demanding-fired-staff-be-reinstated/1100-6536181/" data-ref-id="1100-6536181">200 Rockstar employees have demanded</a> that the fired devs be reinstated, and there have been multiple protests at Rockstar offices in support of the workers. For now, the issue remains unresolved. </p>

                <p>An absolute classic is one of two Nintendo 64 games set to join the Nintendo Classics library this month. Rayman 2: The Great Escape and Tonic Trouble, both from Ubisoft, will be available to play for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers starting December 17.</p><p>Rayman 2 was originally released in 1999 for Nintendo 64 and PC, with ports on Dreamcast, PlayStation, and other platforms following in subsequent years. It was the first 3D outing for Ubisoft's mascot and received acclaim from critics, rivaling Crash Bandicoot, Banjo-Kazooie, and even Super Mario 64.</p><p>Tonic Trouble is also an Ubisoft original, though decidedly with a lesser reputation compared to Rayman 2. Designed by Rayman creator Michel Ancel, the action-adventure game depicts a mutated Earth with a ton of colorful and quirky character designs.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAVh2BgUkxA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uAVh2BgUkxA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/rayman-2-the-great-escape-review/1900-2545068/" data-ref-id="1900-2545068">Rayman 2: The Great Escape review</a> from 2000 rewarded the title a 9.3 score, citing its "wonderfully humorous story, excellent game mechanics, and perfection in almost all other categories." Meanwhile, Tonic Trouble <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tonic-trouble-review/1900-2543716/" data-ref-id="1900-2543716">received a 3/10 review</a> from GameSpot in 1999, with the reviewer lamenting that it will be remembered as "the game that's not Rayman 2."</p><p>If these Ubisoft additions aren't doing it for you, at least the addition of Rayman 2 bodes well for a couple of first-party Nintendo games making it onto the service. Back in July, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/internet-sleuths-think-super-smash-bros-donkey-kong-64-and-more-are-headed-to-nintendo-switch-online/1100-6532987/" data-ref-id="1100-6532987">online sleuths looked at blurry cover-art images</a> from a Nintendo video and deduced that five then-unannounced additions to Nintendo Classics were coming to the service.</p><p>Two of those five titles, one being Rayman 2 and the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/classic-sci-fi-shooter-forsaken-64-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online/1100-6534439/" data-ref-id="1100-6534439"> other being Forsaken 64</a>, have made it to Nintendo Switch Online since then, with the remaining games being Glover, Donkey Kong 64, and the original Super Smash Bros. The latter two have been glaring omissions, so Rayman 2's NSO debut should give hope to those waiting for some certified bangers on the service.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-horizon-adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> is the brickified and much more family friendly reimagining of Aloy's first outing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>. "It's a decidedly joyless kind of game, the sort that's better to look at than actually play with, and one that does little to bridge the gap between its two main subjects," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-horizon-adventures-review">Eurogamer's Lego Horizon Adventures review</a>.</p><p>We were more enthusiastic about Assassin's Creed Mirage. "I have frequently looked at Assassin's games as historical adventures with a bit of wonky sci-fi glamour, and Mirage's late-game certainly conforms to the formula in this regard. But what Mirage, and Mirage's Baghdad in particular, have reminded me is that the historical stuff is where the real care is found," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-mirage-review">Eurogamer's four star Assassin's Creed Mirage review</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skate-story">Skate Story</a>, meanwhile, we awarded five stars, with reviewer Alexis Ong showering the surreal demonic skateboarding sim in praise. "Can't sleep? Moon too bright? Want to eat it? It's a simple goal for a demon in the underworld, as you'll find in this gorgeous, extraordinary narrative adventure that just so happens to require skateboarding," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skate-story-review">Eurogamer's review</a>.</p>

		<p>ININ Games has announced R-Type Dimensions III with the studio aiming to release the game in May 2026. The side scrolling shooter will feature completely rebuilt assets of R-Type III: The Third Lightning with players able to choose between 2D and 3D views of the action. ININ Games has also announced a Special Edition and Collectors Edition of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="R-Type Dimensions III Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bXOKxxPsUvs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The main features of R-Type Dimensions III includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fully remastered experience with completely reconstructed assets</li>
<li>Local co-op, enhanced with new scoring and survival mechanics</li>
<li>Advanced mode accessible from the start</li>
<li>Customizable controls and quality-of-life features in the settings</li>
<li>3D Camera settings (normal and crazy)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to get the Special Edition it will set you back approximately £54, and that will net you the game, a special edition box, the original soundtrack and an artbook. There is also the R-Type III Dimensions Collector’s Edition, which is priced at a much higher price of nearly £180. That features an exclusive case cover and manual, the artbook, a two disc soundtrack, posters, stickers, bosscards, replica boxes, and 15cm resin statue of Dobkeratops facing off against the R-90. Oh, you will also get a numbered certificate of authenticity.</p>

<p>R-Type Dimensions III is going to be released for PC, PS5, Switch, and Switch 2.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ring-battery-video-doorbell-priced-like-basic-doorbell-amazon-plays-zero-profit-on-own-brand-2000652158</link>
            <guid>1378597</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Ring belongs to Amazon, which gives the retail giant complete freedom to price these video doorbells however aggressively it wants without worrying about profit margins on individual units. Amazon’s strategy focuses on getting Ring devices installed in as many homes as possible and knows that subscription revenue and ecosystem lock-in will pay off long-term even if the hardware sells at cost or below.</p>
<p>The newest<strong> battery doorbell model delivers head-to-toe video coverage with 66% more vertical view</strong> than the previous generation, and captures packages on the ground and tall visitors’ faces in a single frame. This<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/"> latest version currently sells for $49 on Amazon instead of the usual $99</a>&nbsp;which marks a record low price that makes smart doorbell technology accessible to practically anyone with a front door and a WiFi connection.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6333/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Video Coverage That Shows What Really Matters</h2>
<p>The <strong>bigger vertical field of view is a big improvement over older Ring doorbells</strong> which often cut off the tops of tall people’s heads or packages on the ground below the camera’s frame. This full-body coverage gets rid of the annoyance of having to watch footage again and again only to find that important details are missing because they were out of the camera’s view: You can clearly see the faces of delivery drivers while also making sure they really left your package instead of just pretending to deliver it. You can also see people who look suspiciously like they’re casing your property while they think they’re outside the camera’s range.</p>



<p>The<strong> built-in rechargeable battery</strong> means you don’t have to connect the doorbell to your home’s electrical system so renters or anyone who doesn’t want to deal with electrical work can install it. You probably already have cables that work with the USB-C charging port because it uses modern connector standards that are the same as those used by most new phones and tablets. When the battery gets low, just take the doorbell off its mount, plug it into any USB-C charger, and put it back in place after a few hours.</p>
<p>With the <em>Live View</em> feature, <strong>you can use the Ring app on your phone to see what’s going on at your door</strong> at any time, even if no one has pressed the doorbell button or motion detection has been triggered. This is helpful if you’re waiting for a delivery and want to see the driver, if you want to make sure your kids got home from school, or if you just want to see what’s going on outside without having to walk to the door.</p>



<p>When there is movement near your door, <strong>motion detection sends real-time alerts to your phone</strong>. However, the basic notifications only let you know that motion was detected and don’t say what caused it. Ring’s subscription service offers Smart Alerts, which use AI to tell the difference between people, packages, and other moving things like cars or animals. This way, you get more useful notifications that help you decide if something needs your immediate attention.</p>
<p>With Alexa integration, you can stream doorbell video to Echo Show devices all over your house, use Alexa speakers to announce visitors, or use voice commands to control Ring functions. You can ask Alexa to show you the front door, and within seconds, the video feed will appear on compatible Echo displays which lets you check who’s there without having to pull out your phone.</p>
<p>When you consider that smart doorbells from well-known brands usually cost between $150 and $250, spending $49 on a Ring video doorbell with its build quality and features is a great deal. Amazon’s usual price of $99 already made this a good deal compared to other options, but the 50% discount makes it so cheap that it is almost as cheap as regular doorbells from home improvement stores.</p>

            <guid>1378591</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>John Romero’s upcoming game, which was seemingly canceled back when Microsoft ended its publishing agreement with Romero Games and pulled funding, has been saved. Well, sort of.</p>



<p>During an appearance at Salón del Videojuego de Madrid&nbsp;(Madrid Video Game Show), the creator of DOOM revealed that work on the game was continuing. He then went into some more detail on the game’s state, and what’s been happening since the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/romero-games-denies-its-closed-after-game-cancellation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">news broke in July</a>.</p>







<p>Romero revealed that the game has been “completely redesigned” and incorporates elements from the original version while still being a different game. That said, he wanted to make it clear that they weren’t “starting at ground zero” with the project.</p>



<p><strong>“We can take pieces out of and put into a brand-new indie game,”</strong> he said.<strong> “We have a lot of stuff we can put in the game. The design is completely different, but the team is very excited about the new design.”</strong></p>



<p>He continued to say that the building the game is “more fun” than it was while also being a “much smaller game” overall. </p>



<p><strong>“It’s more fun for us because the people working on it were all directors of different departments, and they didn’t actually get to code or design or whatever,” </strong>he said. <strong>“[Now] we get to actually do that, do the thing that we’re really good at ourselves.”</strong></p>







<p>As far as the game’s features, Romero didn’t go into many specifics during his on-stage talk. That said, he spoke about Elden Ring being an inspiration for the game because it was a “really new experience”. His game, he says, is something that he’s never even played before, and making it something like that for players is the main idea behind the project.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Overwatch 2’s December Patch Overhauls Competitive Like Never Before]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-2-patch-december-overhauls-competitive/</link>
            <guid>1378588</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Overwatch 2, despite a few ups and downs, remains one of the most popular hero shooters on the market. Since being released in October 2022 and going free-to-play, Overwatch 2 has remained a staple of the esports space, even with some drastic changes taking place to alter the face of the game’s core competitive leagues.</p>



<p>In the most recent update, the super-sized patch released on December 9, Blizzard made stacks of amendments to Overwatch 2, focusing quite heavily on the game’s competitive ecosystem. It was an overhaul, the likes of which haven’t been seen since the game launched.</p>



<h2 id="h-overwatch-2-s-competitive-revolution">Overwatch 2’s Competitive Revolution</h2>



<p>Blizzard’s latest Overwatch 2 update isn’t just about festivities; it’s a landmark moment for the game’s competitive platform. On December 9, the Winter Wonderland event was ushered in alongside a new patch, but the core of the update addressed the game’s ranked foundations.</p>



<p>The headline change is the ‘Challenger Tier’, a complete replacement for the long-standing Top 500 system that players have known and understood for years. The new framework transforms leaderboards into a season-long battle of skill.</p>



<p>It boasts an all-new scoring system that allows players to earn points based on their MMR, and certain bonuses can be unlocked for consistent performance streaks.</p>



<p>To get into the leaderboard, you’ll need to have a 4000 to 5000 Challenger Score, depending on the playlist you prefer to enjoy.</p>



<p>What’s exciting for the more pro players out there is that social integration is now a thing with this latest Overwatch 2 patch. Those players who are lucky enough to be verified can integrate their streaming and social profiles directly to their entry on the in-game leaderboard, and active competitors are highlighted, prompting fans to spectate their matches from within the client.</p>



<p>The new Wuxing University map is a competitive dream. Cassidy has been completely reforged to emphasize better survivability and versatility, and the competitive meta has been tweaked to no end. It really is the biggest update to the game’s core ‘esports systems’ since it was released over three years ago.</p>
