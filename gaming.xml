            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/25/deadrop-studio-drops-co-founder-dr-disrespect-after-allegations-surrounding-the<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/08/02/check-out-dr-disrespects-upcoming-shooter-deadrop-in-new-gameplay-clips">Deadrop</a> studio Midnight Society has terminated its relationship with co-founder and streamer Guy Beahm aka Dr. Disrespect. It did so after looking into allegations surrounding Beahm that emerged over the recent weekend regarding his 2020 Twitch ban.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Friday, June 21, former Twitch account director of strategic partnerships Cody Conners said on Twitter, "He [referring to Beahm] got banned because he was caught sexting a minor in the then existing Twitch whispers product. He was trying to meet up with her at TwitchCon. The powers that be could read in plain text. Case closed, gang." Conner replied to his own post on X (formerly Twitter) and said, "No one made the wrong decision, f*** him and his boys."&nbsp;</p>

<div>
<blockquote>
<div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>He got banned because got caught sexting a minor in the then existing Twitch whispers product. He was trying to meet up with her at TwitchCon. The powers that be could read in plain text.</p><p>

Case closed, gang.</p></div>
— Cody Conners (@evoli) <a href="https://twitter.com/evoli/status/1804309358106546676?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 22, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div>

<p>Though Conners didn't name Beahm, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/e3-2019/2019/06/12/dr-disrespect-banned-from-e3-for-streaming-from-public-bathrooms-twitch-account">who was previously banned from E3 and suspended on Twitch after livestreaming from a public bathroom in 2019</a>, it was clear that he was referring to the streamer. Beahm even <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1804337822415097955">replied</a> from his Dr. Disrespect account, saying he knows it's a "hot topic" but that it "has been settled, no wrongdoing was acknowledged and they paid out the whole contract." He then <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1804577136998776878">tweeted</a> separately, "Listen, I'm obviously tied to legal obligations from the settlement with Twitch but I just need to say what I can say since this is the f***ing internet. I didn't do anything wrong, all this has been probed and settled, nothing illegal, no wrongdoing was found, and I was paid."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Back in 2020, when Beahm was suddenly banned on June 26, Twitch shared little of the reasoning behind the decision. It released the following statement, "As is our process, we take appropriate action when we have evidence that a streamer has acted in violation of our Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. These apply to all streamers regardless of status or prominence in the community." This ban happened shortly after Beahm signed with Twitch (again) for reportedly an eight-figure sum, as reported by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/07/16/dr-disrespect-is-speaking-again/#click=https://t.co/RnjsaKeGJP"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following this ban, Beahm told&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/07/16/dr-disrespect-is-speaking-again/#click=https://t.co/RnjsaKeGJP">The Washington&nbsp;Post</a>&nbsp;</em>weeks later he still didn't know why Twitch "effectively voided his contract" with the ban. A year after the ban, Beahm sued Twitch and roughly a year after that – so about two years after the ban – he and Twitch settled. At the time, Beahm posted a photo on March 10, 2022, with a paper he signed that read, "I have resolved my legal dispute with Twitch. No party admits to any wrongdoing."&nbsp;</p>



<p>During this sequence of events, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/12/15/dr-disrespect-launches-new-aaa-studio-with-call-of-duty-halo-veterans">Beahm also launched a new triple-A studio with Call of Duty and Halo veteran game developers</a> called Midnight Society. After Conners' reveal about Beahm on Friday, Midnight Society apparently assumed his innocence but began speaking to parties involved. After doing so, it decided to terminate its relationship with Beahm. Here's the studio's full <a href="https://x.com/12am/status/1805341504086622355">statement</a> on the matter:</p>

<p>"On Friday evening we became aware of an allegation against one of our co-founder's Guy Beahm aka Dr. Disrespect. We assumed his innocence and began speaking with parties involved. And in order to maintain our principles and standards as a studio and individuals, we needed to act.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"For this reason, we are terminating our relationship with Guy Beahm immediately.</p>

<p>"While these facts are difficult to hear and even more difficult to accept, it is our duty to act with dignity on behalf of all individuals involved, especially with fifty-five developers and families we have employed along with our community of players."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though Midnight Society doesn't say anything too specific, it did look into the situation following Conners' reveal, spoke to parties involved, and decided then (after previously assuming Beahm's innocence) that it was terminating its relationship with the streamer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though Beahm hasn't acknowledged the Midnight Society situation, people that tuned into the Dr. Disrespect stream happening when the studio posted its statement think they can see the moment he sees the news live on-air. Here's a clip from&nbsp;<em>Kotaku&nbsp;</em>reporter&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/ethangach">Ethan Gach</a>:&nbsp;</p>

<div>
<blockquote>
<div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>You can see the exact moment Dr Disrespect appears to find out that Midnight Society is dropping him, or some other seemingly bad news related to his Twitch ban allegations.</p><p>

He had just defeated Bayle The Dread and went to look at his phone after fast travelling to Scadu Atlus <a href="https://t.co/CwgPSVYCXc">pic.twitter.com/CwgPSVYCXc</a></p></div>
— AmericanTruckSongs9 (@ethangach) <a href="https://twitter.com/ethangach/status/1805357542786449698?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 24, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div>

<p>Considering Beahm's Twitch ban was settled in court with the Amazon-owned streaming service, there's a good chance we don't learn about the sitaution as there are likely legal obligations stopping either party from sharing further details.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dr-disrespect-fired-midnight-society-sexting-minor<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Streamer and Midnight Society co-founder Dr. Disrespect has been fired from his studio following an investigation into allegations that he sexted a minor.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/12am/status/1805341504086622355" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Midnight Society says it became aware of allegations against Dr. Disrespect, real name Guy Beahm, on Friday evening. Beahm is one of the studio's co-founders, having set up Midnight Society alongside other heads <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/drdisrespect-game-studio-midnight-society-announced">back in 2021</a>.</p>
<p>The studio says it presumed his innocence at first, but after speaking with "parties involved" with the allegations, Midnight Society "needed to act", hence the termination of its relationship with Beahm, effective "immediately".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/midnight-society-dr-disrespect-fired-deadrop.jpg?itok=YPc7Up7E 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/midnight-society-dr-disrespect-fired-deadrop.jpg?itok=3Yq3IQ0Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Midnight Society is currently working on&nbsp;<em>Deadrop</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Midnight Society goes on to say that details of the allegations are "difficult to hear and even more difficult to accept", but that it's the studio's "duty" to act "with dignity" on behalf of everyone involved.</p>
<p>These allegations emerged a few days ago thanks to <a href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1804309358106546676" rel="noopener" target="_blank">former Twitch employee Cody Conners</a>, who claimed Dr. Disrespect was banned from Twitch in 2020 because "he got caught sexting a minor".</p>
<p>Conners says Beahm was trying to meet up with the person in question at TwitchCon, but that Twitch shut the interaction down and banned Beahm from their platform.</p>
<p>His comments were corroborated by a second former employee, who <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">told The Verge</a> that Beahm had used Twitch's messaging system to initiate the exchange.</p>
<p>Subsequently, esports news writer Jake Lucky <a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1804328239441285485" rel="noopener" target="_blank">picked up Conners' post</a> and reported on it on X, prompting a response from Beahm in which he told Lucky that "no wrongdoing was acknowledged" and that the matter was "settled".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dr-disrespect.jpg?itok=biX4zBHL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dr-disrespect.jpg?itok=6h-tooFx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Dr. Disrespect's mood appeared to noticeably change while playing&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>recently.</figcaption></figure><p>Beahm followed up this statement with <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1804577136998776878" rel="noopener" target="_blank">another one</a> in which he claimed he's "obviously tied to legal obligations from the settlement with Twitch", but that he "didn't do anything wrong", reiterating once again that "no wrongdoing was found".</p>
<p>Following this, Dr. Disrespect streamed himself playing&nbsp;the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-patch-112-dlc-launch">recently-released&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC</a>, with Kotaku reporter Ethan Gach <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1805352625438703854" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noting</a> that Beahm's mood "took a noticeable turn" after he checked his phone during the stream (the implication seemingly being that he's just seen Midnight Society's announcement).</p>
<p>He also <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1805355384271782085" rel="noopener" target="_blank">goes on to say</a> that he's "stepping away" from streaming, and that he will "completely remove" himself from Midnight Society.</p>
<p>As for the studio itself, we're not sure what comes next, nor do we know whether this move will impact the development of "vertical extraction shooter"&nbsp;<em>Deadrop</em>. Watch this space for more info.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/payday-3-will-add-solo-mode-still-requiring-online-connection-soon-alongside-nvidia-dlss-3-support/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a recent Payday 3 developer diary, Starbreeze <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r26hIijRoRo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the upcoming additions due with the patch scheduled to go live on Thursday, June 27. One of the highlights is undoubtedly the arrival of the solo mode (as a beta) that franchise fans have long awaited, though it will still require an online connection for the time being.</p>
<p>Payday 3 Global Brand Director and Head of Community Almir Listo explained:</p>
<p><em>It's not our full vision for this feature. For now, we're setting it as a beta to test how it runs. We expect performance to be affected since the parts normally frontloaded by our servers will now have to be run on your own hardware. It will work, though, and you can get progression that'll update you once you return online. You will still be required to start the game while online in solo mode, which will be improved once we improve this feature. For now, though, we want to test that the features that went into this work work properly. Before the next iteration of the feature, we hope we'll have hosted co-op and all that cool stuff.</em></p>
<p><em>Keep in mind this is not an offline mode. It's a solo mode where the portions of the game previously hosted on our servers are now hosted on your device. Bear in mind that this is a stepping stone for a feature to come, not something we're releasing and calling done.</em></p>
<p>The upcoming Payday 3 update will also introduce support for NVIDIA DLSS 3 on PC (previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-ii-to-support-path-tracing-and-dlss-3-5-cod-modern-warfare-3-fortnite-payday-3-also-get-dlss-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> but mysteriously absent at launch), the ability to rename loadout, a free new playable character (Clover), two Weapons (Clover's signature gun and the LMG), three Masks, twelve Flag Stickers, and one Charm.</p>
<p>Payday 3 <a href="https://wccftech.com/remnant-2-sales-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn't have a successful launch</a>, and part of that was due to lackluster matchmaking. Starbreeze is preparing a new matchmaking service that should be ready by the end of the year, providing a better online experience for everyone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation is Working on PS3 Emulation for PlayStation 5, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-ps3-emulation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-is-working-on-ps3-emulation-for-playstation-5-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.910455/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-ps3-emulation/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Two insiders have claimed that PlayStation is reportedly working on PS3 emulation for the PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>That’s according to XboxEra’s Nick Baker and Giant Bomb’s Jeff Grubb, who have both claimed that PlayStation is working on PS3 emulation for the PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>The first report of the rumor came from Nick Baker, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwVRYZGPWEA&amp;t=10789s&amp;ab_channel=XboxEra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">who claimed</a> that “Sony is working on select PlayStation 3 backward compatibility.” Unfortunately, Baker doesn’t provide any other details and has seemingly covered all his bases using the term ‘select,’ which could mean one game or all of them.</p>



<p>However, Giant Bomb’s Jeff Grubb took to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7VhpUERtTk&amp;ab_channel=GiantBomb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">his podcast</a> to also cover the news and add a little more input on what he’s heard. “It’s something I’ve heard has been in the works for quite some time; I thought it was going to get revealed earlier this year when I first heard about it, but that clearly didn’t happen. That doesn’t mean it will never happen; maybe it does,” he said. Unfortunately, Grubb’s input is also pretty vague and doesn’t necessarily confirm that this could ever be released, but as always, with smoke, there’s fire.</p>



<p>Do you think PlayStation is working on PS3 emulation for the PlayStation 5? If so, which games would you like to see make their way to the console? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

IGN has asked Sega for comment.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>A remake of the original Jet Set Radio is in the works at SEGA, it is a full remake of the Dreamcast game and it is not related to the F2P reboot.</p><p>Source: Midori <a href="https://t.co/D7Cd8yDLly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/D7Cd8yDLly</a></p></div>— Senhorita Kazzy (@MSKAZZY69) <a href="https://twitter.com/MSKAZZY69/status/1805073421916569982?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 24, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Three of the screenshots show protagonist Beat exploring Tokyo by grinding on rails and running across walls, while the fourth shows the World Map, which features locations such as Central, DennoCho Station, Neribei, SubCul, and South.</p><p>The video shows what appears to be an in-development trailer for the game, again showing Beat traversing Tokyo while spraying graffiti, performing tricks, and more. This footage is incredibly similar, if not identical in places, to the "Next Generation" montage released by Sega when it announced the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi-golden-axe-and-more-are-in-development-game-awards-2023">reboot alongside revivals of other classic franchises</a> Crazy Taxi, Golden Axe, Shinobi, and Streets of Rage in December 2023.</p><p>This remake, if real, is allegedly separate from the reboot of Jet Set Radio, but it does tick a lot of the same boxes. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jet-set-radio-reboot-appears-to-be-open-world-based-on-newly-revealed-info">The reboot is also likely open-world</a> and brings the classic characters and gameplay to modern platforms.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/if-mr-house-is-in-fallout-season-2-which-new-vegas-ending-is-canon-fans-have-their-theories<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>This week the showrunners of Prime Video’s Fallout TV show <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-showrunners-confirm-robert-house-for-season-2">confirmed Robert House “will be involved” in Season 2</a>, cementing the appearance of a major <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout New Vegas</a> character after a pre-war cameo in Season 1.</p><p><em><strong>Warning:</strong></em><em> Spoilers for Fallout Season 1 and Fallout New Vegas follow.</em></p><p>Given the Fallout TV show is set after all the Fallout games and is considered canon, the confirmation of Mr. House’s appearance in Season 2 has sparked all sorts of fan theories about how he’ll make his live-action appearance, and what it means for Obsidian’s much-loved New Vegas itself.</p><p>First, some background. Robert House appears in New Vegas as Mr. House. He rules New Vegas as a brain plugged into a supercomputer that has extended his existence from the pre-war era hundreds of years into the post-war era. Robert House makes a cameo appearance in the Fallout TV show during a pre-war scene in which the then RobCo Industries boss plots with Vault-Tec management and the heads of other companies to not only survive the inevitable nuclear apocalypse, but maybe even trigger it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Fallout TV Show Video Game Easter Eggs – Companies</h3></div></output><p>Season 1 ends with a Power Armor-clad Overseer Hank stomping towards New Vegas, with The Ghoul and Lucy MacLean in hot pursuit. Much of Season 2, it seems, will be set in New Vegas and deal with the coming together of the main characters there.</p><p>As for how this fits in the Fallout timeline, the Fallout TV show is set in 2296, nine years after the events of Fallout 4 and 15 years after the events of Fallout New Vegas. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-fans-are-convinced-a-brotherhood-of-steel-airship-confirms-one-of-two-canon-endings-from-fallout-4">We’ve already seen a debate about which Fallout 4 ending should be considered canon</a>, if any. And now we know Mr. House is in Season 2, presumably in the current post-apocalyptic timeline and not relegated to pre-war flashbacks only, fans are debating which New Vegas ending would make most sense as canon.</p><p>Let’s talk about New Vegas’ various endings. Depending on the choices the player, aka The Courier, makes throughout the course of the game, New Vegas can end with victory for the player during the Battle of Hoover Dam, which drives out all factions including Mr. House himself, a victory for Mr. House in which he remains in control of New Vegas and takes over Hoover Dam, a victory for Caesar's Legion, or a victory for the New California Republic.</p><p>There are variations within these endings, but let’s look in more detail at the one most fans now believe will be considered canon as we head into Season 2 of the TV show. If Mr. House is in Season 2 in a post-war setting, as in alive when the main characters turn up at New Vegas, then it’s likely he survived the events of New Vegas the video game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>So, perhaps the New Vegas ending the show assumes to be canon is the one in which Mr. House's Securitron army takes control of Hoover Dam and the Strip, pushing both the Legion and the NCR out. This ending, the player is told, causes Mr. House to continue to run New Vegas in a despotic vision of pre-War glory. “The streets were orderly, efficient, cold,” the ending says. “New Vegas continued to be the sole place in the wasteland where fortunes were won and lost in the blink of an eye.”</p><p>As Fallout co-showrunner Graham Wagner has now confirmed: “Many of our lead characters are Vegas-bound. Las Vegas in the world of Fallout is Robert House’s town. Robert House will be involved in Season 2.”</p><p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/TKsMantis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Fallout lore expert TKs-Mantis</u></a>, the House ending in Fallout: New Vegas “is about to be canon when Season 2 of the show drops.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">House is alive, which means we might have chosen the Dam with NCR, they launch a bomb like shady sands. Maybe it goes downhill siding with House, The Courier is the unknown variable. So perhaps we died, or left. House had to pick a more irreliable apprentice. Caesars Legion??? <a href="https://t.co/a7AMNNR58e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/a7AMNNR58e</a></p>— Hector Moya (@Pope831) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pope831/status/1805277440715219415?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 24, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>What we don’t know is what happened to New Vegas in the 15 years after the events of the video game. The glimpse we get of New Vegas at the end of Season 1 shows the area in apparent ruins, which is not the state of the place at the end of the video game. If that glimpse does indeed reflect the New Vegas we’ll see in Season 2, how did things get so bad?</p><p>But there is some debate about the reliability of the New Vegas teased at the end of Season 1. Some believe the images we see do not show New Vegas in ruins at all, rather just as run-down as most places in the Fallout universe (no-one ever tidies up!). Similarly, there are questions over whether Caesar's Legion, the NCR, or even The Boomers will have survived. Will the Courier still be around? The only thing that is clear, really, is that there are many questions to be answered.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/whats-the-snake-oil-salesmans-mysterious-serum-in-the-fallout-tv-show-fans-have-theories"><u>Fans have plenty of theories about the Snake Oil Salesman’s mysterious serum</u></a>, for example (this one's my favorite!).

In the interview, Howard confirms the bombs that destroy Shady Sands, as seen in the Fallout TV show, fall just after the events of New Vegas.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

			<p>The upcoming Final Fantasy XIV 7.0 patch will bring plenty of visual improvements to the MMORPG, as well as 120 FPS support on consoles and NVIDIA DLSS support on PC, among other things.</p>
<p>As confirmed by the preliminary 7.0 patch notes found on the game's official website, the upcoming patch will introduce 120 FPS support on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. The game, however, is not expected to run at the maximum framerate all the time, so it will be very interesting to see how it will run with the new visual improvements the patch will bring, which include improved hair and face textures, changes in lighting due to the passage of time, soft shadows, improvement for lenses in glasses and other glass objects, metallic material on certain gear, water and waves, fog, textures of distant terrain when riding a Mount and more.</p>
<p>The upcoming Final Fantasy XIV patch will also bring some PC-specific improvements, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-benchmark-test-previews-nvidia-dlss-amd-fsr-additions-and-graphics-improvements/">AMD FSR 1.0 and NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 upscaling</a>, which were both announced a while back, anti-aliasing via TSMCAA and SSAO via GTAO.</p>
<p>The Final Fantasy XIV 7.0 patch also brings plenty of additional content as part of the new Dawntrail expansion. You can find the full patch notes by going <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/027df51f6c2c3d792f33cbc4430ef648e989722d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>Final Fantasy XIV is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. The game could be released on Nintendo Switch 2 as well, but not in its launch window.</p>

Square Enix has released the <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/027df51f6c2c3d792f33cbc4430ef648e989722d">full patch notes for Patch 7.0</a>, ahead of Dawntrail's early access launch later this week.

</p>
<p>
The notes give a rundown of what additions and tweaks players can expect from the new expansion. Much of this includes known and expected changes like level cap increases and new quests, on top of a look at new locations and duties. If you're avoiding spoilers, you may want to skip the notes.
</p>
<p>
However, there are also some smaller but welcome additions worth pointing out, as well as a stark look at the visual changes the graphical update will bring.

<p>

Firstly, though, it should be pointed out Final Fantasy 14 will be unavailable to access from 26th - 27th June as maintenance is performed across all Worlds in preparation for Dawntrail. These patch notes explain what will be implemented.
</p>
<p>
As already widely reported since the announcement at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14s-next-expansion-dawntrail-will-be-the-very-best-summer-vacation">Las Vegas Fan Fest</a>, Patch 7.0 will introduce a graphical update that's been applied for all Dawntrail content, with similar updates coming to older content in future updates. The update includes improved textures and lighting, as well as other more subtle effects and changes.
</p>
<p>
In the patch notes, a couple of slider images indicate the improved textures - it looks like wearing glasses after having blurry vision. The aim of this update is to futureproof the game for years to come.
</p>
<p>
To ensure players are happy with the graphical changes to their characters, everyone will receive a free Fantasia item with which to edit their character. Now, though, players will have up to 60 minutes of in-game time in which to re-edit their character should they change their minds once seeing their character in action.
</p>
<p>
Further, the patch will introduce new hairstyles, the ability to add two colours when dying gear, and a separate option for facewear - so now you can wear glasses and a helmet together.
</p>
<p>
Two other tweaks are very welcome. The first, as previously mentioned in the Live Letter from the Producer but worth reiterating, is that other players around a quest giver can be temporarily hidden - a major tweak considering the high number of players expected for Dawntrail's launch.
</p> <div>

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Secondly, quest objectives that require following an NPC now have visual indicators to help avoid detection. Endwalker introduced a number of these stealth missions, but they sometimes proved frustrating.
</p>
<p>
Other small tweaks include: the ability to use a DualSense Edge controller on Windows; trophies and achievements unlocking from play on other platforms; and the addition of the mute list and term filter for better safety.
</p>
<p>
And, very importantly, there is now a new adorable llama mount.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, the notes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14s-server-capacity-increased-by-roughly-50-compared-to-launch-of-endwalker">reiterate measures temporarily implemented to reduce server congestion</a>: restricting travel between certain Worlds and data centres; automatic logout after 30 minutes of inactivity; and new areas being split into multiple instances.
</p>
<p>
Dawntrail releases in early access this Friday, 28th June, with the full launch arriving on 2nd July. This was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14s-dawntrail-wont-release-until-the-end-of-june-so-you-can-play-the-elden-ring-dlc">pushed back a week</a> due to the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree.
</p>
<p>
I played a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dawntrail-is-final-fantasy-14-at-its-most-colourful">preview version of Dawntrail last month</a> and described it as Final Fantasy 14 "at its most colourful".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-1080p-not-smart-performance-concerns/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is rumored to feature a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-conservative-hardware-evolution/">1080p screen</a>, but this may not be the smartest decision due to various reasons, including mishandled backward compatibility.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of the <a href="https://youtu.be/QzCkpTE0bM0?si=k3F_0juuhO3ZK0nc&amp;t=5007" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DF Direct Weekly podcast</a>, the tech experts at Digital Foundry answered a fan question regarding the next Nintendo console, commenting on how a 1080p screen may not be the best of choices. If the console supports backward compatibility with the original Switch games, as rumored, it could lead to some image quality issues, as games in portable mode on the current console output at 720p resolution, which would look blurry on a 1080p screen. To address this issue, the Nintendo Switch 2 would essentially have to use backward compatible game's docked mode, which output at 1080p resolution, while running them in portable mode.</p>
<p>Even for Nintendo Switch 2 games, a 1080p screen could be an issue. While developers can certainly target 720p resolution, it wouldn't look good on such a screen. On the other hand, NVIDIA DLSS support could be quite helpful in this regard, as 540p resolution upscaled to 1080p would look better than 720p resolution on a 1080p screen. Digital Foundry, however, feels that a 720p screen would be more beneficial for the system, as a lower resolution could leave more performance headroom in portable mode and would still look good, as proved by the Steam Deck. HDR support would also be quite an update over the current Switch models.</p>

<p>Not much is currently known about the Nintendo Switch 2, but more information on the system, rumored to launch in the first few months of 2025, should be coming before the end of the year.</p>

            <p>
The Pokémon Company has booted a bunch of fans from a Pokémon card art contest, after claims several entrants used AI to aid their submissions. 
</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCG/status/1805430785056588279">statement</a> today from The Pokémon Company claimed that "select entrants" among the competition's top 300 quarter-finalists had been found to have "violated the official contest rules", leading to their disqualification.

<p>
The statement does not name AI specifically as the reason behind the action being taken, but a quick glance at the company's previous announcement on the matter shows an array of complaints from fans on social media pointing to what they believe to be AI art making the contest's quarter-final cut.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">it's all the submissions that follow the V_____ K______ naming convention. Pretty brazen of them tbh. These scores are wildly high, meaning very little editing was done to the AI renders.

The Pokémon TCG Illustration Contest is a semi-regular oppurtunity for fans to show off their artistic prowess and win both prize money and a chance at getting their creation printed on an actual Pokémon card. The top cash prize is $5k, around £3940.
</p>
<p>
300 pieces of artwork from finalists were posted to the Pokémon website two weeks ago, though various entrants (some with strikingly similar artist names) were quickly highlighted as likely being AI-generated. 
</p>
<p>
There's no explanation by Pokémon today of why it failed to detect likely AI involvement before now, or why numerous similar author names were not flagged as suspicious. 
</p>
<p>
Still, at least this time Pokémon players weren't <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2012/03/spanish_pokemon_team_disgraced">disqualified for flinging poo</a>.

            <p>A little show called Fallout released back in April - you may have heard of it - which received scores of praise on its release, including in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-review">our own Fallout review</a> that called it "a lovely, if blood-spattered, surprise". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-creator-tim-cain-is-a-big-fan-of-the-tv-show">Fallout's original creator Tim Cain also had nothing but praise</a>  for the adaptation.</p>
<p>During its first 16 days on Amazon Prime, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-show-was-watched-by-65m-people-in-its-first-two-weeks">65 million viewers tuned in</a> to follow Lucy, Maximus and The Ghoul as they made their way through the Fallout wasteland. It ultimately came as no surprise when the series was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">quickly picked up for a second season</a>.</p>
<p>But, what does season two have in store? The first series finished with an obvious story thread for the Fallout team to follow, and now the showrunners have confirmed one video game character that will definitely show up when season two hits the streaming service. Please note, <strong>there will be spoilers for the Fallout series (game and show) below</strong>.</p>

</figure>
<p>The first season of Fallout ends with disgraced (at least, in the eyes of many) Vault-Tec executive Hank MacLean in his pinched Brotherhood of Steel Power Armour, fleeing towards a ruined New Vegas. Showrunners Graham Wagner and Geneva Robertson-Dworet <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-tv-showrunners-discuss-season-two-location-and-why-the-series-doesnt-need-to-follow-a-canon-ending">previously confirmed the next season will head to New Vegas</a>, adding its ruined state is to show the audience that "things have happened" to the location since the events of New Vegas the game (which, canonically, were 15 years prior to the show).</p>
<p>But while things have clearly happened between the events of the game and the show, one popular character will still be featured in some way for season two - that of Robert House, aka New Vegas' enigmatic leader Mr. House.</p>
<p>"Many of our lead characters are Vegas-bound," Wagner said in conversation with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8Q0Ch50lNU">Variety</a>. "Las Vegas in the world of Fallout is Robert House's town. Robert House will be involved in season two."  Robertson-Dworet added coyly House "might have something to do with it".</p>
<p>Robert House had a brief cameo in the first season of Amazon's Fallout show, popping up during a meeting between Vault-Tec executives and various other corporation heads and CEOs. It was during this meeting the notion that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-tv-show-finale-answers-long-running-series-mystery">Vault-Tec itself may have dropped the bombs</a> was first floated.</p>

<p>As to <em>how </em>House will appear in season two, for now that remains unknown. Will he still be leading in some way, or will his name merely be that of a time now past, spoken by those still left in New Vegas? Or, will his part be explored via flashbacks? We will have to wait and see.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Fallout's showrunners said they want to get the second season of Amazon's adaptation out swiftly, with Robertson-Dworet and Wagner stating the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallouts-second-season-will-be-out-as-fast-as-humanly-possible">Fallout team is "going to be pedal to the metal to get season two out as fast as humanly possible"</a>.</p>

            <p>Deadrop developers Midnight Society have "terminated" their relationship with studio co-founder and celebrity streamer Herschel "Guy" Beahm, aka  "Dr Disrespect", over fresh allegations about the reasons for his infamous Twitch ban in 2020. </p><!--more-->
<p>At the time of the ban, which came just a few months after Beahm and Twitch announced <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/dr-disrespect-signs-multi-year-deal-stay-twitch-1283878/">a two-year exclusivity contract</a>, Twitch <a href="https://x.com/Shannon_Liao/status/1276617617730568195">commented only</a> that Beahm had been jettisoned for acting "in violation of our Community Guidelines". Beahm himself described the move as "a total shock" in a later conversation with the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/07/16/dr-disrespect-is-speaking-again/">Washington Post</a>. In August 2021, he <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/dr-disrespect-is-suing-the-fuck-out-of-twitch/">took Twitch to court over the ban</a>, but the dispute was eventually <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/drdisrespect-settles-his-lawsuit-with-twitch/">settled</a> with neither party admitting any wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Last week, however, former Twitch strategic partnerships account director Cody Conners <a href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1804309358106546676">alleged in a Xitter post</a> that an unnamed person "got banned because [he] got caught sexting a minor in the then existing Twitch Whispers product. He was trying to meet up with her at TwitchCon. The powers that be could read in plain text. Case closed, gang." (Twitch Whispers is a now-retired private 1-to-1 messaging service.) According to two anonymous former Twitch employees <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation">cited by the Verge</a> in a subsequent investigation - one of whom worked on Twitch's trust and safety team at the time of the ban -  the unnamed person in question was Beahm.</p>
<p>As to why it's taken Conners this long to make the allegations, he posted <a href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1805086524247245217">a rather elliptical comment</a> just yesterday suggesting that "the information had been so normalized, declawed in the circles that I ran in that could be reduced to allusion and entendre.</p>
<p>"For everyone who has since said "that’s fucked" — I agreed with you on Friday night before you wrote it," Conners went on. "I should have agreed with you sooner."</p>
<p>Beahm hasn't yet addressed these latest claims about his behaviour, beyond <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1804577136998776878">tweeting last week</a> that "Listen, I'm obviously tied to legal obligations from the settlement with Twitch but I just need to say what I can say since this is the fucking internet. I didn't do anything wrong, all this has been probed and settled, nothing illegal, no wrongdoing was found, and I was paid."</p>
<p>Beahm's and Conners' statements have, as you'd expect, been the subject of much discussion on social media. Responding to this, Beahm told viewers of a Twitch stream yesterday (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-ousted-from-own-studio-as-new-twitch-ban-allegations-surface">Eurogamer</a>) that he needed to take a "step back" from his work at Midnight Society. "I mean I'm gonna have to relay this to the Midnight Society, but, you know, maybe I step away from there too," he said. "Just completely remove myself from the scene. It's what I need to do." </p>
<p>Shortly after that stream, The Midnight Society <a href="https://x.com/12am/status/1805341504086622355">ran a statement of their own</a> acknowledging the allegation, and declaring that they would part ways with Beahm "in order to maintain our principles and standards as a studio and individuals" following an internal inquiry. Here it is in full:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Friday evening we became aware of an allegation against one of our co-founder's Guy Beahm aka Dr Disrespect.</p>
<p>We assumed his innocence and began speaking with parties involved. And in order to maintain our principles and standards as a studio and individuals, we needed to act.</p>
<p>For this reason, we are terminating our relationship with Guy Beahm immediately. </p>
<p>While these facts are difficult to hear and even more difficult to accept, it is our duty to act with dignity on behalf of all individuals involved, especially the fifty-five developers and families we have employed along with our community of players.</p></blockquote>
<p>I've mailed a representative of Beahm to ask for comment about Midnight Society's statement.</p>
<p>Back in 2020 around the time of Beahm's ban, there was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/industry-hit-with-second-wave-of-abuse-allegations">a wave of revelations about abuse, manipulation and predatory behaviour</a> on the part of streamers and influencers across Twitch and Youtube, alongside a few developers or journalists. In September 2022, Twitch was the subject of a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2022-twitch-problem-with-child-predators/">Bloomberg</a> report into cases of child grooming, following which the platform holder <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Our-Work-to-Combat-Online-Grooming?language=en_US">announced plans</a> to improve safety measures, including better moderation and "expanding the signals" for catching and blocking users who are younger than 13.</p>

        <p>Korean developer currently under investigation by the Ministry of Labor and Employment as it amassed millions in debts</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Challengers Games is shutting down, with its latest title Second Wave no longer available as of yesterday.</p>
<p>In a long post shared on the <a href="https://www.challengersgames.com/goodbye-heroes-of-armantia-and-koji-villagers/">studio's website</a>, CEO and studio head Koji Tamura shared that the Seoul-based firm has ₩2.4 billion worth of debts (around $1.7 million), and is currently under investigation by the Ministry of Labor and Employment.</p>
<p>The company's accounts have been seized, and the teams have not been paid since March 2024, he added, saying they were "hoping for a miracle."</p>
<p>This follows ongoing struggles with funding and development  of its titles Illang and Second Wave, the latter having been poorly received when it came out in Early Access last month.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid that Second Wave will unfortunately not be able to continue in July, because quite frankly, we have absolutely no money to pay for the servers, and ultimately the servers will end up shutting down," Tamura said,.</p>
<p>He continued: "I wanted to make the game a success, but I apologise to everyone for not being able to do so. I also feel a heavy responsibility for the overdue wages. I will find a way to pay everyone."</p>
<p>Tamura said it's not impossible that Challengers Games will be back though, adding: "We will start over and we will announce things when we are ready."</p>
<p>Players who purchased Second Wave on Steam will be refunded, and its Discord server will shut down in July.</p>

            <p>
Monster hit Palworld is yet to receive any formal legal threat from Nintendo or The Pokémon Company, the game's developer has confirmed, despite continuing close comparisons between its creature designs.
</p>
<p>
Palworld's breakout success at the beginning of this year - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-says-it-will-investigate-and-take-appropriate-measures-following-claims-palworld-copied-designs">and its obvious similarities to Pokémon</a> - prompted a rare public statement from The Pokémon Company, which pledged to "investigate and take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to the Pokémon".
</p>
<p>
But, speaking to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/">GameFile</a>, Palworld creator Takuro Mizobe said that threat was never followed up behind the scenes. 
</p>

<p>
"[We heard] nothing at all," Mizobe said. "Nintendo and the Pokémon Company didn't say anything to us."
</p>
<p>
In the same interview, Mizobe discussed how his career as a game developer got started via a year-long training programme backed by Nintendo. As a student in the programme, Mizobe ultimately helped launch a free downloadable game for the Nintendo DSi (a simple shooter named The Tentai Show launched only in Japan, it tasked players with defending Earth from impending meteoroids).
</p>
<p>
"I always think: To make new things is very hard," Mizobe said when asked what he'd learned from working with Nintendo.

<p>
"In game development, of course, sometimes we have to do it, but, as much as possible, I try to avoid creating new things."
</p>
<p>
Next up for Mizobe is continuing work on Palworld, which will this week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-gets-new-island-and-more-in-sakurajima-update">get a new island to explore and a PVP arena</a>, and the ongoing addition of more "Pals". A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-community-manager-teases-ps5-version">PlayStation 5 version of Palworld</a> has also been teased as on the way.
</p>
<p>The Pokémon Company's former chief legal officer Don McGowan, who worked at the company for 12 years, said earlier this year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemons-former-chief-legal-officer-surprised-palworld-managed-to-get-this-far">he was "surprised" Palworld had "got this far"</a>.</p>

            <p>A corn dog is something I’ve never eaten, because they’re not really a thing in UK. I am morbidly curious about them, although I cannot ascertain their texture just by looking, which worries me. A Khorne dog, however, is a texturally simpler proposition. You can tell just by looking at today’s new legendary hero for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War Warhammer 3</a> that he’d be quite difficult to chew, should you get to that point. Either way, the price is definitely easy to swallow - he’s completely free as part of today’s patch 5.1.0, which also brings substantial changes to multiplayer.</p>

<p>The headline items for the patch - which precedes a promised deep dive into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/greenskins-ogres-and-khorne-are-all-coming-in-the-next-dlc-for-total-war-warhammer-3">the next DLC </a>tomorrow - are mostly centered around multiplayer. First up, there’s the new competitive multiplayer Conquest Mode. They’re effectively land battles but with a single capture point in the middle of the map. “With the addition of a capture point that serves as an alternate win condition, we incentivise players to fight in the centre of the map,”  <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/23-total-war-warhammer-iii-patch-5-1-0?page=1">reads the blog</a>, with the aim of disincentivising cheese strats like corner camping.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, a series of new community and developer maps are being added to Domination mode, and the mode itself can now be played against AI, alongside some other tweaks and changes. Lords, for example, can no longer be summoned and unsummoned. I have a passing interest in domination mode, which is to say I like watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@turinRTS">Turin</a> cast games, so I’ll wait to hear his opinions so I can pass them off as my own.</p>
<p>Other changes include the Daemons of Chaos now being playable in quick battles, free-for-all battles now being playable against the AI, and the usual round of nerfs, buffs, UI updates, and general rebalances. Of note here is a change to Collision attacks so they apply full weapon strength damage, making chariots more useful. Also, they nerfed the Thunderbarge, praise the lord/that’s a grudging, depending on your allegiance. Make sure to pop back tomorrow when we should have some more details about the DLC. Ogres, Orcs, and Khorne are currently slated to be getting some new toys.</p>
<p>Creative Assembly themselves have<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-total-war-dev-accuses-creative-assembly-of-mismanagement-and-says-strategy-series-ai-is-limited-by-design"> come under fire recently</a> from a former developer who took to Medium to allege a culture of mismanagement during his time there. As he takes time to say though, it’s clear the folks in the trenches are still dedicated to make their games as good as possible.</p>

            <p>The Northern Ireland Assembly All Party Group on Reducing Harm Related to Gambling has called for stronger loot boxes regulation in the country.</p>
<p>While it didn't call for a ban, it's recommended that "gambling within video games be severely limited to the greatest possible extent in the second phase of gambling legislation in [Northern Ireland]."</p>
<p>This is part of a report put together following an inquiry that ran between December 2022 and January 2024, gathering evidence on the impact of gambling on public health. The APG believes that Northern Ireland is "in an advantageous position to lead the way on the regulation of loot boxes."</p>
<p>As part of recommendations made to the NI Executive and the UK government, it called for legislation to "regulate the structural characteristics, availability and accessibility of gambling mechanics within video games, including loot boxes."</p>
<p>It also recommended that companies take a more nuanced approach to loot boxes, for example offering direct purchasing options, or the guarantee to get the content of a loot box after a certain amount has been spent.</p>
<p>Regulation shouldn't be relying solely on games companies changing their approach though, the APG warned, but should be "based on stringent, legally mandated regulations, with attention paid to the structural characteristics and overall availability of loot boxes."</p>
<p>The report also called attention to free-to-play social casino titles, supporting their restriction so they can't be easily accessed by minors.</p>
<p>Researcher Leon Y. Xiao, who regularly <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/authors/leon-y-xiao">contributes to <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> on the topic of loot boxes regulation</a>, was part of the NI inquiry and held a special evidence session.</p>
<p>He commented: "Players in Northern Ireland would benefit from the industry self-regulation coming into force in the UK regardless of Stormont's [the Northern Ireland Assembly] approach, but Stormont can seek to provide a higher degree of consumer protection (than that which will be enjoyed by other UK players), if it deems doing so to be necessary and appropriate."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-miniclip-jagex-loot-box-ads-broke-uk-advertising-rules">UK's Advertising Standards Authority warned EA, Miniclip, and Jagex</a> after they failed to disclose presence of loot boxes in some of their titles, violating the country's advertising rules.</p>

            <p>
An Elden Ring dataminer has unmasked the NPCs of Shadow of the Erdtree, revealing what their faces look like beneath the armour.
</p>
<p>
The DLC includes a number of new characters, from the followers of Miquella seen in the game's trailers to other quest givers in the Land of Shadow.
</p>
<p>
Dataminer Zullie the Witch has released a new video that reveals the unique faces of these NPCs, to give a proper look at who they really are.

<p>

Take Hornsent, for instance. As his name suggests, he has small horns protruding from the wraps around his face, yet underneath he's just a regular, grubby looking bloke. As Zullie suggests, he should probably have horns on his character model but this would require a unique model outside the capabilities of the character creator.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, we see beneath the hefty armour of characters like Moore, Sir Ansbach, Redmane Freyja, and Needle Knight Leda, who are all met in the early hours of the DLC.
</p>
<p>
While seeing their faces doesn't reveal anything major about their characters, it does show their diverse characteristics. What's more, it indicates FromSoftware's creation process: using its own character creator to develop the models before slapping some armour on top.

<p>
Zullie the Witch is well known for revealing the grotesque details of enemies and characters across the Soulsborne games. 
</p>
<p>
A similar video was done for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-rings-npcs-unmasked">NPCs in the base game of Elden Ring</a>, as well as a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-rings-gargoyle-enemies-are-actually-made-of-human-flesh">closer examination of the gargoyle enemies</a>.


</p>
<p>
Another Shadow of the Erdtree character has also been unmasked: the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/modder-de-robes-shadow-of-the-erdtrees-lion-boss-and-yes-two-little-guys-really-are-hanging-out-under-there">Divine Beast Dancing Lion boss</a>.

            <p>The Steam Summer Sale is kicking off this week, say Valve, purveyors of fine games and thousands of crap ones too (don't worry, we help you tell the difference). The sale begins on Thursday June 27th and runs until July 11th. That's a full two weeks of sun and soulslikes, beach balls and beat 'em ups, paddling pools and puzzle games. I don't know any other objects associated with this mythological "summer" people talk about, I'm from Ireland. But I can tell you at least some of the games that'll be in the sale, according to some bargain-teasing by Valve.</p>

<p>They <a href="https://x.com/Steam/status/1805299921853333557">advertised the upcoming sale on Xitter</a>, a handy reminder. In that video they point out a few headliners, like Pokénot sweatshop simulator <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a>, princess-befriending farm 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disney-dreamlight-valley">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>, and managerial peasantry botherer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a>. But don't say how much of a saving there'll be. They also mention a category of sales items they're calling "deep discounts". Which I'm guessing might simply be a list of all games on sale for more than 50% or 75% off, or something like that? Who knows.</p>
<p>Valve schedule these sales far in advance. They once used kept upcoming sale dates to themselves but not anymore. You can see the planned dates for all future sales in 2024 in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3970553774441642998">a post on their Steamworks blog for developers</a>, for instance. After this year's summery sale comes smaller sales like Tower Defense Fest and Fighting Games Fest, both in August. But the next big seasonal blow-out will be the Steam Autumn Sale, which is planned to run from November 27th to December 4th. </p>
<p>The sales are easier to resist when you already own a catalogue of unplayed platformers gathering cobwebs and moaning like forgotten skeletons at the bottom of your game library. But yes, it's worth keeping an eye out in Steam's sometimes bargainous bucket for that thing-wot-you-always-kinda-wanted-but-not-THAT-much. Here's hoping you find it for pennies.</p>

            <p>Aside from its naturally satisfying rhythm and the cool audio dings of success that usually accompany it, I find something innately hilarious about parrying. Yes, yes, it’s a deeply skilled expression of martial prowess that turns your enemy’s aggression back at them. But it’s also a pleasingly low-effort method to make your opponent look very silly - the combat equivalent of waving your outstretched hand and shaking your head in unison. I assume so from videogames, anyway. In reality, I could not parry a nerf dart with a metal bin lid.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you’re <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-of-the-erdtrees-mixed-steam-reviews-paint-a-different-picture-to-the-critical-reception">having trouble</a> with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a>’s bosses, why not make the game temporarily more difficult for yourself, but then eventually easier, with a slightly obscure item that effectively turns <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>  into stabby <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth</a> ‘em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice">Sekiro</a>?</p>
<p>The Deflecting Hardtear is an item for your Physick flask. You’ll need to beat the first fire golem you encounter in the shadow lands, which you can more or less spot from the first site of grace. Mix it in, get it down you, and you’ll gain the following effects:</p>
<blockquote>Damage negation and guard poise will be heightened in the moment immediately after assuming a guarding stance. Successfully executing a spontaneous guard will also strengthen guard counters.</blockquote>
<p>To see this - surprisingly massive expansion of the combat to be hidden behind an optional item - in action, here’s someone using it to parry Melania’s infamous Waterfowl Dance i.e the boss move in the game voted most likely to have been ported over from an unreleased Sekiro DLC.</p>


<p>The effects last for five minutes, which should be more than enough to embarrass Melania's first phase at least. This isn’t the only crystal tear in the DLC of course, and you might want to have a peek at Ollie’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-boss-locations">guide to boss locations</a> if you want to track down the rest. You could just play Sekiro, of course. It's got massive chickens in it.</p>

        <p>Developer says its in response to allegations related to the streamer's Twitch ban</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Game studio Midnight Society has parted ways with co-founder and streamer Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm.</p>
<p>In a statement issued to <a href="https://x.com/12am/status/1805341504086622355">social media</a>, the developer said it had become aware of allegations last Friday related to Beahm's Twitch ban in 2020.</p>
<p>"We assumed his innocence and began speaking with parties involved," the company said. "In order to maintain our principles and standards as a studio and individuals, we needed to act. For this reason, we are immediately terminating our relationship with Guy Beahm.</p>
<p>"While these facts are difficult to hear and even more difficult to accept, it is our duty to act with dignity on behalf of all individuals involved, especially the 55 developers and families we have employed along with our community of players."</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation">The Verge</a>, a former Twitch employee who worked on the platform's trust and safety team alleged that Beahm was banned due to messaging a minor on the platform, and reportedly tried to organise a meet up with them at TwitchCon.</p>
<p>Beahm has since denied these allegations on <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1804577136998776878">social media</a>.</p>
<p>"This has been settled, no wrongdoing was acknowledged, and [Twitch] paid out the whole contract," he wrote.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/drdisrespect-banned-from-twitch-again">Beahm was permanently banned from Twitch in 2020</a>, a year into a two-year contract with the platform.</p>
<p>A reason for the ban was not given at the time. Twitch simply said it had taken action in response to a violation of its Community Guidelines and Terms of Service.</p>
<p>Beahm sued Twitch in response to the ban, and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/drdisrespect-banned-from-twitch-again">the case was settled in 2022</a> after a resolution found that "no party admits any wrongdoing."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-has-sold-over-one-million-units-since-launch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Korean game developer Shift Up held an IPO press conference today, <a href="https://www.khgames.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=229298" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealing</a> that its latest game, Stellar Blade, has sold over a million units since its late April launch. That's not very surprising, considering that the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-helldivers-2-npd-circana-april-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">topped the US sales charts&nbsp;that month</a>.</p>
<p>Once codenamed <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-eve-looks-stunning-in-first-playstation-5-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Eve</a> and announced for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, the game was later confirmed to be a PlayStation 5 exclusive published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. Its results are, therefore, all the more impressive for the availability on a single platform, not to mention that it's a brand-new intellectual property, which is inherently riskier than any established franchise.</p>
<p>The developers from Shift Up also shared some additional equally impressive figures. The Stellar Blade demo has been played more than twice compared to the demo of the highly anticipated Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. Moreover, the studio believes significant sales are still possible, and they will continue updating the game to keep players' interest high.</p>
<p>The long-awaited Photo Mode will be added with an update slated for August. New character skins for protagonist Eve will be released after October, and a 'large collaboration' is being prepared for late 2024. Moreover, Shift Up CEO Kim Hyeong-tae confirmed that the team is working on DLCs and the PC version, as previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-port-and-sequel-planned-confirms-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> (alongside a sequel, which is obviously further off in the future).</p>
<p><em>In the case of Stellar Blade, we created it to deliver a complete experience as a game created without considering purchasing additional content. As time goes by, we are identifying new needs and developing Stellar Blade. There is a possibility of developing paid DLC for elements such as external collaboration.</em></p>
<p>The game received a 9 out of 10 score in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> written by Kai Tatsumoto:</p>
<p><em>No butts about it, Stellar Blade is a marvelous feast for the eyes and a technically impressive action RPG. Those who find the hyper-sexualized Eve offputting will find little redemption in finding some modesty for the playable heroine, but at the same time, those already accustomed to the years following Bayonetta’s release and 2Booty memes will find the character designs enjoyable, to say the least. Stellar Blade is a fantastic action title and one PlayStation exclusive you’ll have to play after the kids go to bed.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/jet-set-radio-remake-footage-leaks-on-the-web/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-craxy-taxi-jet-set-radio-reboot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first rumors</a> from April 2022 that Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi were being brought back by SEGA, the Japanese publisher appeared during the last edition of The Game Awards to <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-revives-5-of-its-classic-ips-golden-axe-crazy-taxi-jet-set-radio-shinobi-and-streets-of-rage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirm</a> that those two franchises (in addition to Golden Axe, Shinobi, and Streets of Rage) would return as part of a big plan to revive SEGA's dormant IPs.</p>
<p>Today, some work-in-progress pictures and a brief video of a Jet Set Radio remake have leaked only. You can watch the footage in the embed below, although be quick—chances are SEGA may take it down sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>There are reportedly two Jet Set Radio games in production: a full remake of the first installment and a free-to-play live service reboot. Best manage the hype, though, as the current expected release window is 2026. Crazy Taxi is reportedly <a href="https://imgur.com/Kmb6xgr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following a similar schedule</a>, with a remake of the first game due in Q1 2026 and a free-to-play online multiplayer live service reboot slated by the end of 2027.</p>
<p><iframe title="Jet Set Radio in Dev Footage" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8QTSGtZYjcQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As for the Jet Set Radio remake, we know it will be an open world game. SEGA management previously said that players will be able to make friends, increase their fans, and create a movement. The game will once again be set in Shibuya, Tokyo, and characters like Beat, DJ Professor K, Gum, and Combo are returning.</p>
<p>With the last mainline installment now being 21 years old and still another couple of years left before the launch of this remake, fans might want to check out spiritual successors like <a href="http://wccftech.com/hover-revolt-gamers-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hover</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/bomb-rush-cyberfunk-the-funk-is-with-ya/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</a> in the meantime.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/logitech-g-has-a-new-gaming-keyboard-and-its-impressive/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Logitech G has <a href="http://logitechg.com/g515" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced its latest</a> gaming keyboard, the Logitech&nbsp;G515 Lightspeed TKL. It’s a low-profile and lightweight keyboard that Logitech is hoping sees as a jack of all trades kind of device.</p>



<p>Retailing for $139.99 wireless and $99 wired, the Logitech G515 TKL sits at just 22mm high with low-profile keys featuring switches with a 1.3mm actuation distance. The switches come in the form of tactile or linear.</p>



<p>“With the iconic G915 gaming keyboard, Logitech G delivered a first-of-its-kind low-profile<br>keyboard renowned for its exceptional quality, top-tier performance, and premium design<br>features. With the G515 low-profile design, we have pushed the boundaries even further,” Arnaud Perret-Gentil, Head of PC Gaming at Logitech G said.</p>



<p>“With the G515, we’ve maintained the sleek design while also including our latest technology innovations, such as LIGHTSPEED, LIGHTSYNC, and KEYCONTROL, to give gamers an advanced and high-performance gaming keyboard experience.”</p>



<p>Other features of Logitech’s newest gaming keyboard include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Lightspeed connection allows multiple peripherals on a single dongle</li>



<li>Tri-mode connection — Lightspeed, Bluetooth, wired</li>



<li>Layers for mapping allow for more custom key mapping up to 15 custom functions</li>



<li>Custom shortcuts, modifiers, and RGB lighting using the Logitech G Hub software</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-this-logitech-gaming-keyboard-is-a-comfortable-use">This Logitech Gaming Keyboard Is A Comfortable Use</h2>



<p>For the better part of the last week I’ve been using the Logitech G515 TKL keyboard, and to say it meets all of the marks you may be looking for in a keyboard would be an understatement. </p>



<p>Its low profile reduces the angle your wrists need to be at when typing, gaming, or anything really. It limits the stress you put them under, helping you enjoy longer playtimes. It’s not perfectly ergonomic, but that’s not something it claims to be. For what it does on that front, it does it really well.</p>



<p>The keys are responsive and feel great when I’m playing any time of game or writing this article. For what it’s worth, I was sent the G515 TKL with tactile switches. But I’m sure the linear feel just as good if that’s what you prefer. What makes them feel so nice are the pre-lubed switches and slightly concaved keys that make your fingers just fit and slide between presses seamlessly all over the board. It’s hard to describe just how smooth it feels without you using it yourself, but picture a hot knife going through butter, only better.</p>



<h6>READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/msi-raider-ge78-hx-review/">MSI Raider GE78 HX Review – As Powerful As It Is Big</a></h6>



<p>The battery life is advertised as up to 36 hours on a full charge. Like I said, I’ve used the keyboard for the last week as my main keyboard and I’ve only had to charge it once during that time. </p>



<p>The only real issue I have with the Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL is the lack of dedicated media controls and volume wheel. Most keyboards, even other TKL boards I’ve used over the last few years, have had a volume wheel and media controls. It’s not the end of the world to not include them, and it’s clear the decision was made to not have them in order to keep the low profile universal, but it still feels like a weird omission. You can still control media and volume through the function key, but it’s an extra step that’s I didn’t find necessary. </p>



<p>Overall, the Logitech G515 TKL is a solid gaming keyboard across the aisle, especially for the price.  </p>

<p><em>NOTE: Logitech provided a G515 TKL for the purpose of review/impressions.</em></p>

Luckily, since we're within 30 days, new members can take advantage of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Prime's 30-day free trial</a> and access the Prime Day discounts without subscribing. It's also worth noting that current students and everyone aged 18-24 can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime?primeCampaignId=studentWlpPrimeRedir&amp;tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">get six months of Amazon Prime for free</a>.</p><hr><hr><p dir="ltr">You also get to enjoy all the other Prime benefits, like access to Prime Video, Prime free shipping, free PC games each month, and more. Just be sure to cancel your trial membership before the free trial is over if you don't want to pay, or your account will automatically roll over to the monthly subscription.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of free PC games, Amazon revealed a selection of freebies outside of its normal monthly schedule alongside the Prime Day announcement. From now to July 11, Amazon will gradually unlock <strong>11 free games for Prime members</strong>. Once you claim them, they are yours to keep forever, even if your subscription lapses.

You can expect deals on everything from video games and gaming hardware, to Blu-rays, books, and more--though we won't know what specifically is on sale until deals are live. You can expect some <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primeday?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">early Prime Day deals</a></strong> to go live in the coming weeks, but the bulk of the sale items will only be available July 16-17.</p><p dir="ltr">As mentioned, Prime Day deals are exclusive to members, but there are many deals for non-members due to Amazon matching competing sales, such as Walmart's newly announced "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/walmart-announces-new-walmart-deals-summer-sale-event/1100-6524475/" data-ref-id="1100-6524475">Walmart Deals</a>," which will actually run prior to Prime Day on July 8-11.

<p id="7e50o5">Neither of these mushroom Pokémon see any use in raids, gyms, or PvP content. Their shinies are great, since they go from a spring coloring to a nice autumn red-yellow-brown.</p>
<h2 id="wepEXU"><strong>What is the shiny rate for Morelull in Pokémon Go?</strong></h2>
<p id="NElmhN">As per old research by the now-defunct website The Silph Road (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230423103325/https://thesilphroad.com/shiny-pokemon">Wayback Machine</a>), the shiny rate for Pokémon on a regular day is approximately one in 500. Morelull is not a confirmed Pokémon that gets a “permaboost” (meaning that it’s a rare spawn and thus gets a boosted shiny rate).</p>
<h3 id="TZ4GJv"><strong>What can I do to attract more shiny Pokémon?</strong></h3>
<p id="r3MqkW">Not much, unfortunately. It appears to be random chance. Shiny Pokémon catch rates are set by developer Niantic, and they are typically only boosted during special events like Community Days or Safari Zones, or in Legendary Raids. There are no consumable items that boost shiny Pokémon rates.</p>
<h3 id="thj8sX"><strong>Where can I find a list of available shiny Pokémon?</strong></h3>
<p id="WRj9xa">LeekDuck maintains <a href="https://leekduck.com/shiny/">a list of currently available shiny Pokémon</a>. It’s a helpful visual guide that illustrates what all of the existing shiny Pokémon look like.</p>
