		<p>Nintendo has revealed everything that will feature in the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2 Edition</a> upgrade for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/super-mario-bros-wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>, and confirmed that it will launch on 26th March 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="More fun is coming to the Flower Kingdom March 26th! (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-LgNT3oIw6Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Continuing their trend of making their game titles ludicrously long, “Super Mario Bros. Wonder – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park” will arrive with a bunch of added content for the hit 2D platformer.</p>
<p>Let’s break it down.</p>
<p>Starting with Bellabel Park, there’s two main plazas to explore with different gameplay offerings. The local multiplayer plaza features 17 co-op and competitive multiplayer games to try out, with up to four players able to take part, whether on a single console or through GameShare. The Game Room Plaza takes things even further with online and local wireless play and six different attractions. These are more ghost races, with up to eight players locally and twelve online.</p>

<p>The Toad Brigade is also found in Bellabel Park at Camp Central, giving you challenges to revisit the main adventure and, for example, race to collect all the coins in a level before time runs out. These can be played in 4 player co-op on one console. You’ll earn patches and rank up as you complete more challenges.</p>
<p>But there’s more! The Koopalings have returned and stolen the Bellabel flowers, spreading them across the Flower Kingdom and forcing you to go, track down the Koopalings and fight them.</p>
<p>Joining the platforming adventure is Rosalina for the first time, playable in both the main game and through Bellabel Park. Luma is also here, as a second player co-player, able to fly around, collect coins and spin attack at enemies – you can also use mouse controls for this. That’s alongside a new assist mode, which will stop you from taking damage and give you a propeller flower if you fall down a pit.</p>
<p>It’s a pretty significant expansion for the game, that’s for sure, and can be bought physically as a new release, or digitally with an upgrade available for existing owners.</p>
<p>I loved it with its original release. giving it a massive &lt;a href=”https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/18/super-mario-bros-wonder-review/”&gt;9/10&lt;/a&gt;, and saying, “Super Mario Bros. Wonder puts a fresh new spin on the classic Mario side-scroller with wild and trippy level transformations. It’s still Mario at its core, but it’s fun not knowing what to expect from each level. This could be the start of a bright new era for 2D Mario games.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nacon and Spiders have confirmed the full release date for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/greedfall-the-dying-world">GreedFall: The Dying World</a>, the game exiting early access and launching across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on 12th March 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="GreedFall: The Dying World | Release Date Trailer (Gameplay Overview)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UWuflAxciDE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new gameplay overview trailer runs through how the game has been designed, with a rich narrative to weave around your character, who has been ripped from the new world and taken back to the old, the companions that you can recruit, a look at the combat, and the blend of weapon and magical combat.</p>
<p>A good chunk of this is rather different to the original. GreedFall: The Dying World is a prequel to the first game, casting you as a Teer Fradee native, seeing how the colonial invaders are weaselling their corrupting ways into the land, before being whisked away from your home. A major difference is with the combat, which changes from an action RPG approach to the tactical pause style.</p>

<p>We recently had the chance to go hands on with an updated version of the game, and Steve came away much more intrigued than with his first attempt. He said, “All in all I was left far more impressed with this experience than my first try at the released build. Greedfall: The Dying World is very much an old-fashioned RPG in the style of Dragon Age: Origins and this change from the more accessible action combat of Greedfall may well still be make or break for the game and its original cohort of fans. There’s still time for the Early Access version to be developed with Spiders announcing that there will be news about the full release early in 2026, so as things stand I’d definitely encourage RPG fans to add the game to their wishlist and see how the final build turns out when we get a chance to play it.”</p>

<p>Kiki's Bakery Service</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Publisher Silver Lining Interactive and developer Sunny Lab are bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/witchs-bakery">The Witch's Bakery</a> to Switch 2 in addition <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witchs_bakery">to Switch</a>, with the cosy RPG arriving on both consoles in <strong>Q2 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Imagine opening a bakery in modern-day Paris — not easy, right? Well, as Lunne the witch, that's exactly what you're doing. But this slice-of-life adventure is more than just making Mont Blancs and macarons; being a witch, Lunne has the ability to see inside people's hearts and heal their emotions. Anyone getting some <strong>Kiki's Delivery Service</strong> vibes from the premise alone?</p>
<p>The game is split into three parts — during the day, you're running your bakery, fulfilling customer requests and managing a small group of staff. In the evening, you get to explore Paris, make friends, and also solve problems by using Lunne's aforementioned magical ability. At night, you can decorate your bakery, practise your magic skills, or just relax.</p>
<p>And all of these activities get your experience and money, as well as build relationships and make new friends. But Paris is also home to many shops and unique districts, so make sure you spend time running around the most beautiful city in the world.</p>

<p>And goodness, somehow we haven't talked about the beautiful hand-drawn visuals yet: The Witch's Bakery looks gorgeous, with 2D character models that look like they've come straight out of an anime on 3D-esque backdrops. Paris has never looked more stunning, we think.</p>
<p>In addition to a digital release, Silver Lining has also confirmed it will be releasing a physical version for both the Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions — the latter appears to be a Game-Key Card — for <strong>£29.99 / $34.99 / €34.99</strong>. Pre-orders are opening now <a href="https://direct.silverliningint.com/search?q=the+witch%27s+bakery&amp;options%5Bprefix%5D=last">on Silver Lining Direct</a>.</p>
<p>We know there's a lot of cosy games on Nintendo's consoles, but the visuals and unique mix of gameplay elements make The Witch's Bakery stand out to us. It looks lovely, and we can't wait to see more later in the year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 was the Best-Selling Game in the US for 2025, While Subscription Spending and Mobile Drove 1.4% Growth]]></title>

            <guid>1413178</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Circana</strong> executive director and video game industry analyst <strong>Mat Piscatella</strong> has published the final report for video game software and hardware sales in the US for 2025, and all of the work that <strong>EA</strong> and <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong> put in last year seemingly paid off, because <strong>Battlefield 6</strong> was the <strong>best-selling game in the US in 2025.</strong></p>



<p>It officially beat <strong>Call of Duty</strong> on the sales front, a feat that many doubted Battlefield could accomplish. Everyone thought it would give Call of Duty a good deal of competition, but hardly anyone (<a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-president-battlefield-6-boot-stomp-call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">save for <strong>Mike Ybarra</strong>, who, to his credit, called this outcome back in August 2025</a>) thought that Battlefield 6 would have the juice to really squeeze out Call of Duty on the sales charts.</p>



<p>Even with <strong>Black Ops 7</strong> coming out on top for the monthly sales for December 2025, it was still only able to reach fifth place overall for 2025 premium sales. <strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-thousands-dlc-checks-only-certain-conditions/">despite its performance struggles on PC</a>, had a strong enough launch that it was able to hold onto fourth place for the year. <strong>Borderlands 4</strong>, another game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-boss-borderlands-4-sales-softer-than-expected-poor-pc-release/">had performance issues at launch,</a> came in at third place, and <strong>NBA 2K26</strong> fell behind Battlefield 6 at second place.</p>



<p>Other notable entries on the software charts for the year are <strong>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</strong>, which is the only other non-shooter or annual sports game to make the top-10 alongside Monster Hunter Wilds. <strong>Ghost of Yotei</strong> just missed joining them as it fell to eleventh place on the year, but even that still shows how well <strong>Sucker Punch's</strong> latest was received. Lastly, we'd be remiss to not point out that, once again, <strong>Grand Theft Auto V</strong> was one of the best-selling games of the year, barely making the top charts in the number 20 spot.  </p>







<p>Strong as these software sales were, they were not what drove the US video game market to grow <strong>1.4%</strong> compared to 2024, with the market reaching <strong>$60.7 billion in 2025.</strong> That growth, according to Piscatella, came from <strong>mobile games</strong> and spending on<strong> hardware</strong>, namely the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, and <strong>subscription services</strong>.</p>



<p>But, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mczexudooc2v">as Piscatella notes in a separate post</a>, the increased spending wasn't necessarily driven by the number of people spending money on video games going up, but rather the price of everything, including subscription services, going up.</p>



<p>On the hardware side, the Nintendo Switch 2 was unsurprisingly the best-selling console in the US for 2025, reaching <strong>4.4 million units sold</strong> in the US for the year. <strong>PlayStation 5</strong> came behind the Switch 2 in second place for the year.</p>

<p>Bellabel Park, which gives the Switch 2 Edition of <em>Super Mario Bros.

It shares some functionality with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock">Nintendo’s Alarmo alarm clock</a>, but the Talking Flower seems more like a talkative companion for fans of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>First and foremost, as the name implies, the Talking Flower will just randomly speak a couple of times every hour when left alone with phrases like “sometimes it’s nice to space out,” and “is it weird for flowers to talk?” A single button on the toy can be pressed to trigger random thoughts on demand, or you can press and hold the button to silence the Talking Flower for a while. There’s music, too, and at launch it will support 11 different languages including English, Italian, and Japanese.</p><p>You can also set the Talking Flower to speak at specific times of day, such as greeting you in the morning or saying good night as you head to bed, and some of its random phrases are only triggered at specific times of the day. It’s got a built-in sensor so it can comment on the temperature in the room, and instead of using LEDs or a screen, the Talking Flower will just tell you when its batteries are running low. The toy will be <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260122688129/en/Discover-More-of-Whats-New-in-Super-Mario-Bros.-Wonder-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-Meetup-in-Bellabel-Park">available for preorder today</a> through the My Nintendo Store and other retailers, and is expected to release on March 12th, 2026.</p><p>Surprisingly, this wasn’t the only flower-related news from Nintendo today.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/fallout-s2-ep6-super-mutant-character-name-2000662226</link>
            <guid>1413160</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-finally-brings-back-two-classic-pieces-of-the-franchise-2000661833">latest episode of </a></span><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>season 2 unveiled a very neat surprise for longtime fans of the franchise. If you’ve yet to see it for yourself and want to preserve the mystery, this is your first and final warning to avoid reading this article and half of the internet.</span></p> <p><span>People are already <strong>spoiling</strong> episode six’s big reveal across social media, but, in truth, it’s more of a half-reveal. There’s a lot to unpack here, so for everyone who’s already caught up, let’s get started.</span></p>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-ron-perlman-s3-intro-sandwhich-war-2000660136"><span>So, Ron Perlman is finally in </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i></a><span>. He was spotted at the Los Angeles premiere back in December, he “no comment”-ed his way out of confirming his appearance in the show during FAN EXPO Canada in August last year, and his very distinctive voice could clearly be heard in the first official trailer for season two, so we all knew this was coming.</span></p>

 <p><span>The real surprise is who Ron Perlman is playing: a Super Mutant. While his stature and gravelly voice lend themselves to the role, the part that’s befuddling fans is the vague nature of his character’s actual identity. The fact that there’s no name listed anywhere for Perlman’s character (be that in the episode itself, its credits, Amazon Prime’s x-ray feature, or even </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt36116508/?ref_=nm_flmg_job_1_accord_2_cdt_epp_sm_1"><span>on IMDb</span></a><span>) implies that there might be some sort of big reveal in store for his identity later in the show.</span></p> <p><span>That could mean one of two things: said character has already shown up in a previous episode (in a human form), or it’s an existing character from the </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> games.</span></p>

 <p><span>If it’s the former, I think there are only two possibilities: Ron Perlman’s character is either Cooper Howard’s wife, Bard Howard, or his daughter, Janey. We saw a glimpse of their cryo pods in a previous episode, but we didn’t see their contents, so there’s certainly a chance (especially considering Barb seems to be involved with the Enclave). However, since Ron Perlmutant didn’t acknowledge any relation to Cooper in their meeting, this doesn’t seem too likely to me. Also, and more importantly, it would be far less entertaining to theorize about, so let’s put a pin in that for now.</span></p>

 <p><span>Instead, let’s break down the likelihood of Perlman’s character being from a previous </span><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>game and the evidence to support each of the potential characters he might be. I’m basing these hypothetical characters off of the ones listed </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fotv/comments/1qituva/so_who_do_we_think_this_is/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>in this thread</span></a><span> over on the r/Fotv subreddit, but I’ve also thrown in one of my own at the end (that I haven’t seen anyone else mention yet).</span></p> <h2><b>Marcus</b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000662229" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662229"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662229">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Let’s start with the most popular choice: Marcus, the 200-ish-year-old Super Mutant who first appeared in </span><i><span>Fallout 2</span></i><span>. Marcus is an easy pick for several reasons.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Firstly, we know he’s kicking about in the Mojave Wasteland, as he popped up in </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span> as the mayor of Jacobstown. He also helped found Broken Hills, the New California refuge for Super Mutants, ghouls, and everything in between. Perlman’s character referenced a similar outlook on ghoul/Super Mutant cooperation (Cooper-ation?) in his conversation with Cooper.</span></p>

 <p><span>There are two big issues with this theory, however. Marcus has a very visually distinct design from other Super Mutants, which Perlman’s character lacks: huge boil-like bumps that cover the entire left side of his face. He’s also voiced by Michael Dorn, of </span><i><span>Star Trek</span></i><span> fame, in both </span><i><span>Fallout 2 </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span>. I think the chances of the showrunners not bringing Dorn in to play Marcus in the live-action adaptation are extremely low, given how beloved his performance is.</span></p> <h2><b>Mean Sonofabitch</b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000662235" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662235"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662235">Bethesda</figcaption></figure> <p><span>We can apply a lot of the same logic from the Marcus theory to Mean Sonofabitch, the fan-favorite Super Mutant from </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span>. He’s extremely friendly, he’s been around long enough that he’s aware of the Enclave’s history, and he was last spotted in Jacobstown.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, even though it would be really, really funny if Ron Perlman were playing a guy called Mean Sonofabitch, the character’s speech impediment gets in the way of things here. Mean Sonofabitch’s tongue was cut out by a band of Super Mutant xenophobes over a decade before you meet him in</span><i><span> New Vegas</span></i><span>, and, in spite of his FEV-accelerated health regeneration, never properly healed. His speech impediment is permanent, and Perlman’s character doesn’t have one. Besides, what would be the point of changing the most distinct thing about such a fan-favorite character?</span></p>

 <h2><b>Neil</b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000662234" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662234"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662234">Bethesda</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Again, </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas’</span></i><span> Neil qualifies for all the same reasons that Marcus and Mean Sonofabitch do. Friendly, clever, formerly hail from Unity, and now reside in Jacobstown. However, unlike Marcus and Mean Sonofabitch, I don’t really have any evidence against him being Perlman’s character.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, Perlman’s character and Neil share something in common; they’re both seemingly a little more violent than your standard first-generation Super Mutant. Well, it actually might be more accurate to say that they’re a bit more violent than the other first-generation Super Mutants that don’t immediately kill non-Super Mutants on sight. The only true evidence I can give against Neil being Perlman’s character is Perlmutant’s lack of mouth straps. The canon is somewhat vague on the necessity of mouth straps, but (according to the Fallout Bible) some Super Mutants sport them because their upper lips are too heavy. This small detail aside, the Neil theory’s odds look half-decent to me.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Frank Horrigan</b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000662233" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662233"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662233">Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p><span>When you finally dispatch Frank Horrigan at the end of </span><i><span>Fallout 2</span></i><span>, his chest bursts open. Then he’s bisected at the waist. Then the pneumatic pressure caused by his suit malfunctioning separates his head from his torso. </span><i><span>Then </span></i><span>his corpse is consumed by a nuclear explosion.</span></p> <p><span>If Perlman is Frank Horrigan, I will livestream myself consuming a bloatfly slider.</span></p> <h2><b>Fawkes</b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000662236" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662236"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662236">Bethesda</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Fawkes is definitely a dark horse pick here, because there’s no real evidence to support his potential link to Perlman’s character. They’re both Super Mutants, and that’s where the theory starts and ends.</span></p> <p><span>However, there is one small, possible link here. Fawkes outright tells you in </span><i><span>Fallout 3</span></i><span> that his mind has begun to degrade over the years, and that he cannot remember who he used to be prior to his FEV exposure. It’s a stretch, sure, but perhaps this lack of an exact history makes him the perfect candidate for Perlman’s character, as it would give the writers something to work with (and not upset the canon enthusiasts in the process).</span></p>

 <h2><b>Rust King</b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000662228" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662228"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662228">Bethesda</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Here’s an interesting one: </span><i><span>Fallout 76’s </span></i><span>Rust King, a Super Mutant warlord and the main antagonist of the </span><i><span>Burning Springs</span></i><span> expansion.</span></p> <p><span>If you’re not familiar with the Rust King, then don’t worry– neither am I. That being said, after seeing this suggestion </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fotv/comments/1qituva/comment/o0wtuex/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>in the r/Fotc subreddit</span></a><span>, I’m partially convinced by it. For starters, Cooper Howard is introduced in the same </span><i><span>Fallout 76 </span></i><span>update that the Rust King is, and even tasks you with taking him down. The Rust King also has a nasty history with the Enclave, as he was once their prisoner. Plus, when you meet him, the Rust King states that he doesn’t have a problem with ghouls or humans, as long as they can help him to further his goals.</span></p> <p><span>Now, you might be thinking, if the Rust King and Cooper are enemies, surely Perlman’s character would have recognized him in the TV series. Funny explanation for that one: they never meet in </span><i><span>Fallout 76</span></i><span>, or at least haven’t so far.</span></p> <h2><b>The Vault Dweller</b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000662232" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662232"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662232">Interplay</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Hear me out, because this one is an original theory from yours truly. I know it sounds far-fetched, but I think there’s a genuine possibility that the Vault Dweller, the first protagonist in </span><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>history, and Perlman’s character may be one and the same.</span></p>

 <p><span>There are a million and one canon reasons as to why this one might not be true. For starters, the Vault Dweller is dead. That’s according to the intro of </span><i><span>Fallout 2</span></i><span>, which states that “he lived out the rest of his years” after founding the settlement Arroyo. That’s fifty-ish years before the events of the </span><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>TV adaptation.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Thanks to the Vault Dweller’s memoirs, a diary written by the Vault Dweller that’s included in </span><i><span>Fallout 2’s </span></i><span>instruction manual, we also know the exact canon choices he made during the events of the first game. This includes the ending where the Vault Dweller destroys the Master’s base and the FEV vats that it housed. Unfortunately (for my theory, at least), this means that the “Dipping” ending, in which the Vault Dweller willingly turns themselves into a Super Mutant, is non-canon.</span></p> <p><span>So why do I think there’s a chance that the Vault Dweller and Perlman might be the same person? It’s mostly circumstantial, but there’s enough here that I think it’s worth entertaining.</span></p>

 <p><span>To begin with, the bit about him living “out the rest of his years” is vague enough that I think we can ignore it. At the very least, I could easily justify it as him living out the rest of his </span><i><span>human </span></i><span>years. He also, oddly, refuses to detail his encounter with the Master, merely stating that he couldn’t bring himself “to write of this discovery.” Even stranger still, he finishes his memoirs by implying that certain details within it could be false. “That is my story, and I am sticking to it,” he writes at the memoir’s conclusion.</span></p> <p><span>Perlman’s character drags Cooper to a literal church. The followers of Unity, the Master’s mutant cult, go by the name the Children of the Cathedral and operate out of a church called the Cathedral.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The followers also don bright purple robes. “Walking among the misshapen ones, I killed one of their servants and took his clothing,” states the Vault Dweller in his memoir. Perlman’s character wears a robe that looks suspiciously similar to these, except they’re black. I don’t think it’s a stretch to say that they could have darkened over the decades he’s worn them.</span></p>

 <p><span>Now, I’m not saying that the ending in which the Vault Dweller dips himself in FEV is canon. The events of </span><i><span>Fallout 2 </span></i><span>and every <em>Fallout</em> game beyond it confirm that it’s not. But what if he sought out the FEV in his later years? What if, in that conversation that he refuses to elaborate on, the Vault Dweller came around to the Master’s way of thinking? After all, there are dialogue paths during the Vault Dweller’s conversation with the Master that allow you to entertain (and even partially agree with) his philosophy on forced human evolution, yet ultimately still decide to oppose him.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The Vault Dweller even states in his own memoirs that he’d changed after this point: “I screamed. I cried. Slowly I came to realize that the Overseer may have been correct. I had changed. Life outside the Vault was different, and now I, too, was different.”</span></p> <p><span>Ron Perlman has been with</span><i><span> Fallout </span></i><span>since its inception. He’s narrated almost every intro and every ending slideshow in every canon </span><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>game. What if he’s not just some faceless, unknown narrator, but instead…the very first protagonist of the entire series, recounting the history of the Wasteland through the eyes of a near-immortal Super Mutant body? Just a fun thought. It’s probably that Rust King guy, though.</span></p>

              <p>Despite being a huge critical and theatrical hit in 2025, Ryan Coogler’s stunning horror movie <em>Sinners</em> somehow left the Golden Globes without recognition for its acting or directing. However, it looks like Hollywood has an opportunity to redeem itself: the film has just received a record-breaking 16 Oscar nominations, including nods in most of the top-tier categories.</p> <p><em>Sinners</em>, one of the smartest horror movies ever made, tells the story of identical twin brothers Elijah (Smoke) and Elias (Stack) Moore (both Michael B. Jordan), a pair of WWI vets and criminals returning to their hometown of Clarksdale, Mississippi in 1932 after seven years of robbing the mob in Chicago. In the Jim Crow South, the brothers buy an abandoned sawmill and open it as a jazz joint for the Black population of the town, but find themselves and their club entwined in some deeply complex supernatural shenanigans that involve Robert Johnson-like blues abilities, vampires and vampire hunters, and the all-too real horror of the Ku Klux Klan. It’s a breathtaking work from the <em>Black Panther</em> director, and despite its Golden Globes snubbing it looks far better set to receive the awards it deserves from the Academy.</p>

 <p><em>Sinners</em> was nominated for seven Golden Globes, including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director and Best Screenplay in the Drama category, but won not a single one of them. It did come away with gongs for Best Original Score and the peculiar booby prize of Cinematic and Box Office Achievement. (Deserved, of course, given it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/sinners-box-office-original-live-action-200-million-1851780478">the first original movie to make over $200 million domestically since 2017</a>.)</p> <p>When it comes to March 15’s Academy Awards, the prospects are looking far better. No film has ever received 16 Oscar nominations before, indicating judges are already pretty enamored. Here’s the full list of&nbsp;<em>Sinners</em>‘ nominations:</p>

 <ul> <li>Best Actor in a Leading Role – Michael B. Jordan</li> <li>Best Actor in a Supporting Role – Delroy Lindo</li> <li>Best Actress in a Supporting Role – Wunmi Mosaku</li> <li>Best Casting – Francine Maisler</li> <li>Best Cinematography – Autumn Durald Arkapaw</li> <li>Best Costume Design – Ruth E. Carter</li> <li>Best Directing – Ryan Coogler</li> <li>Best Film Editing – Michael P. Shawver</li> <li>Best Makeup and Hairstyling – Ken Diaz, Mike Fontaine and Shunika Terry</li> <li>Best Original Score – Ludwig Goransson</li> <li>Best Original Screenplay – Ryan Coogler</li> <li>Best Original Song – ‘I Lied To You’, Raphel Saadiq and Ludwig Goransson</li> <li>Best Picture – Zinzi Coogler, Sev Ohanian and Ryan Coogler</li> <li>Best Production Design – Hannah Beachler and Monique Champagne</li> <li>Best Sound – Chris Welcker et al</li> <li>Best Visual Effects – Michael Ralla et al</li> </ul> <p>Competition remains stiff at the 98th Academy Awards, and the list of Best Picture nominations gives you the best idea of the movies that could pip&nbsp;<em>Sinners</em> at the post:</p> <ul> <li><em>Bugonia</em></li> <li><em>F1</em></li> <li><em>Frankenstein</em></li> <li><em>Hamnet</em></li> <li><em>Marty Supreme</em></li> <li><em>One Battle After Another</em></li> <li><em>The Secret Agent</em></li> <li><em>Sentimental Value</em></li> <li><em>Sinners</em></li> <li><em>Train Dreams</em></li> </ul> <p>It’s a very pleasingly eclectic list, and it’s likely that Timothée Chalamet could spoil Michael B. Jordan’s chances for Best Actor, given the Oscars’ reputation for&nbsp;<em>so&nbsp;</em>many factors, such as recency bias, an aversion to so-called “genre” films, and the fact that the Academy really seems to struggle with giving trophies to non-white actors.&nbsp;<em>Marty Supreme</em> and&nbsp;<em>One Battle After Another</em> seem the most likely rivals in the list.</p>

 <p>Horror movies, like anything that’s not a straight-laced drama, do have a far harder time getting deserved acclamation, so even setting this record for the most nominations&nbsp; is already a huge achievement. That it’s been achieved by a Black-led movie from a Black director with a predominantly Black cast makes it even more so. Could this finally be the year when the Oscars are not quite so white?</p>

<p>You might have to clap clap for YAPYAP when all is said and done in 2026. It has the potential to be one of the year’s big multiplayer titles, and you’ll be kicking yourself if you weren’t on board with YAPYAP’s release date sooner.</p>



<p>Joining a hype train halfway through is fun, but it’s better when you’re seated from the start. YAPYAP could be <em>that</em> game, and follow in the footsteps of memorable 2025 indie multiplayer hits like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/repo-collaboration-fortnite-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REPO</a> and Peak.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-yapyap-coming-out-release-date-explained">When Is YAPYAP Coming Out? Release Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s throwing everything into the pot. Credit to Maison Bap</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>February 3 is the confirmed release date for YAPYAP, and it follows the success of the demo.</strong></p>



<p>Yes, YAPYAP has been in existence for a while, and many have already tried out its co-op carnage via a free Steam demo. The testing and trialing are over now, as it’s time for YAPYAP’s full release date.</p>



<p>The official announcement arrived on January 19, when Maison Bap had a message for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3834090/view/217994805837303225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Hey everyone! We’re happy to announce that&nbsp;YAPYAP officially launches on February 3rd&nbsp;Thank you to everyone who took the time to play the demo. The feedback we received was invaluable and allowed us to make significant improvements across the entire game, refining systems, fixing rough edges, and expanding on what worked best.”</p>
</blockquote>







<h2 id="h-what-is-yapyap">What Is YAPYAP?</h2>



<p><strong>Maison Bap’s YAPYAP is a multiplayer game that blends teamwork, horror, and all-around silliness to create another entry in the popular online co-op genre.</strong></p>



<p>Now, you can play YAPYAP by yourself, but these games are always better with someone else to shout at or BE shouted at by—we’re all friends here. Among Us and Lethal Company really popularized this genre of people working together online, invading a location, grabbing resources, or recording footage, and trying to get them out while avoiding monsters.</p>



<p>YAPYAP is just that, only this time, you can all cast spells by actually saying them out loud into your microphone. You can create projectiles, turn your friends into tiny people, use Crystal Balls to guide your way, and literally fly around the castle.</p>



<p>Think of Harry Potter, only Harry, Hermione, and Ron remain unruly children forever and intend to cause as much mayhem as possible.</p>



<p>Check out the full launch trailer right here.</p>

            <p>Creepy archive-searching deduction game TR-49 has had the best launch of any of Inkle's many games, the studio revealed today, meaning it sold better than games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heavens-vault-review-a-rich-web-of-possibility">Heaven's Vault</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/a-highland-song">A Highland Song</a>, which took longer and far more resources to make.</p>
<p>"TR-49 is our best launch, ever, in 14 years," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jon.inkle.co/post/3mcyz4wpwtk2r">Jon Ingold, the creator of TR-49 and co-founder of Inkle, wrote</a>. "I admit I'm surprised!</p>
<p>TR-49 was made quickly, in nine months, he said, mostly as an experiment to learn open-source game-making engine Godot. It was also "an excuse to play with some actors", he added, highlighting the game's performative side that Inkle's text-based games usually feature only lightly. TR-49 is partly an audio drama.</p>
<p>"One thing I think IS cool," Ingold continued: "it's a 'one-sitting' game. 4 hours; $7. No commitment required." And one huge upside of that is "people SEE THE END!", Ingold wrote. "This is huge for me, personally."</p>
<p>It's a success that may affect the studio's future output, though it's worth pointing out that Inkle has done short games before. Overboard! and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/expelled-an-overboard-game-review">Expelled!</a> are both short, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-highland-song-review">A Highland Song</a> isn't what I'd call long. Nevertherless, I'm sure Inkle is considering using this one-sitting approach again.</p>
<p>"If we're going to make that a sustainable model we might need to be able to make things a little bit quicker, but I love the basic concept of 'compact games'," Ingold said.</p>
<p>TR-49 is a game about searching an archive in a strange machine, looking for things that don't exist in the outside world any more. It's a code-related deduction game, really, as you search around looking for clues for codes that will reveal hidden secrets within. It's really good. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tr-49-review">I gave TR-49 four stars in my Eurogamer review</a>.</p>

<p>Out alongside Meetup in Bellabel Park on Switch 2</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Bros. Wonder – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park</a> is coming out very soon — as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/super-mario-bros-wonder-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park-arrives-on-switch-2-in-march">just announced</a> on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> — but that's not the only upgrade coming to the 2023 GOTY-nominated platformer.</p>
<p>Three brand new amiibo will be released on the same day as the Switch 2 upgrade, <strong>26th March 2026</strong>. The line-up features Elephant Mario, Poplin &amp; Prince Florian, and Captain Toad &amp; Talking Flower. Yes! Captain Toad <em>finally</em> has an amiibo!</p>
<p>Prices haven't been announced yet, but given the increase as of the Switch 2 generation, they'll likely be on the more expensive side. Here's a little look at them:</p>

<p>What do they do in-game? They'll give you free power-up items if you scan them in while you're in any course.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Greedfall 2: The Dying World Will Launch Out of Early Access In March 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/greedfall-2-the-dying-world-release-date-march-2026/</link>
            <guid>1413118</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Publisher <strong>Nacon</strong> and developer <strong>Spiders</strong> have announced that <strong>Greedfall 2: The Dying World</strong> will launch out of early access and into its definitive <strong>1.0 version</strong> this coming <strong>March 10, 2026,</strong> on PC, and two days later, on <strong>March 12, 2026,</strong> it'll arrive on <strong>PS5</strong> and <strong>Xbox Series X/S</strong>.</p>



<p>The news comes alongside a new gameplay overview trailer that digs into the different core aspects of Greedfall 2: The Dying World, including the game's story, the companions you'll meet along the way that fill out your adventures, combat, crafting, and more.</p>



<p>Greedfall 2: The Dying World launched in early access on PC on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-ii-the-dying-world-releases-september-24-in-early-access/">September 24, 2024</a></strong>, and has seen some major updates in that time, namely its largest one yet back in <strong>November 2025</strong>, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-2-the-dying-world-gets-largest-early-access-update/">added a new region to explore, a new companion, and an overhaul to combat</a>.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="GreedFall: The Dying World | Release Date Trailer (Gameplay Overview)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ggjI-RnrnQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Even though major updates like the aforementioned November 2025 update brought some much-needed overhaul, the game continues to struggle to gain any traction. An issue not helped by <a href="https://wccftech.com/spiders-management-respond-to-allegations-made-by-stjv/">allegations of internal issues at Spiders</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-developer-lays-off-most-animation-team/"><strong>layoffs</strong> that hit the studio</a> months ahead of the one-year mark for The Dying World's early access release.</p>



<p>Wccftech checked out Greedfall right when it launched in early access in September 2024, and while there was a core to the game that was fun to play, so much of it was an unfinished and janky mess. <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-2-the-dying-world/">At the time, we even went so far as to say that it <strong>wasn't ready for an early access release</strong></a>. A feeling that was clearly shared by players, as noted by its negative reviews on Steam at its early access launch, and unfortunately, even recent reviews still cite major issues.</p>



<p>So far, Spiders has proclaimed that the early access version is only the first third of the game. Hopefully, with the other two-thirds and another major update that comes along with its 1.0 version, it can gain some forward momentum. We'll find out when it arrives on <strong>March 10, 2026</strong>, on PC and on <strong>March 12, 2026,</strong> on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to regular cards for adorable 'mons like Vanillite and Pumpkaboo, as well as new Trainer cards like the Retreat Cost-lowering Peculiar Plaza and the Energy-sapping Piers.</p><p>As for that new mechanic, Stadiums are "a new type of Trainer card that can turn the tide of battle", according to The Pokemon Company.

            <p>Often, the gaming internet depresses me with *gestures expansively*, but sometimes, it delights me with some relatively specific and impassioned Thing like, in this case, a single-player aerobatics sim dedicated to formation flying. Created by Japanese indie CloveTek, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dancing-wings-the-aerobatic-simulator">Dancing Wings – The Aerobatic Simulator</a> is as far from yer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ace-combat-8">Ace Combats</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/delivery-must-complete-is-devil-may-cry-for-ace-combat-pilots">Delivery Must Completes</a> as you can get while still having wings. A bunch of wise guys have tagged it “Automobile Sim” on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3728180/Dancing_Wings__The_Aerobatic_Simulator/">the Steam page</a>, but ignore them! I expect they're just sore about never having performed a genuine Immelmann turn. Here’s a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>And here’s the gist: you fire up the game as one pilot and complete a fancy manoeuvre of some kind. Then you save a replay and start over as a second pilot, alongside the first. Then you save a replay and start over as a third – etcetera. Up to six planes can be flown in this way. You’ll also be able to share replays with other players, challenging them to keep up with your loop-the-loops and boop-a-doops and all the rest of that death-defying razzle-dazzle.</p>
<p>There have been display flight sims before - games like 2017’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/635430/Blue_Angels_Aerobatic_Flight_Simulator/">Blue Angels Aerobatic Flight Simulator</a> or 1985’s <a href="https://www.bbcmicro.co.uk/game.php?id=283">official Red Arrows game</a>,
for BBC Micro - but they’re not exactly as abundant as roguelites. I know about this one because CloveTek have emailed to say they’re showing it off at Tokyo Game Dungeon 11 in February. I fear Ziff Davis are not going to expense a trip to Japan for a demo, not even if I argue that flying over in an actual Red Arrow would be an amazing bit. If you’re at TGD next month, by all means corner the developer and ask whether the planes really dance. </p><p>Dancing Wings will release sometime in October 2026. While the game’s singleplayer focus sounds restful, I do wish this had a multiplayer mode. After all - if it were multiplayer, we could put together an RPS aerobatics team. Picture the dashing aces of the Rock Paper Arrows hunkered over the video feed at Ground Control, after failing to skywrite “PCGamer sucks big bubbly beaver balls” for the sixth time running. “You’re ahead again, Julian,” says Flying Officer James Archer. “You’ve made us write ‘PC games’ instead. We’ll be a laughing stock!”</p>
<p>“I am not AHEAD,” retorts Wing Commander Julian Benson, his handlebar mustache quivering with indignation. “YOU are all BEHIND. And if that was a Reverse Half Cuban Eight, young Archer, then I am Manfred von Richthofen.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-drops-the-galaxy-tab-s10-lite-with-its-biggest-discount-of-the-year-while-ipad-prices-stay-frozen-2000661993</link>
            <guid>1413103</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Lite offers a lot in a compact tablet, including a 10.9-inch LCD, an included S Pen for note-taking, a long-lasting battery, and USB-C charging. Inside, the tablet features 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of internal storage, giving you enough space to run multiple apps and their associated data. Battery life is also quite impressive, with the Galaxy Tab S10 Lite offering up to 16 hours of video playback. When you do need to charge the tablet, the USB-C port provides fast charging, and you should be able to get the battery from empty to nearly full in less than 2 hours.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6099/">You can pick up the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Lite on Amazon for only $280, which is $70 off the standard price of $350, for a 20% savings.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6099/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A powerful tablet perfect for every use case</h2>
<p>The Galaxy Tab S10 Lite’s 10.9-inch LCD provides a large viewing area while keeping the tablet relatively light and portable. In addition, the display’s brightness automatically adjusts based on the ambient lighting conditions where you are using the tablet.</p>
<p>The Exynos 1380 processor and 6 GB of RAM provide plenty of power for running demanding apps, including video games, social media, and streaming services. While 128 GB may seem like a small amount of internal memory, it is actually sufficient for most tablet users’ needs. However, if you need more space, it also includes a microSD card slot that supports microSD cards up to 2TB.</p>
<p>An included S Pen stylus lets you create handwritten notes and drawings directly on the screen. The S Pen delivers high precision for creating and editing digital content, which is ideal for writing short reminders, drawing simple diagrams, and highlighting text in documents.</p>



<p>Beyond running apps, the Galaxy Tab S10 Lite also includes a range of advanced AI-based features. One example is the Circle to Search option. When enabled, this lets you draw a circle around an item on the screen and instantly view relevant information about it. In addition to search capabilities, you also get AI-based tools for translating text, refining and organizing handwritten notes, and reducing redundant steps within supported apps.</p>
<p>You can connect the Galaxy Tab S10 Lite to your other devices and the broader Galaxy ecosystem using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Through these connections, you can answer smartphone calls from the tablet, transfer ongoing documents and projects between devices, and control compatible smart home devices using the SmartThings Map View feature.</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Lite delivers a strong mix of features and performance at an affordable price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6099/">At $280, down from its regular price of $350, it offers a cost-effective way to enjoy a large, high-quality 10.9-inch display, long battery life, S Pen support, storage expansion via microSD cards, and Galaxy AI features.</a></p>

Separately, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-beyond-good-evil-2-survives-ubisofts-project-purge/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider Gaming</a> has reported that the project is indeed still alive today, as the dust settles.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On reddit, Beyond Good &amp; Evil's long-suffering fans have reacted to the sequel's survival by calling it "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondgoodandevil/comments/1qj77ye/ubisoft_just_canceled_six_games_and_delayed_seven/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">miraculous</a>", "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondgoodandevil/comments/1qjenil/its_insane/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">insane</a>" and simply "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondgoodandevil/comments/1qjs15h/too_big_to_fail_ubisoft_is_in_too_deep_with/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">too big to fail</a>."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's insane this game is still in production and survived," dan_in_his_own_way wrote. "Don't get me wrong, I want to play it but the cancelation of the Price of Persia remake hit really hard. A project that would arguably cost them less and require less resources than Beyond Good &amp; Evil." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Beyond Good and Evil 2 will survive World War 3," quipped Travguard. "But it still won't be out by the armistice," added meathappening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One fan, 33Sharpies, pointed to the likely financial implications of Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 ever being canceled, at which point Ubisoft would have to write down the cost of its gargantuan development. While the project is still alive, however, it can still be listed as an ongoing asset. (Insider Gaming has reported that the project has been valued internally as having now cost over $500 million, though that figure is unverified.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Beyond Good and Evil 2 Concept Art</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 is believed to have originally begun early development in 2007, with series creator and Rayman mastermind Michel Ancel and his Ubisoft Montpellier team on board. Over the coming decade, development was mostly paused while Montpellier worked on other projects, but Ubisoft re-announced the game with fanfare in 2017 and showed off an in-engine concept featuring space flight and designs to feature multiple solar systems and planets. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, however, development struggled — and the project was further impacted by Ancel's departure from Ubisoft and the sad death of its subsequent creative lead Emil Morel. But the last couple of years have seen work coalesce once more, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-has-a-new-narrative-link-to-beyond-good-evil-2">the sequel's characters given intriguing cameos in the new Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition</a>, while a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beyond-good-and-evil-2-gets-new-creative-director">new creative director</a> — former DICE and King veteran Fawzi Mesmar — has come on board to steady the ship.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 still lacks any word of a release date — and may well have been one of the titles Ubisoft delayed to receive further polish yesterday. As of now, however, it remains alive — however improbable that may seem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

"This patch is deploying some important updates to suppressed weapons, allowing Helldivers to eliminate threats with reduced detection and tighter tactical control. Expect quieter kills, cleaner engagements, and new opportunities for coordinated strikes before the enemy knows you’re there. Remember: stealth is a tool, not a substitute for overwhelming firepower. Use it wisely, Helldivers!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arrowhead suggests Commando missions — which send you "deep behind enemy lines where the normal reliance on air superiority is no longer an option" — are a good place to start with these new tools, teasing "reinforcements have to be deployed in advance and destroyer support is a risky business with limited time."

            <p>Arknights: Endfield, a new gacha action game released today, has temporarily halted PayPal transactions after multiple players were charged real money for in-game purchases they didn't make.</p>
<p>Some users quickly took to online community hubs like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Endfield/">the Arknight Endfield Reddit</a> show payments made on their PayPal accounts which they didn't authorise. Some screenshots include payments made in various global currencies, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Endfield/comments/1qjijsy/random_paypal_account_linked_to_my_account_i_just/">with some claiming that other player's Paypals were being registered to their fresh account</a>. The exact cause of this bug has not been confirmed as of writing by the developer Hyperglyph.</p>
<p>One user, Impossible Clover 818, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Endfield/comments/1qjs62z/did_anyone_get_refunded_for_the_paypal_nonsense/">created a post</a> on the Endfield Reddit titled: 'Did anyone get refunded for the PayPal nonsense yet? My whole balance got wiped'. They claim that £1,200 was "wiped" from their Paypal account, and less than an hour ago <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Endfield/comments/1qjs62z/comment/o11d2pt/?context=3">had been prompted to provide real-world identification</a> to access the account, due to 'suspicious activity'.</p>

<p>In a statement made <a href="https://x.com/AKEndfield/status/2014188503891099888">on the official Arknights Endfield social media account</a>, a statement explains that Hyperglyph is aware of the problem, and that it affects "a small number of purchases" made via PayPal, and that was an "inconsistency between the order and item delivery". It then asks impacted players to contact the company via email, and to provide their account server and ID for a refund.</p>
<p>The statement goes on to assert that all refunds are expected to be resolved "within four hours". Given it was posted 15-minutes ago as of writing, this should hopefully be resolved in short order.</p>
<p>When contacted for comment prior to this social media post, a representative of Hyperglyph provided the following to Eurogamer:</p>
<blockquote><p>We want to sincerely apologize to everyone affected by the PayPal payment issue that occurred shortly after launch. We understand how upsetting and concerning this kind of situation can be, especially when it involves purchases and personal payment details.</p>
<p>Here's what we want to clearly share with you:</p>
<ul>
<li>All affected PayPal purchases will be fully refunded. We've already begun processing refunds for impacted orders.</li>
<li>We do not store players' payment information. Payment details are handled directly by PayPal and are not saved in our systems.</li>
<li>This issue only affected some players on certain platforms when using PayPal. As soon as we became aware of the problem, we disabled PayPal payments within roughly two hours of launch to prevent any further impact.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the moment, PayPal payments will remain unavailable while we continue to investigate the root cause together with our partners. We won't re-enable the payment option until we're confident the issue has been fully resolved.</p>
<p>We're truly sorry for the stress and inconvenience this caused, and we're grateful for your patience while we work through this carefully. If you have additional questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us directly.</p></blockquote>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/22/bladesong-early-access-review-forge-your-own-adventure/</link>
            <guid>1413061</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I do feel as though I was born in the wrong era. For all that there was no medicine, that you brushed your teeth with twigs, and pillaging was a daily possibility, the simple, arable life that existed in medieval England still sounds like a lot less pressure than the modern day. Working the fields or raising livestock would be popular choices, but blacksmithing must have been the top pick at medieval careers day. Particularly for the less sporty kids who couldn’t swing a sword.</p>
<p>For all those ideas, Bladesong’s opening is somewhat more high-pressure than I was expecting. You awake on your deathbed. The elderly woman who’s nursing you pours water down your throat, and you find yourself selecting your own backstory, telling her where you’ve come from, what you carry with you, and what drives you to stay alive. Is it ambition, continuity or compassion that you believe in?</p>
<p><iframe title="Bladesong - Official Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EVZrvOBVEdU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Bladesong’s narrative plays out as an old-school text adventure would, giving you prompts to choose from as you awaken, remembering your past and setting forth on a new beginning. It definitely tickled away at my gaming memory, selecting the option to ‘Get your bearings’ and being told, “You’re in a tent. There’s no sign of your caretaker, apart from a half-empty water pail and a damp cloth on your brow.” This is absolutely what games were like when I first discovered them, and that literary edge is put to good use in Bladesong’s opening, forming a clear vision of its fantasy medieval world and your place within it.</p>
<p>You are a blacksmith. A half-dead one, but a blacksmith, nonetheless. Each day, you’re offered a selection of commissions, and you’re able to choose which of these you take on, with new ones coming in the next morning. Each commission uses up resources, including Action Points, Steel, Leather and Wood, depending on the task set out in front of you. Alongside the cost, commissions also make specific requests about the type of blade you forge, and you have to try to make something that matches their specification.</p>


<p>The first customer that approaches you wants a sword that’s two-handed, asking for something, “Good and long. I don’t like my enemies to be in hugging distance.” There’s no other requirements here, but later commissions might ask for a sword that hits hard, or one that’s viciously sharp. You then select abilities to start shaping the blade.</p>
<p>You start each sword with a billet, a chunk of steel, that you then have to physically hammer and mould into shape. You select the right ability, and then hammer away with repeated clicks of the mouse to bash it into the correct form, with clicks at the top of the hammer’s apex resulting in harder blows. One after another, you hammer out the length, then flatten it to the right thickness and width, before shaping the end into a point and working on the blade’s cross section.</p>

<p>Once you’ve got the blade into the correct shape, you need to add a hilt, a grip and a pommel, because, well, a sword without those things looks silly. That, and it’s much harder to hold. There’s various options within each of these additions, so you can tailor your wickedly sharp creations to both the owner and your own tastes as well.</p>
<p>Each commission has its own narrative context, and you begin to build a picture of this mud-strewn, dangerous place that you start the game in. As a new blacksmith, you slowly build up your position within the encampment, attempting to make your way into the city beyond, though your business model may cause the odd moral quandary when your customers are definitely going to shove your creations into another person’s gut.</p>
<p>Each time you complete a commission, you earn a portion of XP, and as with all good RPGs, once you’ve got enough you’ll level up. This then grants you skill points, which you can plough into the smithing skill tree, giving you access to advanced smithing, the ability to engrave your creations, or even start to work with curved blades. You can see all of these options from the off, so if there’s a particular creation you have in mind, you can choose to work your way along that branch before testing the others.</p>

<p>If you want to see the kind of things you’ll eventually be able to create, the Creative mode immediately gives you every single one of Bladesong’s tools and attachments to play with. There’s three pre-built examples for you to lovingly spin around in 3D which you can dismantle as well, swapping out parts and making changes as you see fit, before embarking on your own design project. If you attempt this at an early point in the Campaign’s narrative there’s a daunting array of options, but as you become more proficient, you’ll soon learn how to construct your perfect sword. The UI mostly does a good job of supporting you in that effort, though there’s a few rough edges to polish up through Early Access, like being able to easily apply different materials to your blade.</p>
<p>The painterly artwork for each location really helps set the scene, and they shift in front of you ever so slightly to make it feel as though you’re actually looking at them. It’s surprisingly effective, and a clever way for a smaller team to manifest a bigger, living world. The swordmaking display is similarly straightforward: an anvil, hammer and blade existing within a black void. I’d love to see this develop through Early Access into specific places, viewing your commissions in situ within your tent, or possibly founding your own smithy as you progress, but it definitely works well as it is.</p>
<p>ughij</p>
<p>There’s something very compelling at work in Bladesong. The sense of desperation, danger and destitution run through the opening hours of the Campaign with alarming force, and in some ways the smithing and swordmaking is simply the means to explore and experience more of this world. I love the writing, and the classic adventure threads that run through each moment really help to pull you onwards.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s the smithing sections that let you truly embody a medieval craftsman, and Bladesong gives you the physical and narrative tools to decide exactly who that craftsman is. You learn to balance your own creativity with what your customers want, and as you become more proficient with a hammer, you forge your own place in Bladesong’s world. It makes for a unique, thoughtful and utterly engaging experience that’s bound to find a legion of fans.</p>

<p>Rosalina Returns</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>After its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park-has-been-rated">rating</a> earlier this month, Nintendo has today given us another look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Bros. Wonder - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup In Bellabel Park</a>, accompanied by a release date of <strong>26th March</strong>.</p>
<p>The new trailer showcases a bunch of new features that will be arriving in the 2023 platformer. First up is the Game Room Plaza, a location for some multiplayer mayhem which will offer six different 'attraction' minigames to be played either locally or online with up to 12 people.</p>
<p>The Toad Brigade occupy a new area called 'Camp Central', where you can participate in training challenges to hone your skills, earn patches, and raise your Brigade ranking.</p>
<p>The trailer also gives us another look at the Koopalings! These notorious baddies have stolen the Bellabel Flowers and scattered them across the map, so add that to the list of collectables as you make your way across the levels.</p>
<p>And speaking of familiar faces, Rosalina is available as a playable character in this Nintendo Switch 2 Edition! You can even control a Luma as a 'co-star' in co-op, where Mouse Mode is an option.</p>

<p>As if that wasn't enough, the trailer wraps up with the big reveal that three (yes, <em>three</em>) Wonder amiibo will be launching alongside the Switch 2 Edition on 26th March — Prince Florian fans, rise up!</p>

<p>In practice, some Steam reviewers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997660/GreedFall_The_Dying_World/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">beg to differ</a>. <em>GreedFall 2 </em>has amassed a Mixed rating across over 500 reviews since its Early Access launch, and even more recent opinions point to what players perceive as game-breaking bugs, unfinished systems, and iffy optimization.</p><p>Of course, there's a good chance that Spiders and Nacon can turn around <em>GreedFall 2 </em>and fix its issues in time for launch in March; there are, after all, two months between now and then, which should be enough time to at least iron out some of the more troubling-sounding problems.</p><p>However, given that Spiders was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spiders-layoffs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1d57ded4-a6cf-40e0-93cb-59588606ff42" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs in July last year</a>, the studio is operating at a reduced capacity compared to when <em>GreedFall 2 </em>launched, so you might want to temper your expectations accordingly if you're going to pick the game up on PS5 or Xbox.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with <em>GreedFall 2: The Dying World</em>, it is, as the name implies, the sequel to the 2019 RPG <em>GreedFall</em>, although it's actually a prequel.</p>
<p><em>GreedFall 2 </em>once again revolves around notions of colonialism and exploitation; this time, you're playing as a Teer Fradee native, who must navigate political intrigue and deadly fauna across the open world of Gacane.</p><p><em>GreedFall 2: The Dying World </em>is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997660/GreedFall_The_Dying_World/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and it's coming to <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010517" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/greedfall-ii-the-dying-world/9P2SLNTMLJ2Q" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a> on March 12th.

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/report/865219/ubisoft-reorganization-ea-playstation-big-games</link>
            <guid>1413049</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Ubisoft is making some massive changes to its business: As part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/865060/ubisoft-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled-reorganization">a reorganization</a>, the company will focus its efforts on the big open-world games it’s famous for along with live service titles, and it has canceled six in-development games, including <em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</em>. It’s all part of a recent trend of the industry’s biggest publishers, including companies like EA and Sony, making fewer but bigger games to avoid risk.</p><p>Under its new structure, Ubisoft games will be developed by five “Creative Houses” focused on specific genres and franchises. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/789721/ubisoft-vantage-studios-subsidiary-assassins-creed-far-cry">previously announced Vantage Studios</a>, for example, will develop Ubisoft’s biggest franchises to “turn them into annual billionaire brands,” including <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, and <em>Rainbow Six</em>. Other Ubisoft studios are focused on competitive shooters, live service games, fantasy and narrative-driven “universes,” and casual games.</p><div><p>“What we’re seeing is a classic risk-aversion strategy”</p></div><p>Ubisoft’s press release lists a lot of familiar series that will live under these studios, including <em>The Division</em>, <em>Ghost Recon</em>, <em>Splinter Cell</em>, <em>Just Dance</em>, and <em>Prince of Persia</em>, despite the <em>Sands of Time</em> cancellation. Even <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em>, the sequel to which has been in development for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/14/15801280/beyond-good-evil-2-preview-michel-ancel-interview-e3-2017">well over a decade</a>, is included. But Ubisoft says that there are just four franchises that are actually new in development — and that it canceled three franchises in the works — indicating it plans to rely more on familiar brands instead of branching out. In addition to canceling games, the new structure has also meant the closure of several studios and will likely <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3mcxcxiwki22r">lead to more layoffs</a> in the future.</p><p>This structure puts more pressure on these games to be successful, as shown by the catastrophic failure of PlayStation’s <em>Concord</em>. That game, which was in development for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-was-in-development-for-roughly-eight-years-firewalk-dev-confirms">about eight years</a>, was <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290">reportedly expensive to make</a> and didn’t catch on right away. As a result, Sony <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234909/sony-concord-ps5-shutdown-poor-sales-launch-pc">took the game offline</a> just two weeks after it launched, and a few weeks later, it permanently shut down the game and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">developer Firewalk Studios</a>. Ubisoft obviously wants to avoid those kinds of fiascos, and by banking on known games and franchises, it reduces the risk of a bomb. And games that probably won’t be a smash hit, like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/667061/ubisoft-prince-of-persia-remake-release-date-by-april-2026">years-in-development <em>Sands of Time Remake</em></a>, seem like they won’t be a major part of the strategy moving forward.</p><p>“What we’re seeing is a classic risk-aversion strategy,” Joost van Dreunen, a New York University games professor who also <a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/">writes about the industry</a>, tells <em>The Verge</em>. “When markets get choppy, large publishers retreat to what they know works: their established franchises. It’s a rational response to uncertainty, but it comes with real costs,” he adds, like recycling proven franchises instead of developing new experiences and potentially raising prices to justify big-budget sequels. “This strategy might work for publishers with deep catalogs of beloved franchises, but it’s not a guarantee of survival,” van Dreunen says. “It’s more like buying time than building a sustainable future.”</p><p>Ubisoft’s shift is similar to what we’ve seen from other big gaming companies. EA, even before the announcement of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/787112/electronic-arts-55-billion-privacte-acquisition-pif-silver-lake-affinity-partners">$55 billion deal</a> to take the company private, had been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/787723/ea-private-deal-buyout-future-games-layoffs">focusing more</a> on tentpole franchises with big online communities, like <em>Battlefield</em>, <em>EA Sports FC</em>, and <em>The Sims</em>. After <em>Battlefield 2042’</em>s rocky launch, <em>Battlefield 6</em> was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/795232/ea-battlefield-6-hit-launch-deal">a pivotal moment for the series and EA</a>, and it was also a huge undertaking, developed by multiple internal studios. That bet seems to have paid off as the game has been a massive hit, with EA proclaiming it to be “the best selling shooter game” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/825171/battlefield-6-had-a-big-launch-month">of 2025</a>. Like Ubisoft, EA has smaller franchises, like <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em>, but it has also whittled down its library, canceling <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/675923/black-panther-cancelled-cliffhanger-studios-shut-down-ea">a <em>Black Panther</em> game in development</a>.</p><p>Sony is similarly focusing its efforts into fewer games that largely fall in two distinct groups. While Sony has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23953640/sony-pushes-back-its-live-service-game-ambitions">scaled back</a> its live service ambitions and weathered <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345575/sony-god-of-war-bluepoint-games-bend-games-canceled">some failures</a>, live service games are still a key pillar for the company — it even announced a new studio <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/662579/team-lfg-playstation-studio">last year</a> that’s spun out of <em>Destiny</em> maker Bungie. Meanwhile, Sony is also continuing to push the big-budget single-player exclusives that have become so closely associated with the PlayStation brand. Its known projects in the works include expansive single-player games that build upon what their developers did before: Housemarque’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/843302/housemarques-next-game-is-getting-a-small-delay"><em>Saros</em></a> follows up the well-received <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408468/returnal-ps5-dualsense-3d-audio"><em>Returnal</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/611201/sony-playstation-5-ps5-wolverine-gameplay-trailer"><em>Marvel’s Wolverine</em></a> is the next game from <em>Spider-Man</em> maker Insomniac, and <em>The Last of Us</em> developer Naughty Dog is hard at work on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24320197/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-trailer-game-awards-2024"><em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em></a>.</p><p>In Wednesday’s press release, Ubisoft cofounder and CEO Yves Guillemot summarized the problem the AAA market is facing: It’s more competitive, has higher costs, and has greater challenges, but successful games have “more financial potential than ever.” The company, like many others, is making the bet that refocusing on bigger and known brands that are released on a more regular cadence will be a more stable business. That path may prove successful, but it’s also one saddled with issues, from lost jobs to less creative innovation. The future of blockbuster games is unclear, but it will be full of familiar faces.
