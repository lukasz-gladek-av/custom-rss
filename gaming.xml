		<p>Super Mario Party Jamboree is a bit of a tautological title, but it’s also the perfect way to describe this latest Mario Party game. There’s just more party in it! More maps, more characters, more mini games than in any previous mainline entry. At the third attempt on Switch, it feels like Nintendo Cube (formerly Nd Cube) have finally cottoned on to what series fans have been saying all along: just give us more, and don’t mess with the formula.</p>
<p><iframe title="Super Mario Party Jamboree – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKp9cD4e8ac?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, you can’t really blame a developer for trying to iterate and add new ideas to such a long-running series, but it’s fair to say that the various experiments in the 2010s just didn’t land. Players moving together in a car, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/10/03/super-mario-party-review/">character specific (and smaller) dice</a>, free movement without set paths, they just didn’t scratch the itch that fans of the N64 and GameCube games had. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/28/mario-party-superstars-review/">Mario Party Superstars</a> was, in many ways, the answer to this – “You want old stuff? Have some old stuff!” – remaking classic boards, bringing back 10-side dice, and remaking a bunch of classic minigames.</p>


<p>Now Super Mario Party Jamboree is carrying that on. It is essentially the same gameplay as before, but with new boards, new minigames, both button and motion controls, and some new twists on online multiplayer as well.</p>
<p>There’s also more characters than ever. A total of 22 playable characters are available to choose from, with a whole host of Bowser’s minions filling out the usual roster, as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgNfiHcQqHk">Pauline and Ninji</a>, who are completely new for the series.</p>


<p>There’s five new boards and two remakes in Super Mario Party Jamboree, and we went hands-on with Mega Wiggler’s Tree Party. As is typical, players roll a die and move between 1 and 10 spaces on their turn, visiting stores, triggering events, and choosing the path to travel down as you race to reach a star on the map. After all the players have had a go, it cuts to a minigame, which is the main place to earn coins to afford those stars and items –&nbsp;again, items are fairly standard, with the main wrinkle we spotted being that there’s now two types of warp pipe: a green random one and a gold ‘move to Star’ one.</p>
<p>For Mega Wiggler’s Tree Party, there’s three main routes –&nbsp;a small loop, a main loop and then an extended branch off that –&nbsp;as well as the option to take a path along Wiggler’s back as a shortcut. The risk there is that other players can land on event spaces that see Wiggler move and completely throw you off course.</p>
<p>It’s a fairly straightforward board, but there’s still things like piranha plants that will snap at you and steal more money for each player they catch, and a game of chance where you try to extract honey from honeycombs, and hope you don’t trigger the bees.</p>

<p>The 110 minigames in Super Mario Party Jamboree will cover all bases with both button controls and motion controls represented, and a mix of free-for-all and team-based modes. There’s some great ones, like teams trying to cut steaks perfectly in half, and revisited ideas, like a player hiding in one of four slots while the others try to find them…. with hammers. The 3v1 minigames are always difficult to balance, and it’s fair to say that some still stack the odds way in the favour of the solo player, or the party of three. Still, it wouldn’t be Mario Party if there wasn’t some arbitrary nonsense!</p>
<p>If you just want a quick dose of Mario Party shenanigans without having to sink at least an hour into playing a full board, then there’s plenty of ways to get straight at the minigames, such as with the Daily Challenge. This offers up themed collections of three minigames to quickly race through, such as Minigame Munchies featuring cookie cutting and avoiding gigantic sandwiches as they fall from the sky, with players earning stars for each round they win.</p>

<p>These days you need to have online multiplayer, though, and thankfully Super Mario Party Jamboree builds on the options featured in the last two games. You can play a full board in online multiplayer, which is always welcome, but there’s snappier online modes alongside this.</p>
<p>The Koopathlon sends up two 20 players into a race of minigames, with each coin that you earn during a round sending you running around the track. Every few rounds, you’re then confronted with a showdown against Bowser as you try to avoid or outpace hazards he sends your way –&nbsp;like hopping over fireballs shot from the side of the screen –&nbsp;and with a penalty that will send you back a certain number of spaces depending on if and how long you survive for. The first player to complete five laps wins, which will keep you occupied for a good long while!</p>
<p>Then there’s the cooperative Bowser Kaboom Squad mode for up to eight players. There’s an imposter Kaiju-sized Bowser stomping around, with some other minions like Charging Chucks alongside for good measure, and you have to take him down. How do you do that? Well, crates of bombs are dropping from the sky and you need to go grab them and load up a cannon to deal damage, all while time ticks down for a coop minigame round, and the chance to earn some bonus items. You have to defeat Bowser within 5 rounds, which could be easier said than done!</p>

<p>For one thing, the coop minigames can be pretty tricky, like trying to collectively walk on in time to outpace a Wiggler, and Bowser’s stomping can knock people out so they need to be recovered from bubbles. Running around the stage is simple enough, but the camera controls are minimal if playing with a single Joy-Con, as all you can do is turn the camera to face the cannon, which can leave large parts of the map and incoming danger out of sight. It’s still good and frantic fun, though.</p>
<p>Like a second serving of a tasty jambalaya, Super Mario Party Jamboree is more of the same, but in all the right ways. There’s still some experimentation with the online multiplayer modes, but the core board game experience is being kept intact, and there’s that extra 10% on top.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/popucom-preview-colorful-cooperation</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/popucom-preview-colorful-cooperation.975681/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/popucom-preview-colorful-cooperation<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Hypergryph, known more for its hit gacha title <em>Arknights </em>than anything else, is doing something completely new with the upcoming title <em>Popucom</em>. There's no gacha in sight, nor is it a mobile game -- it's a premium title that is, inside and out, its very own thing.</p>
<p>When we checked out <em>Popucom </em>at PAX West 2024, it was a surprise, to say the least. I came in with little knowledge on the title besides its cooperative <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/astro-bot-review-90s-platformer-done-right">platformer</a>, color-matching premise, but I left wanting to learn (and play) much more. With <em>Popucom, </em>fun is guaranteed.</p>

<h2><em>Popucom </em>- Part Matching Game, Part Platformer</h2>
<p><em>Popucom</em> has a delightfully simple concept executed so wonderfully. Take elements from color-matching games like <em>Zuma's Revenge</em>, a dash of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/splatoon"><em>Splatoon</em></a>, and make it co-op. It's a game that requires a minimum of two players with a maximum of four, so friends are mandatory, but that just makes it even more fun.</p>
<p>I played my <em>Popucom</em> demo with a developer, and across several levels I was able to grasp the basics of this game's premise. Playing two-player co-op gives you the ability to shoot two different colors -- so I was assigned blue and green. A simple button press shifts your color instantaneously. My partner had two other, different colors.</p>

<p>As a platformer, you'll traverse stages with plenty of obstacles, and those obstacles also have assigned colors. At one point, my companion and I are on a moving platform and barriers block the way; each barrier is colored differently, so we have to alternate shooting these blockades with the correct color so we don't fall off.</p>
<p>This is just a very simple objective, but as one can imagine, <em>Popucom</em>'s gameplay can (and will) range in complexity. One level had us use a shield ability, which blocked beams of a certain color. In blocking these, your friend doesn't get zapped by the beams and we can proceed through the stage. You're also able to raise the shield like a platform, to the uses of these tools are multifaceted.</p>

<h2>Blast Enemies Away in <em>Popucom</em></h2>
<p>There's also combat in <em>Popucom</em>, and you'll fight blob-like enemies comprising different colors. Some enemies are singular blobs, and so you'll shoot them twice to add another blob on top of it a la <em>Zuma's Revenge </em>(or any other color-matching type game), which defeats them. It becomes a bit more complex when you fight enemies composed of multiple blobs and all four colors.</p>
<p>These cartoonish monstrosity's require a bit more precision with your shots and fall apart piece by piece in such a cool way. Of course, if you miss and shoot the wrong color at the wrong blob, the enemy grows bigger. This can be a bit tricky for someone who is colorblind such as myself, but I'm told there will be accessibility options for this on launch.</p>
<p>The final part of my <em>Popucom</em> demo had me fight against a gigantic snake. Its long body is made of these colored orbs-- so of course, we shoot the corresponding color at them -- but things get a bit more tricky when the boss shot out colored obstacles that needed to be nullified with a shot.</p>

<p>Eventually, we hop on this roller coaster and follow the snake through the crowds as it shoots projectiles at us -- which, you guessed it, we need to shoot -- and eventually we whittle away the boss's body and defeat it.</p>
<p>I find it's a bit difficult for me to find the words to describe <em>Popucom</em>'s gameplay, which is strange for such a simple concept. Rest assured, it's one of those games that once you see it, you'll understand immediately. <em>Popucom</em> concocted a formula for the perfect cooperative experience, and I can't wait for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/super-mario-party-jamboree-preview-you-should-be-excited-for-mario-party.975675/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/super-mario-party-jamboree-preview-you-should-be-excited-for-mario-party<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With just how formulaic and rigid <em>Mario Party</em> is, I wouldn’t blame you for feeling a bit along the lines of “played one, played them all.” I think <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree </em>is going to change some minds, however.</p>
<p>While at PAX West, I got a little over an hour with the game and got to play a few of the games modes, including checking out the classic Party mode of collecting stars around the boardgame.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for that classic mode, that’s where <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree </em>will certainly feel the most familiar. We spent the least amount of time on it, and it’s going to be pretty much what you think it is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously, a lot of the mileage for<em> Mario Party</em> is just how much you enjoy the various minigames, of which I did have a good time. They’re bite-sized, and I did find myself enjoying quite a few more than I thought.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In one, you and a partner must align to cut a large piece of steak in half. The catch is, many of them aren’t symmetrical, so you have to make as good a guess as you can.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m not sure why, but seeing a high definition, very real looking giant slab of perfectly cooked steak next to a Boo and a Goomba is very funny.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Super Mario Party Jamboree’s Online Modes Are Very Fun&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The most unique, and new, parts of <em>Jamboree </em>were in two new online modes we got to check out. They both mix up the<em> Mario Party </em>formula enough to make even minigames you’ve played before feel fresh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first we tried was Koopathlon. In Koopathlon, you and 20 people compete by completing the same minigames, seeing who can do the best in them. It’s a bit of a race in that you’re completing laps around a huge track, which is something like 100 spaces long. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Each minigame you move forward, or back, a certain number of spaces depending on how well you do (or coins you collect). There’s even a leaderboard that looks near identical to Mario Kart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Koopathlon is not simply just playing some minigames and seeing who does the best, either, as there are some quirks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the Koopathlon takes place over multiple rounds, you’ll actually play the same three minigames each round. However, each round that same minigame gets more difficult.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In one, I had to shoot myself out of various cannons to collect coins in the area. The further the Koopathlon went along, the more complex the coin patterns, cannon movements, and obstacles in my way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other minigame I have to shoutout just has you push objects into a chute. Toys and stuffed animals stacked up to then just be poked over an edge and fall over. Genuinely the most satisfying gameplay from my weekend at PAX West.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The minigames have items you can get, a la <em>Mario Kart</em>, that let you get in the way of your of one of your opponents, too. Things like inking your opponent’s screen so they can’t see.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ramp ups in the minigame difficulty were great, as some minigames definitely have a unique enough concept to see it used in more than just the one way. It was like playing a few games at once, competing against a bunch of people level by level.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other quirk is that at the end of each round is a Bowser-themed minigame that you have to try to survive or you’ll be sent back spaces in the race. The higher your ranking, the more you lose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Often, these are hard to survive, and only two of the twenty, usually some CPU characters, survived. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In one, you’re trying to keep ahead of Bowser who keeps destroying a platform as you run towards a screen. In another, you had to avoid standing on the wrong tile before it disappeared or be dropped to your doom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These can be a good equalizer and avenue for you to mount a comeback if you’re behind. The punishments to those in the top rankings aren’t so devastating they almost guarantee you’ll be behind, like a blue shell, but they make catching up more achievable for those behind.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Kaboom Squad is Cooperative Mario Party&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The other online mode is for up to 8 people. It sees you pitted against a "Imposter Bowser" in an attempt to defeat him. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The main part of the mode has you running around a map avoiding the giant while attempting to collect bombs to put in a cannon. Once you collect enough, they’re fired off to damage Bowser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the round ends, a cooperative minigame involving the 8 players begins.</p>

<p>An example of one in ours is that one half of the team was collecting apples to make juice while the other half collected the packages to load up a delivery truck. It’s simple on the surface, but there is definitely efficient and proper ways to do it to have the best results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on how well your team does, you’ll get the opportunity to select some items to help against Bowser. One allows you to place pads that increase your run speed on the map, another increases the amount of bombs you carry, and so on down the line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The more damage down to Bowser, the more difficult the rounds you’re trying to avoid him and collect bombs become. It’s a nice ramp-up of challenge that gets genuinely difficult and will be impossible without teamwork.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kaboom Squad is great cooperative fun done well. The 8 player minigames are thoughtful, and you'll never find yourself sitting around waiting for something to do.</p>

<p>As with all things <em>Mario Party</em>, my only big concern comes with the staying power of the game. The regular party mode, with its betrayals and chaos with friends, always has a certain allure no matter what.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, These two new modes, Koopathlon and Kaboom Squad, rely pretty heavily on the minigames and will be as enjoyable as you find those to be. Will there be enough variety to keep people interested? We don’t quite know yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then there’s the pesky issue of Nintendo Online. It’s come a long way, so hopefully this has a good implementation. Thankfully, in the case of at least Koopathlon, the minigames are played solo but just the results are shared. So, that shouldn’t run into some issues.</p>
<h2>Super Mario Party Jamboree Preview | Final Thoughts&nbsp;</h2>
<p>I walked away enjoying <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em> a lot more than I thought. The minigames were quirky and fun, the new modes a refreshing way to take in the minigames, and its as charming as you’d expect any Mario game to be. &nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em> is the first time I’ve been excited for a <em>Mario Party</em> game in a very long time.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-capcom-staffers-birdkin-hideaki-saori-utsumi<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ex-Capcom staffers and sound designers Hideaki and Saori Utsumi have announced Birdkin Studio, a new two-person husband-and-wife indie outfit based in their native Japan.</p>
<p>Per the <a href="http://www.birdkin.com/Welcome.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">studio's new official website</a>&nbsp;(which is charmingly simple), the studio is a small one; "just Hideaki Utsumi and Saori Utsumi", as the description goes. They're currently working on their debut title, which will be released for Switch and PC via Steam.</p>
<p>No details about the game are available just yet (apart from one piece of artwork which may or may not be indicative of the final product), but if you want to keep up with Birdkin's progress, you can do so via the <a href="https://x.com/birdkinstudio" rel="noopener" target="_blank">studio's official X (formerly Twitter) account</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-hideaki-saori-utsumi-birdkin.jpg?itok=rfv8TNMN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-hideaki-saori-utsumi-birdkin.jpg?itok=Wxqscmz_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hideaki and Saori Utsumi's credits include franchises like&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>,&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry</em>, and more.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the site, Hideaki Utsumi will serve as a game designer, sound designer, and composer for Birdkin, all of which are also roles Saori will take on. In addition, she'll be a CG artist and programmer for the studio.</p>
<p>If you feel that Utsumi's name is familiar, then you may have seen some videos of the couple's adorable birds, of which they have four: Gumi, Kiwi, Kohaku, and Lemon.</p>
<p>Utsumi's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsS33cJqqykG3bM7gGDEulg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>&nbsp;is chock-full of videos of the birds and the chaos they create. In particular, Gumi, a red and green chattering lory, is well-known for his distinctive "wuewuewue" catchphrase. If you haven't seen it, I heartily recommend checking it out for a big lift to your day.</p>
<p>Saori also has two YouTube channels: one for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXkxH0sZml2Jy7vmXayAWuw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">her music</a> and one on which she posts <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzC-DBjubG__KmShLv1EULA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">videos of the couple's birds</a>. The videos are mostly in Japanese, but they're well worth a watch to get a sense of what she's about.</p>

<p>The Utsumis aren't the first ex-Capcom staffers to fly the nest, so to speak (although neither of them has worked at Capcom for quite some time).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Others include&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi, who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-capcom-producer-founds-new-studio-at-netease">founded his own NetEase-funded studio in 2022</a>, and Hideaki Itsuno, who <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/famed-dragons-dogma-and-devil-may-cry-director-hideaki-itsuno-leaves-capcom-after-30-years" rel="noopener" target="_blank">left Capcom recently</a> after over 30 years with the company.</p>
<p>We'll bring you more on what the Utsumis get up to next as soon as we've got it. Stay tuned!</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/abiotic-factor-connectivity-dev-pledge-fix</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/abiotic-factor-devs-promise-fix-for-connectivity-issues.975669/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/abiotic-factor-connectivity-dev-pledge-fix<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>developer Deep Field Games has acknowledged one of the game's major ongoing connection issues and has pledged to release a fix in time for the next major Community Update.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/ABFGame/status/1832997878647963853" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>X (formerly Twitter) account, Deep Field provides some steps to try out if you're experiencing the "Fleming" error - or, indeed, any other error - when trying to join a friend's&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>game.</p>
<p>The steps are pretty simple; either get the host and clients to restart <em>Abiotic Factor</em>, or have the host player restart their entire PC. It doesn't seem like client players need to take this step, however.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/abiotic-factor-connectivity-issues-machine.jpg?itok=ky49rsx7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/abiotic-factor-connectivity-issues-machine.jpg?itok=8EnFjoDB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you're having connectivity issues in&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor</em>, rest assured Deep Field is aware of the problem.</figcaption></figure><p>Deep Field says that if neither of these fixes work for you, then a "long-term fix" is also in the works, and it should be implemented by the time Community Update 2 rolls around.</p>
<p>We don't know quite when that will be just yet, but as a reminder, Community Update 1 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/abiotic-factor-update-dynamic-difficulty-more">launched back in May</a>, just three weeks after&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>itself was released. It added features like difficulty tweaks, save backups, and more.</p>
<p>Recently, however, Deep Field did provide a first look at what's coming when Community Update 2 does arrive, and it'll bring features like difficulty options during world creation, new aquarium items, and more storage options.</p>
<p>Community Updates are not seemingly on the same level as major content drops like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/427410/view/4340992597637826894" rel="noopener" target="_blank">August's Crush Depth update</a>, but that makes them the perfect home for fixes like the one in the works for the aforementioned connectivity problem.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>is, it's a survival-crafter set in an underground research station overrun with paranormal horrors.</p>

Larian didn't intend on players having access to this much, as CEO Swen Vincke told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/baldurs-gate-3-mod-support-GDC-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a> in March 2024 that Baldur's Gate 3's mod support wouldn't be as extensive as the one released for Larian's previous game, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/divinity-original-sin-ii">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>.</p><p>This was because its "tools are very complicated" so Larian instead focused on things it knew players wanted to mod. "Not all tools are going to be shipped, because we wouldn't be able to support them," Vincke said.</p><p>Only time will tell what players do with both the official mod support and now the unofficial unlocked version. Baldur's Gate 3 captured the attention of fans to such an extent that it's still a regular topic of conversation one year later, despite it being a predominantly single-player game with no expansions.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Players are already hard at work too, as Vincke revealed on <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1832324806777172376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a> more than a million mods had been installed within 24 hours of the Toolkit's release.

Not exactly sure what you're getting all hot and bothered about. Very happy to see games I've worked on referenced in this way”). But they are also unsurprising, given his previous comments on Sony’s treatment of Days Gone and the sequel that never happened.

As it turns out, Godot's open-source foundations created an environment where voting on updates to the engine was a million times easier to manage than software for porting to proprietary consoles. In a conversation at Gamescom 2024, Jones, Verschelde, and Linietsky laid out why Godot hasn't possessed any porting capabilities up to this point, why the team formed a separate company to develop the necessary tools, and how these challenges will impact the future of the increasingly popular game engine.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Open-source engines like Godot can't publicize propriety code">Open-source engines like Godot can't publicize propriety code</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's a little bit of "fine, I'll do it myself" at the heart of W4 Games. Verschelde and Linietsky explained to Game Developer that the company is structured like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.redhat.com/en">Red Hat</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It's a developer of Godot-friendly tools for corporations that both provides critical professional services and acts as a liability shield between platforms and developers.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/godot-founders-had-desperately-hoped-unity-wouldn-t-blow-up-" target="_self">Godot founders had desperately hoped Unity wouldn't 'blow up'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The pair said they hadn't set out to make such a corporation as Godot's userbase grew. They'd hope someone else would pick up the slack...but then no one did, and Unity's Runtime Fee catastrophe sent a huge number of developers scrambling for new solutions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So the pair—who are intimately familiar with Godot and recruited a team of programmers familiar with all major consoles—set up W4 Games. Nothing is stopping anyone else from setting up a similar company, but now the pair can get developers shipping on consoles as soon as possible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers unfamiliar with the nuances of porting may still ask why these tools weren't built into Godot directly. According to Linietsky, there were two reasons: liability, and use of resources.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The liability angle is a critical point. Godot is an open-source engine, and console platforms are built on "completely closed" technologies guarded by strict non-disclosure agreements. "Here's a simple example," he said. "Imagine somebody gets some GPL license code into the engine, then a company uses it and makes a game and publishes on PlayStation—and the GPL licenses say they have to be open source, but consoles are completely secret."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This will do a lot of damage to a company like Sony, Nintendo, or Microsoft, and then the person who put that in there. The person or company that published that is going to have to take on a massive amount of liability."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers working on proprietary engines, as well as the teams at Unity and Unreal, build close relations with console manufacturers to ensure their games are optimized on the various platforms. If the Godot Foundation took on that liability itself, it could leave the nonprofit in a precarious state.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That wouldn't be the only challenge the Foundation faced. If it had to pay the salaries for W4's (deservingly well-paid) engineers, that would be money it couldn't devote to features at the core of the engine, and a large amount of work would have to be done to protect the interests of console makers in the future.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As with other companies licensing Godot, W4 will be able to share some technical solutions back with the community, and help further the engine's core development. It's already working with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel Snap</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer Second Dinner </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/marvel-snap-developer-second-dinner-working-on-most-ambitious-godot-game-yet-">on its next game</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and the developer has publicly pledged to support the engine.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What does it mean for Godot's founders to run a for-profit company?">What does it mean for Godot's founders to run a for-profit company?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers uncomfortable with Verschelde and Linietsky's dual roles at W4 Games and on the Godot Foundation board have legitimate concerns—concerns so valid the duo raised them in our conversation without prompting. If they, the founders of Godot, who sit on the board of the nonprofit, are operating a for-profit company, aren't there concerns about conflict of interest?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Possibly. Some developers may nurse that concern for a long time. The pair explained they don't intend to abuse this connection, but more importantly, they and other Godot Foundation members laid groundwork to make sure W4 is never the "owner" of Godot.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Godot Foundation itself has strong conflict-of-interest policies, they said, and it already takes an open-source, community-driven approach to engine updates. W4 Games has promised to bring as many tools as it can back to the open-source community, only keeping the proprietary tech protected by NDAs locked behind closed doors.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But if something were to go wrong, the pair hope that Godot's open-source nature will be what keeps it from crashing and burning. "If the Foundation were to become corrupt or something, [developers] would just fork the project and start another foundation," said Linietsky. "There isn't any real risk of a commercial company taking over."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Jones added that W4 Games wants to mirror the Godot Foundation's mission and "democratize" porting and other development tools as much as possible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However you slice it, Verschelde and Linietsky have taken on a lot of responsibility in the game development community, shepherding in a popular new game development tool and assuming the task of expanding its commercial viability. It will take a steady set of hands and clear-eyed view of software development to make sure the fruits of their labor don't turn sour.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/5-things-to-pick-up-from-aaa-studios<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content" data-testid="featured-image"><p><span>Image via Christina Morillo.</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The world of game development offers both challenges and solutions for indie developers. However, certain practices adopted by AAA studios indie creators can learn and follow to stand out.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As Studio Head at Larian, I am responsible for running the UK studio of Larian Studios to help deliver the best RPGs which is our mission. In this article, I will discuss the five aspects, including quality of production, community engagement, iterative development, narrative-driven approach, and post-launch updates. These areas have plenty to pick up for Indie game developers and creators from AAA studios.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Focusing on Production Quality Matters"><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Focusing on Production Quality Matters</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">High production values come by default and are one of the first aspects of AAA games. This involves three main elements that work together: polished graphics and cinematics, strong art direction, and high-quality sound design. These all contribute to the overall presentation, which helps create impactful experiences for gamers. Here are the elements involved in production quality:</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Polished Graphics"><span>Polished Graphics</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While AAA titles are known for their visually striking presentations, indie developers can achieve a similar impact by focusing on meticulous attention to detail. The success of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hollow Knight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by Team Cherry exemplifies how careful art direction and sound design can result in a visually stunning game, despite the constraints of indie development. Leveraging accessible tools like Unity and Unreal Engine, along with high-quality assets and a memorable style, allows indie teams to maintain high standards without the need for extensive resources.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Art Direction"><span>Art Direction</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rather than aiming for hyper-realistic graphics, which can be resource-intensive both for developers to make and players to run, indie developers can focus on a unique and consistent visual style. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Undertale</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by Toby Fox is a prime example where well-executed pixel art and memorable character design significantly contributed to the game's charm and appeal. By sticking to a consistent and unique visual style, indie games can establish a unique identity in the market.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Sound Design"><span>Sound Design</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Investing in solid sound design and a standout soundtrack can make a noticeable impact on the player's experience. Indie developers might consider collaborating with emerging musicians and aspiring talents with a vision to enrich their game's audio landscape.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By honing these elements, indie developers can achieve production values or rather the impact that rivals those of AAA titles, offering players polished and immersive experiences.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Community Engagement is Key"><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Community Engagement is Key</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">AAA studios invest heavily in marketing and community building long before a game’s launch, creating anticipation and securing a strong player base from day one. While indie developers may have smaller marketing budgets, they can still learn from this approach. Early marketing is crucial. For instance, Eric Barone began building </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stardew Valley</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> community through developer blogs and forums years before its release. By sharing development updates, screenshots, and progress reports, he generated significant interest and anticipation among gamers. Here’s how to get your community involved:</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Marketing"><span>Marketing</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Regular updates on social media platforms like X, Facebook, TikTok and Instagram keep the community informed and excited — especially when they are combined with Steam for developer updates. Discord and Reddit are also helpful for direct interaction with fans, providing valuable insights into their preferences and feedback. For instance, the developers of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Among Us</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by InnerSloth used social media and an active community to keep the game popular long after its release.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Crowdfunding"><span>Crowdfunding</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kickstarter and Indiegogo can also help build a dedicated fanbase, not just secure crowdfunding. Successful campaigns often include detailed project descriptions, development timelines, and frequent updates to backers, which contribute to creating a dedicated community. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shovel Knight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by Yacht Club Games successfully used Kickstarter to raise funds and build a committed fanbase eager to follow the game’s development.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Regular Updates and Feedback"><span>Regular Updates and Feedback</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Engaging with players through regular updates and feedback loops is essential. Early access programs, beta testing phases, and demo releases offer valuable insights and help refine the game based on player feedback. Supergiant Games successfully used this approach with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hades</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, iteratively improving the game based on community feedback during its early access period on Steam.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Iterative Development and Playtesting Pay Off"><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Iterative Development and Playtesting Pay Off</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">AAA studios often rely on iterative development processes, where games are refined through cycles of planning, execution, and evaluation, allowing for continuous improvement based on playtesting and feedback. Indie developers can greatly benefit from adopting a similar approach. It can help them to identify and resolve issues early, leading to a more polished and enjoyable final product.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, the indie game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Celeste</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> went through several iterations during its development. The developers released early builds and gathered feedback from a select group of gamers, which helped refine the game’s mechanics, difficulty balance, and overall design. By addressing feedback promptly, they ensured that the final release was well-tuned and widely appreciated. So the iterative development process involves:</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Early Prototype Releases"><span>Early Prototype Releases</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Indie developers can begin by releasing early prototypes or alpha versions to a small group of testers. Platforms like itch.io offer one of the venues for this, enabling developers to share early builds or host game jams and receive feedback from a community of passionate gamers. For example, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rogue Legacy</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by Cellar Door Games benefited from early access and gamer feedback, allowing the developers to fine-tune the game’s procedural generation and difficulty settings.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Playtesting Sessions"><span>Playtesting Sessions</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers can organize playtests at different stages of development to gather diverse feedback, either in-house with friends and family or by engaging online communities. Playtesting not only helps identify bugs and gameplay issues but also provides valuable insights into gamer behavior and preferences. The game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fez</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by Polytron Corporation underwent extensive playtesting, which was instrumental in perfecting its unique puzzle mechanics and ensuring a smooth experience for gamers.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Beta Testing Platforms"><span>Beta Testing Platforms</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Utilizing beta testing platforms can also provide broader feedback before the official launch. Indie developers can open their games to a wider audience through beta testing, allowing them to gather crucial data on how the game performs across different systems and under various conditions. Motion Twin successfully used this approach with Dead Cells, releasing the game in early access on Steam and continuously updating it based on community feedback.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strong Narrative and World-Building Make a Difference"><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strong Narrative and World-Building Make a Difference</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">AAA games often excel at crafting deep narratives and meticulously detailed worlds that keep players invested and engaged for extended periods. Indie developers can pick up valuable aspects from this by focusing on strong narrative elements and world-building, even when working within the constraints of smaller budgets and teams. A compelling story and a well-crafted game world can significantly affect how a game is received and remembered:</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Narrative"><span>Narrative</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A compelling narrative involves a story that resonates with gamers, featuring memorable characters, emotional arcs, and meaningful choices. Creating a cohesive world with consistent lore and visual style enhances immersion and deepens the connection between gamers and the game. Indie titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hyper Light Drifter</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by Heart Machine illustrate the power of effective world-building. Despite its minimalist dialogue, the game conveys a rich, post-apocalyptic world through detailed pixel art, ambient sound design, and environmental storytelling.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Environmental Storytelling"><span>Environmental Storytelling</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This approach involves using the game’s environment to convey narrative elements without relying solely on dialogue or cutscenes. Games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inside</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by Playdead masterfully use environmental cues to deliver its narrative. The game’s eerie, dystopian world is revealed through meticulously designed levels, encouraging gamers to piece together the narrative themselves. Indie developers can leverage this technique to add depth to their games without extensive dialogue or exposition.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Collaboration"><span>Collaboration</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Indie developers should not hesitate to bring in external talent of writers and artists if it enhances their game’s storytelling. For example, the indie hit </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kena: Bridge of Spirits</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by Ember Lab </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-external-and-distributed-development-is-the-future-of-aaa-games">relied on</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> external teams like Virtuos for asset creation, level dressing, and visual effects. This collaboration enabled the lead developer to focus on the game's core vision while benefiting from outside expertise.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Prioritizing strong narrative elements, indie games can achieve a level of depth and engagement that rivals even the most polished AAA titles.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Post-Launch Support Ensures Longevity"><span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Post-Launch Support Ensures Longevity</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Post-launch support and ongoing updates are critical strategies employed by AAA studios to maintain gamer engagement and extend the lifecycle of their games. Indie developers can adopt this approach to ensure their games remain relevant and enjoyable long after the initial release. Providing continuous support means:</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Post-Launch Updates"><span>Post-Launch Updates</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Planning for post-launch content needs to start early in the development process. Indie developers can consider future content scenarios, including additional levels, new features, or story expansions. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Slay the Spire</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by MegaCrit regularly received updates and new content, which kept the gamer community engaged and excited about the game. These updates included new characters, cards, and balance adjustments that enriched the overall experience.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Community Feedback"><span>Community Feedback</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Indie developers can actively engage with their player base through forums, social media, and in-game surveys to gather insights on what players want to see improved or added. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dead Cells</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by Motion Twin is a prime example, where the developers closely monitored gamer feedback during its early access phase and continued to update the game based on community suggestions after its official release. This approach resulted in a highly polished and well-received game that continued to evolve.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Downloadable Content (DLC)"><span>Downloadable Content (DLC)</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Indie developers can create meaningful and well-priced DLCs that offer significant content, enhancing the base game. For instance, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hollow Knight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by Team Cherry received several free DLC packs that introduced new areas, bosses, and abilities, greatly expanding the game and keeping the gamer community engaged without additional cost. This not only added value for existing players but also attracted new ones, who saw the ongoing support as a testament to the game's quality.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Regular Updates"><span>Regular Updates</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Regular patches maintain game health. These updates can address bugs, adjust game balance, and resolve performance or compatibility issues that may arise post-launch. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Terraria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by Re-Logic is well-known for its consistent updates and patches, which improved game mechanics over the years. This dedication to ongoing support has kept the game popular and relevant long after its initial release.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">***</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By embracing these five key takeaways, indie developers can gain valuable insights from the practices of AAA studios, equipping themselves with the approaches needed to craft games that resonate with gamers on multiple levels. Each stage — from improving the impact of production quality to building strong community engagement — contributes to creating a game that not only captivates visually but also offers compelling experience. Having these elements combined, indie creators can ensure their games are enjoyed and appreciated for the stories they tell and the way they’re told.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/marvel-crisis-protocol-asgardian-character-pack-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Who likes Thor? How about the other Thor? Loki? How about my real Asgardian freaks out there who are Lady Sif fans? That's right, we've got new&nbsp;<em>Marvel: Crisis Protocol</em>&nbsp;minis to check out (plus some bonus terrain worth peeping)!&nbsp;Recent past coverage of mine includes my review of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/marvel-crisis-protocol-black-panther-shang-chi-and-more-review">Black Panther, Namor</a>&nbsp;and more, and we've also covered some great <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/marvel-crisis-protocol-professor-x-nightcrawler-and-more-review">X-Men recent releases</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now Atomic Mass Games has sent along a&nbsp;<em>Marvel: Crisis Protocol</em> - Asgardians Affiliation Pack for me to check out, so let's grab Mjolnir and throw ourselves into it!</p>
<h3>Thor, Hero Of Midgard</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-asgardian-character-pack-thor-hero-of-midgard.jpg?itok=UQ1VbjwE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-asgardian-character-pack-thor-hero-of-midgard.jpg?itok=ikIeMR9X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This version of Thor is absolutely a beast at 6 threat. While both of his standard attacks are relatively close range (with a range 3), they absolutely smash. First up, his builder attack <b>Odinson's Ire</b>&nbsp;has a Strength 7, and with a lucky roll you can end up zapping nearby enemies with some sparking energy. But his real whammy of an attack is&nbsp;<strong>I Would Have Words With Thee!</strong>&nbsp;which costs 4 power but is Strength 10! Plus, you then throw any character under size 4.</p>
<p>He also comes with a full toolkit for dishing out damage, from the ability to throw size 4 or smaller objects, a reactive ability that dishes out revenge damage after attack, and the ability to fling himself Medium.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-thor-hero-of-midgard-card.jpg?itok=sbCQISjg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-thor-hero-of-midgard-card.jpg?itok=4-Va2mKm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>So, how do you run Thor, Hero of Midgard? You get him stuck in the action, acting as a high-damage dealing zone controller. You can get into it with an enemy on an objective, unleash hell on them, throw them out of range, gain control, and then continue moving on.</p>
<p>In our playtests, Thor, Hero Of Midgard kind of acting like a prowling, lashing out shark (shout out to Jeff!) who would patrol the middle of the board, striking hard any time someone got too close!</p>
<h3>Loki, Prince of Lies</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-asgardian-character-pack-loki.jpg?itok=i1lvttGn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-asgardian-character-pack-loki.jpg?itok=nEMmBqNb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>These days it seems like everyone loves Loki (except the mini painters among us who have to try to replicate those tiny, crisp yellow lines on his green jumpsuit)! And Loki, Prince of Lies might be just what your fighting force is missing, as he's a very slippery, very fun character to field.</p>
<p>His attacks don't deal a ton of damage, but as you'd expect they truly manipulate others on the board. From giving them the Root special condition, to an area attack that moves every enemy who's hit by it, Loki's here to mix it up. Along with moving allies around the board and having the ability to potentially dish out some retaliatory damage, there's one ability that truly stands out.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-loki-prince-of-lies-card.jpg?itok=mjljBK94 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-loki-prince-of-lies-card.jpg?itok=nHH-zXaG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><strong>This Isn't Mischief, This Is Mayhem</strong>&nbsp;is an always-on ability that reads "When attacking or defending, this character adds [Skull] results in the enemy character's roll to its total successes." What!? That's totally wild, and I love the way they're willing to break the rules of the game for a character who's constantly breaking the rules of the Marvel universe.</p>
<p>In our playtests, Loki does exactly what you'd expect him to do - he messes with the board and scoots enemy players around. I will say, I was surprised at his damage output potential. Though a lot of his damage will be pinging for small amounts, it stacks up more. I imagined he'd play more of a control/support role, but he can really shave off some HP.</p>
<h3>The Mighty Thor</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-asgardian-character-pack-the-mighty-thor.jpg?itok=tGz19Ufz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-asgardian-character-pack-the-mighty-thor.jpg?itok=fQsV-r6w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Now it's Jane Foster's turn to throw around Mjolnir with The Mighty Thor! Along with an incredible model sculpt, The Mighty Thor is meant to serve as an agile attacker. Her builder can throw enemy units a short distance away, and her heavier attack has the chance to electrocute any other enemies that happen to be nearby the initial target.</p>
<p>She also has a 3 power ability that let's her take a move action followed by an attack action, can throw terrain around, and can re-roll defense dice against certain attacks.</p>
<p>This makes her a slightly more defensive version of the&nbsp;<em>other&nbsp;</em>Thor in this box, even if she can't quite dish out the same beat-down as he does. What I really like about her is her Team Tactics Card (which I don't usually cover too deply in these top-down reviews), but let's her remove her activated token, activate again, and then she's K.O.'ed. It's a great last ditch effort to remove a major threat or retake control of an objective before the clock runs out!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-the-mighty-thor-card.jpg?itok=Am6FMw9K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-the-mighty-thor-card.jpg?itok=i_WsxZV2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In our playtests, she didn't make as noticeable an impact on the board as some of the other characters in this box, but a very lucky roll from her powered up attack made for a very memorable moment where she ended up electrocuting a big batch of enemies clustered around an objective. If She Be Worthy, Indeed!</p>
<h3>Lady Sif</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-asgardian-character-pack-lady-sif.jpg?itok=uwkPcK3C 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-asgardian-character-pack-lady-sif.jpg?itok=rw4x2OTw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Lady Sif, Asgardian, master swordswoman, friend to Thor... she's one of the coolest looking Asgardians with her red and white motif and killer sword, but how does she play? Straightforwardly, that's how! Her two main attacks are really all about putting damage and pressure on an opposing character, and then sticking close to them.</p>
<p>This is a fun mechanic, supported by her Charge ability, where with proper dice rolls she's constantly pushing enemy characters away and then following them, essentially locking them into battle with her or blocking them from getting back to objectives.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-lady-sif-card.jpg?itok=oVZHawkT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-lady-sif-card.jpg?itok=jwnL9FUk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Add to that her ability to reroll attacks and defense if she's up close to an enemy, and the fact that she's always reducing incoming damage by 1, and you've got a sturdy melee-ish fighter who can take a bit of punishment and keep fighting back. Not complicated, but super-useful!</p>
<h2>Bonus! Asgardian Terrain Spotlight!</h2>
<p>Along with this really fun Asgardian Affiliation pack, Atomic Mass Games also released two different terrain sets to go along with them!</p>
<p>And what I'm most excited about in regards to these terrain options is not how they can evolve the board beyond sci-fi and city street wargaming (as previous terrain sets did), but how now each terrain kit comes with&nbsp;<em>something</em>&nbsp;that adds to the game (should you choose to play with it). Both of these sets come with One-Shot cards!</p>

How fun!</p>
<p>This also modifies the threat of the scenario you're playing this with by 3, which could give you that little extra oomph of power you need to sneak in a stronger character.</p>

This is the Asgardian Shrine terrain pack, and the one-shot included with this is so fun. By turning all [SHIELD] rolls into additional power, you'll ensure everyone on the field is launching their most powerful attacks.</p>
<p>If you like the idea of these One-Shots as much as I do, you'll love the fact that Atomic Mass Games has released downloadable <a href="https://www.atomicmassgames.com/transmission/one-shot-cards-for-existing-terrain-packs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">One-Shots for&nbsp;<em>all of the terrain sets</em></a>&nbsp;they've produced for&nbsp;<em>Marvel: Crisis Protocol</em>.</p>

<p>In our playtests, my only real note of concern is that The Mighty Thor feels slightly underpowered for her cost, and doesn't do quite as much flashy stuff as the rest of the figures in the box. That's an extreme shame, because Jane Foster as The Mighty Thor is one of the coolest, most innovative character decisions Marvel's ever done with the Asgardian storyline, and she deserves a wildly cool miniature.</p>
<p>But other than that, the design is perfect for these minis, they're potent and powerful, and those terrain sets (sold separately, I should mention though I think that's obvi) are absolutely gorgeous. This is a pack that truly can't be missed.</p>

Yeah, it’s challenging and, occasionally, unforgiving. But that’s part of its charm. It introduces you to unique characters from ancient Chinese mythology—an entirely new world to many—and satisfying combat mechanics.</p><p>Still, for as singular as it is, whether you eventually bounce off of <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>or outright beat its story, there are several other games out there that scratch the same itch. Here are a bunch that we recommend you dive into next.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f6ba5957e6e1241775efb0751b2db5f0" data-recommend-id="image://f6ba5957e6e1241775efb0751b2db5f0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Activision</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f6ba5957e6e1241775efb0751b2db5f0" data-recommend-id="image://f6ba5957e6e1241775efb0751b2db5f0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you ask anyone for a recommendation following <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, they’re liable to suggest <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>. It’s a challenging yet satisfying Soulslike that heavily relies on parry mechanics over dodge-rolling. As you watch yourself improve at parrying a boss’ attacks, you’ll find the game difficult to put down. To many, it’s one of the most demanding titles in the genre. But if you can handle <em>Black Myth</em>, you can probably learn the ropes in <em>Sekiro</em>.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c2e4d1dab2479458be7582273aa6c0f6" data-recommend-id="image://c2e4d1dab2479458be7582273aa6c0f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c2e4d1dab2479458be7582273aa6c0f6" data-recommend-id="image://c2e4d1dab2479458be7582273aa6c0f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>These days, when imagining a Soulslike, most people’s minds immediately go to <em>Elden Ring</em>. It’s the quintessential Soulslike, with its massive open world that offers boundless opportunities to level up and improve your abilities before tackling the game’s many challenging bosses. But if you’re new to the genre and just coming off <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, don’t rush into <em>Shadows of the Erd Tree</em>. It’s far more complicated and painful than the main game, which still doesn’t hold your hand in any way.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="954a3acf2265a22e59158f6f25e2f583" data-recommend-id="image://954a3acf2265a22e59158f6f25e2f583" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Santa Monica Studio / PlayStation</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="954a3acf2265a22e59158f6f25e2f583" data-recommend-id="image://954a3acf2265a22e59158f6f25e2f583" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> features stellar combat mechanics that feel satisfying when you land the perfect light attack combo. We suggest <em>God of War</em> to follow the more action-oriented side of the game. While not a Soulslike, it’s another common comparison people make when discussing <em>Black Myth</em>. It’s more action-focused, providing gratifying combat encounters, memorable set pieces, and a storyline that pulls you in and doesn’t let go for its entire 20+ hour campaign.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="54f84af0c99a866dd18fa7bd3a4d1f56" data-recommend-id="image://54f84af0c99a866dd18fa7bd3a4d1f56" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sloclap / Kepler Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="54f84af0c99a866dd18fa7bd3a4d1f56" data-recommend-id="image://54f84af0c99a866dd18fa7bd3a4d1f56" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For a more grounded title, <em>Sifu</em> provides much of the same challenge as games like <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>but set in reality. You play as a kung fu master on a quest for revenge after assassins slay your family. The resulting chaos is a tightly wound brawler with Roguelike mechanics. If you die in combat, you respawn older, more powerful, but slower. You must balance your rapidly progressing age with the onslaught of enemies to reach the end of the story and find absolution.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1df94517e5efffe6f1cc4257e1c2f5e5" data-recommend-id="image://1df94517e5efffe6f1cc4257e1c2f5e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->KOEI TECMO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1df94517e5efffe6f1cc4257e1c2f5e5" data-recommend-id="image://1df94517e5efffe6f1cc4257e1c2f5e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s true that <em>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</em> still suffers from poor reviews and the occasional bug or glitch, but it’s also quite similar to <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> for several reasons. Along with its Chinese setting, <em>Wo Long</em> features challenging yet approachable combat, unique boss-type enemies, Soulslike mechanics, and potent abilities that can alter the flow of combat in the blink of an eye. Oh, and it’s available on Xbox Game Pass, so if you’re a subscriber, there’s no risk in trying it out!</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="702d569127f7a39c3c33ddb5c18d50de" data-recommend-id="image://702d569127f7a39c3c33ddb5c18d50de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->KOEI TECMO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="702d569127f7a39c3c33ddb5c18d50de" data-recommend-id="image://702d569127f7a39c3c33ddb5c18d50de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Nioh 2</em> is a unique alternative to <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> in that it’s an amalgamation of the Soulslike genre with the thrilling loot mechanics of a game like <em>Diablo IV</em>. The various Yokai you will face pose significant challenges, particularly the many boss fights, but the ability to customize your build and play style with potent gear makes it approachable. It’s also an opportunity to delve into more Eastern mythology after <em>Black Myth</em>, as the game is set during Japan’s Sengoku period but with a demonic twist.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b3f4cdb15dd3de70259ff72bb0ba7531" data-recommend-id="image://b3f4cdb15dd3de70259ff72bb0ba7531" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Respawn / Electronic Arts</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b3f4cdb15dd3de70259ff72bb0ba7531" data-recommend-id="image://b3f4cdb15dd3de70259ff72bb0ba7531" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s a slew of less intense yet still action-oriented Soulslikes (or Soulslites?) that offer semi-challenging gameplay while honestly allowing anyone a chance at completing the campaign. <em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em>, the<em>&nbsp;</em>second game in EA’s <em>Jedi </em>series, is one of them. The game continues the story of Cal Kestis in his fight against the Empire. On the combat front, if you’re not mindful of your surroundings and of the tells your enemies exhibit, even the lowliest of Stormtroopers can land a lucky shot and send Cal reeling.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="839144c82ea947faf5fae4fd6e213bb1" data-recommend-id="image://839144c82ea947faf5fae4fd6e213bb1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->NEOWIZ</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="839144c82ea947faf5fae4fd6e213bb1" data-recommend-id="image://839144c82ea947faf5fae4fd6e213bb1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Lies of P</em>, the Soulslike story of Pinocchio, took the gaming world by storm in late 2023 with its intricate world design, satisfying combat mechanics, and lovable characters. Some would call it a masterpiece while others call it infuriating. You’ll likely fall somewhere in between. The city of Krat offers a palpable atmosphere as puppets roam the streets in search of their next victim, but you’re armed with various customizable weapons and abilities to stop their reign. Like <em>Sekiro</em>, <em>Lies of P</em> heavily utilizes parry mechanics over dodge-rolling, so timing is everything.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="291b35bce1946959f8be837db22a94c2" data-recommend-id="image://291b35bce1946959f8be837db22a94c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->SHIFT UP / Sony Interactive Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="291b35bce1946959f8be837db22a94c2" data-recommend-id="image://291b35bce1946959f8be837db22a94c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Futuristic monsters, captivating costumes, and high-flying action combine in <em>Stellar Blade</em> for an out-of-this-world experience that should serve as a rather casual romp following the challenges of <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>. While certainly not a Soulslike, <em>Stellar Blade</em> does wonders at thrusting you into tough combat encounters that shouldn’t pose too much trouble after playing as The Destined One. It’s a story-driven action game that could be the perfect palette cleanser players need after beating The Great Sage’s Broken Shell.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="eiwy7auvjbfoxjrxo1ge" data-recommend-id="image://eiwy7auvjbfoxjrxo1ge" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="eiwy7auvjbfoxjrxo1ge" data-recommend-id="image://eiwy7auvjbfoxjrxo1ge" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Lastly, we have yet another recommendation that doesn’t fall under the Soulslike category but does offer exceptional combat and exploration. <em>Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey</em> is often touted as one of the best of the new breed of <em>Assassin’s Creed titles</em>, meaning those with RPG-like mechanics, and it still holds up well after all these years. It’s an enthralling game that draws you into ancient Greece, provides you with the necessary tools to make combat as inviting or challenging as you like, and serves up a memorable story all the while.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>An English artist has reacted to a purported offer from Rockstar Games to include his band Heaven 17's 1983 song "Temptation" in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, saying the offer of $7,500 was "extremely low."</p><p>Martyn Ware, 68, <a href="https://x.com/martynware/status/1832360366464008543?s=46&amp;t=gp9HY1NQP1eeZxZoq0Xxsw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said on social media</a> that he was recently contacted by his team to discuss an offer from Rockstar Games about the possibility of putting "Temptation" in GTA VI. Ware said he was "naturally excited about the immense wealth that was about to head my way," that is, until he saw the actual offer: $7,500.</p><p>Ware said this amount would have covered "a buyout of any future royalties from the game--forever." Ware went on to (incorrectly) state that GTA VI has already grossed $8.6 billion and that he believes he was low-balled because having the song in GTA VI could generate "exposure" for the song.</p><p>Ware's response? "Go f**k yourself," he said about the offer.</p><p>To be sure, GTA VI is not yet released and thus has generated $0. Ware is likely referring to GTA V, which is among the most successful video games of all time with more than 250 million copies sold. It <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-v-sales-reach-1-billion-in-three-days/1100-6414762/" data-ref-id="1100-6414762">cleared $1 billion in revenue</a> after just 72 hours back in 2013. GTA VI is expected to be a juggernaut as well in terms of units sold and revenue.</p><p>Ware's social media posts went viral, and he later offered a number of clarifications. Starting off, the $7,500 offer was for <a href="https://x.com/martynware/status/1832652897676394782" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">his share alone</a>--the song has three credited writers, and they would also receive $7,500 for a total of at least $22,500. The other songwriters are Glenn Gregory and Ian Craig Marsh.</p><p>Ware labeled the offer <a href="https://x.com/martynware/status/1833016893197766722" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"pathetic."</a> He said he <a href="https://x.com/martynware/status/1832739125591462115" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">attempted to engage in a counter-offer through his publisher</a>, but Rockstar's team <a href="https://x.com/martynware/status/1832768705165459575" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">refused</a>, he said.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/disney-lorcana-shimmering-skies-starter-deck-reviews-party-time<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As we rejoin the story of <em>Lorcana</em>, there’s great cause for celebration! <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/disney-lorcana-ursulas-return-starter-decks-review-songs-and-swords">Ursula nearly took over the realm</a>, but brave Illumineers and glimmers defeated here! Now there’s nothing left to do but party! That’s the theme behind Shimmering Stars, the latest set for <em>Disney Lorcana</em>! <a href="https://www.disneylorcana.com/en-US/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ravensburger</a> sent us two starter decks, as well as some other great new accessories to check out, so read all about them in my review!</p>

<p>To kick things off, we're going to dive right into these two Starter Decks and do a quick run-down of how they play, while highlighting some key cards from each deck. Also included in each Starter Deck are two booster packs for&nbsp;<em>Shimmering Skies</em>, but those are (obviously) all random, so I won't be factoring in the cards I opened when evaluating these decks.</p>
<p>Here at TechRaptor, my colleagues and I have previously checked out the Starter Decks for Ursula's Return (linked above), as well as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/disney-lorcana-rise-of-floodborn-starter-decks-review-wizards-witches-princes-and">Rise of the Floodborn</a> set and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/disney-lorcana-into-inklands-starter-decks-review-doggone-good">the Into the Inklands set</a>! For more info on those, click those links! Now that's enough blabbing, let's jump in!</p>
<h3>Amethyst And Ruby Starter Deck</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-shimmering-skies-starter-deck-ruby-and-amethyst-highlight-cards.jpeg?itok=kmSDft1x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-shimmering-skies-starter-deck-ruby-and-amethyst-highlight-cards.jpeg?itok=eVjHvUAu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>First up is the Amethyst and Ruby Starter Deck. This deck is led by Wreck-It Ralph in his card "Wreck-It Ralph, Demolition Dude," (who makes his <em>Lorcana&nbsp;</em>debut along with many other characters from his franchise) and by Elsa with her card "Elsa, the Fifth Spirit." Now, when I say&nbsp;"led by" I'm really talking about the two cards on the front of the box. But check out their cards above, they serve as a kind of blueprint for what this deck wants to do.</p>
<p>Now, at first glance, this may not look like these cards have much to do with one another, or point toward an overall approach to gameplay. But this deck is a perfect distillation of Ruby's aggressiveness and Amethyst's tricky nature. Let's take a look at the rare cards included in this deck to get a better sense.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-shimmering-skies-intro-deck-rare-ruby-amethyst-cards.jpg?itok=thdpswIa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-shimmering-skies-intro-deck-rare-ruby-amethyst-cards.jpg?itok=WUK11YCL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With these cards, we can see a pattern start to emerge. The Sword Released wants you to have big, bulky characters on the field - and with cards like Wreck-It Ralph not minding taking damage, you're encouraged to get out there and start swinging at your opponents. Add to that the amount of Ruby cards with Rush, and Ruby's truly doing its job here (aka... to smash).&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for Amethyst, this tricky color is up to all its normal... well, tricks! With tons of cards sporting the Evasive ability, the idea here is that you let your Amethyst cards start piling up your lore while being relatively free from attack. Plus other Amethyst cards, like Elsa, can help lock down your opponents.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-shimmering-skies-starter-decks-ruby-amethyst-key-commons-and-uncommons.jpg?itok=5mLJ6Zeq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-shimmering-skies-starter-decks-ruby-amethyst-key-commons-and-uncommons.jpg?itok=5HuI2n-J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Taking a look at some of my favorite Common and Uncommon cards from this deck (psst... need help figuring out Disney Lorcana rarity? <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/how-to-understand-disney-lorcana-rarity">Check out the Disney Lorcana Rarity Guide we put together</a>), this two-pronged approach is driven across the finish line even further.</p>
<p>You'll see as you play this deck that it's just Evasive card after Evasive card, Rush attacker after Rush attacker. All in all, it's a very straightforward, but very potent recipe for victory.</p>
<h3>Emerald And Steel Starter Deck</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-shimmering-skies-starter-decks-emerald-and-steel-lead-cards.jpg?itok=HUbvtUiL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-shimmering-skies-starter-decks-emerald-and-steel-lead-cards.jpg?itok=VxDfiXnU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As you can see from the above lead cards, "Kronk, Head of Security" and "Scar, Vengeful Lion" playing the Emerald and Steel Starter Deck isn't necessarily cheap. But if you can hit your ink every turn, you'll be in for a fun ride where it's easy to overwhelm your opponent.</p>
<p>While Kronk's ability is fun, the card's pretty much unplayable at 7 unless you can shift him onto a cheaper Kronk. But Scar... ooh what a card!</p>
<p>In my playtesting with this deck, my wife (who piloted the deck) drew so. many. cards. with Scar. And while there are some pretty good Steel cards in this deck, all this deck really wants to do is have damaged opponent characters on the board. A very fun new approach to a Starter deck. Let's look at the Rare cards.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-shimmering-skies-starter-decks-emerald-and-steel-rare-cards.jpg?itok=sqLGtvs6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-shimmering-skies-starter-decks-emerald-and-steel-rare-cards.jpg?itok=bnHKXZNL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"Tug-of-War" is great at sending out pinging little damage across the board to your opponents, which will fuel your strategy - and it doesn't hurt that, in a pinch, it can wipe out a lot of evasive enemy characters.</p>
<p>All of these other rare characters, including Robin Hood (I&nbsp;<em>love</em>&nbsp;Robin Hood cards in&nbsp;<em>Lorcana</em>, he's always running away with tons of Lore), really benefit hugely from damaged opponent characters.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-shimmering-skies-starter-decks-emerald-and-steel-commons.jpg?itok=ZdsSeq8F 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-shimmering-skies-starter-decks-emerald-and-steel-commons.jpg?itok=hOBv_BrP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Of all the cards I'm showing off here as my favorite common and uncommon cards from this deck, don't sleep on Tropical Rainforest. While this card is on the table, if the rest of your deck is doing what it's supposed to be doing, you can essentially stop your opponent from having a viable win condition... that's just absurd.</p>
<p>In summary here, this is certainly a more complicated deck to run than the Ruby and Amethyst deck, but it is - in my opinion - way more powerful. Sure, there are times when your combo-esque cards don't really come up in the right sequence, but that's pretty rare.</p>
<p>What will usually happen is the benefits of all your different cards wanting to do the same thing will begin to compound, and soon you'll find yourself sporting an eight point lore gap ahead of your opponent. Pretty nice!</p>
<h2>Bonus! Disney Lorcana Shimmering Skies Accessories</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-shimmering-skies-accessories.jpg?itok=NbgK0miw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-shimmering-skies-accessories.jpg?itok=mSY1W-5b 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While I'm at it, I wanted to speak for a moment about some really fun new accessories and other bits and bobs that Ravensburger sent along for me to check out! Some of the items I'm most excited for are these two large folders, these are Portfolios for the game, meant to keep your cards safe.</p>
<p>For the budding player who's excited about both the game&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;the collectible nature of the cards, these Portfolios are a Bear Necessity. They feel sturdy, do a nice job of holding sleeved and unsleeved cards in their pages, and I really like that they come in two designs - one featuring characters from across the world of <i>Lorcana</i>, and the other featuring the cardback artwork.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-shimmering-skies-illumineers-trove.jpg?itok=5_l2NDzO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-shimmering-skies-illumineers-trove.jpg?itok=lae2SUrJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>And finally, above you'll see the Illumineer's Trove for&nbsp;<em>Disney Lorcana Shimmering Skies</em>. I always love these Troves. First off, they're a fun way to get a batch of packs (each includes 8 packs), but I&nbsp;<em>also</em>&nbsp;really love the dice that come with each one. They're always different for each set, and this set of dice matches the celebratory, sparkly nature of the Shimmering Skies with its gold flecks and purple numbers.</p>
<p>I've said it before, but if you're looking to get a gift for someone who loves&nbsp;<em>Lorcana</em>, there's no better gift than an Illumineer's Trove.</p>
<h2>Disney Lorcana Shimmering Skies - Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Both of these Starter Decks are a lot of fun for different reasons. If you're newer to the game (or maybe even thinking of getting a younger player into the game), I would absolutely start with the Ruby and Amethyst Starter Deck. Once you understand the core mechanics of the game, it's so, so easy to run this deck.</p>
<p>As for the Steel and Emerald deck, this is one for more experienced players. It also feels, to me at least, like it would be easy to upgrade into something pretty over-powered with the right additions. This definitely feels more like the kind of Starter Deck you could use as a skeleton for a competitive deck.</p>
<p>Between these two decks, and the accessories I've touched on above, Shimmering Skies is really a fun, celebratory entry in this game that hasn't yet missed its mark at all! If you're a fan of the game, keep going with Shimmering Skies. And if you're new, there's really no better set to jump into (that's readily available, at least) than this one.</p>

These could be fellow bots to rescue, puzzle pieces used to unlock new features, or secret level entrances in select worlds. Finding them is half the fun of <em>Astro Bot</em>, but if you’re having trouble tracking one or two down, the game has a feature that directs you to them. After you complete a level once, you can go back to it and find a birdhouse at the beginning of the stage. Opening it will cost 200 coins, but if you choose to do so, you’ll get a little robot bird companion who will point out collectibles as you move through the level. You’ll only have to pay the fee once to unlock your flying guide. Then they will help you find that pesky robot hiding off the side of a cliff.<br></p><p><strong>You’ll use those photo ops…later</strong><br></p><p>Throughout <em>Astro Bot</em>, you’ll stumble across hidden photo ops. These are stands that our robot hero can stick their head through to pose with something in the environment. However, you can’t really do anything with them to start. Later in the game, they can reward you with coins. But that’s not until much later because…<br></p><p><strong>Photo mode is unlocked late in the game</strong><br></p><p>You unlock photo mode late into <em>Astro Bot</em>. Our mechanical friend gets a camera only after you’ve unlocked the fourth structure on your home base by collecting puzzle pieces throughout each level. This will allow you to actually get something out of the photo ops, and finally get to take cute screenshots of Astro Bot and all their PlayStation pals. It’s a pretty barebones mode, but at least you can get good posed pics for the latter parts of the game. It also gives you a reason to go back and play older levels, I suppose.<br></p><p><strong>Use your boosters to gauge your landing</strong><br></p><p>One difficulty some folks have with platformers is depth perception. Part of jumping is landing, and gauging your fall to make sure you’re properly positioned to land on solid ground becomes instinctual. But <em>Astro Bot</em> has a tool that helps you see if you’re going to reach your destination: the boosters. <em>Astro Bot </em>doesn’t have a double jump, but if you hold down the X button after jumping, you get some extra airtime by using boosters to float off the ground a little bit longer. These boosters touch the ground below Astro Bot, so you’ll know if you can land on something tangible if you can see the jets touching the floor. So when in doubt, float a little longer and look at the ground.<br></p><p><strong>The tribute levels have extra collectibles</strong><br></p><p><em>Astro Bot </em>has several tribute levels that are essentially theme parks for a specific PlayStation franchise. These are cool because they’re full of little Easter eggs and references to games like <em>God of War</em> and <em>Uncharted </em>with new mechanics not found elsewhere in <em>Astro Bot</em>. On top of this, they also have additional collectibles for you to find. For example, the <em>God of War </em>level includes several hidden birds representing Odin’s Ravens from the Norse mythology games. So be on the lookout for more than just the standard bots and puzzle pieces in these levels.<br></p><p><strong>You can turn off gyro controls immediately</strong><br></p><p>The <em>Astro </em>games have often been used as technical showcases for PlayStation’s peripherals and gimmicks. <em>Astro Bot </em>is no different, and that means it’s using the DualSense controller’s gyroscope motion controls. This can be for things like steering Astro’s ship and for climbing in some levels. But if you’re not a fan, you can turn this off right out the gate by pausing and going to the accessibility menu and turning off “control tilt assist.” This will replace these inputs with a flick of the analog stick.<br></p><p><strong>There are hidden levels on the galaxy map</strong><br></p><p><em>Astro Bot </em>has a lot of levels, but they aren’t all immediately accessible or readily apparent on the galaxy map. You’ll notice a few abnormalities start to pop up on this level select screen as you play. This includes asteroid clusters that you can interact with by flying your ship right into their path. If you destroy all of them, you’ll unlock a new level. They will have time limits though, so destroy them all quickly if you see them. If you mess up, try leaving the system and coming back. Or go play a full level. It will show up again eventually.<br></p><hr><p><em>Astro Bot </em>released Friday on PlayStation 5, and is one of the most acclaimed games of 2024. If you’re sleeping on it, don’t, because it’s got so much joy to offer, especially for longtime fans of PlayStation. If you’re curious and, for some reason, never played <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-playroom-ps5-free-launch-party-team-asobi-1851641829&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-playroom-ps5-free-launch-party-team-asobi-1851641829"><em>Astro’s Playroom</em></a></span><em> </em>when it came pre-installed on your PS5, it’s worth going back to see what all the fuss is about.

One issue in particular is creating an awkward situation between players before they set out on a co-op mission — so awkward in fact that it’s making simply playing the class you want more frustrating than it should be.</p><p>Space Marine 2 includes three-player co-op missions as part of Operations mode. These co-op missions are set during the game’s campaign, but with different characters who are off doing other missions that tie in to the events that follow Titus and co. These missions are referenced in the campaign, but Operations mode lets you actually play them.</p><p>Operations mode only lets your squad include one Space Marine of each class. So, for example, it is impossible to have an all-sniper team (developer Saber has said this is a deliberate design decision to encourage “strategic variety.”)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Multiplayer Modes Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>That would be fine if it weren’t for the fact that Space Marine 2 will actively matchmake you into a group with a player who is the same class as the one you just picked to play as. In-game, there is an area of the Battle Barge where players must “assemble” before an Operations mode mission kicks off. The countdown only begins when all three players have selected a different class. This means you can end up in awkward standoffs where two or more players want to be the same class, each waiting for the other to blink first and switch.</p><p>I have first-hand experience of this myself. I’m currently leveling my Bulwark and so only want to play as this (really fun!) tank class, but I’m often matched with players who clearly had the same thought. So we just stand in the “assemble” area staring at each other. After a while, I usually get kicked from the group by the group leader, and have to go through the matchmaking process all over again.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The problem is exacerbated by Space Marine 2’s per class leveling system. You level up the class you play as only, as experience gained from a mission is not shared across all classes. Leveling is slow, too, which means if you’re a fan of one class and want to make progress with them, there really isn’t much point switching to another class.</p><p>Thankfully, it sounds like a fix for this problem is coming from the developers at Saber Interactive. One fan expressing frustration with this stand-off problem called for a system that auto-detects your class and matches you with those who are a different class. Creative director Oliver Hollis-Leick <a href="https://x.com/MocapVeteran/status/1832503234847461661" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replied</a> to say class matching “is definitely one we are going to deal with.”</p><p>Generally speaking, Space Marine 2 has enjoyed a huge early access launch <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-global-release-times-confirmed">with its global release set to go live today, September 9</a>. IGN's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">Space Marine 2 review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: "Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 may not break the third-person shooter mold, but it looks amazing, makes good use of its Warhammer lore, and has brutal combat that just feels great."</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-next-gen-xbox-360-shooter-best-way-possible<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>As a Warhammer 40,000 experience, Space Marine 2 is excellent at many things. The relentless tide of Tyranids. The firing patterns of each individual model of Bolt gun. The way Imperial Guardsmen look up at you as if you are a vengeful angel sent from above. As a video game, though, Space Marine 2 has less to boast about. In fact, it is only truly accomplished at one thing: combat. </p><p>This is far from the negative critique it first sounds. Space Marine 2, much like its 2011 predecessor, is built on the bones of Gears of War. It offers spectacle and destruction in equal measure, with linear levels designed purely to funnel you from one bloody battle to the next. Aside from the fun fact that such a singular focus makes it an authentic digital embodiment of space marines (who exist purely to fight in a galaxy-spanning external conflict,) Space Marine 2’s design harks back to the time of the Xbox 360, an era before the bloated, overstuffed ‘everything game’. It’s a modern demonstration that sometimes it’s best to dedicate yourself to one idea rather than attempt shallow versions of every feature currently in vogue. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Developer Saber Interactive has crafted such a brilliant combat system thanks to its deep understanding of the Warhammer 40,000 universe. This isn’t a translation of the tabletop game, rather the conflicts those models represent. In fact, Space Marine 2 feels more like an adaptation of the artwork that adorns the pages of Warhammer manuals – so much so that one late-game sequence feels like a reenactment of a piece painted by renowned Games Workshop artist John Blanche. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F7vqjle8st9371.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blanche’s work</a> often captured both the glory and horror of a final stand against an unending sea of enemies and that same feeling is successfully replicated in Space Marine 2. Your foe, the Tyranids, are space bugs capable of swarming the screen by the hundreds thanks to an upgraded version of Saber’s World War Z horde tech.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Space Marine 2 has one of the smoothest transitions between ranged and melee I have ever seen.</p></div><p>That approaching tide of Tyranids is initially the target of your ranged arsenal. Gunplay in Space Marine 2 is magnificently weighty thanks to the thunderous roar of your Pringle can-sized gun barrel and the explosive blood bursts that accompany each round detonating inside your targets. Saber shows a true understanding of the many, many different Bolter types in the 40k universe, and so an arsenal that at first seems like the same gun in seven different formats soon reveals itself to be several discreet weapons with meaningful gameplay applications. There’s the reliable cadence of the Auto Bolter, the quick precision of the Occulus Bolt Carbine, and the unrelenting damage of the Heavy Bolter, among others – all of which have their own effective ranges and damage profiles. </p><p>But, as good as those Bolters (and their plasma brethren) feel to fire, it’s when the horde gets within slashing distance that Space Marine 2 really gets into gear. It starts with one of the smoothest transitions between ranged and melee I have ever seen in a game. A pull of the trigger can flow into the swing of a Chainsword in a split second, allowing for rapid response to approaching foes. It works the other way, too, which enables a unique, rapid flow between long and short range encounters. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/space-marine-2-melee-1725869974651.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Space Marine 2's melee combat is surprisingly accomplished. </figcaption></figure></output><p>When melee starts in earnest, it’s much, much more involved than the rifle whacks and contextual knife stabbings of so many other third-person shooters. Against the waves of cannon-fodder Hormagaunts it’s a button-mashing bloodbath as you string together light and heavy attacks to stun and skewer. But when the Tyranids (and, later, the Chaos-worshipping Thousand Sons) bring out their heavy-hitting larger units, the melee reveals itself to be a fully-featured, surprisingly deep sword combat system with dodges, parries, and counters. As the smaller enemies grow in number and begin to chew away at your armour and then your health bar, it becomes vital to hunt down the special enemies that tower above the swarm. Engage them in a brutal melee and a gory execution finisher will replenish your armour and keep you in the fight for another minute. All the way through the campaign, Saber has crafted combat scenarios that push you to the very edge of death. It’s incredibly satisfying (and very Warhammer) for a ribcage-breaking finisher move to be the thing that saves you from the corpse pile.     </p><p>Outside of this absolutely brilliant combat system, though, Space Marine 2 is largely unremarkable when it comes to many of the other things we value in video games in 2024. The level design is incredibly linear, frequently interrupted by loading screen elevator rides, and features none of the knotty, surprise-hidden pathways we’ve begun to prize over the last decade. It’s also lacking in any kind of mechanical or mission variety – outside of a couple of levels in which you use a jetpack, Space Marine 2 is purely about pushing forward through crowds of enemies. You never drive a tank, and there are no environmental puzzles. There’s not even an on-rails turret section. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There are no mini-games. No underbaked space sections. No endlessly-recycled procedural content in the name of ‘longevity’.</p></div><p>While I’d have liked a few moments or set-pieces that explored the wider scope of space marine warfare (a section where you pilot an Invictus Warsuit in a sequel, please,) this singular focus reminds me of the straightforward joys of the Xbox 360 era. Back then we were treated to many ‘B-tier’ games which were similarly honed in on a single killer feature. There was Dark Sector with its gory glaive, Singularity and its enemy-withering time manipulation device, Dark Void’s jetpack combat, and – of course – the original Space Marine with its mass Ork slaughter. Many AAA studios also trod this path, too, notably Epic’s Gears of War with its cover-based shooting (a game Space Marine would later take inspiration from, even if it did resolutely reject the idea of hiding behind walls.)   </p><p>Such a singular format is in direct contrast to what many AAA studios chase today, in which games are designed to cater to as many gameplay tastes as possible. Ubisoft in particular has fallen foul of this, building open worlds that are bursting with features, many of which feel underbaked or superfluous. The recently released Star Wars Outlaws, for instance, is an open world stealth adventure that also has action combat, an RPG-adjacent gear progression system, faction reputation, and space flight; many of which have been criticised by reviewers and players for feeling anaemic. Prior to Outlaws, Ubisoft had similar over-scoped troubles with Ghost Recon Breakpoint (a blend of tactical combat, stealth, survival mechanics, and looter shooter systems) and Watch Dogs Legion (stealth, hacking, action, and a play-as-anyone mechanic that proved far shallower than its design implied). </p><p>It’s not just Ubisoft struggling with such ‘everything games’, though. Bethesda’s attempt to affix a traditional RPG to a procedurally generated galaxy with base building and ship crafting in last year’s Starfield resulted in a game that’s widely considered unsatisfactory in its many individual fields. It’s something we even saw creep into the most recent Gears of War game – linear campaign design was partially shunned in favour of a mostly empty open world, underwhelming side missions, and an unwarranted tech tree for Jack in Gears 5. </p><p>Space Marine 2 feels like an antidote to all this. There are no mini-games. No underbaked space sections. No endlessly-recycled procedural content in the name of ‘longevity’. It’s laser-focussed on the mass destruction of humanity’s enemies. Yes, such a narrow focus does come with its downsides; I had hoped Space Marine 2 would have featured stronger mission and level design that cherry-picked a few more esoteric ideas from the Warhammer universe. But despite that, Space Marine 2 is a good reminder of an era when one killer feature was enough. While I certainly love ambitious studios and wouldn’t want to curtail important creativity, in a period where sales are struggling and budgets are soaring, maybe Space Marine 2’s approach is something more studios in the AAA and AAA-adjacent space should consider. The Xbox 360 era wasn’t some dark age of technology to be feared, and something could be learned by looking backward. Space Marine 2’s campaign did just that and the results are worthy of the Omnissiah’s blessings. </p><p><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Just four days after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-now-on-pc-adds-mod-tools-manager-evil-endings-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official release of the Baldur's Gate 3 mod tools</a> and Larian's official partnership with Mod.io to <a href="https://mod.io/g/baldursgate3?_sort=downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">host the mods</a>, the website's mod downloads for the game are already at nearly five million and a half. The most popular Baldur's Gate 3 mods so far are:</p>
<ul>
<li>ImpUI (Improved UI) with 283K downloads</li>
<li>Faces of Faerun with 180K downloads</li>
<li>Adjustable Party Limit with 116K downloads</li>
<li>Kay's Hair Extensions with 108K downloads</li>
<li>Mod Manager Minor Fixes with 97K downloads</li>
<li>UnlockLevelCurve - Level 13-20 with 91K downloads</li>
<li>FaerunColors with 88K downloads</li>
<li>All Camp Clothes and Dyes with 82K downloads</li>
<li>Better Inventory UI with 70K downloads</li>
<li>Weightless Consumables with 67K downloads</li>
<li>Better Hotbar 2 with 65K downloads</li>
<li>Origin Feats with 61K downloads</li>
<li>LemonShaderBase with 60K downloads</li>
<li>Lemons AIO Pack 2 with 60K downloads</li>
<li>Lemon AIO Pack 1 with 55K downloads</li>
<li>ContainersExtended with 55K downloads</li>
<li>Kay's Hair Mod with 54K downloads</li>
<li>Leicarna's Piercings: Crystals with 54K downloads</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these are simply reposts on Mod.io of mods that were already available on Nexus and were made without the mod tools. Still, having access to the mod kit will allow modders to make new and potentially better Baldur's Gate 3 mods, so it's worth keeping an eye on the scene.</p>
<p>The implementation designed by Larian and Mod.io includes a built-in mod manager, which allows users to easily download and install mods within the game. This was particularly important to implement because Larian wanted Baldur's Gate 3 mods to work even on consoles, which would not allow the traditional PC modding tradition of downloading files from third-party websites and installing them in a more or less complicated fashion.</p>
<p>Baldur's Gate 3 Patch 7 isn't available yet on consoles (or Mac), but it is expected to launch next month, so you won't have too long to wait. We'll let you know once it goes live.</p>

			<p>The soon-to-be-released PC version of Final Fantasy XVI uses GDeflate, a GPU decompression standard, but it seems the technology still has a long way to go to bring significant improvements, judging from a recent comparison video based on the demo version.</p>
<p>The comparison video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Compusemble" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compusemble</a> puts the game running at 4K, 1440p, and 1080p resolutions with CPU and GPU decompression side by side, highlighting how there's no tangible performance benefit with GPU decompression. Loading times are also identically with CPU and GPU decompression, further highlighting how the technology still has a long way to go to bring significant improvements, although, according to Compusamble, Final Fantasy XVI's implementation of the technology is a step up from Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, as in the Insomniac Game, GPU decompression also impacted performance.</p>
<p><iframe title="Final Fantasy XVI - GPU Decompression On vs Off" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sN4s3YIOnIw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Final Fantasy XVI is now available on PlayStation 5 and will be released on PC on September 17th. You can learn more about the latest main entry in the series by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Final Fantasy XVI heralds in a new standard for Japanese role-playing games and while the RPG components themselves are limited by Square-Enix standards, it's the narrative and gameplay that exceed all expectations. What begins with kingdom-wide subterfuge and destruction ends with a world forever changed and the player, as Clive Rosfield and Ifrit together, are the driving force to see it all through until the end.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Has GTA 6 Been Delayed to 2026?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/has-gta-6-been-delayed-to-2026/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/has-gta-6-been-delayed-to-2026.975579/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/has-gta-6-been-delayed-to-2026/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>New rumors suggest that GTA 6 has been delayed from its original 2025 release date to 2026, but how valid are the recent claims?</p>



<p><span>The latest GTA 6 rumor originated from X user (formerly Twitter)&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/billsyliamgta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@billsyliamgta</a>, who claimed on the platform that GTA 6 has been internally delayed to 202</span>6, with the information coming from “multiple devs across two studios.” As of the time of writing, no one with a reputable track record has corroborated Liam’s claims, which is somewhat unusual considering the magnitude of GTA 6 and how big of a story a delay would be.</p>



<p>What’s particularly confusing about the original claims is that the user has sourced “multiple devs,” which makes the lack of public corroboration from reputable sources confusing. After all, such a big story with multiple devs reaching out to one person usually suggests that they’ve reached out to more people, or at the very least, a different developer at the studio has reached out to someone else to try and get the information leaked. But that seemingly doesn’t seem to be the case for the moment.</p>



<p>Jason Schreier, arguably the best investigative journalist in the industry, has already subtly (in my opinion, at least) implied that there’s currently no delay. On X, <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1832842420020552153?s=46&amp;t=lDTUr8ci7tw7XnAHNA4Y_g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Schreier said</a>, “Way too many people interpreting this as “Jason says there’s no delay” when all I said is that I never said anything about commenting on it.” But with how reporting works, Schreier (and any reputable reporter) cannot flat-out say that there’s currently no delay, as that can easily change, especially when we’re still a good 14-15 months away from its presently intended release date.</p>



<p>Another way to look at this weird situation is without the initial rumor itself: Would a reputable reporter randomly report, “GTA 5 is still coming in 2025”? Probably not. Why? Because we already know officially that GTA 6 is scheduled to be released in 2025, so what value would that report add, and how stupid would that reporter look in a week if there was a delay?</p>



<p>For this reason, let me be absolutely clear; I have no idea if GTA 6 has been delayed. I haven’t reached out to anyone, and no one has reached out to me, but I wanted to explain the current rumor and whether you should note it or not. In my opinion, at least there doesn’t seem to be a delay for GTA 6. Rockstar Games’ track record does suggest that another delay could be coming down the road, but for now, that doesn’t seem like it’s been decided.</p>



<p>So, let’s just wait for the next GTA 6 rumor to pop up because it’s only a matter of time.</p>



<p>GTA 6 is officially scheduled to release in 2025 on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>

                <p>In September 2001, the original Silent Hill 2 set a new standard for the survival-horror genre in the PlayStation 2 era. Later this month, Konami's classic game is getting a remake from Bloober Team that is giving <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-preorder-guide/1100-6518983/" data-ref-id="1100-6518983">Silent Hill 2</a> a modern flourish. Now, an extended stream from 2BRO has revealed more of the changes in store for players as they explore the town of Silent Hill.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTxhiokIUxA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZTxhiokIUxA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The first 13 minutes of the stream serve as a reminder for how far games have come in the last 23 years by playing through the opening parts of the original Silent Hill 2. That game needed a loading screen just to bring its main character, James Sunderland, into a partially fenced-off area. The modern version of Silent Hill 2 appears to be a more seamless experience, and less reliant on fog to cover up its shortcomings.</p><p>At the beginning of the reboot, the tunnel to Silent Hill has been completely sealed off. That's why it takes James close to 20 minutes of gameplay to find his way to the town by going off the trail. James still encounters a young woman named Angela Orosco in a cemetery on the outskirts of town, but he doesn't run into any other main characters in this stream.</p><p>During this portion of the game, the only weapon that James has to rely on is a wooden board with some nails on it. That's good enough for him to dispatch the armless creatures that run around in the fog and occasionally hide under cars before attacking him. In a nice touch, James can use the board to break the windows of stores in town and bypass the doors by climbing through the openings. It also appears that there are more places to explore in this version of the game.</p><p>James is eventually drawn to a jukebox puzzle that he has to solve before he can advance and find a key that he needs. The music that plays appears to trigger a flashback for James, but since this demo is in Japanese, we can only assume that the scene in question relates to his quest to reunite with his late wife, Mary.</p><p>Silent Hill 2 will be released on PlayStation 5 and PC on October 8.</p>

			<p>A new Starfield mod brings significant visual improvements by overhauling interior lighting, effects, and ambient light.</p>
<p>The Enhanced Lights and FX, whose beta version can be downloaded for free from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/54?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, aims to create more atmospheric and realistic lighting by overhauling, as mentioned above, interior lighting, effects, and ambient light. This is achieved by making all interior light sources actually emit light, removing lights being cast from nowhere, increasing the use of reflection probes to improve reflections and indirect lighting, tweaking fog, redesigning light to make it more atmospheric, and more. Needless to say, the end results, even in the beta versions, are extremely good, as highlighted by the comparison screenshots below.</p>

<p>While modders are continuing to improve Starfield, Bethesda hasn't been idle either. Following the release of a few updates, the development studio is gearing up for the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-turns-one-today-and-bethesda-has-shared-some-new-shattered-space-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shattered Space expansion</a>, which promises to enhance the experience with new features and content.</p>
<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>With an engaging story, well-developed characters and lore, and a huge amount of meaningful content, Starfield is one of Bethesda's finest games and one of the best role-playing games released in the past few years. The lack of seamless exploration and real innovation of the typical gameplay formula from the studio are noteworthy, but those willing to forego these issues will find a reactive and sprawling sci-fi universe to lose themselves in for hundreds, if not thousands, of hours.</em></p>

            <p>When Warner Bros <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-minecraft-movie-trailer-looks-expensively-naff">released a fairly abysmal trailer for the Minecraft Movie</a> last week, there could be only one possible result: the game's legions of fan filmmakers, modders, texture pack creators, and garden-variety players would attempt to upstage it. That process begins with the speedy release of several fan reworkings of the trailer that use something like vanilla Minecraft graphics, rather than the original, unholy fusion of LB Photo Realism and Jack Black. This'll teach Johnny Hollywood to run his grubby hands all over our beloved Creepers, eh.</p><!--more-->
<p>I've unearthed two of these reworkings so far. Both automatically look more charming than the movie, in the same way that having a nail pulled out of your leg is preferable to hammering another one in. The below is from Alumio, a 3D artist, modeller and animator who's known for making Five Nights At Freddy's videos using Minecraft's blocky visuals.</p>

<p>And here's one from QdAndy, who caveats that "I challenged myself to make it as fast as possible and thats why some of the stuff looks kindaaa weird? also its the best my potato Pc could do without exploding". Please bear in mind that in watching both of these videos you will be exposing yourself repeatedly to the soundtrack for the Magical Mystery Tour, a somewhat fusty late-career Beatles endeavour. Yes, I'm picking fights with both Warner Bros and Beatles fans in this post. We like our Mondays <em>spicy</em> round these parts. Come at me, groupies!</p>

<p>One thing from the trailer that seems to have won some guarded enthusiasm is the usage of Ghasts as hot air balloons, but the movie <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/12f1bo0/turned_the_ghast_into_a_hot_air_balloon_piloted/">can't claim to have invented the idea</a>.

            <p>Amazon's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> adaptation now has two Emmy awards to its name.</p>
<p>The show, which was released earlier this year on Amazon Prime, follows the story of Ella Purnell's Lucy, Walton Goggins' Ghoul and Aaron Moten's Brotherhood of Steel member Maximus as they each make their way through the post-apocalyptic wasteland with varying degrees of success.</p>
<p>The series quickly became a hit for the streaming service, with scores of praise across the industry. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-review">Our own Fallout review</a> called it "a lovely, if blood-spattered, surprise", while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-creator-tim-cain-is-a-big-fan-of-the-tv-show">Fallout's original creator Tim Cain had nothing but praise for the adaptation</a>.</p>

<p>Now, during this weekend's Creative Arts Emmy Awards, it was announced Fallout had won two accolades: Outstanding Music Supervision and Outstanding Emerging Media Program.</p>
<p>Fallout won the <a href="https://x.com/TelevisionAcad/status/1832585341435342897">Outstanding Emerging Media Program</a> award for its interactive website known as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/salp/fallout?tag=georiot-us-default-20&amp;ascsubtag=pcg-gb-3501703158991930027-20&amp;geniuslink=true&amp;hhf">Fallout: Vault 33</a>. This site allows users to explore Vault 33 and the wasteland by listening to songs such as "I don't want to set the world on fire" by The Ink Spots and "Stars and Stripes Forever" by the US Marine Corps Band on a virtual record player, playing a number of promo videos for the show and swinging by Ma June's for a visit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the show's music supervisor <a href="https://x.com/TelevisionAcad/status/1832965673389068767">Trygge Toven</a> was honoured with the Outstanding Music Supervision award.</p>
<p>In addition to its wins, Fallout has also been nominated across several other categories, including a deserved nod for Goggins' portrayal of The Ghoul and the prosthetic makeup team.</p>

			<p>Halo 5: Guardians, as well as other Xbox One exclusives, will soon become playable on PC thanks to a new Xbox One translation layer for Windows PCs.</p>
<p>XWine1, which was revealed with a tweet on X, is an Xbox One translation layer for Windows PCs that currently runs six games properly. Among these games are Halo 5: Guardians, which hasn't been ported to PC to date, Rare Replay, Crimson Dragon, Forza Motorsport 5, Powerstar Golf, Space Jam: A New Legacy - The Game, Forza Motorsport 6, Forza Horizon 2 and CrossfireX. Unfortunately, the translation layer is not available to the public yet, and when it does, it's likely the development team will end up open sourcing the project.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Introducing XWine1, an Xbox One translation layer for Windows PCs.<br>
Currently six games are fully playable, with others reaching logos and in-game. More news to come! <a href="https://t.co/Du6puJz6Dj">pic.twitter.com/Du6puJz6Dj</a></p>
<p>— XWine1 (@XWineOne) <a href="https://twitter.com/XWineOne/status/1832740078658974168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 8, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Where's the source code?</p>
<p>— AE KXZ (@cnrd0o) <a href="https://twitter.com/cnrd0o/status/1832743252241310067?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 8, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The past few months have been filled with great news for PC players who haven't had the chance to try out some of the best console-exclusive games released in the past console generation. <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-dynamic-shadows/">Bloodborne</a>, just like Halo 5: Guardians, has yet to be ported to PC, but the amazing progress the ShadPS4 emulator has been making suggests that it won't be much longer until PC players will be able to venture into Yarnham.</p>
<p>Halo 5: Guardians is now available on Xbox One, but it can also be played on any device that supports Xbox Cloud Gaming. More information on the fifth entry in the series can be found on the franchise's <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-gb">official website.</a></p>

            <p>Hack the planet, wizard fans. A modder has cracked open some previously disabled abilities in the official modding toolkit for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, making it possible for folks to create their own levels or alter the game's existing environments. The toolkit (which was only made available last week) previously wouldn't let you do any of that, due to "technical constraints and platform-specific guidelines," according to developers Larian. But modders neither care nor sleep. It took them just two days to worm their way into the devkit's innards and make the impossible possible.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>To give you some context, last week the developers released a hefty patch that added a bunch of new endings to the fantasy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>. But included in that patch was official mod support and the modding toolkit. It was made available to help the usual sickos continue working on new hairstyles, customised weapons, and, uh, "other" material. The kit is essentially a watered-down version of what developers Larian would use in the studio, with some of the more powerful features disabled. You could view the game's levels in "read-only" mode, for instance, but you couldn't alter those environments, nor make your own levels. Until enterprising modder "Siegre" stuck a lockpick into the devkit and made everything possible, that is.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/12021?tab=description">BG3 Toolkit Unlocked</a> is available on Nexus Mods (at the time of writing, at least) and has a simple description: "This mod unlocks all the disabled features and enables write permissions for the BG3 Toolkit. Including level editing, save editing, and more." As a demonstration, some accompanying images include a level being filled with random environmental pieces like ruined columns, bell towers, and webs of glistening flesh. Mmmmmm, game development. </p>

<p>It's not 100% clear why Larian didn't include these features in the toolkit to begin with, but it may be a case of protecting certain copyrighted assets being scraped easily from the game, or from being altered in a way that is unpleasing to DnD's intellectual property overlords. "Baldur’s Gate 3, as a Dungeons &amp; Dragons game licensed by our partners, has certain guidelines in place to ensure the integrity of the game’s universe," they said in <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/community-update-27-official-modding-support_118?mc_cid=62c7d6b649">the notes for last week's patch</a>, suggesting the restrictions to the modding kit went beyond the studio's control. </p>
<p>It's also possible they didn't want to muddy the official mod library with mods that would cause technical and certification problems on consoles. They already have to watch out for willies in the official in-game mod launcher, for example, even if the studio don't mind PC players continuing to make that kind of thing on Nexus Mods and so on. "While some NSFW mods and certain script-heavy modifications may not be supported through the official pipeline," they said, "modding outside of our pipeline will still be an option."</p>
<p>And what an option. The moral of this story is that there's always someone out there willing to take a big boltcutter to the words "read-only". It will be interesting to see what modders can create with the toolkit now entirely unlocked. The studio's previous game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/divinity-original-sin-2-review">Divinity Original Sin 2</a>, allowed modders to make full campaigns of their own using a huge asset library from the game. For the same thing to be possible in Baldur's Gate 3 - however technically difficult - may lead to some impressive creations filled with many more dungeons and/or dragons. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Ah, but think of the exposure… Go f*** yourself.”</p><p>IGN has asked Rockstar for comment.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/gettyimages-1793840515-1725871614837.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Martyn Ware of Heaven 17 performs on stage at the O2 Shepherd's Bush Empire on November 14, 2023 in London, England. (Photo by C Brandon/Redferns)</figcaption></figure></output><p>Ware’s tweet includes a figure for money made by GTA 6, which obviously isn’t out yet. Predecessor GTA 5 is the second best-selling video game of all-time with an eye-watering 200 million sold, so perhaps the figure relates to an estimate of earnings from that game (Rockstar parent company Take-Two has not disclosed a GTA-specific revenue figure.)</p><p>Ware later <a href="https://x.com/martynware/status/1832652897676394782" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> to clarify that the $7,500 offer was $7,500 for each of Temptation's three writers, which amounts to $22,500 total. "Still utterly unacceptable," he added.</p><p>Either way, Ware’s point that GTA makes a huge amount of money and therefore the offer to use Temptation should be significantly higher is clear. And in subsequent tweets, despite many replies suggesting he should take the money and enjoy the “exposure” offered by having Temptation appear in what is likely the biggest video game of all time, <a href="https://x.com/martynware/status/1832661703554728237" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ware doubled down</a>, saying: “For those claiming H17 should have accepted the extremely low offer for buyout for Temptation in GTA6 claiming ‘increased exposure’… An extra 1 million streams generates each writer a pitiful $1k each.”</p><p>Then, replying to another user who suggested $7,500 would be “better than nothing,” <a href="https://x.com/martynware/status/1832675363421397126" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ware said</a>: “Get off your knees.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Grand Theft Auto 6 vs Real Life Inspiration</h3></div></output><p>Rockstar has a long-standing relationship with the music industry, and the soundtracks to its games are among the most popular in all video games. Indeed, the GTA games’ radio stations are often as memorable as the games themselves, providing as they do the backdrop to players’ antics with each new release. GTA 5 has hundreds of licensed songs that play out over its many in-game radio stations, and it’s likely GTA 6 will go even bigger in this regard. Having a song in GTA 6 will provide significant brand recognition, of course, but Ware’s tweets have sparked a discussion about whether $7,500 is enough for a single track’s inclusion in what may end up being the best-selling and most-played video game of all time.</p><p>It feels like an age since Rockstar broke the internet by releasing the debut trailer for GTA 6. Since the December 2023 release of GTA 6 Trailer 1, as it’s called, information-hungry fans have <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/eagle-eyed-gta-fan-spots-a-single-piece-of-jewelry-from-the-gta-6-trailer-in-the-new-gta-online-update">analyzed the trailer to within an inch of its life</a>, coming up with all sorts of outlandish theories and predictions about what to expect when Rockstar finally releases the game next year. Set in modern-day Leonida, a fictionalized version of Florida, GTA 6 will let players control Lucia and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-protagonist-isnt-played-by-the-last-of-us-star-troy-baker"><u>an unnamed male</u></a> that some fans speculate is named Jason.</p><p>Questions have swirled around GTA 6's release date ever since the initial reveal, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-website-changes-hinting-at-new-screenshots-has-fans-going-feral"><u>fans going feral over details like website updates</u></a>. Internal conflict over Rockstar's return to office policy has led to questions over whether <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-games-is-asking-employees-to-return-to-office-amid-gta-security-concerns"><u>GTA 6 will ultimately be delayed into 2026</u></a>. However, as of right now, it looks like Rockstar is determined to get GTA 6 out the door during its intended release window of fall 2025.</p><p><em>Photo by C Brandon/Redferns</em></p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The fix was alarmingly simple. Blocking a single IP address allowed normal service to resume, but who was the owner of that digital calling card? None other than OpenAI, the generative AI firm behind ChatGPT and Dall-E.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/EddCoates/status/1831321191186932040">Coates initially shared the news on X</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and slammed OpenAI's practice of scraping websites for information that can be used to train its models. The company isn't shy about this. Its </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7842364-how-chatgpt-and-our-language-models-are-developed">website openly states</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> its large language models are trained on three sources including "information that is publicly available on the internet." Of course, a myriad of lawsuits and potential legal challenges </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/30/us-newspaper-openai-lawsuit">involving major newspapers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/dec/27/new-york-times-openai-microsoft-lawsuit">including the New York Times</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/7/23823046/openai-data-scrape-block-ai">even YouTube creators</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would argue that "publicly available" doesn't equate to legal (thanks The Guardian and The Verge).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Coates, the issue here is twofold. For starters, he doesn't agree with OpenAI's methods or business model, but being targeted by the company also drove a wrecking ball through a free resource he'd spent five years building.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I first noticed that the database was having issues a couple of weeks ago, when pages were taking a lot longer to load. I knew this had nothing to do with the site itself because it had always run smoothly (even with more active online users), so I suspected foul play but couldn’t find any evidence at the time," Coates told Game Developer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I was unable to release any updates to the site as the lag was interfering with my admin tools, and I was even getting angry emails and messages from users who rely on the site as part of their day-to-day workflow."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He explained the disruption eventually caused the website to stop working altogether, dishing out "502 Bad Gateway" errors to users. At that stage, Coates sought the help of Jay Peet, who hosted the database on their private server for the last five years. Peet looked at the site logs and realized the website's resources were being swallowed by a single IP address belonging to OpenAI.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The homepage was being reloaded 200 times a second, as the [OpenAI] bot was apparently struggling to find its way around the site and getting stuck in a continuous loop," added Coates. "This was essentially a two-week long DDoS attack in the form of a data heist."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Game UI Database founder questions how OpenAI scraping is &quot;fair or even legal?&quot;">Game UI Database founder questions how OpenAI scraping is "fair or even legal?"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Coates makes no money from the Game UI Database. In fact, they actually run the website at a loss. If, however, they had attempted to monetize the project or leveraged external tools such as Amazon Web Services, OpenAI's unwelcome interest might have caused financial harm.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If I were relying on [Game UI Database] for ad-revenue or membership fees, the downtime caused by OpenAI would have&nbsp;absolutely&nbsp;had an impact on my income," he said. "They were transferring ~70GB of data from the server every ten minutes. Fortunately, I have no bandwidth costs and minimal server fees, so I’m able to provide this resource to everyone for free (as all educational resources should be). But if I were paying AWS for storage, for example, this bandwidth would have cost me around £850 a day."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"OpenAI aren't even being transparent about where their data is coming from, so I would have been solely responsible for that bill. How is that fair or even legal? And I'm certainly not the only one being affected by this."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Coates said the issue is more profound than a potential loss of income, though. "Don't get me started on what they're doing with this data," he continued, pointing out that he spent years meticulously collecting and cataloguing UI references to help other creatives in the game industry only to have that work (which encompasses the efforts of thousands of developers) "stolen by a multi-billion dollar organization."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Coates said the idea that OpenAI is repurposing that work to "hurt and replace the people that I'm trying to help" only adds insult to injury. "It's sick. Generative&nbsp;AI technology simply wouldn't exist without the work of human creatives, and yet we are the ones here being punished without compensation or credit," they added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for how Game UI Database succeeded in rebuffing OpenAI's advances, Coates and Peet eventually blocked all of the company's associated IPs at the HTTP server level to prevent it from deploying a workaround.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When I investigated this problem, it was apparent that we were being scraped or crawled by something. Our usage analytics showed 10 active users, while the actual server was reporting 200 to 300 active requests," said Peet. "I suspected someone was either attempting to DDoS us or that the data was being taken en masse by an automated scraper.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Blocking the crawlers was not too complex although the method to do so could be frail if OpenAI were to add or change any of their in use IP addresses. After modifying the robots.txt (which OpenAI can just ignore if they wish) I explicitly blocked all of OpenAIs IPs at the HTTP server level. After switching to the new config, the website was immediately back to its regular response time."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the time of writing, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gameuidatabase.com/">Game UI Database</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is back firing on all cylinders and championing UI work featured in almost 1,400 titles–including ill-fated projects like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Concord</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;Game Developer has reached out to OpenAI for comment.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p>Astro Bot is set to receive DLC with more yet-to-be-revealed VIP bots, though the game's credits hint towards which characters we may see.</p>
<p>The free DLC will arrive this year, confirmed Team Asobi's Nicolas Doucet in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQIqH3c3Agw">Quest Daily</a>, but it will be "small" and focus on speedruns following its popularity in Astro's Playroom. Leaderboards will be included.</p>
<p>What's more, "some characters that we didn't include yet will appear," said Doucet.</p>

<p>The DLC will focus on challenging levels, but the team will also add a "toy feeling" suitable for any players, Doucet continued, though "we're not too sure about that one".</p>
<p>However, while Doucet didn't confirm which VIP bots were on the way, the game's credits do provide hints.</p>
<p><strong>Stop here if you want to avoid potential spoilers.</strong></p>
<p>Team Asobi thanks third-party publishers for use of their characters in the credits, but there are some here that don't currently appear in the game.</p>
<p>Those companies include: Shift Up and the use of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a>; Ubisoft and the use of Rayman, Beyond Good &amp; Evil, and Assassin's Creed; Koei Tecmo and the use of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rise-of-the-ronin-review">Rise of the Ronin</a>; and Argonaut Games for the use of Croc.</p>
<p>Of course, Team Asobi may have licensed these characters and chosen not to include them. But with more bots now confirmed to be in the DLC, there's a fair chance we may see these characters in some form.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-has-lots-of-bots-but-concept-arts-got-those-that-are-not">Other characters were seen in concept art</a>, but also do not appear in the game - including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fat-princess">Fat Princess</a>, and Sweet Tooth from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/twisted-metal">Twisted Metal</a>.</p>
<p>Astro Bot released on Friday last week to much fanfare and celebration.</p>

		<p>If you are playing the very excellent Astro Bot you may have encountered a very <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/astro-bot-save-warning-you-have-to-exit-via-the-dashboard-to-make-a-save-doing-otherwise-leads-to-no-save-being-made-i-lost-5-hours-progress.974571/">annoying bug</a>.&nbsp; Although the game autosaves your progress it seems that for some people the file is not completed saved unless you properly exit the game, if you just shut down the PS5 or crash, you may lose your save.</p>
<p>The work around for the Astro Bot save bug is simple if a little annoying. All you have to do is exit out to the main menu while you are playing to ensure the data is saved. If you have a long gaming session then we suggest you do this quite regularly just in case you hit any issues.</p>
<p><iframe title="Astro Bot - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/unYFdcEjV9k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>We, like many sites, gave Astro Bot our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">top score of 10/10.</a></p>
<p>“Just as with Playroom, Astro Bot is a game that absolutely celebrates all things PlayStation, aimed at anyone and everyone who loves this console and the games that have made it what it is,” said Nic. “Whether you’re an old timer or a young kid with their first console — or better yet, a combination of the two — there are dozens of hours of fun to be mined here. It’s a fun, easy-going romp through PlayStation history, and absolutely impossible to play without a smile plastered to your face.”</p>

<p>Astro Bot currently has a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/astro-bot/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5">Metacritic score </a>of 94 with 100% positive reviews, a nice win for Sony which they probably needed after the mess that was Concord.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/TeamAsobi">Team Asobi</a> have yet to comment on Astro Bot save bug but as there are many reports of it out in the wild I would expect a patch to be released as quickly as possible.</p>

		<p>Martyn&nbsp; Wear from Heaven 17 has revealed that Rockstar asked to use the classic track “Temptation” in<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6/"> Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, and he was initially excited.&nbsp; The excitement soon faded when he saw what they were offering., “IT WAS $7500 – for a buyout of any future royalties from the game – forever…”</p>



<p>In other words Heaven 17 would get just $7500 and that’s it, doesn’t matter how many copies of the game were sold. To explain why Martyn is annoyed you need to know how the music industry works, specifically compilation albums. If you get a track signed to a compilation you get a one off fee no matter how many copies are sold, and then a (very small) percentage of every copy over a certain number. For example you may get 10k up front, and then a percentage after 50,000 sales.</p>
<p>GTA V has sold over 200 million copies and the radio stations are essentially compilation albums, albeit in game, so you can see Martyn’s side of the argument, artists should get paid for their work.</p>

<p>Sadly many people online are attacking Martyn saying he should be grateful for the “exposure” of being in a high profile game. To reiterate the well worn saying, exposure does not pay bills.</p>
<p>Have a bop to the original version of Temptation below or if you’re feeling epic, try the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6nK3EHYIiE">11 minute Brothers in Rhythm Remix.&nbsp;</a></p>
