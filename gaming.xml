			<p>A new entry in the Virtua Fighter series has finally been confirmed to be in the works today.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/why-sega-is-reviving-classics-like-shinobi-and-jet-set-radio-across-games-film-and-tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VGC</a> about bringing back classic SEGA franchises like Shinobi and Set Radio across games, movies, and TV, global head of transmedia Justin Scarpone casually confirmed that a new entry in the fighting game series that has been left dormant for years is in development. While nothing else was added about the game, it is very nice to know that the series is about to make a grand comeback.</p>
<p>While welcome, the confirmation of a new Virtua Fighter game currently being in development is hardly surprising, as SEGA somewhat brought the franchise back with Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown, an enhanced remake of the fifth entry in the series, which was released on PlayStation 4 in 2021. The game bested the publisher's expectations, who did not hide <a href="https://wccftech.com/virtua-fighter-5-ultimate-showdown-successful-future-games-considered/">future plans for the series</a>, which are coming to fruition with the newly announced game, rumored to be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-reboot-details/">reboot</a> launching on all major platforms complete with cross-platform play support and rollback netcode.</p>
<p>You can learn more about the aforementioned latest entry in the series, Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown, on its <a href="https://virtuafighter5us.sega.com/lang/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

<p>You know, I’m a total sucker for Stardew Valley. I grew up playing cutesy farming sim games, like the original Harvest Moon titles, and that love stuck with me despite my gaming tastes becoming more mature. It’s easy to love the indie farming hit, as developer ConcernedApe continuously updates and improves the core experience. Now, we’re treated to the latest Stardew Valley console update—update 1.6—and it’s enormous!</p>



<h2 id="h-stardew-valley-update-1-6-patch-notes">Stardew Valley Update 1.6 Patch Notes</h2>



<p>Prepare yourself because this is a positively huge update that touches upon most aspects of gameplay, including festivals, an all-new farm type, the ability to acquire multiple pets, a world map for Ginger Island, bug fixes, quality-of-life improvements, better mod support, and so much more. It enhances Stardew Valley on consoles tenfold!</p>



<blockquote>

</ul>
</li>



<li>Price changes:
<ul>
<li>Most home renovations now cost money, which is refunded if you undo the renovation. (The game knows whether you bought it though, so refunding a pre-1.6 renovation won’t give you free money.)</li>

<li>You can no longer lose the Golden Scythe, Infinity weapons, or tools.</li>



<li>You can no longer lose more than three items.</li>



<li>The amount of money lost now scales to how much you have. It’s now less punishing if you don’t have much money, but more punishing if you have a lot. This also raises the maximum lost from 5000g to 15000g.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
</li>



<li>Spouse changes:
<ul>
<li>Spouses now have a seven-day “honeymoon” period after marriage which prevents them from laying in bed all day due to being upset.</li>

<li>Friendship gain is reduced by 33% for spouses.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Rebalanced the&nbsp;crop fairy&nbsp;event: the chance no longer depends on the number of planted crops, it can no longer happen on the last day of the season (to avoid growing crops that might die overnight), and it can no longer choose dead crops to grow.</li>



<li>Increased the&nbsp;shaving enchantment‘s effect on&nbsp;giant crops.</li>



<li>The&nbsp;mushroom cave&nbsp;now provides mushrooms every second day. It was unintentionally changed to daily in Stardew Valley 1.5.</li>



<li>You can no longer plant trees in the beach farm tunnel.</li>



<li>Randomization no longer produces simple repeating patterns in many cases (e.g. clay farming, mushroom level prediction, crab pot fish offset, etc).(You can enable “Use Legacy Randomization” in the&nbsp;advanced save options&nbsp;to use the old randomization, though some specific patterns may still change due to the underlying changes. That option is mainly intended for speedrunners; most players should keep it disabled for the intended experience.)</li>



<li>Spreading&nbsp;weeds&nbsp;can no longer destroy&nbsp;artifact spots.</li>



<li>Increased the number of monsters that daily monster quests will ask you to slay (in some cases). Added more custom quantities, for example Dust Spirits will ask for 10-20 kills.</li>

<ul>
<li>Performance improvements.</li>



<li>NPCs now shove chests out of their way instead of destroying them.</li>

<li>Crystalariums now have to be removed and replaced before a different gem can be put inside, to help avoid wasting gems accidentally.</li>



<li>Daily billboard quests now have a more informative tracker notification when you make progress on them.</li>



<li>Added a small checkmark icon on special orders you’ve completed before (only on town special orders board).</li>



<li>You can now skip the pet adoption scene, which causes you to adopt the pet.</li>



<li>Reduced the amount of time you need to push against a pet before they start shaking and then let you pass through them (1.5 → .75 seconds).</li>



<li>Reduced time for mini-obelisk warp (750ms faster).</li>



<li>Male farmers are no longer forced into wedding clothes on their wedding day, so you can choose your own outfit for the wedding.</li>

I haven't touched Bloodborne Remake for a year for 50 reasons (too big, too risky to finally be C&amp;D).</p><p> But last week I decided to start a new project from scratch, Bloodborne Top Down Arena</p><p>Maybe you won't like it, but I'm enjoying developing it and playing it 😂 <a href="https://t.co/OPont0sS45" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/OPont0sS45</a></p></div>— Maxime Foulquier (@MaximFoulquier) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaximFoulquier/status/1853835793388953662?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 5, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The gameplay looks very much as you’d expect: FromSoftware’s hugely popular Bloodborne but with the camera pulled up into an action RPG perspective. The repurposed Bloodborne combat is action RPG snappy, perhaps a good fit for a Diablo-style game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Foulquier <a href="https://x.com/MaximFoulquier/status/1853834672347758739" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> Bloodborne Top Down Arena is "less ambitious and different from a true remake” of Bloodborne, so hopes it will avoid falling into the crosshairs of Sony’s lawyers. “The Demake and the Minecraft Project didn't receive CnD so I cross the fingers,” Foulquier added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that the developer behind Bloodborne Nightmare Kart <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nightmare-kart-bloodborne-kart-release-date">ended up re-jipping the game after Sony got in touch</a>, so perhaps Foulquier is being a little naive here. Foulquier insisted, however, that because Bloodborne Top Down Arena is not planned for release on Steam, it will avoid a similar fate.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Yeah but I don't want to release this on Steam.</p>— Maxime Foulquier (@MaximFoulquier) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaximFoulquier/status/1854087594008617080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 6, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, what Bloodborne fans really want is a sequel to the PS4 classic, or, saving that, a next-gen update for the original game. Neither are so far announced from either FromSoftware or Sony. In February, ahead of the launch of FromSoftware’s Elden Ring expansion Shadow of the Erdtree, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftwares-miyazaki-responds-to-calls-for-bloodborne-remake-on-ps5">director Hidetaka Miyazaki said that because the developer doesn’t own the Bloodborne IP</a>, he can’t speak about its future. He did, however, admit Bloodborne would benefit from releasing on more modern hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-ps5-pro-can-you-see-the-difference">IGN has had a look at Bloodborne running on the PS5 Pro</a>, which launches November 7 priced $700. And then there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-no-bloodborne-remake-but-there-is-a-bloodborne-outfit-for-astro-bot">the Bloodborne cameo in recently released PS5 exclusive Astro Bot</a>, if you’re desperate for a fix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Once players have collected one of each of these Pokémon the 3 Star Mew card will unlock.</p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/06/mew-1730901811705.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The 3 Star Mew card in Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket.</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The only condition is the cards must also be from Genetic Apex, meaning, for example, that collecting the promotional Butterfree card from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-releases-lapras-ex-through-limited-time-battle-event">the special Lapras ex event</a> won't count towards the 150 total despite it being among the first 150 Pokémon. Any version of the Pokémon from Genetic Apex will work, however, whether it's an ex or alternative art or regular or whatever else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While simple, collecting so many cards may still take some time. One player recently worked out it could take almost two years of daily play to collect every card in the set, though thankfully hitting the 150 necessary for Mew will require considerably less time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mew holds a special place in the set as one of just four 3 Star cards, meaning it's one of the special immersive cards with fully animated artwork. It joins Charizard, Pikachu, and Mewtwo in this category, the three Pokémon which feature on the booster pack covers of Genetic Apex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived in October as a streamlined, digital version of the beloved trading card game.

			<p>It doesn't come as much of a surprise that Pokemon has sold such a massive amount of units on the Nintendo Switch, considering how die-hard the Pokemon community is. Some of the releases on Nintendo Switch have been a bit rockier than others, but overall, they still perform incredibly well. In Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest earnings announcement</a>, it's been confirmed that more than 99 million Pokemon games have been sold for the Nintendo Switch alone. Considering that Nintendo has been struggling a fair bit this year, this seems like a significant milestone and achievement to hit amidst the lull in record-breaking releases.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch launched in 2017 and is still going relatively strong despite the hardware's beginning to age. At this time, we've seen the Nintendo Switch Lite and the Nintendo Switch OLED be released, with a successor to the Nintendo Switch being announced in the past year. More details of this successor are meant to be announced within this fiscal year, but it seems to be slipping away quickly, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-end-of-the-year/">minimal further information</a> coming out. However, it was announced that the successor of the Nintendo Switch will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-confirmed-to-be-backward-compatible/">backward compatible</a>, which is a huge relief to many.</p>
<p>Since the release of the Nintendo Switch, plenty of games within the Pokemon universe have been released, such as Pokemon Let's Go, Pokemon Sword and Shield, and even some of the older titles like the original Pokemon Snap being available with the use of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack. Their most recent title, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet seems to have been the rockiest one so far, as the graphics weren't what fans were hoping for, and even today, the game is heavily riddled with bugs in both solo and co-op play.</p>
<p>Pokemon Legends: Arceus did incredibly well despite the drastic changes they took when creating this game. You could go out and throw Poke balls at Pokemon without battling, and there were 'boss' fights to participate in, as well as side quests. It felt more like an RPG than a creature collector or pet battler game. The next Pokemon game is due to release in 2025, and is another Pokemon Legends game. The title is called Pokemon Legends: Z-A, taking players back to the Kalos region.</p>
<p>When it comes to franchises performing well on the Nintendo Switch, both Pokemon and The Legend of Zelda are highly successful, with the Zelda franchise selling over 53 million units on Switch. Despite that, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe remains the best-selling Switch game of all time, with more than 64 million copies sold.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warner Bros has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>sales have topped yet another huge sales milestone, further cementing the game's importance as a cornerstone of the studio's gaming strategy.</p>

<p>As noted in <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/harry-potter-franchise-future-tv-series-video-games-1236201249/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a Variety article</a>,&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>has now reached 30 million sales "as of last month" (that's Variety's wording), which means it's picked up another 15 million sales between <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-smash-through-15-million-barrier">May 2023</a> and now. That's pretty impressive, even given the game's high profile.</p>

<p>Variety also notes that&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>was the top-selling game across the board in 2023, meaning it beat huge releases like&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake (not to mention being the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/google-year-end-search-list-gaming-2023">most-Googled game of that year</a> as well).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-sales-dragon.jpg?itok=fKlBqvwN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-sales-dragon.jpg?itok=cDdurZF6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>is, surprise surprise, a big seller for Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure><p>Warner Bros. Interactive president David Haddad says the company is currently thinking hard about the sequel to <i>Hogwarts Legacy</i>, acknowledging that fans of the franchise are "looking for more things in this world" and that his studio is "spending a lot of time" considering how to give them what they want.</p>

<p>If you're someone who disagrees with&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter&nbsp;</em>writer J.K. Rowling's political stances, you might be dismayed to learn that while Rowling doesn't directly manage the franchise, Warner Bros is keeping her updated "via her literary agent" (again, that's Variety's wording, not WB's).</p>

<p>This news comes after it was reported that&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>developer Rocksteady is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut-report">currently working on a Director's Cut version</a> of&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, although no official announcement on Rocksteady or Warner Bros' part has been made on that front.</p>

<p>It may even have been&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>'s failure that led to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-suicide-squad">layoffs at the studio</a>&nbsp;in September, although the studio is reportedly in the midst of pitching a new single-player game that would return it to its&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham</em>-style roots (although it's not necessarily part of that franchise).</p>

<p>Old School RuneScape’s mobile version turns six years old today, and to celebrate that milestone, Jagex has rolled out a major update that adds new features and ‘revamps’ the game’s UI to make it more streamlined and intuitive.</p>



<p>It has been almost 24 years since RuneScape was first released, and it’s still one of the world’s most popular MMORPGs today. The mobile version of the game is how gamers on the go are enjoying an open-world, retro adventure.</p>



<p>Read on to check out the changes the team has made to Old School RuneScape on mobile.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-better-than-ever-before">‘Better Than Ever Before’</h2>



<p>Per a press release, Jagex has tweaked the mobile experience of Old School RuneScape to ‘make playing the classic MMO on the go better than ever before.’</p>



<p>That’s a bold claim, but if the patch notes are anything to go by, the team has certainly gone some way towards making that true:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Side Stones:&nbsp;</strong>Players can find their stones for high-intensity gameplay and more laid-back encounters divided into columns, complete with a handy button to minimise the second column for when you need to focus on the task at hand.</li>



<li><strong>Hotkeys:&nbsp;</strong>Five custom hotkeys allow for a variety of actions, settings, and stats to be displayed. Swap between PvM and Skilling as easy as the touch of a button and alter your hotkeys based on the activity at hand with ease.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Popout Panel:&nbsp;</strong>The Popout Panel gives players an insight into future additions coming to the game well as XP tracking, settings for Ground Item Indicators, and lots of features and options. With a new compact design, the Popout Panel provides a minimalist aid for players to keep the focus on gameplay.</li>



<li><strong>New Chat:&nbsp;</strong>With a new polished interface, the chat function can now be collapsed with the brand-new toggle button, featuring a bigger and better easy-to-use keyboard button to make gameplay the forefront of the screen.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Menu Entry Swapper:&nbsp;</strong>A recent major quality-of-life improvement, the Menu Entry Swapper has landed in the mobile version of Old School RuneScape. The MES, allows players to swap interactable elements of both NPCs and other entities, as well as Examine, Use, Cancel and more.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>HiScores:&nbsp;</strong>Get ready to have a deeper understanding of your opponents as HiScores become available to find within the game client. Stored alongside the side panel with the XP Tracker, HiScores will let players get the upper hand on hopeful opponents climbing up Mount Karuulm and the Agility Shortcut.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The update is available for free to all users from today.</p>

Renowned for its explosive 3D graphics and high intensity gameplay, <em>Under Defeat</em> features no less than three game modes offering high levels of replayability, all of which have been integrated under supervision of G.rev.</p><p>Arcade Mode faithfully replicates the original arcade experience, with a 4:3 ratio and a pseudo vertical screen.

But on the bright side, Stardew Valley creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has offered players a (temporary) solution to the problem: Take the hats off your pets.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1853889827294650577" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">PSA: if you are experiencing performance issues in Stardew Valley 1.6, remove all hats from pets.

But while many third-party franchises have toyed with LEGO collaboration in gaming, it’s a bit of a shock to see <em>LEGO Horizon Adventures</em>—based on a first-party Sony franchise—landing at our feet. </p><p>Despite how unusual it seems for <em>LEGO Horizon Adventures</em>, you may be even more surprised to see that it’s every bit the type of LEGO game fans have come to know and love over the years. So whether you’re on the fence about purchasing this new entry, or you’re just curious what to expect when you do, here’s what you should know about <em>LEGO Horizon Adventures</em>.</p></div></div><div><p><em>LEGO Horizon Adventures</em> is a kind of loose retelling of <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, the 2017 PS4 open-world RPG, in a colorful, lighthearted LEGO world. It maintains the characters from the main series—Ashly Burch even reprises her role as main character Aloy—but the LEGO spin gives the whole experience a far more casual and family-friend vibe that ensures it’s accessible to all. Expect plenty of goofy humor and some abbreviated plot points as the game aims to keep you laughing and playing rather than watching cutscenes or reading dialogue.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, you don’t exclusively control Aloy this time around. Instead, like many LEGO games before it, <em>LEGO Horizon Adventures</em> allows you to unlock and play as a wider selection of characters, such as Varl, Rost, and Teersa. You can even equip various cosmetics to further customize your playtime, including costumes based on other beloved PlayStation characters. <br></p><p>Speaking of customization, you can also rearrange various things back at the central hub of Mother’s Heart—an iconic returning location from <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>. In an effort to make things genuinely feel like you’re inhabiting a LEGO world, you can mix and match things all across Mother’s Heart to make it really feel like your own creation.  </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b93c43fa74daf11f57e83e385d90319a" data-recommend-id="image://b93c43fa74daf11f57e83e385d90319a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aloy and Varl run across a LEGO jungle map." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aloy and Varl run across a LEGO jungle map." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b93c43fa74daf11f57e83e385d90319a" data-recommend-id="image://b93c43fa74daf11f57e83e385d90319a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aloy and Varl run across a LEGO jungle map." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>LEGO Horizon Adventures </em>was co-developed by Guerrilla Games and Studio Gobo. </p><p>As you probably know, the former is the developer of the mainline <em>Horizon </em>franchise, so you can rest assured that the team’s love of the series is in full swing here. The latter, however, has also made a name for itself by co-developing AAA titles like <em>Redfall </em>and <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, working hand in hand among the biggest teams in the business. In other words, you’re in good hands all around.  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c1ec8ec5c9db8a1f7e5253bd6b62a0a4" data-recommend-id="image://c1ec8ec5c9db8a1f7e5253bd6b62a0a4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two characters with customization menus are shown in a screenshot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two characters with customization menus are shown in a screenshot." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c1ec8ec5c9db8a1f7e5253bd6b62a0a4" data-recommend-id="image://c1ec8ec5c9db8a1f7e5253bd6b62a0a4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two characters with customization menus are shown in a screenshot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While the previous games in the <em>Horizon </em>franchise have been solo affairs, multiplayer fans can rejoice because <em>LEGO Horizon Adventures </em>features 2-player co-op. Even better, you can opt to play with a friend online or someone sitting right next to you on the couch. That being said, if you want to take things online, don’t forget that you’ll need a PlayStation Plus subscription. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cb2b12d8b9c5e491da355d7b7bd49404" data-recommend-id="image://cb2b12d8b9c5e491da355d7b7bd49404" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A tall neck walks next to Aloy and another Horizon character." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A tall neck walks next to Aloy and another Horizon character." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cb2b12d8b9c5e491da355d7b7bd49404" data-recommend-id="image://cb2b12d8b9c5e491da355d7b7bd49404" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A tall neck walks next to Aloy and another Horizon character." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>LEGO Horizon Adventures </em>is available on PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC. And yes, you read that right—in a stunning turn of events, a first-party PlayStation franchise is landing on a Nintendo console!</p><p>While the game will be more or less identical across platforms, it’s worth noting that both PS5 and PC will provide significantly better visuals and performance.

			<p>Before the first minute was up, I knew Metro Awakening was going to be good. The dark tunnels and rooms of the post-apocalyptic Moscow Metro system make for the perfect setting for a VR game, with developer Vertigo Games able to add so much interactivity to the ideas and mechanics from previous Metro games, while retaining all of the charm, and indeed horror, from its non-VR brothers.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metro Awakening | PS VR2 Extended Gameplay Video" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E4-hYHLj7_g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Set mostly in 2028 you play as a Doctor called Serdar, a survivor of the nuclear holocaust and resident of the Metro systems in Moscow. His wife seems to be hearing the voice if their long dead son and you are soon on a quest to work out exactly is happening, exploring themes of grief and mental health as you do so.</p>


<p>The prologue does a great job of setting the scene for newcomers or reminding Metro fans just what was great about the games. You wander through one of the station camps which is packed full of details and this, combined with lots of NPCs chattering away and some superb lighting and graphics, really brings the experience to life. Within a few minutes of playing you forget that you’re in VR and really feel like you are there – something many games fail to achieve.</p>
<p>The controls are well thought out with realistic weapon loading mechanics and the usual holsters on your hips and over your shoulder to store guns – it’s basically the same set up as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/06/arizona-sunshine-2-review/">Arizona Sunshine 2</a> and Vertigo Games’ other recent titles.</p>


<p>Metro has always had some retro and survivalist tech, but now the mechanics of winding up hand held generator to create electricity for your head lamp has been made fully interactive. In fact, all the mechanics from the Metro games have been reworked for VR, from putting on your gas mask and changing filters to simple touches such as turning your headlamp on and off by raising your controller above your head to click a button. These could have been simplified or even automated, but by making them all interactive it adds a whole new layer to the game. Frantically trying to attach a new filter as you slowly choke to the death is a terrifying experience.</p>
<p>There’s also been a lot of thought put in for how you move about, VR games often have trouble with ledges and jumps and you spend ages positing the character. In Awakening you just need to move forward you will automatically perform the action, while the climbing ladders – which was a bit of a chore in Arizona Sunshine 2 and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/17/arizona-sunshine-remake-review/">Remake</a> – has also been made easier.</p>
<p>Apart from one frantic set piece at the start of the game, you are slowly eased in to combat. There’s little-to-no aim assist and with the very limited ammo you’re going to have get good at shooting straight and fast. There’s not many guns in the game but they all play like rusty old Soviet weapons that have been in use for years. They all kick like a mule, so getting those headshots is a must.</p>

<p>There are large battles with multiple enemies, literal on-the-rails sections as you zoom down train tunnels firing massive guns, quieter horror-tinged moments as you creep about and enemies spring from the dark, and stealth sections. I’m not usually fond of stealth, but Awakening confounded expectations and made stealth a heart racing game of cat and mouse, hiding in the dark corners and craning your neck out just far enough to see where the enemies are.</p>
<p>The Metro games have always had great scripts and Awakening is no different with original novelist Dmitry Glukhovsky writing the story. As you play you are accompanied by various characters on your radio and these propel the narrative forward in a very natural way, especially when Max and Serdar are chatting away like the old friends that they are. Peppered throughout the story are short cutscenes, many of which play like an out of body experience and feature an unexpected “celebrity” special guest.</p>
<p>The voice work and animation is spot on and, one again, adds to the immersion. Characters really feel like they are talking to you, with naturalistic “uhms” and “ahs” punctuating their dialogue, rather than the precise chat you get in many games. Another nice touch is that NPC’s eyes and head will, within reason, try and be focussed on you while they are talking. It’s just a small thing that’s fairly common in flat screen games and you probably wouldn’t pay attention to, but it’s another detail that keeps you immersed in the game.</p>
<p>The game also makes full use of PS5 and PSVR 2’s haptic feedback and spatial audio. As you might expect, the weapons provide jolts to the controllers but there plenty of other touches, most notably when you attacked by giant face hugging spiders. After jumping right in to your face they scuttle round the back of your head and the haptic feedback in the PSVR 2 headset revs up so that it honestly feels like there’s a massive spider crawling round the back of your skull. It is <em>horrible!</em>&nbsp;I <em>loved</em> it!</p>

<p>The audio is a key component to the game, you have to listen for the directions of footsteps when playing stealth sections and there are plenty of growls to warn you if you are entering an area full of mutant creatures. There is also a very annoying audio puzzle which requires you to listen to faint singing and follow its direction. Audio puzzles are never great and this one is hampered by loud and similar sounding incidental effects firing off in the background. Outside of the populated stations the graphics do become a little more basic, but low light level throughout most of the game allow these fairly simple images look much better than they actually are. By the way, the provided screenshots for this review are most likely taken from the PC version with all sorts of fancy lighting and shadows, playing on PSVR 2 does not look as good as they do, and Meta Quest will also drop quality down further.</p>
<p>Metro Awakening takes somewhere between ten to twelve hours to complete, but does feel slightly padded towards the end – fighting the dog-like enemies stops becoming scary after a while, though it’s still fun. I would have liked a little more variation in locations as well, as you never really get to go above ground which was a big part of the previous games. There was also a small amount of occasional texture pop in on PS5, something that didn’t really annoy me but was one of the few things that ever broke my immersion.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-employees-strike</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dont-nod-employees-to-strike-this-week-following-layoff-announcement.1028790/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-employees-strike<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Employees at&nbsp;<em>Life Is Strange&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden&nbsp;</em>developer Don't Nod will go on strike this week, following an announcement of sweeping layoffs at the studio.</p>

<p>Last month, Don't Nod announced that up to 69 employees' jobs could be at risk after a period of underperformance for the company. French union STJV then <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-strike-stjv-union">called on employees to strike</a>, describing Don't Nod's redundancy plan as "the climax of a series of catastrophic decisions".</p>

<p>Now, according to a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dont-nod-workers-to-strike-on-november-8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz report</a>, it seems that strike is indeed going ahead on Friday. The strike's picket line will apparently be next to the studio's Paris HQ, and employees are due to gather at 2pm local time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-dont-nod-strike.jpg?itok=DR_SA-Nm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-dont-nod-strike.jpg?itok=O5JdCP8e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Employees from Don't Nod will go on strike on Friday.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the GI.biz report, employee demands include management abandoning the aforementioned redundancy plan, giving employees greater decision-making power at the studio, and CEO Oskar Guilbert attending the negotiations.</p>

<p>An open letter from Don't Nod employees also highlights what they call "delusions of grandeur" and "short-term thinking" at the studio, leading to what they describe as "a succession of negligent acts and bad decisions" on management's part.</p>

<p>The employees conclude by saying they want to save their studio, but "not at the price of unjustified redundancies or a deteriorated working environment".</p>

<p>This situation is occurring after what has been a trying period for Don't Nod, with several of the studio's recent projects, including climbing sim&nbsp;<em>Jusant&nbsp;</em>and action-RPG&nbsp;<em>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-financials-first-half-2024">underperforming compared to expectations</a>.</p>

<p>The potential layoffs at the studio also come as part of a wider wave that's sweeping across the industry, catching big companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs">Sony</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs">Take-Two</a>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-developer-zaum-confirms-game-cancellation-and-layoffs">smaller studios</a>, in its wake.</p>

Its X3D chips have provided a boost that Intel has been unable to match, and its new $479 Ryzen 7 9800X3D goes a step further to not only improve gaming performance but also day-to-day tasks and creative workloads.</p><p>The first desktop Zen 5 CPUs were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220250/amd-zen-5-cpu-reviews-ryzen-9-9950x">disappointing in gaming</a>, but the 9800X3D, which arrives on November 7th, makes some big improvements over the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/5/23668320/amd-ryzen-7-7800x3d-review-cpu-processor-benchmark-test">already-great Ryzen 7 7800X3D</a>. I’ve been testing it over the past week, and I’ve found big improvements to productivity workloads, alongside around an 8 percent jump in gaming performance.</p><p>Just like the $449 7800X3D, if you mostly play games on your PC, then the 9800X3D should be your next CPU.</p><div><p><h3><a data-item-id="k4hwn0" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?st=9800X3D&amp;_dyncharset=UTF-8&amp;_dynSessConf=&amp;id=pcat17071&amp;type=page&amp;sc=Global&amp;cp=1&amp;nrp=&amp;sp=&amp;qp=&amp;list=n&amp;af=true&amp;iht=y&amp;usc=All+Categories&amp;ks=960&amp;keys=keys">AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D</a></h3></p><p><span>$<!-- -->479</span></p><p>AMD’s new Ryzen 7 9800X3D is built on the Zen 5 architecture and includes second-generation 3D V-Cache. AMD has improved the base and boost clocks to make this CPU better at both gaming and productivity tasks.</p></div><p>AMD’s productivity improvements with the 9800X3D are largely thanks to a redesign of the processor. AMD is using a second generation of its 3D V-Cache technology that sees the cache now sit below the processor cores. It’s a big difference that means the processor cores have better access to cooling and the cache is now less sensitive to high temperatures. That’s the big reason AMD has been able to ramp up the base clock speed by 500MHz and add an additional 200MHz to the boost clock.</p><p>Both of these clock speed increases have helped boost productivity performance, alongside the Zen 5 architecture. For the first time on an X3D chip, AMD is even supporting overclocking, which should mean we’ll see some even more impressive results from this processor.</p><div><p>AMD test machine:</p><div><ul><li>CPU cooler: Corsair H150i Elite LCD</li><li>Motherboard: Gigabyte Aorus Master (EXPO enabled and default BIOS options)</li><li>RAM: 32GB G.Skill DDR5-6000</li><li>GPU: Nvidia RTX 4090 Founders Edition</li><li>Storage: Samsung 970 Evo Plus 2TB</li><li>PSU: Corsair HX1000W</li></ul></div><p>Intel test machine:</p><div><ul><li>CPU cooler: Corsair H150i Elite LCD</li><li>Motherboard: MSI MAG Z790 Carbon Wi-Fi for i9-14900K / Asus ROG Strix Z890-A Gaming Wifi for Core Ultra 9 285K</li><li>RAM: 32GB Corsair Dominator Platinum DDR5 6600</li><li>GPU: Nvidia RTX 4090 Founders Edition</li><li>Storage: Samsung 970 Evo Plus 2TB (14900K) / Samsung 980 Pro 2TB (285K)</li><li>PSU: Corsair HX1000W</li></ul></div></div><p>I’ve been testing AMD’s Ryzen 7 9800X3D with a Gigabyte X870E Aorus Master motherboard, 32GB of G.Skill DDR5-6000, and Nvidia’s RTX 4090. This is one of the latest AM5 motherboards, but the 9800X3D will work with existing AM5 boards thanks to BIOS updates.</p><p>I’ve tested a variety of workloads, synthetic benchmarks, and games across AMD’s new Ryzen 7 9800X3D, its existing 7800X3D, and Intel’s $589 Core i9-14900K and Core Ultra 9 285K. All the tests were run on Windows 11 (version 24H2) with virtualization-based security (VBS) and resizable BAR enabled.</p><p>All tests are performed at 1080p resolution to analyze raw CPU performance. Like most <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zy3w-VZyoiM">other CPU reviewers</a>, we don’t test at 1440p or 4K in games to ensure we’re demonstrating the differences between CPUs. Most games demand more from the GPU at higher resolutions, instead of the CPU. But a better CPU can still help out at 4K, especially for upscaling technologies like DLSS or in CPU-heavy titles like <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, and <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em>.</p><p>AMD’s Ryzen 7 9800X3D blows the 7800X3D away in productivity and creator workloads. It’s not even close. In Geekbench 6, the 9800X3D is around 20 percent faster than the 7800X3D in both single-threaded and multithreaded performance. In Cinebench 2024, it’s nearly 16 percent faster for the single-thread test and a massive 27 percent faster on the multithreaded workload.</p><p>Even in Premiere Pro and Photoshop PugetBench tests, the 9800X3D leaves the 7800X3D behind, with an 18 percent increase in performance in PugetBench for Photoshop and just shy of 10 percent in the Premiere Pro test.</p><p>These scores demonstrate the big improvements AMD has made to the 9800X3D for day-to-day tasks and creator workloads. It’s still largely behind Intel’s latest Core Ultra 9 285K in these workloads, but AMD has significantly closed the gap the 7800X3D had.</p><p>Over on the gaming side, AMD has extended its lead, especially against Intel’s Core Ultra 9 285K. Like many other reviewers, when I <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278407/intel-ultra-9-285k-benchmarks-performance-hands-on">tested Intel’s latest desktop CPU</a> last month, I found that it was a step back in gaming performance compared to the Core i9-14900K.</p><p>The 7800X3D already comfortably beat the 14900K and Core Ultra 9 285K, and the 9800X3D leaves Intel’s gaming CPU efforts even further behind. During my tests, I’ve found that the 9800X3D is around 8 percent faster in games than the 7800X3D. That’s exactly what AMD promised when it announced the 9800X3D, and in some games, it’s even higher.</p><p>In <em>Metro Exodus,</em> I saw frame rates with the 9800X3D that were nearly 14 percent higher than the 7800X3D.<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em> also improved by nearly 11 percent. To put that in perspective, the 9800X3D is 50 percent faster than Intel’s latest Core Ultra 9 285K in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> at 1080p. It’s an astonishing gap for Intel that suggests there must be some kind of bug with that particular combination of game and CPU. But the 9800X3D is still 38 percent faster than Intel’s previous 14900K, so AMD has an impressive advantage here either way.</p><p>If you want to squeeze even more performance out of the 9800X3D in games, Gigabyte offers an X3D turbo mode on the Aorus Master, which boosts single-thread performance by performing some bandwidth tuning, unifying CPU core distribution, and balancing some of the hardware power. The result is lower overall performance in workloads that rely on multithreaded performance but some increases in game performance, depending on the game.</p><p>I saw a 9 percent jump in performance in <em>Metro Exodus</em> with X3D turbo mode enabled, with just a 3 percent increase in<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em>. Other games saw a smaller increase, like <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> seeing a boost of nearly 2 percent. In 2023’s <em>Forza Motorsport, </em>the X3D turbo mode had no effect on performance. You definitely sacrifice multithreaded performance in creator workloads if you have this enabled in the BIOS, though.</p><p>This extra performance does come at a slight cost to power draw and thermals. During Cinebench 2024, I noticed the 9800X3D hit a CPU package temperature of 88 degrees Celsius, more than the 82C I saw on the 7800X3D during the same test. The 9800X3D also used 160 watts at its peak during this test, whereas the 7800X3D only hit 89 watts.&nbsp;</p><p>Both chips have a 120-watt TDP, but it’s clear that the 9800X3D is using this more often than not. During the <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> benchmark, the 9800X3D was using 131 watts, more than double the 63 watts that the 7800X3D was using for the same test. The 9800X3D power draw is still far behind Intel’s power-hungry 14900K during creator workloads, which pulls more than 260 watts during Cinebench tests. Power draw will also vary depending on the types of games you’re playing.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>AMD’s new Ryzen 7 9800X3D has a new generation of its 3D V-Cache technology.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>What’s clear to me with this 9800X3D is that AMD has now established an even more impressive gap over Intel in gaming performance, while shrinking the performance differences in productivity and creator workloads. I think this smaller gap on the non-gaming side will now tempt more creators who also play games over to AMD.&nbsp;</p><p>Intel sacrificed gaming performance in favor of efficiency with its Core Ultra 9 285K, but many PC gamers simply don’t care about power efficiency unless it results in significantly cooler temperatures and, therefore, better performance and less throttling. Intel’s sacrifices make the 9800X3D an obvious purchase if you want the best PC gaming performance, and the Core Ultra 9 285K is an obvious choice if you want the best in productivity and creator performance and play games very little or not at all.&nbsp;</p><p>If, like me, you’re someone who plays a lot of PC games but also renders 4K videos and needs great performance in productivity tasks, then it’s a tougher choice. Intel has always offered a good balance between creator workloads and gaming, but AMD beats it in gaming and is closing the gap on the productivity side. If I were mostly gaming, I would pick the 9800X3D or even wait to see what a <a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Press/News/2235">rumored 16-core</a> Ryzen 9000 X3D chip could deliver very soon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>More than 99 million Pokemon games have been sold for the Nintendo Switch alone. Nintendo confirmed this as part of the company's latest <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">earnings announcement.</a></p><p>Since the Switch launched in 2017, there have been numerous Pokemon games released for it, including Pokken Tournament, Pokemon Quest, Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu/Let's Go Eevee, Pokemon Sword and Shield, Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, and Pokemon Legends: Arceus, alongside older titles included with Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack.</p><p>Nintendo said the Pokemon series has "found a new home" on Switch, where the "scope of sales has greatly increased" over time. The 99 million sales figure represents Pokemon game sales on Switch through September 30, so the franchise will likely cross 100 million soon, if it hasn't already.</p><p>Nintendo has supported The Pokemon Company with legal assistance, as the two companies <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-is-suing-palworld-devs/1100-6526569/" data-ref-id="1100-6526569">filed suit against Palworld studio Pocketpair</a> pertaining to patent infringement claims. Nintendo owns a minority stake in The Pokemon Company and has been a steady partner over the years.</p><p>The next Pokemon game for Switch is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a/" data-ref-id="5000-619901">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>, which releases in 2025.</p><p>It's not just Pokemon that's having big success on Switch, as The Legend of Zelda series--spanning Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom--has sold 53 million units on Switch. And the best-selling Switch game of all time, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, has sold more than 64 million copies by itself for Switch.</p><p>More than 1.3 billion games have been sold to date for the Switch. That's the most for any Nintendo system ever, with the next closest being Nintendo DS (948.76 million).</p><p>Looking ahead, Nintendo has reconfirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-announcement-is-still-five-months-away-at-most/1100-6527576/" data-ref-id="1100-6527576">it will announce the Switch 2, or whatever the console is called, by April 2025</a>. The system <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-will-play-switch-1-games-nintendo-confirms/1100-6527598/" data-ref-id="1100-6527598">will play Switch 1 games</a>, and Nintendo Switch Online will be supported across both systems as well.</p>

            <p>"Never read the comments," is a truth much-rehearsed by senior games journalists, but I have long since levelled-up past this axiom and entered into a new world of benevolent narcissism. I <em>always</em> read the comments, for all commenters are my children. They exist to glorify and preserve me in my dotage. True, occasionally my children say things like "I think your writing and opinions are appalling, and that you deserve to be repeatedly run over by a herd of deer", but it is the nature of children to rebel.</p>
<p>All of which is to say that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/weve-temporarily-closed-comments-for-maintenance-but-theyll-be-back">the comments downtime during a tech transition</a> this week has been painful for me. I've missed you all! I don't have anything particular to say in this post - I just thought we could do with a place to convene after this long, strange purgatory of articles being published with no accompanying trickle or waterfall of reader insights. What have you all been up to? Any news to share? I hear there's been some kind of election somewhere. I promise you the comments outage is unrelated.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/steams-game-recording-feature-is-now-out-of-beta/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>All Steam users now have a brand new built-in system called Game Recording to take advantage of. This system allows you to create and share footage directly from Steam.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Steam’s Game Recording <a href="https://x.com/Steam/status/1853950924018118790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">introduces several features</a>, such as Background Recording, On-Demand Recording, Replay, Clip, and Share. Through Background Recording mode, players can continuously save footage on their preferred drive according to their specified duration and storage limits. On-demand recording, on the other hand, allows you to stop and start the recording process manually.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Replay allows players to jump back in time, helping them catch up on what they might have missed during their adventures. A new Recordings and Screenshots interface includes the Clips feature, allowing you to choose the specific gameplay footage you want to share. The Share feature in the same interface will enable you to share your game recordings with the world or between devices such as your PC, Steam Deck, and Mobile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, when using Steam Game Recording, a Steam Timeline is introduced, which features event markers, player-added markers, game-added markers, game mode indicators, and highlight views. These markers are great for editing and going back through the footage to find something specific. There are timeline-enhanced games that “proactively notify Steam when relevant events happen” to add game-event markers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game recording feature will also work with non-Steam titles as long as the Steam Overlay is running. However, the feature will not record your desktop; only the games you are playing will be recorded, and all footage will be stored on your hard drive. Lastly, Game Recording is Steam Deck verified so you can record on the go.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Steam now shows that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-now-shows-that-you-dont-actually-own-the-game-youre-buying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you don’t own the game you are buying</a>. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sparking-zero-tops-all-dragon-ball-games-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sparking Zero has topped all Dragon Ball games</a> on the platform. What are your thoughts on Steam’s Game Recording system?

Those paying $9.99 a month for the Premium Pass can collect all cards in 437 days, though the subscription would add up to almost $150 in this time.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/06/machamp-1730896591108.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The alternative art Machamp ex and the regular Machamp ex.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Those not desperate to collect every alternate art card, identifiable by their artwork expanding beyond the normal borders to cover the entire card, can do so in just 130 days, or 87 with the Premium Pass. Developer Creatures Inc. will presumably release a new set of 200 to 300 cards every three or four months, so those playing every day should just about be able to complete one before another comes out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket, like many other free-to-play mobile games with microtransactions, floods players with dozens of packs on their first day as they complete simple quests and gain large amounts of experience. But this generosity soon dries up as the option to pay real money for packs is waved in front of players, and those not willing to spend can open one new pack just every 12 hours. The Premium Pass lets players open one extra pack a day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">TCGPCollector also provided some tips on how players can optimize their collecting, recommending that Wonder Picks only be used to collect 2 Star rarity cards. Pokémon TCG Pocket cards are classified by rarity, with the standard 226 ranging from 1 Diamond to 4 Diamond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 60 alternate art cards range from 1 Star to 3 Stars, followed by three super special gold background Crown cards. Regular alternate arts are 1 Star, ex Pokémon are 2 Star, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-release-date-set-for-october">the special immersive cards with fully animated artwork</a> are 3 Star.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most efficient way to collect cards is therefore only to pick out alternate art ex Pokémon in Wonder Picks, though it's far from guaranteed one will appear in the regularly rotating spots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, players should only use Pack Points to obtain the 3 Star and Crown cards. These are the points players acquire for opening regular booster packs, obtained at the rate of five per pack. Cards at 3 Star cost 1,500 points, demanding the opening of 300 packs, and Crown cards cost 2,500 points, meaning 500 packs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It will obviously take a long time to get there, but TCGPCollector is essentially recommending players play the long game and not be tempted to exchange Pack Points for cheap cards they'll come across in booster packs eventually.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, the last recommendation implores players not to use Poké Gold to buy packs, noting that the Premium Pass and, again, a little patience, is a much better way to spend money. Spending $9.99 on a Poké Gold bundle instead of the Premium Pass, for example, would allow players to open just nine packs compared to the 30 accrued over the course of a month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the best shop bundle, which grants 690 Poké Gold for $99.99, grants just 115 packs and therefore averages out at 87 cents per pack. This is much more than the 33 cents per pack average from the Premium Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This financial logic isn't enough to stop many, many players from buying bundles of Poké Gold, of course. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-early-days-but-pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-already-looks-like-a-smash-hit">Pokémon TCG Pocket pulled in a whopping $12 million in its first four days</a>, so the simple routine of opening packs, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-a-snazzy-way-to-carry-a-pokemon-card-binder-in-your-pocket">collecting cards</a>, building decks, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-love-farfetchd-and-theyre-absolutely-right">battling others</a> is certainly enticing enough to open the purse strings of players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The digital, streamlined version of the traditional Pokémon Trading Card Game is keeping players entertained in other ways, with Creatures Inc. having already launched two events including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-releases-lapras-ex-through-limited-time-battle-event">one that allows players to win a Lapras ex</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players may otherwise want to keep an eye out from cards from the two decks currently dominating the Pokémon TCG Pocket meta, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">headlined by usual suspects Charizard ex and Mewtwo ex</a>.

We never confirmed it. There were some discussions of course. There was some misalignment, there was some misinformation, but at the end of the day there won’t be any Denuvo at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“With that, I would like you to close the case already. Stop texting under every post we do that Denuvo is in the game, because it’s not. We never announced… we never said it will be there.

Clearly, though, that is not the case.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 - Gamescom 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Denuvo is a controversial system used by video game developers and publishers to stem the tide of video game piracy by, they hope, pushing back the release of cracked versions of their games by sometimes weeks, maybe months, and in some cases, indefinitely. From a publisher perspective, Denuvo helps to prevent lost sales and revenue it might have received if those who pirate a video game at launch would have otherwise bought it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Denuvo is often criticized by PC gamers for potentially affecting video game performance and even reducing the life-span of solid-state drives (SSDs). Denuvo has repeatedly denied the claims. In 2021, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-resident-evil-village-cracked-performance-beats-official-code" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Digital Foundry</u></a> found the pirate version of Resident Evil Village actually improved performance. Capcom later patched the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, we’ve seen some developers even announce that their games won’t launch with Denuvo, much to the delight of PC gamers. In October, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-does-not-include-any-3rd-party-drm-including-denuvo">BioWare confirmed <u>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</u> wouldn’t have third-party DRM of any kind</a>, including Denuvo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, it’s set to launch February 11, 2025.

                <p>Valve has announced that Steam Game Recording has been released for all PC and Steam Deck users. The new built-in system for game recording offers a variety of tools for users, allowing them to capture highlights of their gameplay, record lengthy play sessions, and share them online through the Steam overlay.</p><p>Similar to Nvidia's GeForce Experience, Steam Game Recording has a background-recording mode. This can be fine-tuned to continually record footage while you play according to a specified duration and storage limits. The recording software also offers a quick-replay function so you can see where you went wrong in a game, as well as tools to make it easy to find and clip your gameplay footage. Gameplay will be recorded in an MPEG-4 format, in a folder designated by the user.</p><p>This could be especially interesting for users, as you'll be able to drop markers as reference points and Steam has provided tools for developers to create "timeline-enhanced" games that can proactively notify Steam when relevant events happen. "These events are represented along the timeline with details specified by developers," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/gamerecording" rel="nofollow ">Steam explained</a>.</p><p>The timeline-enhanced feature could be where Steam stands out from other game-recording options, as Nvidia and Windows don't offer a function like this within their respective applications. Valve says that Steam Game Recording has been designed to use minimal computer resources, as it uses your Nvidia or AMD graphics cards to help with the recording workload.</p><h2>How to enable Steam Game Recording</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4395338-steam-recording.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4395338" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4395338-steam-recording.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4395338"></a><figcaption>Once Steam is updated, you can start tweaking the settings.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4395338-steam-recording.jpg"></figure><ul><li>Ensure that Steam is updated</li><li>Click on Steam in the top-left corner of the client</li><li>Click on settings</li><li>Select "Game Recording"</li><li>Adjust settings to your preferences</li><li>Press CTRL+F11 to start recording gameplay footage manually</li></ul><p>It's also worth noting that Steam Game Recording works for any game that supports the Steam Overlay, but it may not work for some older games.</p>

            <p>Workers at Don't Nod - the studio behind the likes of Jusant, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> 1 and 2, and upcoming release Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage - are set to strike this Friday, 8th November.</p>
<p>The strike is in reaction to the studio's redundancy plan, which it announced in October.</p>
<p>As Matt reported last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jusant-lost-records-studio-dont-nod-says-69-jobs-at-risk-as-part-of-reorganisation-project">69 jobs at the studio are at risk</a>, as Don't Nod initiates a "reorganisation project to ensure the company's long-term future" amid "deteriorating" financial results.</p>

<p>In an open letter seen and translated by Eurogamer's sister-site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dont-nod-workers-to-strike-on-november-8">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Don't Nod workers accused studio leadership of failing to take responsibility for its own shortcomings, instead using economical context as a justification for the redundancy plan.</p>
<p>"As workers at this company, we know that these failures are due to a succession of negligent acts and bad decisions from leadership," the letter reads. "We have warned leadership about these failures for years, but are not being listened to. Ultimately, we're the ones paying the price of these absurd decisions today, with the redundancy plan."</p><p>Workers accused leadership of "short-term thinking", adding "delusions of grandeur" influenced those higher up in the organisation to over-invest. "We want to save the company, but not at the price of unjustified redundancies or a deteriorated working environment," the letter closed.</p>
<p>Don't Nod's workers have laid out a number of demands, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>That Don't Nod abandons the redundancy plan</li>
<li>That employees have a voice in decision-making at the company</li>
<li>That Don't Nod CEO Oskar Guilbert be present at the negotiation</li>
</ul>
<p>The strike is set to begin at 2pm on Friday, union STJV announced, next to Don't Nod's Paris headquarters.</p>

<p>In September, Don't Nod said it had high hopes for Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-nod-bets-on-lost-records-bloom-rage-as-multiple-projects-fail-to-meet-expectations">Jusant and Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden failed to reach company expectations</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-creators-lost-records-launches-in-two-parts">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage is set to arrive in two parts next year</a>. The first instalment launches for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 18th February 2025. The second part will then debut a month later, on 18th March.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>According to two prominent insiders, Fortnite Season OG will return permanently in December. The news was reported by <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1853920988594930095" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HYPEX</a> and <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1853920981682704412" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShiinaBR</a>, who received the information from an anonymous source and were able to confirm its veracity. They also said all Fortnite Chapter 1 seasons would return monthly with an OG item pool. Moreover, both Build and Zero Build modes will be available. The announcement is expected at Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards, which will take place at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles on Thursday, December 12, starting at 4:30 PM Pacific Time.</p>
<p>Fortnite Season OG <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-season-og-breaks-player-count-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned</a> for the first time last November, marking record player numbers for Epic. The first day after the relaunch, the Battle Royale game registered the biggest day in its history with more than 44.7 million players. It came at the right time, too: just a few months before, Epic had been forced to lay off sixteen percent of its workforce. Fortnite's comeback, which started with Season OG, was largely responsible for a much healthier state of the company's finances.</p>
<p>Epic seems to have figured out Fortnite users are really into nostalgia. Right now, there's the Chapter 2 Remix season <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-is-live-now-brand-new-kicks-cosmetics-unveiled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a> on live servers. Are you enjoying it? What do you think about these returning seasons? Let us know in the comments.</p>

single unified "Nintendo Account" will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-boss-says-transition-from-switch-to-next-console-will-be-smoother-than-before/1100-6518543/">smooth the transition</a> into the next console. The Switch hasn't featured traditional backward compatibility since it launched, as it shifted from the disc format of the Wii and Wii U consoles back to cartridges. It's not clear yet if the Switch 2 will have a dedicated cartridge port for original Switch games, or if it'll implement a similar backward compatibility approach toward downloads of digitally purchased games like on the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles.</p><p>As it enters its eighth year, sales of the Switch have begun slowing down and an official announcement on it is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">expected within the next five months</a>. 140 million systems and more than 1 billion Switch games have been sold so far, and Nintendo said in its latest earnings result that hardware sales continue to remain stable. <a href="https://x.com/serkantoto/status/1854050495566061608" rel="nofollow ">Nintendo stock has also been on the rebound</a>--shares fell yesterday after Nintendo revised its sales forecast and confirmed that Switch sales were starting to slow down--increasing by 5.8% on November 6.</p><p>As for when exactly the Switch 2 will be revealed, analysts predict that it won't be this year as Nintendo wants to avoid diverting attention from its current system before it heads into the lucrative holiday season.</p>
