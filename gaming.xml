What do people that play <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> call themselves, frostpunks? Feels too obvious, but I'm going to do it anyway. Breaking news frostpunks! There's a new big <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a> update that's just arrived in the game, adding some pretty big additions and changes,so let's jump into them. First up, The Pit! No, it's not just some hole to chuck things in, it's a large new map with a "distinctive 'proto-crater' pit counted as mountain terrain," to be found within.
</p>

<p>
The heating system has seen a big overhaul too. Described as the "biggest systemic change since launch", this one localises heat management to individual districts. Each district can apparently have "unique" effects, as well as consequences if you're failing to keep places warm. There's a new heatmap view too so you can see how each district is doing temperature.

<p>
Serenity mode from the first game is back with this update, a good one for frostpunks that don't like stress. There's gentler weather, way more resources, shorter whiteouts, and the fervour system is completely gone, meaning no conflict between factions and very few protests.
</p>
<p>
You'll find new challenges in-game too, all of which apparently introduce a "unique quest and storyline. Multiple Tales can be combined in a single playthrough. Complete a Tale to unlock a unique Monument Hub to “decorate” your city, but be careful: failure results in game over!"
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game has received a few other tweaks to smooth things over as well, like a rebalanced prologue, improved tutorials, city visuals showing a denser population, alongside other changes. Modding tools are out of beta now, adding in features like a search bar, improved loading times, and tutorials.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/11-bit-studios">11 bit studios</a> go into a lot more detail about the minutiae changes in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/498320947205373969?l=english">Steam post</a>, if you're looking for all the nitty gritty bits. There they also promised that alongside future DLC, they are "committed" to releasing more free big updates for Frostpunk 2, all while they work on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/11-bit-studios-new-frostpunk-game-isnt-a-threequel-or-a-spin-off-but-a-remake-of-the-original">recently announced Frostpunk 1886</a>.

                <p>Paradox Interactive has finally confirmed that its Tinto studio's Project Caesar, which it had been teasing through a series of <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/forums/tinto-talks.1171/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dev diary posts</a> on its forum, is Europa Universalis V. As the first new entry in this series in nearly 12 years and one releasing in a very different landscape for strategy games, questions arise about what will, or should, change. Paradox's answer is to simply rework and tweak a formula that has proven to work well, rather than changing everything to court new players.</p><p>I attended a digital preview event for Europa Universalis V and went hands-on with an early build of the real-time strategy game ahead of the announcement. I found that its biggest changes didn't address approachability--which you might think would be the primary focus to attract newcomers to the franchise--but instead added strategic depth. Europa Universalis V feels distinct from what came before, but it doesn't lose any of the series' identity and focus on complexity. This might be the most hardcore grand strategy game in Paradox's catalog.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKaGSIm9juI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MKaGSIm9juI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>All of the government, military, and economic strategy systems that the series is known for return in this latest entry, working in tandem to create a complex political climate that grows from the in-game starting point of 1337. Players take control of any nation they want from around the world and micromanage nearly every aspect of it. Grand strategy games are overwhelming in the amount of information and strategic options they present players, but become outstanding sandboxes for emergent storytelling once you know where to look and what to do--Europa Universalis V is no different.</p><p>Declaring war on a small neighboring country as Naples, only to get massive swaths of my territory annexed by France's army because I didn't notice the country I was attacking was their ally, was a frustrating moment. But it’s also one I won’t soon forget because it reminded me to pay closer attention to every little political detail Europa Universalis V offers and informed the rest of my play time as Naples. It was the kind of strategic mistake I won’t soon forget, as its fallout informed a non-negligible part of my country’s history.</p><p>The biggest hurdle Paradox will encounter with Europa Universalis V is encouraging players to upgrade to it. Every time Paradox releases a new game in one of its grand strategy series, it's asking players to move away from games they've spent potentially thousands of hours and hundreds of dollars on.</p><p>Ultimately, Paradox believes that the appeal of an upgrade to Europa Universalis V comes from the new gameplay changes. When asked why players should upgrade, game director Johan Andersson said he believes Europa Universalis V has "more mechanics" and "more content" than its predecessor, making the upgrade worthwhile. That answer once again stresses that mechanical depth is this strategy game's biggest draw.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4489856-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489856" data-ratio="0.5619295958279" data-width="3835" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4489856-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489856"></a><figcaption>This screenshot from the start of The Age of Discovery shows just how much information Europa Universalis V makes players account for.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4489856-3.jpg"></figure><p>Some of these gameplay evolutions are influenced by other Paradox grand strategy games, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/victoria-3/" data-ref-id="5000-532092">Victoria 3</a>. For example, the population of Europa Universalis V's provinces is now split into population units, each of which can have different cultural, religious, and economic demands and preferences. Keeping everyone as happy as possible is key to keeping a nation stable, but that's easier said than done. There are also now more minutiae in the goods each province can produce, so players have to be more aware of whether they have a surplus of goods or if they have enough proper trade routes.</p><p>Europa Universalis V also goes back to the series' roots in different ways. First, it removes mana as a mechanic, which restricted when and how players could perform actions. Secondly, it brings back the policy sliders from the first three games in the series, providing a clearer indication of where one's nation stands in relation to different political values. All of these new systems and returning gameplay features give Europa Universalis V a clear identity of its own, if you know where to look.</p><p>And that identity is as a hardcore strategy game. Andersson outright called it "the most grand game we've ever made." Those hardcore fans are the ones most likely to appreciate all of the tweaks Paradox has made to the core of the Europa Universalis formula. But if you're someone who was hoping the next Europa Universalis would strip back complexity to make it more approachable, that's certainly not the case.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4489857-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489857" data-ratio="0.5619295958279" data-width="3835" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4489857-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489857"></a><figcaption>A clearer look at the world map in Europa Universalis V. Keep in mind that you can also play as countries outside of Europe.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4489857-1.jpg"></figure><p>The one addition that will make Europa Universalis V a little more approachable is its automation system. It allows players to automate tasks related to the conquerer, explorer, trader, and gardener play styles. By using this feature, players can focus on specific parts of the game, whether for educational or entertainment purposes.</p><p>This approach doesn't sacrifice depth for the sake of approachability, as your best option will still be to manage everything yourself. Still, new players may want to automate certain tasks at first while getting used to all the changes and mechanics that Europa Universalis V introduces. As has historically been the case with Paradox Interactive's grand strategy games, Europa Universalis V is overwhelming at first, but captivating once you get a handle on everything going on. In this way, it doesn't sacrifice the series' identity, but the culmination of all the Paradox grand strategy games that came before it ensures the experience doubles down on the strategic complexity. As a strategy game fan, I love it--I'll take all the mechanical depth and complexity I can get.</p><p>Europa Universalis V does not balk at the challenge of offering a comprehensive grand strategy for its players, simply offering tools like automation so players can ease themselves into everything bit by bit. Although it may be tough for some to move on from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/europa-universalis-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-149860">Europa Universalis IV</a>, a game with over 12 years of updates and DLC, those who make the jump will discover what's shaping up to be the next great grand strategy sandbox from Paradox.</p>

		<p>It’s almost always been the case that you have to wait a good long time between grand strategy and 4X sequels, but those gaps have stretched longer and longer for Paradox Interactive’s most notable series. After the 12 year gap before the much meme’d <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/victoria-3">Victoria 3</a>, it’s now almost 12 years from EU4 to the announcement and reveal of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/europa-universalis-v">Europa Universalis V</a> as well.</p>
<p>Of course, the tone of that wait is different, when EU4 has had a steady flow of expansions over the years, but with a numbered sequel comes the opportunity and the expectation of great changes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Europa Universalis V: Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MKaGSIm9juI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The first thing to note is that EU5 shunts the starting date of the game even earlier than before, going back to 1337 and capturing more of that transition from the late Middle Ages and into the Renaissance. More importantly, it also brings a few truly seismic world events into the game’s opening few hours (depending on how much you pause the game, that is). The Hundred Years War kicks off between England and France literally months after you hit play, and then just a decade or so later the Black Death rolls through the world, adding an early game crisis point that you’ll feel the ramifications from for decades to come.</p>
<p>As the Black Death is first reported, you’re given a few choices for how to react. You can just keep going business as usual, keep up trade, allow migration and for people to just do their things, or you can enact various isolationist policies. Spending influence you can try to source cures, you can draw all the Nobles to a little retreat that tries to keep you away from the riff-raff, you can close down cities, exile the infected, make scapegoats of the healthy, and more. It’s difficult to know what the best path to take here is –&nbsp;obviously there’s no actual cure or vaccines at this time, so you will feel the pain, and it’s almost just about how long you want to drag this out for. Playing as Portugal, I got the plague fairly late on, but with my choices, I still had that wash of green within my borders much longer than Spain, Morocco or England did. I clearly bungled it…</p>


<p>And that flushed my economy right down the pan, to be honest. With trade massively impacted, production all starved of workers, and my coffers completely dry, I needed a slew of big loans from my nobles, which were then being traded back and forth to foreign banks, and my attempts to micromanage this were barely keeping my kingdom afloat.</p>
<p>Thankfully this is where I could lean on one of the major areas of improvement within EU5. There’s much more automation available to you which, in the long run, will give you more freedom to play this game in the fashion that you want. Initially I was micromanaging trade, putting in deals to meet the needs of the pops and production, quickly clicking through on individual deals, but then seeing them quickly become unprofitable as supply dried up –&nbsp;this can be applied to trade in general, as well as to specific markets. Similarly, I was somewhat fearful of raising taxes across nobles, burghers, and the common folk, lest they get all angry and rebel, but got into such financial straights after the pandemic that I told the AI to take over and rake in enough cash for me to start recovering. There’s further automation for other areas, with the Automation AI based on the same AI leading computer-controlled nations, so you likely will want to keep key areas under your control or supervise, otherwise you could end up in a pseudo spectator mode –&nbsp;albeit one where there’s regular events to make decisions on, where foreign policy and wars are in your control, and so on.</p>
<p>Of course, each of these areas has also been revisited by Paradox Tinto to reconsider how they work, whether you put them in the hands of AI or furiously click your way through menus yourself.</p>

<p>Let’s stick with trade for the moment, which is defined not by your cities, ports or nation as a whole, but rather by markets that can cross country divides and regions. For Portugal, my two markets were both based in Castile, both of them with their own tendrils of supply and demand. To a certain</p>
<p>At the heart of any nation is its people, and EU5 has population units more similar to Victoria 3 or Imperator: Rome. There’s some core demographics to pay attention to here, as they’re broken down by their class and working status – from Nobles down through Laborers to Slaves, if your nation’s laws allow them – while there’s also their religion and cultural background to consider for the harmony within your country. When looking at your government, these are broken down into Estates for Nobles, Clergy, Berghers, Commoners, which you’re trying keep their broad approval and happiness. Often times, you’re having to make concessions, especially if (as a monarchy) you hold a council and need their approval to push a new agenda. Approval gradually shifts in a given direction to a neutral position,</p>

<p>Those decisions that you’re making will tie in with the Societal Values system, reviving the policy sliders from older titles in the series and replacing the Ideas of EU4. This breaks particular issues down into polar opposites –&nbsp;Spiritualist vs. Humanist, Land vs. Navy, Aristocracy vs. Plutocracy –&nbsp;and measures along these scales. Naturally, you enact policy and make decisions that nudge things one way or another, but there’s tons of these elements to keep in mind.</p>
<p>One of the ways you can affect societal change is with your Cabinet, a small cadre of officers that you can send out to perform tasks for you. One key tenet is the notion of Control throughout your nation. While your ruler or government presides in the capital, the further away from the seat of power you get, the less it really matters to the people living there, the more like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtYU87QNjPw">Monty Python’s Repressed Citizens skit</a> it might feel like, and the more difficult it is to exert your influence (and gather taxes). Building roads improves Control as the time to travel and the kind of closeness to cities is improved. They can also be set to work restoring your country’s Stability after a period of upheaval or with a looming threat, work to develop a province, try to convert a region’s populace, and much more. They’re an extension of your will and gradually get things done.</p>

<p>In general, there’s a step away from having certain traits and skills be treated as resources. Instead of having to save up points before you can send your advisors on a new task, instead they have a particular skill rating that affects how well and how quickly that job will get done. This does mean that their impact feels much more gradual, but also gives you more flexibility to pivot as world events take place.</p>
<p>We’ve barely scratched the surface of many elements of Europa Universalis 5. For example, we didn’t get stuck into a war, so didn’t try out the revamped military systems, which borrow ideas from Imperator: Rome for having formations, while requiring you to have logistics and resources to keep an army marching. Meanwhile, there’s a new antagonism rating that could see alliances spring up against you if you’re too aggressively expanding through the world. Then there’s playing through the longer passage of time, as technology works through individual trees for the starting Age of Traditions, through the Age of Renaissance, Discovery, and beyond.</p>

<p>Europa Universalis 5 remains a deep and complex historical grand strategy game, and it certainly looks to build and integrate, not only idea that came from a decade of updates and expansions to EU4, but also to some of the more fundamental shifts and ideas that we saw in Victoria 3 and Imperator: Rome. Importantly, there is that on-ramp for newcomers, with the deeper automation set to lift some of the burdens of leaning the ropes, at the same time as lifting some of the micromanagement that can become a chore deeper into a campaign.</p>

		<p>Paradox Interactive has revealed Europa Universalis V, their latest grand strategy sequel that is in development at Paradox Tinto, having gone under the codename Project Caesar for the past year or so.</p>
<p>No release date or window has been set just yet, but the game is now available to wishlist, to keep tabs on announcements through Steam</p>
<p><iframe title="Project Caesar - Official Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YaZcN-eVta8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>EU5 has been announced almost 12 years after EU4 arrived in August 2013, but even with all of the expansions and updates for the last game, this sequel promises to be no less deep and complex for ardent fans of the series. Still, Paradox has gone through their game, reconsidered a number of areas and mechanics, and reset the foundations for the coming decade. They’ve done this in tandem with the community, even so far as to founding Paradox Tinto five years ago and the team that was built around it.</p>
<p>There’s some key differences between the two games, some of which can be seen as drawing from other Paradox games released in the last few years.</p>

<ul>
<li>EU5’s start date is 1337, just before the outbreak of the Hundred Years War between England and France, and not long before the other outbreak that defined the era, with the Bubonic Plague set to sweep across Europe in the 1340s. The game continues on through to 1837.</li>
<li>Time is broken down into ages, such as the Age of Discovery where you can colonise distant lands, giving you the opportunity to adopt Institutions that define the technology trees that you follow.</li>
<li>There’s hundreds of millions of people being simulated across the world of EU5. Each province is now broken up into population units (POPS), similar to Victoria 3 and Imperator: Rome, each of which can have a different culture, religion, class and so on. Your fundamental job is to keep the fed, loyal and happy.</li>
<li>Trade does away with merchants and trade nodes, but there is instead a system of regional markets that have their own borders and regions. Setup trade routes between nations, sell surplus goods, and be mindful of needs and desires from your buildings and pops.</li>
<li>Societal Values see the return of policy sliders from earlier games, which were absent in EU4’s Ideas system. These sliders give your nation’s position between two opposing political values, with new sliders emerging as you progress through the ages.</li>
<li>There’s no more “Mana” where you accumulate points for nebulous resources to spend on actions. Now your monarch and their advisors have skill ratings for Administrative, Diplomatic and Military and this will affect the eventual cost over time and speed of actions.</li>
<li>Automation is a bigger part of EU5, letting you offload managing the economy, trade, building, production and more to an AI that is based on the same logic the computer controlled nations use. This is optional, and means that you can focus on what you find fun. If you want to micromanage, then you can, but if you want to focus on foreign policy and war, or deal more with events and major decisions, then you can do that too.</li>
<li>Warfare now has the military formations of Imperator: Rome, adding a tactical layer to your army set ups. Armies can be given directives for how to act in times of war – make a beeline to set up castle sieges, for example – and resource control is a major factor in how long you can go to war for, taking the resources and production away from a nation you’re invading.</li>
</ul>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/survios-debuts-story-trailer-for-alien-rogue-incursion/">Alien: Rogue Incursion - Part One</a> was one of the standout VR games in 2024, and for Alien fans with a VR headset to play it, it was the kind of Alien game those fans had been waiting for since Alien: Isolation.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Rogue Incursion developer Survios announced that Alien fans without VR headsets will soon be able to join the fun, with Alien: Rogue Incursion - Part One: Evolved Edition, a flatscreen version of the original VR game, arriving on September 30, 2025, for PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>
<p>You can wishlist the game now, with the standard edition coming in at $29.99 USD and the deluxe edition which includes a digital art book and a weapon and armor skin costs $39.99 USD.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition | PS5 &amp; PC Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Ho3DAL11eA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how Rogue Incursion is re-tooled from being a VR game since so much of the original experience was clearly designed for VR. The trailer Survios released today looks like it's showing footage captured in the game's engine, but it doesn't look like actual gameplay.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that this is still just part one of a two-part story, a fact that wasn't clear ahead of Rogue Incursion's original release. When Part One launched, Survios released a <a href="https://x.com/Survios/status/1870484344768172495">statement</a> to players saying that it understood why the last-minute addition of the 'Part One' subtitle to the game's full title was negatively interpreted by players, adding that it did not "<em>intend to mislead or cause confusion about what this game is</em>."</p>
<p>It also clarified that it didn't cut the game short or in half, and that this was always the plan, though for whatever reason, the words 'Part One' were not publicly added to the title until after the game launched.</p>
<p>Now that we know Survios has been working on a flatscreen version of Part One alongside the development of Part Two now brings up the question of whether Part Two will be available as a VR headset first, and a flatscreen game later, or if it'll be playable with or without a VR headset at launch.</p>

			<p>The action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/early-access-for-titan-quest-ii-set-for-winter-2024-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Titan Quest II</a> has had its early access launch shifted to Summer 2025, developer Grimlore Games <a href="https://x.com/TitanQuestGame/status/1920515492902551765" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today. A crowded release window and the desire to improve the game based on the community's feedback mixed to push the studio toward this choice.</p>
<p>Still, the developers said the recent demo playtest was very successful. Thousands of players participated, streamed, and completed surveys. Grimlore said that over 92% of these playtesters rated their experience as positive or very positive, with long-time franchise fans particularly enthusiastic about capturing the spirit of the original while moving forward with modernized systems.</p>
<p>The playtest featured the game's introductory chapter, where players could choose between two masteries and face the first boss, Appollonia the Terrible - a battle that proved a fan favourite. The visuals and audio received outstanding marks, with average scores of 5.25/6 and 5.16/6, respectively, while exploration and environmental storytelling were frequently highlighted as memorable features.</p>
<p>Not all was great, though, which is why Titan Quest II was delayed. Combat fluidity, skill targeting, and balance were all in need of improvements, which Grimlore said are being addressed, while performance optimization continues. Additionally, a customizable control scheme and revamped user interface indicators are underway based on the community's suggestions.</p>
<p>In the game, players will have to face against Nemesis, the goddess of vengeance, who is inexplicably out of control. She is corrupting the threads of fate and condemning all those who oppose her to eternal punishment - including the main character. Players must pick up their weapon, fight alongside the gods, and change fate itself to stop Nemesis, free those she's punished, and weave their own epic tale.</p>
<p>They'll get to create their own class by combining two of the masteries, forging a unique hybrid playstyle thanks to different combinations of skill modifiers, attributes, and items.</p>

Rockstar probably knew what it was doing when it led the latest trailer with a scene of Jason working hard while his jacked upper body glistened in the sunlight. Though choosing this scene probably had a double meaning, as Jason mentions that he’s “fixing some leaks” on a rooftop, which is likely a nod <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-leak-aaron-garbut-son-tiktok-1851070189&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-leak-aaron-garbut-son-tiktok-1851070189">to the giant leak <em>GTA 6 </em>suffered in 2023</a></span>. While Jason’s filthy, country trashbandit disposition may win over some ladies, too, it’s the kind of thing gays flock to. Sure, there’s probably something to unpack about gay guys gravitating towards men who look like they wouldn’t respect them, but that’s a psychologist’s job, and I am simply a gay man who is predictably drawn to men who look like they would call me a slur. But I’m not alone. Plenty of us are thirsting for the next <em>Grand Theft Auto </em>protagonist in the out-of-pocket ways they tend to.</p><p>This is a win for the girls and the gays. A mere 20 seconds of footage has piqued the interest of every gay gamer you’ve ever met. That’s exquisite targeted marketing on Rockstar’s part, and now the game will get even more free promotion through the inevitable bump in Rule 34 searches for Jason in the coming months. Not that the game really needs that much promotion. This is the kind of game that sells millions of copies on the first day, then stays near the top of the charts for several years. But it’s nice to see Rockstar is aware of every market it can possibly corner.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It is a “linear, narrative-driven” game, a “focused package” that offers a “cinematic experience.” You might find yourself driving around an authentic representation of 1900s Sicily in Mafia: The Old Country, or even riding around on horseback a bit like that other Rockstar game, but the similarities to Rockstar games stop there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

It might be worth it for the keen collectors among us, but let's dig into whether you should be paying this much for so little.</p><div catalogid="aa330f46-232b-48d9-aa21-2e145ab03cb4" id="220107"><div id="220107" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Prismatic Evolutions Surprise Box</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Includes 1 of 9 randomly selected foil promo cards with a special logo. Warning: MSRP: $22.99.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For starters, the box itself is nice, and it's cool to get stamped versions of the standard Eeveelution ex cards: Eevee ex, Vaporeon ex, Jolteon ex, Flareon ex, Espeon ex, Umbreon ex, Leafeon ex, Glaceon ex, or Sylveon ex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But you also only get one per box at random, and I'm not going to give myself an anxiety attack trying to work out the odds on hunting all of these down, but that's a big bag of bones going off Amazon's pricing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is it a nice gift? Sure. Is it practical enough to buy a couple of boxes for just ripping open packs and hoping for your favorite Eeveelution? At $59.99... jeesh, maybe not.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Prismatic Evolution Stamped Surprise Box Cards</h3><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/08/umbreon-pokemon-tcg-ign-1746714881932.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Umbreon ex - 060/131 (Prismatic Evolutions Stamp)</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">But still, it's been a popular pick amongst <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-may-8-2025">IGN's Daily Deals readers</a>, so who am I to judge? Make your own decisions when buying, just don't say I didn't warn you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Otherwise, you can also consider picking up the singles you might be chasing via trusted retailers like TCGPlayer. Let's explore the top Prismatic Evolutions cards available to pick up today as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're, like me, just interested in the Suprise Box for the promo cards, it might be worth just buying the cards standlone. The most expensive <a href="https://zdcs.link/z62qDZ?object_uuid=df5b0964-4c67-4039-928b-93414a5c727f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">(of course it's Umbreon)</a> is going for the same price as one of these boxes, with the rest coming in at well under $20. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So for the price of two to three Suprise Boxes, you can get the complete collection. If you want to rip open packs and pull these promos yourself then go for it, but it'll cost you.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Prismatic Evolution Chase Cards</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Dropping over a grand on a Pokémon card sounds mental, but this Umbreon SIR has come down quite a bit after release.

Titan Quest 2 missing that timeframe came from Grimoire Games wanting to avoid a "crowded ARPG release window and a desire to give the game the spotlight it deserves," according to a press release. A specific early-access release date was not given.</p>

The team will additionally add new customizable control schemes and better UI indicators based on player feedback.</p><p dir="ltr">Like its 2006 predecessor, Titan Quest 2 will drop players into ancient Greece to battle against mythological foes like Gryphons, Harpies, and Centaurs, this time on a quest to stop the goddess Nemesis from corrupting the Threads of Fate and condemning all who oppose her. Players will be able to choose from different combat masteries and combine two of them to create unique builds, with Titan Quest 2 aiming to be a challenging ARPG experience that will require players to dodge and use every skill at their disposal to overcome foes. The game will also feature crafting, allowing players to turn what normally would not be a great item into a more powerful one by adding affixes.</p><p dir="ltr">In other ARPG news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-season-8-is-making-endgame-bosses-stronger-simpler-to-access-and-more-rewarding/1100-6530970/" data-ref-id="1100-6530970">Diablo 4 Season 8 just began</a>, revamping its endgame boss system and introducing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-everything-diablo-4-and-immortals-berserk-crossover-entails/1100-6530989/" data-ref-id="1100-6530989">Berserk crossover</a>, while developer Grinding Gear Games has been hard at work addressing complaints in regards to an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-devs-respond-to-unpopular-update-there-were-some-blatant-f-ups/1100-6530736/" data-ref-id="1100-6530736">unpopular major update to Path of Exile 2</a>.</p>

		<p>Hangar 13 and 2K have announced that Mafia: The Old Country will launch on August 8th for PS5, PC, Xbox Series XS, and NVIDIA’s GeForce Now. To mark this news, a new gameplay trailer for Mafia: The Old Country has been released, and it shows shootouts, stealth attacks, car chases, and horseback chases with more shootouts thrown in.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mafia: The Old Country - “Whatever it Takes” Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KTmJDf6CuZs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“Mafia: The Old Country&nbsp;is a focused, linear experience that combines quality storytelling, authentic era immersion and a refined take on the familiar&nbsp;<em>Mafia</em>&nbsp;gameplay,” said Hangar 13 President Nick Baynes. “That focus allows us to deliver a story that’s gritty, grounded, brutal and emotional. Embracing early 1900s era Sicily, this is a mafia origin story that follows our protagonist, Enzo Favara, as he takes the oath and works his way up Don Torrisi’s crime family.”</p>
<p>Unlike previous Mafia games that were set in the US, Mafia: The Old Country takes us to the very beginning of the Mafia and its base in Sicily. Enzo Favara is a brand new protagonist in the series and with the time setting, we will not see any of the characters from previous titles as most of them haven’t been born yet. In addition to the gameplay trailer, Hanger 13 has also released some developer insights that you can watch too. This video focuses on how the studio created the setting for the story of Mafia: The Old Country.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-financials-2024-25<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has released its financial statement for the fiscal year ending in March 2025, and revenue and profit are both up for the&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>publisher.</p>

<p>Per the company's latest presentation, revenue across all sectors jumped by 17% this year, while operating profit rose by 27%. In the "Digital Entertainment" sector (which covers Konami's video game business), revenue was up by 22.5%, while profit grew by 24.7%.</p>

<p>In an accompanying <a href="https://img.konami.com/ir/en/ir-data/statements/2025/en0508_28h9rg.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">document</a>, Konami attributed its success this year to the successful release of Bloober Team's&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake, which had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">sold two million copies</a> at last count. The two studios are currently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-konami-new-game-ip" rel="nofollow">working together on another new game</a> based on a Konami IP, although it's unclear whether that IP is&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-konami-financials.jpg?itok=juKP9QPx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-konami-financials.jpg?itok=SVOnP7Z7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>has contributed to a strong year for Konami.</figcaption></figure><p>The company also points to the recent release of remasters of the first two&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>games, as well as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yu-gi-oh-early-days-collection-pc-and-switch-release-date" rel="nofollow">launch of retro museum title&nbsp;<em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Early Days Collection</em></a>, which features 14 "nostalgic classic digital titles", as Konami says.</p>

<p>Sadly, Konami doesn't reveal any sales figures for these collections, so we don't know how well they're doing. We do, however, know that a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-star-leap-announced" rel="nofollow">brand new&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>game is in development</a>, albeit a mobile RPG that will almost certainly feature gacha mechanics.</p>

<p>As regards the future, it's looking like a pretty packed year by Konami's standards. In the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">next few months</a>, the studio will release&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>, an Unreal Engine 5 remake of the 2004 stealth-action classic with a new visual makeover and some hefty gameplay improvements.</p>

<p>Konami also says it's "committed to the development" of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-f-officially-revealed-konami" rel="nofollow">upcoming survival horror title&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em></a>, although the studio stops short of revealing a release date or even a release window for the game.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a> will release on August 8th, developers Hangar 13 and publishers 2K Games have confirmed, and look, here’s a trailer featuring much headlong bloodshed in the villas, citrus groves and *squints* mysterious firelit dungeons of early 20th century Sicily.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> now releasing in 2026, the new Mafia is the criminal enterprise to beat this year. Rather than trying to fill the hole left by the Rockstar colossus, it’s playing things small with “a focused, linear experience that combines quality storytelling, authentic era immersion and a refined take on the familiar Mafia gameplay,” according to Hangar 13 president Nick Baynes.

<p>
As noted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-the-old-country-is-a-focused-experience-that-doesnt-require-massive-time-commitments-for-45">Eurogamer</a>, 2K Games and parent company Take Two Interactive are positioning the new Mafia as a side dish for the enormous live service productions that have become triple-A publishing's stock in trade.
</p>
<p>
“We think there’s a large audience for compelling stories that don’t require massive time commitments,” said 2K president David Ismailer in a release. “We’re excited to offer a game like Mafia: The Old Country in our portfolio, and to provide a linear highly-polished narrative experience that can easily complement the other more persistent games our players also love and engage with on a more consistent basis.”</p>
<p>Good lord, I remember when accidentally uttering the word “linear” in a press release or interview for a big-budget action game was the kiss of death. You’d find torch-waving gamer mobs at your gates the next day. That era has passed below the horizon: we are older now, and full of woe. We crave the sweet succinctness of a mildly interactive corridor.
</p>
<p>
It’s definitely a tapdance, openly selling your game as a “complement” for other games - possibly the devs at Hangar 13 find the language here a bit condescending. My somewhat more depressing analysis is that The Old Country is effectively being offered as a holiday from those games. You've done your time at the seasonal content coalface, so off you go to Sicily for some highly scripted R&amp;R.</p>
<p>Personally, I’m less bothered by questions of length than by the fact that The Old Country seems quite formulaic and lumbering. Guy shoots guy. Guy shoots guy while hunkered down behind table. Guy drives car very fast. Guy stabs guy. I do like the environments, though – hopefully, Hangar 13 have baked in plenty of opportunity to just wander through the groves looking at lemons and whatnot.

            <p>Paradox have announced grand <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/europa-universalis-v">Europa Universalis 5</a>, following some teasers last week. It's the next big entry in the series of complex globe-spanning historical simulations, and having played a little as the hapless ruler of Korea in the 14th century, I can confirm that it is so far as chunky, complicated, and deep as usual. The changes in this sequel won't look wild or revolutionary to a dabbler, but seasoned tyrants might find a lot to pique their interest. Come see a trailer below.</p>

<p>The developers announced the game in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZcN-eVta8">a recorded broadcast</a> and you can see it now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3450310/Europa_Universalis_V/">on Steam</a>. If you're already sold on the idea of carving up England into easily digestible chunks, and simply want to read about every little detail, then just go straight to my other article that describes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/everything-we-know-about-europa-universalis-5">everything we know about Europa Universalis 5</a>. It's big, but it's the most comprehensive summary of the game you'll find anywhere, or your florins back.</p>
<p>For everyone else, here's the skinny version. Europa Univarsalis 5 has been in development for the past few years at Paradox Tinto, a studio based in Spain. It's been called "Project Caesar" until now in an <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/forums/tinto-talks.1171/">ongoing development diary</a>, but it was clearly a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/europa-universalis">Europa Universalis</a> game to anyone who looked at the screenshots included in those dev posts. Over the past year, the developers have shared a lot of info on the historical map 'em up's new features.</p>
<p>In its broadest strokes, this is still a game of painting in the map your favourite colour and marching armies across land that's not yours to the chagrin of your neighbours. The twist this time is that you'll have to keep four competing interest groups happy throughout your rulership: the commoners, the clergy, the nobility, and the burghers. </p>
<p>These "estates" are roughly based on the political idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estates_of_the_realm">the estates of the realm</a>. Annoy the peasants too much and they'll start to get rebellious. Irritate the nobility and you'll have trouble leveraging them for their military power. That sort of thing. If you've played swipey kingdom management game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reigns">Reigns</a>, you'll get the idea. Except, of course, this will be much more finicky. As the crown, it's your job to placate peasant, prince and priest. The satisfaction levels of the estates will always be visible at the top of the screen.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun / Paradox Interactive</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One other big change is that the game will feature "pops", like in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/victoria-3">Victoria 3</a> - the little units of people who work, migrate, and die in your armies. And they'll have needs that must be met, usually in the form of certain trade goods as common as wheat or as precious as gems. Other than that, there are "Ages" that you pass through in certain eras (the Renaissance or the "Age of Absolutism", for example) and named characters like kings, artists, and ministers are a little more prominent than before. </p>
<p>I've been playing an early build of the game and it is quite the monster. Granted, I'm much more of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a> guy, but I can appreciate the vast and intricate machinery of a Europa Universalis. It is overwhelming in places so far (they haven't implemented a tutorial yet) and quite demanding of my PC given all the calculations happening. But this is sometimes the case with Paradox grand strategy, and I have spent a few afternoons as the frowning ruler of Korea struggling under the whip of imperial China but building a beautiful road network in the process. Pity about all the smallpox.  </p>
<p>There's no release date yet. But I'll share more impressions over the coming days, but for now, grab a very large cup of tea and make your way through my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/everything-we-know-about-europa-universalis-5">exhaustive guide post</a>. </p>
<p>The previous game, Europa Universalis 4, has been out for over a decade now, spawning dozens of DLC packs and getting countless updates. It's one of our readers' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-are-your-50-favourite-strategy-games-of-all-time">best strategy games of all time</a> and the only game I have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kings-of-the-castle-europa-universalis-part-1">seen played in an actual castle</a>. "EU IV is a fascinating simulation, an alternate history generator, a narrative tool and an entirely successful redesign of a strong formula," wrote Adam (RPS in peace) in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-europa-universalis-iv">olde reviewe</a>, written in approximately 1342. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <ul><li>Rule a land of your choosing.

                <p>This summer, the sequel to Hideo Kojima's Death Stranding--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>-- will continue the story that began in the first game. But if there's ever a Death Stranding 3, Kojima has no intention of making the game himself.</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideo-kojima-says-he-has-a-concept-for-death-stranding-3-but-hes-not-going-to-make-it/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, Kojima noted that he's already put some thought into what Death Stranding 3 would be. But despite having those ideas in mind, he would prefer to pass off the next game to someone else.</p><p>"If I use this Plate Gate concept, I could make endless sequels," noted Kojima. "I, of course, don't have any plans to do that, but I already have a concept for another sequel. I am not going to make it myself, but if I passed it on to someone else, they could probably make it."</p><p>In the world of Death Stranding, a Plate Gate is apparently some kind of portal that can transport people from continent to continent. It's a system that Sam Porter Bridges (Norman Reedus) uses in Death Stranding 2.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT_A2gPhTIw" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eT_A2gPhTIw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Kojima recently noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-how-kojimas-experience-with-covid-impacted-the-game/1100-6531399/" data-ref-id="1100-6531399">the sequel was inspired by the COVID pandemic</a>, and one of the game's themes explores why it may have been a bad idea for so many people to connect with each other. Kojima told VGC that there's a lot of foreshadowing in the game that will reveal the reasons why Death Stranding 2's tagline is "We should not have connected."</p><p>"Even throughout the game, you see strands from many people, like Dollman and the mech soldiers," said Kojima. "Those are all hints. When you really start thinking about what it means to connect, you start to wonder… That's all I'll say for now."</p><p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will be released on PlayStation 5 on June 26. A Death Stranding 2 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-is-getting-a-limited-edition-dualsense-controller/1100-6531400/" data-ref-id="1100-6531400">limited-edition DualSense controller</a> will be released on the same date.

            <title><![CDATA[Healers In Marvel Rivals Went On Strike]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/marvel-rivals-healer-strike</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/healers-in-marvel-rivals-went-on-strike.1184484/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/marvel-rivals-healer-strike<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A <em>Marvel Rivals</em> match loads. In the time it takes you to blink, four of your teammates have instalocked their hero picks. There’s a Wanda, a Wolverine, a Psylocke, and one Spider-Man. The fifth player’s cursor is also hovering over Spider-Man, but they weren’t fast enough to pick him. A flurry of stars descends from the team chat. The other Spider-Man, bold yet seemingly lost in the match-wide chat, cries out: HEALS???</p><p>You could pick a Strategist, <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ version of a healer, and help your pals out, since most viable team compositions that effectively keep a squad’s health topped up have a minimum of two healing characters. Spider-Man 2 hasn’t settled on a character yet.</p><p>Oh, nevermind. They’re going Black Widow, otherwise known as the hero with the worst win rate. You sigh and pick Punisher, the sixth DPS on the roster.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Toxicity is inevitable in most multiplayer games, especially in hero-based shooters, where the glory of high kill-death ratios seduces players into believing they are the only main character. Yet in April, radiation levels in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> became nuclear. For weeks, players reported that many of their superhero matches had become tortuously devoid of support characters. Healers had reached a breaking point. A “strike” had begun.&nbsp;</p><p>The exact start of the healer exodus is difficult to pinpoint. Some attribute it as a reaction to comments made by the top Spider-Man player in the world, a content creator known as Necros. Midway through April, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@roballenent/video/7493029469721087263" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a video began floating</a> around where the bespectacled streamer called Strategist roles “easier by order of magnitudes” compared to damage-dealing roles. The incendiary clip went on to decry support skill floors as so low that Necros would need multiple books to capture the extent of his sentiment.</p><p>Except Necros wasn’t talking about the current season of <em>Marvel Rivals</em> in that footage, he was talking about how the role felt when the game was initially released. The clip was taken out of context on sites like TikTok and Twitter, where enraged Strategists responded to it by declaring that <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@wrldkailee.plays/video/7496941646328646943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they would stop</a> playing the role entirely. A few viral clips like these amassed millions of views, which may have contributed to the perception that it all trailed back to Necros. But as he says in<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iav0I-8c5N0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a video breaking down why he got “cancelled</a>” over his negative Strategist comments, millions of people play <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. A fraction of them probably engage in anything related to the game on social media, and an even smaller percentage of those players probably watch Necros to begin with. Even in a clip where he’s shit talking Strategists more directly, it’s in response to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1FxkPCzRWM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a thread that mentions him by name</a>, not an unprovoked comment.&nbsp;</p><p>But Necros made for a perfect villain in the larger narrative. He is, after all, the best Spider-Man player around. And nobody likes Spider-Man except other Spider-Man players: Either he’s terrorizing your back lane or he’s going 0-11 and never gracing the objective with his presence. The anti sentiment is so pervasive that most ranked matches will immediately ban Spider-Man even if it means screwing over their own teammates. Strategists in particular abhor Spider-Man: the hero can swiftly one-shot most fragile characters and leave the premises before anyone even notices.</p><figure><figcaption>Marvel Rivals</figcaption></figure><p>Curiously, there’s a thread with over 700 upvotes on Reddit where a healer strike was actively called for that was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rivals/comments/1jbz646/fellow_healers_im_calling_for_a_strike/?sort=new" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drafted two months ago</a>. It describes an apparent incident where a support player used the in-game report system to alert the developers of a death threat, only to be met with inaction. Frustrated, the Redditor encouraged other fellow supports to abstain from playing until toxicity conditions for Strategist players improved.&nbsp;</p><p>“Treat your healer, and fellow players, with RESPECT,” the post demanded. “Stop blaming healers every time you die. Stop blaming healers when you walk into a 5v1 and get melted. Stop saying ‘gg heals’ when you’re a 3 and 8 diving DPS. Stop saying ‘not enough heals!’ while not switching to healer yourself.”</p><p>While the Reddit thread is almost entirely absent from conversations about the strike, the event didn’t quite come out of nowhere. Demoralizing as it may be, everything that the thread described will sound familiar to anyone who has ever played a support role in a multiplayer game. By and large, healing characters are undervalued by selfish teammates who do not seem to understand the concept of a cooldown or why a healer may not be able to be in multiple places at once. Support players tend to bear this treatment for the greater good; it’s difficult to win a match if you can’t stay alive.</p><p>A patch that arrived with the latest season made things even worse. <em>Marvel Rivals</em> has never been a game that prioritizes “balance” or esport viability. NetEase has made it clear <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/we-balance-for-fun-first-and-foremost-marvel-games-executive-producer-discusses-marvel-rivals-priorities-and-why-competitive-balancing-comes-second/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that their focus is on keeping the game fun</a>, which in practice means that the hero shooter is wildly unfair. Spider-Man is but one patch in a larger tapestry of bullshit that includes features like “characters who do not even have to perceive you to kill you in seconds.”&nbsp;</p><p>Still, there’s a limit to how far you can push a chaotic design ethos like this. In games like <em>Fortnite</em>, players accept the brutality of dying with nothing more than a gray pistol to a lucky player who found a golden bazooka because they know that eventually, the lady luck will shine will grant <em>them </em>a bazooka instead. Everyone gets to be a menace, you just can’t be a menace all the time.&nbsp;</p><p>A <em>Marvel Rivals</em> patch that dropped in early April made playing a Strategist into an even rawer deal. Some Strategists had to wait longer before they could use their abilities, while others saw a reduction in their overall health. Making things worse, the patch also tweaked how the game tabulated end-of-match awards. The aim was to reward players in accordance to their specific contribution to the match; the better you did, the more rank XP you’d gain.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a great idea in theory, except that the game’s rubric didn’t account for how a Strategist might contribute to a match. After the patch hit, Strategists reported winning matches and only seeing their points go up by 10, a fraction of what they’d normally get before. Even if the Strategist was instrumental to the team’s performance, it would take winning ten matches before you might rank up.</p><p>The downsides, at this point, were insurmountable. Strategists started posting on social media that they were joining the strike in solidarity with other supports. In doing so, some even discovered that they were better at dealing damage than they realized. They had no intention of going back now.</p><p>“Playing support is not a lot of fun anymore,” said a player named Lucas, who <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@yonsidelucas/video/7496243346877369646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted a video with 1.8M views about his decision to join the strike on TikTok</a>.&nbsp; “There’s only eight options to choose from, and five of them got a nerf in the most recent update. I mean, poor Mantis mains have gotten a nerf every single update since the game came out,” he explained in the video.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Marvel Rivals</figcaption></figure><p>In some ways, the strike is a misnomer. There was no centralized movement, and while some people stopped playing the role, there were plenty of Strategists who agreed with everything people were complaining about yet kept chugging along. Perception may have also been skewed by the fact that support has never been a popular role. Even before the patch hit, it was common to see it take the entire pre-game timer before two people reluctantly picked a support character to play. I’ve been in my share of matches where nobody picked Strategist until well into the match, when things were dire and losing seemed inevitable. Every so often, you’ll get a match where only a single person valiantly picks up the mantle.&nbsp;</p><p>But even if it wasn’t exactly a strike, there was still a list of demands. In <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@xiblankx/video/7497714261997751594" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another video posted in late April</a>, a Twitch streamer named BlanK posted footage where he broke down each point strikers were fighting for–some reasonable, others bordering on parody. For example, one demand was that rather than having the entire team vote on which character got banned from the match, Strategists would get the first ban pick to themselves. A more sensible demand called for a shift in the tone whenever players interacted with Strategists, like making sure to thank them when they healed you. <em>Rivals </em>includes<em> a </em>chat wheel option to say Thanks, but it’s not an option included by default–and most players may never realize it’s there at all.&nbsp;</p><p>As word spread about the strike, what started as a fringe concept became mainstream discourse. Necros may not have lighted the fuse, but a week into the patch, at least some players experienced abuse <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1k5vjdy/the_support_strike_and_necros_comments_why_this/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when the strike was actively mentioned</a>. Many of the incidents attributed to Necros’ influence sound awful, but they’re also typical for anyone playing a Strategist. DPS players would routinely try to lobby their entire team to report a fellow teammate for “throwing” simply because the healer didn’t behave like their personal butler throughout the match.&nbsp;</p><p>The ruckus reached a fever pitch on April 30th, which pushed NetEase to address the situation with <a href="https://marvelrivals.gg/marvel-rivals-version-20250430-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yet another patch</a>. This one focused almost entirely on Strategists, who saw buffs that improved abilities or increased damage. Hilariously, one of the few DPS characters mentioned in the patch is every Strategist’s bane of existence, Spider-Man. The spandex-wearing nightmare now has a slightly smaller radius for his dreaded combo.</p><p>Amid this good news, NetEase not only sounded sympathetic to the woes of support players, the developers appeared to throw shade in the direction of players who berate Strategists for poor gameplay.&nbsp;</p><p>“Strategists face increased pressure, needing to monitor teammates' health closely while carefully using their key abilities and being mindful of their positioning on the map,” the blog post reads. “Meanwhile, Vanguards and Duelists must not only attack effectively but also provide better protection for their Strategists to achieve victory.”</p><p>Necros, on the other hand, still finds himself battling an inaccurate narrative about his role in the fiasco. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iav0I-8c5N0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a video</a> posted at the end of April, the influencer says that while he doesn’t feel responsible for what happened, he understands why things transpired the way they did. Who wants to get MVP on a match only to barely rank up? The world’s best Spider-Man has also been slightly vindicated after everything is said and done. Necros has spent much of his time in May trying to prove his naysayers wrong by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rivals/comments/1ke8ufi/necros_climbs_to_plat_only_playing_support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">focusing entirely on Strategist gameplay</a>. His goal is to reach one of the highest possible ranks in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> using only support roles. He’s already gloating about having an extended winning streak in a role that detractors swore he’d never played.</p><p>Surely such antics aren’t winning Necros any sympathy relative to the amount of backlash he’s received in the wake of the strike. Then again, it was silly to insinuate that one of the best <em>Marvel Rivals </em>players in the world could never be good at a specific role in the game. Whether or not an average person would be able to ascend the ranks nearly as quickly is another story. Ultimately, the skill ceiling for any given character in the game is immaterial without a well-coordinated team.&nbsp;</p><p>A few days into the patch, it’s difficult to say whether or not the new changes are tangibly making a difference. Some Strategists may be overjoyed at their newfound power, sure. But no percentage change can undo the lobotomy of wondering why a support didn’t dutifully follow someone into the thick of the enemy spawn. The best we can hope for is that the Punisher crashing out on voice chat will eventually seek out a therapist.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-iv-max-traffic-speed-tom-walker-finished"><h3>He Did It</h3></a><p>Far and away the biggest Grand Theft Auto-related news of the day</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/valve-issues-cease-and-desist-to-counter-strike-classic-offensive-mod-team-after-previously-giving-approval-shutting-down-8-years-of-development/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Valve has issued a cease and desist order to the team behind the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive mod, Classic Offensive, after having previously approved the mod 8 years prior.</p>
<p>In a lengthy statement published to the mod team's official <a href="https://x.com/csco_dev/status/1920189873488642332">X</a> account, the Classic Offensive team warns mod creators that they "<em>should reconsider how they see Valve: a company that benefits from community creativity while being able to shut down years of work without warning, despite going through their defined process which they can drastically change at any time.</em>"</p>
<p>Valve gave the project the green light in 2017, according to a <a href="https://classic-offensive.net/#/timeline">timeline</a> the Classic Offensive mod team has created on their website. After years of little to no communication from Valve, in January 2025, the Classic Offensive app was rejected by Valve with the only explanation being "<em>we found that your app is not a good fit for Steam</em>."</p>
<p>After that, the team worked to try and find out what Valve meant by Classic Offensive not being a good fit, reaching out to Valve to no avail. The cease and desist order came through just hours before the team intended to update the mod through ModDB.</p>
<p>"<em>As we prepared to update via ModDB instead,</em>" the Classic Offensive team's statement reads, "<em>we received a cease and desist notification from Valve's socials just hours before launch. In follow-up communications, they clarified that releasing Classic Offensive would be distributing 'derivative content' based on their intellectual property, which is not permitted under the Steam Subscriber Agreement</em><em>.</em>"</p>
<p>The statement goes on to call out the narrowing conditions for what mods based on Valve's games are allowed and how, in the view of the Classic Offensive team, the company's current interpretations of what's allowed go against the culture around modding that Valve has benefited from for years and Valve's approval of the project in 2017.</p>

<p>It's unfortunate for the mod team and those who were looking forward to Classic Offensive that Valve has seemingly changed its mind about what it wants to allow at the last minute, and it also puts into question other mods, particularly the recently revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/cs-legacy-a-fan-made-standalone-remake-of-counter-strike-is-in-the-works/">CS: GO Legacy project</a>.</p>

			<p>The Oblivion Remastered unofficial anti-stutter fixes that can be downloaded online don't bring any significant improvement, a recent analysis highlighted.</p>
<p>In the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry took a good look at some of the mods available for the remaster of the fourth entry in the series by Bethesda, starting with the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/51230" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oblivion BSA Uncompressor</a>. The mod, which showed promise because it eliminated a CPU task, was developed for the original Oblivion, but it also works in the remaster, as it ships with the original Oblivion assets. The installation procedure isn't very simple, requiring the user to manually uncompress files as well, but the efforts should be worth it, as it's been claimed it does improve performance.</p>
<p>However, all the effort required to install this mod isn't really worth it for Oblivion Remastered. In their test, Digital Foundry highlighted how, while there's a minimal variance at the beginning of a session, the differences eventually become equal. The difference between the five-minute-long benchmark runs set around the Imperial City was less than 2%, and it doesn't eliminate the issue, as it doesn't address the variance that makes the experience feel choppy.</p>
<p>Besides checking out if the Oblivion BSA Uncompressor indeed solves stuttering issues in Oblivion Remastered, the tech experts also looked at the many engine configuration tweaked files that are usually shared after an Unreal Engine game launches. Looking at the most popular tweaked engine configuration file available from Nexus Mods, the tech experts highlighted how many of the changes don't actually mean anything for a shipped game, such as turning off logging, and how the tweaked file effectly does nothing for performance.</p>
<p><iframe title="Do Oblivion Remastered PC Anti-Stutter Fixes Do Anything?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kSQ5T32d3Lo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With Oblivion Remastered unofficial anti-stutter fixes not really doing anything, it will be up to Virtuos to fix the game's performance, which is one of the biggest issues of the remaster.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bandai-namco-sales-2024-25</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bandai-namco-sales-up-this-year-as-profits-nearly-double.1184454/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bandai-namco-sales-2024-25<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has released its financial summary for the 2024-25 fiscal year, and things are looking up for the Japanese publisher when compared to last year.</p>

<p>In its statement, Bandai Namco reveals that its net sales have risen by 18% this year, and that operating profits are up by nearly 100%, having risen from 90 billion yen in the 2023-24 period to 180 billion this year.</p>

<p>The company's success comes after a couple of big hitters performed very well indeed. Fighting game&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>, for instance, hit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-5m" rel="nofollow">five million sales</a>&nbsp;within around four months, while&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>DLC expansion&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales" rel="nofollow">reached the same milestone in under a week</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-giant-bandai-namco.jpg?itok=ZWv0V6jQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-giant-bandai-namco.jpg?itok=wwjY4CwV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC contributed to a good year for Bandai Namco.</figcaption></figure><p>Indeed,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">passed the 30 million sales mark</a> recently, and while this was revealed too late to be part of the 2024-25 fiscal year, it still indicates that the base game has been selling steadily over the past twelve months or so.</p>

<p>These figures have helped to compensate for what was a pretty egregious failure on Bandai Namco's part in the form of&nbsp;<em>Unknown 9: Awakening</em>, which sold poorly on release last year, causing developer Reflector Entertainment (which is a Bandai Namco subsidiary) to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unknown-9-awakening-layoffs-cancellation-reflector" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs</a>.</p>

<p>In terms of what lies in Bandai Namco's future, the company has reason to be optimistic about the next twelve months as well. Later this month, the studio will release&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>alongside FromSoftware, and if the base game's sales figures are anything to go by, Bandai Namco could well have another hit on its hands.</p>

<p>A third game in the&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>series is also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-nightmares-3-delayed" rel="nofollow">due to be released this year</a>, and it'll be the first title in the series not to be developed by Tarsier Studios, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/tarsier-studios-reanimal-introduces-tense-and-terrifying-journey" rel="nofollow">working on its own horror game</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-platformer-paperklay-is-a-little-bit-banjo-a-little-bit-littlebigplanet<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>3D <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> Paperklay has perhaps the least appealing protagonists I've seen in a game recently. I hate avian buddy duo "Chick &amp; Nugget" and all their works, beginning with the ghastly 3am pun that appears to have spawned them.</p>
<p>Look at that ampersand, dangling in the middle like a chunk of gristle. What an absolute crime against typography. And chickens. And platform game levels made of paper and card - you'd never put an <em>actual</em> chicken nugget on dioramas like these, the grease would ruin it. I also mistrust Chick's beady black eyes, and I can't abide the fact that Nugget is wearing a fragment of eggshell for pants. That's like a human child using a placenta as a necktie! Argh!</p> <!--more-->
<p>Anyway, none of that matters, because Paperklay looks to be an absorbing arts-and-crafty experience with large, transforming environments. It's got music from Banjo-Kazooie and Yooka-Laylee composer Grant Kirkhope and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a> composer Steven Melin. Banjo is definitely the right parallel here. Trailer, away!</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwB0GLKmTw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>The game launches on 27th May, and still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1350720/PaperKlay/">has a demo on Steam</a>. You can expect a familiar buffet of platforming moves - double-jumping, dashing, gliding and sprinting - plus platform puzzles that involve folding, unfolding and variously messing with the layout. There are solutions that, as in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fez">Fez</a>, rotate the entire landmass you're traversing, exposing new routes. Developer Kevin Andersson has been working on the thing for a tidy three years, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@WhyKev">documenting the development on his Youtube channel</a>. The latest press release estimates that the full game will last five to six hours.</p>
<p>Aside from upsetting me with its puns, Paperklay also reminds me that a lot of games now trade on fancy, tactile recreations of physical materials. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lumino-city">Lumino City</a>, for example, or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hirogami">Hirogami</a>, or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paper-trail">Paper Trail</a>, or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-midnight-walk">The Midnight Walk</a> from just this morning.</p>
<p>All these gameworlds are exquisitely made - every object creased and cut and stamped and embroidered to perfection by the unseen hands of godly artisans. I think there's an opportunity here for an arts-and-crafts experience in which the world has been sellotaped and glued together by people with no artistic talent whatsoever. At school, I once tried to make a papier-mache sculpture of a majestic valley. When I came back the next morning, it had shucked off its wire support and curled in on itself like a dead cockroach. Give me a platform level set inside that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Combine with the void magic attack Stendahl, the Cheater, Shortcut, and Last Stand Luminas active, as well as the right stat allocations, and you’re off to the races.</p><p>Players have been experimenting around these key pillars of Maelle’s nuke build over the last week to keep upping the total damage output, going from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-I0xItu0Hs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-I0xItu0Hs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over one billion damage</a></span> to over two billion, and eventually over three billion against certain enemies. Like <em>Diablo IV</em> and other buildcrafting-centric RPGs, a lot of <em>Expedition 33</em> damage modifiers stack, multiplying the damage output as you layer each new buff on top of the last. </p><p>Not surprisingly, developer Sandfall Interactive has been watching Maelle’s increasingly busted builds with great interest, and finally announced on Thursday that it’s going to put an end to the DPS race. “We hadn’t planned to make any balance changes this early—just bug fixes, unless something clearly stood out,” the studio posted on X. “Well, Stendhal did.”</p><p>It continued, “It was underwhelming for most of development, so in our final pre-release balance pass, we gave it a big damage boost—and clearly overdid it. It ended up overshadowing most other options.   We still want you to be able to break the game—and you absolutely still can—but Stendhal was making it a bit too easy.” Players have until a hotfix goes live on May 9 to have their remaining fun. </p><p>Not to worry, however. There’s still tons of other very busted builds in <em>Expedition 33</em>. While none scaled quite to the insane level of Maelle’s Stendahl nuke, they will still help players make short work of even the game’s toughest encounters, including the optional post-game boss fight against the 45 million HP Simon. An endgame Verso build is already <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;http://Verso Build&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://Verso Build" target="_blank">breaking 2.5 million damage per turn</a></span>. Not quite a god mode cheat, but close enough.</p><p> It sounds like Sandfall Interactive will be leaving those intact for now. After all, what’s the harm in letting fans go wild in a single-player RPG?</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        </li></ul><p>“As a team that truly loves <em>Alien</em>, we’re incredibly proud of the immersive original story we’ve told with <em>Alien: Rogue Incursion</em>,” said Survios chief product officer TQ Jefferson in a press release. “Following our great start on [virtual reality] platforms, we’re excited to bring the Evolved Edition to PC and [PlayStation 5] later this year so that fans of Alien can experience Zula’s journey wherever they prefer to play.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Survios:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><a title="Companies > Experience [211 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> the universe of the <em>Alien</em> films like never before: re-envisioned for console and PC. An all-new <a title="Genres > Action [2,716 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>-horror entry into the classic franchise, <em>Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition</em> transforms you into Zula Hendricks—the ex-Colonial Marine hellbent on exposing Weyland-Yutani’s blacksite experiments—on a dangerous mission to investigate an SOS from the backwater planet Purdan, home to a long-defunct mining colony. With her ever-present synth companion Davis 01 for guidance, Zula must infiltrate the infested Gemini Exoplanet Solutions research facility and survive the ever-present threat of the most cunning Xenomorphs ever encountered, with both skilled <a title="Genres > Stealth [83 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">stealth</a> and serious firepower at her disposal. With deeply personal stakes propelling both Zula and Davis deeper, they must plunge to the dark heart of Purdan to expose—but not unleash—the horrors lurking within.</p><p><strong>Part One of a Two-Part Story</strong></p><p>Zula’s Fight Begins Here: Part One of this gripping two-part story thrusts you into the violent world of <em>Alien</em>, where you will uncover the secrets lurking within the GES facility on LV-354, the enigmatic planet Purdan. This installment stands alone as a complete story yet leaves you hanging on a thrilling cliffhanger, eager to dive deeper into Zula’s unfolding story in Part Two, where she will face new challenges and deadlier enemies.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Evolved <em>Alien</em> Combat</strong> – Battle Xenomorphs who behave just like their cinematic counterparts: actively hunting you throughout locations, climbing and crawling on walls and ceilings, stealthing through ducts and tunnels, and jumping on objects within the world.</li><li><strong>Explore to Survive</strong> – With the facility destroyed, resources like ammunition and health supplies are limited, so you’ll have to scrounge and scavenge to stay stocked. That means searching every possible room, closet, and corner, where more than just supplies are hiding.</li><li><strong>Authentic <em>Alien</em> Atmosphere</strong> – Drop directly into the world of the <em>Alien</em> films as you become ex-Colonial Marine Zula Hendricks on a deadly mission featuring characters, environments, weapons, enemies, and stakes from the classic franchise, all within a gripping new story that sets you at the center of the action.</li><li><strong>Spatial Sound Design</strong> – With Xenomorphs lurking everywhere, you’ll most likely hear them before you see them. Stay frosty; that hissing sound could be a Xenomorph or a burst pipe. Spatial sound alerts you where they’re stalking, but your <a title="Genres > Survival [411 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> is up to you.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
