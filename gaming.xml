            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>PC hardware deals don’t always line up this cleanly, but this one is hard to ignore. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6822/">Amazon has dropped the price of AMD’s Ryzen 9 9950X by 20%, knocking it down to $519 from its original $649 launch price.</a> For anyone planning a new gaming PC or looking to anchor a high-end upgrade, this discount puts one of AMD’s most powerful consumer CPUs firmly within reach.</p>
<p>Building a PC might look intimidating at first glance, but the real challenge usually comes long before a screwdriver ever touches a case. Sorting through spec sheets, comparing model numbers, and figuring out what actually delivers value can feel overwhelming. CPUs in particular tend to blur together when clock speeds, core counts, and generation labels start stacking up. Finding a processor that’s got power and long-term relevance that doesn’t break the bank is key. So please direct your attention to the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6822/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="870" data-end="911">A Flagship CPU Built for Modern Gaming</h2>
<p>Only a little more than a year old, the Ryzen 9 9950X sits at the top of AMD’s consumer lineup. With 16 cores and 32 threads. It’s designed to handle far more than today’s games alone. Paired with a strong GPU, this processor can comfortably drive high refresh rate gaming, including demanding titles running at ultra settings. High-resolution streaming, background apps, and content creation tasks won’t slow it down either.</p>
<p>Clocked at a base speed of 4.3 GHz, the Ryzen 9 9950X delivers excellent performance right out of the box. Anyone who like to squeeze out extra power will appreciate that the chip is fully unlocked for overclocking, with boost speeds reaching up to 5.7 GHz under the right conditions. That extra headroom can make a noticeable difference for video encoding, 3D rendering, and competitive gaming scenarios where every frame counts.</p>



<p>AMD’s Ryzen Master software adds another layer of control. The utility provides real-time monitoring of temperatures, voltages, clock speeds, and memory timings, all from a clean interface. Custom profiles make it easy to switch between performance-focused settings and quieter, power-efficient configurations depending on the task. Keep in mind that the Ryzen 9 9950X does not ship with a stock cooler, and AMD recommends pairing it with a quality liquid cooling solution to maintain optimal performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6822/">At $519, the Ryzen 9 9950X is a serious investment, but also a smart one</a>. CPUs of this caliber tend to age gracefully, staying relevant for years as games and software continue to evolve. This is the kind of processor that can serve as the backbone of a system well into the next generation of PC gaming. With the current Amazon discount in play, now is an excellent moment to lock in elite performance at a much more approachable price.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-most-awarded-game-wccftech-awards-elden-ring/</link>
            <guid>1412965</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> has broken a new record, <strong>surpassing FromSoftware's Elden Ring</strong> when it comes to <strong>overall Game of the Year wins</strong> from press outlets and industry associations. <strong>It did so with <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-25-winners-clair-obscur-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our own Wccftech Awards '25 prizes</a></strong>, awarded by staff and community both after extensive polls.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-has-third-most-goty-wins-in-single-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that ResetEra user Angie, who keeps a detailed record of all the Game of the Year wins for each year, revealed how Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 had quickly dethroned <strong>Larian's Baldur's Gate 3</strong> at the third spot. Now, shortly after our announcement of the Wccftech Awards '25 winners, the ResetEra thread <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-now-the-most-awarded-game-of-the-year-ever.1411252/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was updated</a> with Angie claiming that our GOTY awards were just enough to surpass Elden Ring's previous record of <strong>435 GOTY prizes</strong> in a single award season. </p>



<p>Sandfall's game now <strong>sits alone at 436</strong>, and the award season is far from over. The game is extremely well-positioned to win again at upcoming events like the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/29th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-full-list-clair-obscur-ghost-of-yotei-arc-raiders-dispatch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DICE Awards</a></strong> and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gdc-awards-clair-obscur-expedition-33-dominates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GDC Awards</a></strong>. The winners of the former will be announced by the <strong>Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences</strong> (AIAS) on Thursday, February 12, 2026, during the <strong>DICE 2026 Summit</strong> in Las Vegas. We'll have to wait a bit more to know the winners of the latter, as the GDC Awards will be unveiled on Thursday, March 12, 2026, during the <strong>Game Developers Conference 2026</strong> in San Francisco. A bit further still, the <strong>BAFTA Game Awards 2026</strong> winners will be announced on Friday, April 17, 2026, in London.</p>



<p>Those are the major ones, but there are a few others. It's not inconceivable for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 to reach <strong>450 Game of the Year wins</strong> or more, which would make the record quite hard to beat in the coming years. Records aside, what's more important is that <strong>Sandfall Interactive has earned the industry's unanimous appreciation</strong>, from professionals to fans. <span>Just a few days ago, a veteran developer like&nbsp;<strong>The Astronauts</strong>' founder and director,&nbsp;<strong>Adrian Chmielarz,</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/veteran-dev-cant-wrap-his-head-on-clair-obscur-expedition-33-quality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly stated</a> that the game's incredible quality, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sandfall-interactive-made-clair-obscur-expedition-33-for-under-10-million-to-prove-it-could/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">achieved with a relatively low budget</a> and a small development team, made him question everything he thought he knew about the limits of game de</span>velopment.</p>



<p>Of course, now Sandfall Interactive has everyone's eyes on them. Will they be able to stay humble and handle the inevitable massive hype surrounding their next project? Only time will tell, but we're certainly rooting for them.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsungs-nintendo-switch-2-optimized-microsd-card-crashes-to-its-lowest-price-at-under-0-16-per-gb-2000661937</link>
            <guid>1412962</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="594">Nintendo’s next-generation console, the Switch 2, has already had a strong start. Since launching earlier last year, Nintendo’s follow-up to one of the most successful consoles in gaming history has rolled out several notable exclusives, including <em data-start="248" data-end="266">Mario Kart World</em>, <em data-start="268" data-end="289">Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, <em data-start="291" data-end="309">Kirby Air Riders</em>, and and <em data-start="334" data-end="359">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>. While that exclusive lineup is still growing, the real strength of the Switch 2 at launch is its backwards compatibility. The full eight-year library of original Nintendo Switch games can be played on the Switch 2.</p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="594">That’s a lot of games, but unfortunately, you’re Switch 2 won’t even be able to hold a small fraction of them on its internal storage alone.&nbsp;Fortunately, Nintendo has once again made storage expandable via microSD cards—though not just any card will do this time around.</p>
<p data-start="994" data-end="1336"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/">Amazon is offering the Samsung P9 Express 512GB microSD card at 25% off.</a> Normally priced at $120, the discount brings it down to $80, saving you $40 for a limited time. Additionally, the 256GB option is down from $55 to just $40, saving you $15.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p data-start="1338" data-end="1805">The Switch 2’s updated system architecture delivers improved performance and noticeably faster load times compared to its predecessor. However, that performance leap also means the console requires microSD Express cards to keep up with its faster data speeds. Older microSD cards that worked perfectly fine on the original Switch simply won’t meet the new standards. Express cards tend to cost more, which makes sales like this Samsung P9 deal hard to pass up.</p>
<h2>Triple Your Gaming Storage</h2>
<p data-start="1807" data-end="2237">Out of the box, the Nintendo Switch 2 comes with 256GB of internal storage. While that’s a massive improvement over the original Switch’s paltry 32GB, the usable space is slightly lower than what’s listed on the tin once system software is accounted for. On top of that, Switch 2 games are noticeably larger than last-generation titles. <em data-start="2114" data-end="2176">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Switch 2 Edition</em>, for example, takes up more than 20GB on its own.</p>

<p data-start="2239" data-end="2635" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Adding a 512GB Samsung P9 microSD Express effectively triples your total storage, giving you far more breathing room as new releases roll out over the coming years. With that kind of capacity, you won’t need to constantly juggle downloads or delete old favorites to make room for the next big Nintendo release. I’ve still got my fingers crossed for a new <em data-start="2624" data-end="2634">Star Fox</em>.</p>
<p data-start="2239" data-end="2635" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/">Beyond the Nintendo Switch 2, the Samsung P9 microSD Express is also compatible with the original Switch, the Steam Deck, and Asus ROG Xbox Ally.</a> Also it’s not just for gaming. Photographers have been using these for ages too, so maybe you’re just looking to take more photos and videos on your Canon. The deal is just as good regardless of what you plan on using it for.</p>

<p>The <strong>ver. 2.6.0</strong> update arrived late last night here in the UK, and it seems that the main focus was on making things that little bit nicer to play. At least, we think that was the focus. As is so often the case with small Nintendo updates, the patch notes for this one are rather vague.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jnsogv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<h2>Tetris 99 ver. 2.6.0 (Released 21st Jan 2026)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong><br>
- Adjustments have been made to make the game more comfortable to play.</p>

<p>Yep, that's it. Now, as outlined above by @Oatmealdome over on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social/post/3mcyhsxud4c2l">Bluesky</a>, select Tetris 99 updates in the past have been all about moving event themes from the game server into the files, and there's every chance something similar has happened here — the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/tetris-99s-first-maximus-cup-of-2026-celebrates-animal-crossing-unlock-a-special-theme">Maximus Cup</a> wrapped up just two weeks ago, let's not forget.</p>
<p>Either way, make sure you've updated your game if you're after some bonus comfort.</p>

            <p>A new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> patch has arrived ahead of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shush-helldivers-2s-redacted-regiment-warbond-is-all-about-being-sneakily-stealthy-and-silently-suppressed">slightly delayed Redacted Regiment warbond</a> also making its sneaky debut today, January 22nd. In line with that warbond's stealthy shushness, this patch has seen Arrowhead add in new commando missions designed to reward those who know when to crouch-walk. They've also revealed that the slim build that's been in beta for a little while is finally ready to take the reigns from the standard version and its very chunky install size.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First of all, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/509603414731129453?l=english">patch notes</a> describe the new commando missions as follows: "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> are going deep behind enemy lines where their normal reliance on air superiority is no longer an option. Reinforcements have to be deployed in advance and destroyer support is a risky business with limited time." As such, knowing when to kill quietly or co-ordinate a rush with other players will be key.</p>
<p>You'll also be able to test out some tuning up of suppressed guns, which should now be "more valuable in stealth gameplay and attract less attention from enemies", as a result of firing noise radius tweaks. As part of that, foes like the devastator, berserker, spewer, charger, impaler, and observer have been made a bit more chill about bullets landing vaguely in their vicinity, so non-hits are less likely to instantly draw their ire.</p>
<p>Outside of the sneaky stuff, the slim build of Helldivers 2 which Arrowhead have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-install-size-reduction-effort-yields-131gb-in-cuts-and-you-can-try-the-slim-build-right-now">beta testing as part of efforts to cut the 154GB game down to just 23GB</a> in terms of install size will no longer be in beta at some point soon.</p><p>"We are ready to make the slim PC build default for all players," The studio wrote. "We’ll keep the larger version online for a short time to ensure a smooth transition for everyone; so you’ll continue to have the option to switch back should you wish. Once this transition has been completed we’ll look to sunset the large build permanently in the near future." As of writing, no exact date for the initial switch appears to have been given, but it sounds like it'll be ASAP.</p>
<p>Rounding out this first drop of new Helldivers 2 stuff for 2026 was a promise that there's "much more to come in February and beyond", as you'd hope. For now, in the spirit of these sneaky missions, Arrowhead aren't giving too much away.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a>’s efforts to break ground while Gittin’ Back To When Battlefield Was Gud continue with the announcement of two forthcoming maps in the EA shooter’s second season, which begins 17th February. One of the maps is Contaminated, a brand new field of battle that is comparable in scale to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-1">Battlefield 1</a>’s St Quentin Scar and Arras in Battlefield 5. The other is a remake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-4">Battlefield 4</a>’s Golmud Railway – a big, grassy vehicular affair, based on China’s actually existing Golmud-Lhasa railway line.
</p>
<p>
“In this next session, we’ll be testing content on one of Season 2’s new maps: Contaminated,” explains <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/2014005415114310024">an EA social post</a>. “We’ll be evaluating how vehicle gameplay and aerial presence interact with infantry combat, alongside cover and asset placement, and objective boundaries. We’ll also be testing how the map’s unique gameplay mechanics function in live matches, as well as the tools available to players to interact with them.
</p>
<p>
“While we’re saving full details on the new map for a later time,” it continues, “we can share that in terms of size, Contaminated falls between Eastwood and Mirak Valley, and is comparable to classic Battlefield maps such as St. Quentin Scar (Battlefield 1) or Arras (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-v">Battlefield V</a>).”
</p>
<p>
As for Golmud Railway, EA’s goal is “to preserve what made the map so memorable in Battlefield 4, particularly its combined arms gameplay, while improving how it plays and supports Battlefield 6 systems”. It’ll be the biggest Battlefield 6 map ever. EA will release it first in Battlefield Labs so that they can “test changes such as larger flight space, increased cover for aircraft, and other adjustments as the map evolves over time”.
</p><p>
Speaking of those wily airplanes, the devs are also testing out changes to vehicle handling in the run-up to Season 2. This includes tweaks to the AH-6 Little Bird, aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD_Helicopters_MH-6_Little_Bird">Killer Egg</a>, which looks much like how an egg might look if you mounted cannons on it and parked a bunch of screaming jarheads on each side. The fan favourite chopper appears in the game's singleplayer, and can be spawned in Battlefield Portal, but is not formally part of BF6 multiplayer right now. The devs are considering “how it fits within the broader vehicle ecosystem and how it performs across different combat scenarios”.
</p>
<p>
They’re also doing some initial testing on “Aircraft Radar, an important part of the aircraft gameplay experience and a system we’re actively evaluating as part of future air combat improvements”. As I understand it, this is a feature that extends your radar range so you can better track aircraft, which tend to be pretty fast. Unless I’m piloting them, in which case they tend to explode on the runway.
</p>
<p>
“In parallel, we’ll be exploring a tuning package focused on rocket and vehicle interactions, including early adjustments to weapons such as RPGs and TOW launchers, as well as vehicle handling considerations when countering rockets,” the devs continue. There’s some talk of testing improvements “to hit registration and overall combat consistency”, to avoid “scenarios where players may be eliminated after reaching cover, often referred to as ‘death behind cover’ or desync-related behavior.”
</p>
<p>
Last and maybe, possibly not least, the devs are doing more testing around solo play in the battle royale mode. They want to understand “where Solo play can best fit within the broader Battle Royale roster, including how it affects match flow, survivability, and long-term engagement when featured alongside other Battle Royale experiences”. They note that there will never be a “single permanent configuration” for the game’s Plunkbat equivalent. It shall shift and alter like wind through the grasses of Golmund Railway when some absolute plonker crashlands a Killer Egg on take-off.

              <p>Today’s annual Xbox Developer Direct goes live today at 1 p.m ET, during which the focus is expected to fall heavily on Playground Studios, developers of both <em>Fable</em> and&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 6</em>. Both are confirmed to be appearing at the show, alongside Game Freak’s non-<em>Pokémon</em> RPG&nbsp;<em>Beast of Reincarnation</em>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-6-release-date-leak-corroborated">as&nbsp;<em>Eurogamer</em> reports</a>, it seems we now doubly know for sure one of the show’s intended surprises: <em>Forza Horizon</em>‘s release date. However, if any other games are to appear, Microsoft has achieved the unlikely and managed to keep it all under wraps.</p> <p>This isn’t the first time the May 19 release date for <em>FH6</em> has got out into the wild, although a second source certainly makes it seem all the more likely. <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-leak-release-date-may-xbox-direct-2026-ps5-japan-2000659807">Last week a Saudi X account claimed to have seen an accidentally released trailer</a> for the Japan-set racing game which featured the release date of May 19. <em>Eurogamer</em> now adds that renowned leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/forza-horizon-6-oui-une-version-physique-sera-bien-prevue-a-cette-date-et-a-ce-prix-on-vous-revele-les-details-du-lancement-60887">billbil-kun has authenticated the date</a>, alongside the blatantly obvious news that the game will release in Standard, Deluxe and Premium forms. Despite only being a few months away, we’ve seen almost nothing of the game beyond <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-location-microsoft-tokyo-game-show-2000628658">a tease of Japanese mountains</a> and other culturally iconic artifacts. Microsoft is promising a “deep-dive” during the Direct, which will include “new features.”</p>

 <p>Microsoft also says the Developer Direct livestream will include a “first extended look at <em>Fable</em>,” the relaunching of the action-RPG franchise formerly developed by Lionhead Studios. Despite seemingly having been in some sort of development since perhaps as early as 2017, this will be the first time anything of depth will have been shown, following <a href="https://kotaku.com/fable-4-reboot-gameplay-trailer-xbox-summer-game-fest-1849051021">2023’s somewhat obfuscatory trailer</a> featuring Richard Ayoade. No word has leaked about whether we’ll be seeing a release date for the oft-slipping game.</p> <p>The final announced game is quite the coup for Microsoft (and Sony, it should be said), getting a Game Freak title away from Nintendo for the first time since 2017’s, er, <em>Giga Wrecker</em>. (No, me neither.) That eventually saw a Switch release, meaning the last time the&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> developer made a game that didn’t see a Nintendo version was 2015’s&nbsp;<em>Tempo the Badass Elephant</em>, and I think we can all agree: what? Before those two you have to go back to the 1990s. Anyway, action-RPG <em>Beast of Reincarnation</em> is due to come to PC, Xbox and PS5 (and&nbsp;<em>not</em> Switch) at some point in 2026, and today’s show will reveal “details of our protagonist Emma’s innovative plant manipulation actions and gameplay with her canine companion, Koo.”</p>

 <p>That’s all that’s confirmed, but I bet my right buttock that a fourth game will be snuck in there, even if it’s just a teasing glimpse (which you will <em>not</em> be getting of my right buttock.)</p> <p>You can catch the entire thing at 1 p.m. ET (10 a.m. PT) via Xbox’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXn6bvU1Kh4">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/Xbox">Twitch</a> channels, or just stare at the embed below for the next few hours.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-mini-drone-combo-with-4k-camera-hits-its-first-low-of-the-year-now-cheaper-than-black-friday-2000661980</link>
            <guid>1412920</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>“The Drone Ban” sounds overly alarmist, but it’s real. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission has instituted a ban on new foreign-made drones and drone components. Which, considering the huge market dominance of Chinese brands, translates into a “buy them now while you can” situation for hobbyist drones. While this ban prevents any new models from being imported and sold in the U.S., ones that are already here are still available for purchase and use.</p>
<p>DJI is the undisputed U.S. market leader for drone hobbyists, and they’re a Chinese company that’s subject to the new FCC ban. Thankfully this doesn’t affect current DJI products already in the country, so <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6821/">Amazon’s number-one-selling hobbyist drone — the DJI Mini 4K — is available and at its lowest price in 30 days after a 21% price drop down to $309.</a> There won’t be any upgraded versions of the Mini coming, so it’s wise to grab this one while supplies last.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6821/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Beginner-Friendly Bundle</h2>
<p>The DJI Mini 4K Combo that’s on sale at Amazon is comprised of the top-selling, beginner-friendly Mini 4K, its remote controller, two DJI Mini 2 Intelligent Flight rechargeable batteries, a propeller holder, and shoulder bag. The two batteries combine for over an hour of flight time, more than enough to use the Mini 4K’s UHD camera to take incredible aerial still photos and 4K videos.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the Mini 4K is exceptionally beginner-friendly — easy to learn, easy to operate, and built with failsafe features like GPS Return to Home, which automatically brings it back to its point of origin if the signal is dropped or you just feel like you’re losing control of the drone. Most of the commands are one-touch, including takeoff and a soft landing that prevents crashes. The DJI Fly app (available for download at the official DJI website) is packed with learning resources that will have you sending the Mini 4K up to 4,000 meters high, with video transmission of up to 10 km for long-range flight and photography.</p>



<h2>Tiny and Tough</h2>
<p>The Mini 4K weighs just over 8 ounces, and the four propeller arms fold back into the main body to reduce it to a neat palm-sized package. Even with such a small and lightweight body, the Mini 4K’s four brushless motors are powerful enough to battle winds of up to 23 mph while in flight, a vast improvement over earlier hobbyist drones.</p>
<p>Is it possible that the Drone Ban will be lifted and new advanced models from DJI and other foreign manufacturers will again be allowed into the U.S.? Of course — nothing is less predictable than what comes out of Washington. But there’s an equal or better chance that the ban will stick, and it could take years for U.S. manufacturers to catch up to where DJI is now. Bottom line: The last legal foreign-made hobbyist drones are on our shores now, and the DJI Mini 4K is among the very best for beginners and more advanced flyers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6821/">Take this Amazon limited-time deal and score yourself a terrific entry-level drone bundle for just $309.</a></p>

<p>Episode 7 is the upcoming continuation of Amazon’s Fallout Season 2. The smash-hit adaptation is currently on pace to outshine and dethrone S1 as the superior series, so make sure you don’t miss Fallout Season 2 Episode 7, with this release date and start time hub.</p>



<p>Video game adaptations are hit or miss. The Last of Us Season 1 is a masterpiece, whereas Halo bombed. Arcane is sensational, but Return to Silent Hill is a dumpster fire of epic proportions. Fallout has been a revelation, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-2-rotten-tomatoes-score-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout Season 2</a> continues to deliver for Amazon and fans.</p>



<p>If you’re looking forward to the follow-up to Episode 6’s ‘The Other Player,’ here’s the latest Episode 7 info.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-fallout-season-2-episode-7-coming-out-release-date-explained">When Is Fallout Season 2 Episode 7 Coming Out? Release Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s been a blast. Credit to Amazon</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fallout Season 2 Episode 7 will release on January 28, carrying on Season 2’s regular weekly release schedule.</strong></p>



<p>Episode 6 was released on January 21, so Episode 7 is coming on January 28. Shows on Amazon and Netflix are very consistent with episode release patterns, and Episode 7 should be no different.</p>



<p>However, Insider Gaming will be on the ball and the first to update you if any Radroaches or Deathclaws decide you need to take <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apply-for-fallout-shelter-reality-show-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(Fallout) shelter</a> for another week.</p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-season-2-episode-7-start-times-amp-date">Fallout Season 2 Episode 7 Start Times &amp; Date</h2>



<p><strong>Pacific Time-based viewers can start watching Fallout Season 2 Episode 7 from midnight on January 21, and it will be available later for everyone else around the world.</strong></p>



<p>While it would be good if the sun could somehow light up the planet in the same way worldwide, we have to settle for time zones, regions, and scattered releases.</p>



<p>Check out if your region is listed below and what time you can start watching Episode 7.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Praise the Omnissiah!</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> will soon get the Techmarine, its seventh playable class, and with it comes a unique ability that sounds very exciting indeed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/21/space-marine-2-techmarine/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a>, Space Marine 2 game director Dmitry Grigorenko revealed that the Techmarine is designed to be a crowd control and area defense specialist, leaning on tech to get the job done, as they do in the Warhammer 40,000 lore and tabletop wargame upon which Space Marine 2 is based.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In melee the Techmarine uses the Omnissian Axe for wide swipes. This is an upcoming weapon only the Techmarine will have access to upon launch. He also has mechanical arms and an automatic turret bolted directly onto his Power Pack.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Techmarine Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This means that while you’re actively fighting, you can use the Techmarine’s Combat Skill (Space Marine 2’s version of an ‘ultimate’ ability) to trigger the mounted Servo-Gun, which will lay down heavy fire without the player needing to aim it. “Just watch as Tyranids and Thousand Sons get vaporized before your very eyes,” Grigorenko teased.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But here’s the super interesting part: the automatic Servo-Gun frees you up by executing Gun Strikes for you. This is a big deal indeed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the uninitiated, in Space Marine 2, a Gun Strike is a powerful, quick pistol shot you perform after a perfect dodge or parry (or a heavy attack that stuns smaller foes) when a red reticle appears on an enemy, dealing significant damage and allowing for powerful follow-ups without needing to aim or use ammo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All other classes must manually do a Gun Strike for themselves. But Techmarine players, as Grigorenko put it, “will be free to continue aiming at other targets while their turrets stagger or kill their most pressing assailants.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Already fans are getting excited about this new ability, even though it’s limited to your Combat Skill (at least, that’s how the Xbox Wire blog post makes it sound). “Jesus Christ, I was already excited for this class, it just keeps on getting better,” said one fan. “I hope there’s a Techmarine perk or weapon perk that’ll help give more Gun Strikes to really take advantage of that.” Said another person who clearly knows their Warhammer 40,000 lore: “Get your blessing brothers, awake the machine spirit, refined the holy oil and praise the Motive Force, this new class looks dope.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s even more to the Techmarine. It also has the unique ability to locate and service Tarantula Sentry turrets during missions. “Though they can’t be carried or placed freely, these can provide much welcome support to your Combat Squad by attacking your enemies automatically until they either run out of ammunition or get destroyed,” Grigorenko explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Techmarine hits Space Marine 2 as part of Patch 12, due out in a few weeks. The new class will be available across all modes apart from the narrative campaign, as it centers around the story of Ultramarines Lieutenant Demetrian Titus.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Also coming with Patch 12 is a 12th mission to the Operations and Stratagems modes, a new mission pick-up type, three new Hero weapon variants, and new customization options for Space Marine helmetless heads. If you own the Season Pass 2 you also get a brand-new Assault Champion Raven Guard skin and a unique cosmetic pack for the Carcharodons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As announced this week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-is-set-to-close-out-january-2026-with-a-bolt-from-the-grim-darkness-of-the-far-future-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Space Marine 2 releases on Xbox Game Pass, with Xbox Play Anywhere support, on January 29</a>, so expect an influx of new players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Polish language support has also been added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps most notable is what appears to be a typo in the patch notes' list of bug fixes, which references an issue that has been fixed when <em>playing </em>as Kamek on Choco Mountain. Kamek is not a playable character (yet) in Mario Kart World, but this is likely just a reference to the Kamek item. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, nothing else interesting has been discovered in the patch — which is far less meaty than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-update-140-tweaks-track-layouts-adds-custom-item-rules-now-lets-you-see-what-music-is-playing">Nintendo's 1.4.0 update for Mario Kart World that launched at the end of last year</a>. That addition reworked the layouts of several areas to spice up the game's open world, and led fans to believe more changes would likely follow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As of yet, Nintendo has simply been tinkering with its Switch 2 racer, without adding any extra DLC (free or otherwise). Time will tell how Mario Kart World might expand further as the Switch 2's lifecycle matures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, here are the full patch notes for today's Mario Kart World update, version 1.5.0:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mario Kart World: Version 1.5.0 (Released January 21, 2026)</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>General</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><em>Added team races to Knockout Tour when playing in a room during “Online Play” and “Wireless Play”.</em></li><li><em>The game now supports the Polish language.</em><ul data-cy="list"><li><em>Note: You can change your selected language using the “Language” setting in the “System” menu of “System Settings.”</em></li></ul></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><em>Fixed an issue where the game would sometimes end if a player plays as Kamek on Choco Mountain.</em></li><li><em>Fixed an issue where the displayed rating would sometimes be incorrect when joining “Everyone” in “Online Play” while in a room.</em></li><li><em>Several other issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience.</em></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

But it's for his work with Retro Studios on the Metroid Prime series for which he's best known.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in an interview with <a href="https://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309405257646218805574" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Dream</a> magazine, Tanabe has said that Metroid Prime 4 was his final game for Nintendo — meaning that he has left the series' story unfinished, and the fate of his villain Sylux uncertain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sylux has been built up as the next Big Bad of the Metroid Prime series, following his introduction in Metroid Prime: Hunters, and the end of the original Metroid Prime trilogy that pitted Samus against Dark Samus. During the interview, Tanabe said he saw Sylux as a way to "further expand the 'Metroid Prime Universe'" and create further games beyond the initial trilogy. Because of this, he implored developers to foreshadow Sylux's presence via cameos in Metroid Prime 3 and Metroid Prime: Federation Force, while keeping his full story under-wraps. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"A long time passed before I finally had the opportunity to make this game," Tanabe said of Metroid Prime 4 (via machine translation). "Considering my age, I felt that making this Metroid Prime series might be my last chance. Therefore, I conceived and planned this project as the 'first installment of the Sylux Saga.'</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Metroid Prime 4 Beyond Switch 2 Edition Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I portrayed Sylux as a villain with a dark personality, deep resentment, and despicable methods; and from this game onward, Samus will realize that a direct confrontation with him is inevitable, and he must be completely defeated. Therefore, the final battle between Sylux and Samus is not yet over. However, it took longer than I had imagined to complete this game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Furthermore, I have confirmed that I will no longer be able to participate in the production of the series," Tanabe concluded. "Whether a sequel will be made is still uncertain, but I sincerely hope that one day, [assistant producer Risa] Tabata and Retro Studios will be able to tell this story completely and bring it to a close."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo is yet to comment on the report, or announce Tanabe's departure. IGN has asked the company for more detail today.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">After a lengthy delay, Metroid Prime 4 finally launched for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 last month, albeit to a more muted critical response than the franchise's beloved original trilogy. Nintendo has so far made no official announcement on how well the game has sold. However, earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-source-blames-switch-2-holiday-sales-slowdown-on-the-economic-landscape-and-the-absence-of-a-major-western-game-despite-the-release-of-metroid-prime-4-beyond">an unnamed Nintendo source</a> blamed the recent slowdown in Switch 2 sales over the holiday period on a "complicated" economic climate and the "absence of a major Western game" — despite the launch of Metroid Prime 4. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's been 40 years since I joined Nintendo," Tanabe reflected. "Metroid Prime 4 will be the last game I work on at Nintendo. However, we didn't deliberately do anything 'special.' Instead, like all previous Nintendo titles, we worked together with Retro Studios to create it, hoping to bring a fun and unique experience to players of all ages and types.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If it becomes a game that leaves a lasting impression on players who have played it, I will be very gratified. And for those who haven't played it yet, I hope you will experience the unknown planet Viewros through Samus' eyes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <p>We can now finally play <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> with other people courtesy of a new online multiplayer mod.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/11590">The mod, called simply Witcher Online</a>, makes the game into a sort of MMO-like experience, in that you can lark around with groups of people, chat via text, and perform emotes while you hang around wherever you want in the game. I don't know how 'massively' the multiplayer component is, as in how many people can play together, but a video of Witcher Online shows a maximum of five players together, so perhaps that offers a clue?</p>

<p>Specifically, the Witcher Online mod allows you to host or join servers online playing The Witcher 3. You can all work your way through the game together, if you want, or you can mess around doing whatever you want to pass the time.</p><p>You don't all have to be Geralt. A Custom Player Characters mod lets you play as any of the notable characters in the game and tweak the appearance of them, so if you think Yennefer is the real hero of the story, make it so.</p>
<p>Note: you'll need a copy of the game in order to play. Also note: it does appear to be rather buggy. Players in the Witcher Online video seem to frequently fall upwards into the sky. Perhaps it's to do with conflicts between different instances of the game. Maybe mounting Roach in one instance but looks like they're falling into the sky in another instance. It's a perilous business, horse riding.</p>
<p>The mod, made by Nexus Mods user rejuvenate, appeared a little earlier in January, and arrives in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-expansion-rumours-analyst-100-percent-certain-cd-projekt-red-will-release-significant-new-content-this-year">a year of rather unexpected Witcher 3 activity</a>. Rumour has it that there's an add-on or expansion for the 11-year-old game that will launch this year, possibly bridging the gap between The Witcher 3 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>, and possibly taking place in Zerrikania, a desert-like place and biome we haven't explored before.</p>

<p>Rebirth and third entry are now in development for Switch 2</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="9b2fa0ecbe9f7"><a title="FF7 Rebirth" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9b2fa0ecbe9f7/ff7-rebirth.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you've been keeping up with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> on the Switch 2, then you'll probably already know that its direct sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, along with the untitled third entry, will also head to the hybrid console in the future.</p>
<p>Rebirth represents quite a drastic departure from Remake, introducing a vast open world that serves as an almost direct contrast to the tightly-designed environments found in the first entry. This will no doubt sow doubts in fans' minds about just how well it might hold up on the Switch 2. After all, Rebirth's visuals were already noted to have suffered from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2rHUbqauUk">a few downgrades</a> at launch when compared to Remake.</p>
<p>From a gameplay perspective, however, fans can expect parity across all systems with Rebirth and the upcoming third entry. In <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-za/News/2026/January/FINAL-FANTASY-VII-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-Interview-Naoki-Hamaguchi-Director-3010151.html">speaking with Nintendo of Europe</a>, game director Naoki Hamaguchi states that the gameplay experience is "exactly the same", explaining that any differences might be "confusing for players".</p>
<p>Here's what he had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There's not a huge amount of information I can share in terms of future games, but I can reassure players that we’re working on the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the second game in the series, and the third game too. They are being worked on for Nintendo Switch 2 alongside the other platforms right now.</p>
<p>"One thing to reassure the fans who want to play these games on Nintendo Switch 2: I've got a personal policy where I don't want to make any versions of my games different or offer a different gameplay experience just because they're on different hardware. That might get confusing for players, and they might wonder which version of the game they should buy. That’s something I’d very much like to avoid. The Nintendo Switch 2 versions are being developed in a way that keeps the gameplay experience pretty much exactly the same as all the other platforms, so I hope this reassures Nintendo Switch 2 players."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given that Remake hits the Switch 2 <strong>*checks notes*</strong> <em>today</em>, it seems likely that we won't see Rebirth for a little while yet, never mind the mysterious third entry. We'll be keeping a close eye on any and all developments, however, and let you know as soon as we hear more.</p>
<p>In the meantime, do check <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">our full review</a> for Final Fantasy VII Remake if you haven't already. We awarded it a score of 9/10, stating that it "makes impressively few compromises" in moving over to the Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Konami’s Silent Hill 2 has been brought to life through Return to Silent Hill. The 2026 movie adaptation looked quite impressive in its prerelease trailers and screenshots, and Pyramid Head looks as dangerous as he should, but all the effort appears to be in vain.</p>



<p>The 2024 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/konami-says-more-silent-hill-remakes-are-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> gave the franchise new life. It recaptured some of the love and nostalgia from the late 90s and early 2000s era. Silent Hill f went in a different but equally compelling direction. It was full steam ahead for a new Silent Hill movie, but unfortunately, Return to Silent Hill has gotten lost in the fog.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-reviews-are-in-for-return-to-silent-hill-and-it-s-not-good">The Reviews Are In For Return To Silent Hill, And It’s Not Good</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The reviews are just as horrifying. Credit to Davis Films, Electric Shadow, Supernix, and WIP.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Currently, Return to Silent Hill has a jaw-droppingly low score of just <strong>6% on <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/return_to_silent_hill" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rotten Tomatoes</a></strong> based on 17 reviews. There’s a chance more reviews will be added, but it’s hard to see a route back for the movie—and further reviews could bring the score down further.</p>







<p>Critics have described it as a “Massively disappointing adaptation of a classic horror video game,” “An atmospheric, supernatural horror thriller that offers no surprises, thrills or palpable scares,” and “An adaptation that fails to improve upon the source material or do anything particularly new and interesting.”</p>



<p>This makes it the worst-reviewed Silent Hill movie in the franchise, and this isn’t saying much.</p>



<p>The 2006 adaptation with Sean Bean is a Scorsese epic, in comparison, with its 33% Rotten Tomatoes score (and generally isn’t a bad watch), whereas 2012’s Silent Hill: Revelation sees reception plunge to 8%.</p>



<p>Return to Silent Hill beats them all, as it stands. This is likely to affect box office numbers, and it could be the final nail in the coffin for any future Silent Hill movies.</p>



<p>If you already have tickets booked for Return to Silent Hill, please let the community know what you think of it.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cdpr-could-spend-up-to-800-million-on-the-witcher-4-its-estimated/</link>
            <guid>1412860</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>An analyst has predicted that CD Projekt Red could end up spending close to $800 million on the development and marketing of The Witcher 4. </p>



<p>The Witcher 4 will be the next big instalment from CD Projekt Red, and we already know it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-confirms-the-witcher-4-not-releasing-in-2026-new-trilogy-sticking-to-6-year-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t release in 2026</a>. The new trilogy will follow a 6-year plan. As we wait for more news about the title, analysts have predicted the budget that the developers might be targeting for this game. </p>







<h2 id="h-the-witcher-4-could-cost-close-to-400-million-with-an-additional-400-million-to-be-spent-on-marketing">The Witcher 4 Could Cost Close to $400 Million, With An Additional $400 Million to be Spent on Marketing </h2>



<p>The estimate of The Witcher 4 costing $800 million comes from a post on Polish platform <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/analizy/noblesecurities-cdprojekt-wiedzmin-dlc-orion-cyberpunk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Strefa Inwestorów</a> (via <a href="https://clawsomegamer.com/analyst-estimates-800-million-budget-for-the-witcher-4-10x-higher-than-cost-of-the-witcher-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Clawsome Gamer</a>). The prediction comes from a Noble Securities Analyst, Mateusz Chrzanowski, who has stated that The Witcher 4 could cost PLN 1.4 billion (USD 388 million) to make, and that CDPR could spend a similar amount on marketing, bringing the total cost of the title close to $800 million. </p>



<p>Additionally, the analyst has predicted that the trilogy’s budget has increased from PLN 2.1 billion (USD 583 million) previously to PLN 3.2 billion (USD 861 million). </p>



<p>Additionally, the report discusses the budget and release window for Project Orion (the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel). It seems this title could cost around PLN 1.5 billion (USD 416 million) to develop, largely due to the apparent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2-could-feature-online-multiplayer-new-job-listing-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer integration</a>. This integration has also apparently pushed the release date to Q4 2030, which will be Cyberpunk 2077’s 10th Anniversary. </p>



<p>Readers should note that these are analyst predictions and not official numbers from CDPR, so take this information with a grain of salt. </p>







<p>In other news, CD Projekt Red has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-adds-senior-baldurs-gate-3-developer-to-the-witcher-4-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought on a senior Baldur’s Gate 3 developer</a> to The Witcher 4 team.

              <p>If yesterday’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-earnings-layoffs-delays-canceled-ai-2000661869">Ubisoft announcements of cancellations and studio restructuring</a> and promises to focus on gen-AI were intended to win back shareholder confidence, it’s safe to say that’s not <em>really</em> worked out. At the start of trading today, the publisher’s share price dropped to its lowest level in 14 years, a third of their value wiped out overnight, and that’s after years of colossal falls. In fact, a Ubisoft share bought in June 2018 has now dropped in value by more than <em>95 percent</em>.</p> <p>Yesterday, on announcing <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-black-flag-remake-delay-2000661866">the cancellation of projects like the&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia:</em> <em>The Sands</em><em>&nbsp;of Time&nbsp;</em>remake</a> alongside a number of unannounced titles, and a plan to restructure its development studios yet again (in other words, close more of them and fire many more staff), Ubisoft described these actions as introducing “a radically new value-creation model.” It’s certainly proven radical.</p>

 <p>A <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf">lengthy statement</a> laid out how Ubisoft plans to redesign its entire structure and “simplify” its operations, all with a goal to create “efficiency” and convince investors that the company is going to stop hemorrhaging money. The plan promised to focus its attentions on turning its established IPs into “annual billionaire brands” while directing its attention toward all of last year’s buzzwords like “GaaS” (games as a service) and “Gen-AI initiatives.”</p> <p>At the time of writing, a share in Ubisoft is wavering around $4.30, down from $6.60 yesterday. That’s a drop from a peak of $13.40 last year, and an astonishing plummet from 2018’s all-time peak of $95. Things had stayed hopeful until January 2021 when prices still held to around $83, but then began a steep slope downward that has never let up. This has all occurred alongside <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-skull-bones-delay-assassins-creed-far-cry-cuts-1849975925">the repeated cancellation of major projects</a>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-layoffs-division-3-massive-tencent-2000659368">wave after wave of firings</a> of its employees at studios all around the world.</p>

 <p>This endless deckchair rearrangement doesn’t appear to be fooling anyone, and each move has seen prices tumble in response. This morning’s market reaction to yesterday’s latest raft of plans could be the sharpest drop the company has ever seen, unless there’s a skin-of-their-teeth bounce-back later in the morning.</p>

 <p>Still, if you were looking to sell your brand to a private owner, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-shareholders-approve-55bn-sale-saudi-arabia-trump-2000655342">as EA is currently attempting</a>, being this colossally incompetent would sure make you look a lot cheaper to interested buyers.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>EA has revealed that one of the most iconic maps from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-4">Battlefield 4</a> is being rebuilt and brought over to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> as its largest map to date.</p>
<p>That map is Golmund Railway, a massive arena featuring a big ol' train at its centre. Back in Battlefield 4, teams could capture this train as part of the game's Levolution mechanic, moving slowly and offering the controlling team a handy advantage. Fun fact, the Golmud Railway is also based on a real-world railway in China.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/2014005415114310024">In a post on the official Battlefield Comms social media account</a>, the news was broken alongside a peak at other tidbits coming in the future, including aircraft and vehicle combat systems, gameplay tuning, hit registration. All to come as part of in-development changes for the game's second season, as well as more substantial shifts to come later in the year.</p>

</figure>
<p>In regard to Golmud Railway, the post reads "Golmud Railway is being rebuilt for today's Battlefield, not simply ported forward. Our goal is to preserve what made the map so memorable in Battlefield 4, particularly its combined arms gameplay, while improving how it plays and supports Battlefield 6 systems. Golmud is planned to be the largest Battlefield 6 map to date, giving us the opportunity to expand gameplay on a larger scale.</p>
<p>"We're bringing Golmud into Battlefield Labs early as this will be a multi-session project. Through Labs, we want to test changes such as larger flight space, increased cover for aircraft, and other adjustments as the map evolves over time."</p>
<p>As for when you can expect Golmud to make it into Battlefield 6, there's no word on a release date yet. However, more information on how to take part in early play sessions for the map will apparently be announced at a later date by the Battlefield Comms social media account, so keep an eye out if you're keen.</p>

            <p>Act surprised: the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a> release date does appear to be 19th May - a date we're expecting to be announced during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-developer-direct-2026-time-where-to-watch">this evening's Xbox Developer Direct</a>.</p>
<p>Reliable leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/forza-horizon-6-oui-une-version-physique-sera-bien-prevue-a-cette-date-et-a-ce-prix-on-vous-revele-les-details-du-lancement-60887">Dealabs</a> corroborated the date as well as details about the different editions of the game. This isn't very exciting; there will be a Standard, Deluxe and Premium edition, and a physical version for Xbox Series X.</p>
<p>We've heard this May date before, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-6s-release-date-might-have-been-revealed-early-and-its-allegedly-coming-sooner-than-anticipated">from a Forza Horizon 6 leak earlier this month</a>, which revealed we'd get an extra Ferrari if we pre-ordered the game. In the game, that is - not a Ferrari not in real life.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-6-will-be-set-exactly-where-we-expected-it-to-be-set">The open-world setting for this instalment of Forza Horizon will be Japan</a>, but so far we've only seen a cinematic teaser for the game so we could do with seeing a chunk of gameplay footage, which we presumably will, today.</p><p>We also already know that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-6-will-come-to-playstation-5-but-not-immediately">Forza Horizon 6 will<em> </em>come to PlayStation 5</a>, but this version won't launch alongside the Xbox and PC versions in May. "Forza Horizon 6 will launch first on Xbox consoles and PC in 2026," Microsoft said in a statement in September. "Playground Games and Turn 10 Studios are also working together to bring Forza Horizon 6 to PlayStation 5 post-launch."</p>
<p>Today's Xbox Developer Direct starts at 6pm GMT and we'll be covering it live on Eurogamer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="344fee7dbef72"><a title="Croc: Legend of the Gobbos" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/344fee7dbef72/croc-legend-of-the-gobbos.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Argonaut Software</em></figcaption></figure><p>Poor old <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/croc_legend_of_the_gobbos">Croc: Legend of the Gobbos</a>. The Argonaut Games remaster arrived on Switch on <strong>2nd April</strong>, the very same day that we were all distracted by the monster Switch 2 reveal Direct, and those who pre-ordered the physical edition way back in Oct 2024 <em>still</em> have no idea when it's going to arrive. Talk about a Croc-y start.</p>
<p>The game itself was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/croc-remaster-will-miss-its-december-2024-launch-window">delayed</a> back in late 2024. After launch, Rock It Games, the company behind the physical, said that <a href="https://rockitgames.com/blogs/news/croc-update">tariff issues</a> had "made it temporarily difficult to schedule shipments for some items," but things were supposedly back on track. Then, following the release of the game's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/crocs-switch-remaster-returns-this-week-with-a-free-platinum-edition-update">'Platinum Edition' update</a> last October, the company pushed things again to get the whole game complete on cartridge — "the unavoidable consequence of this upgrade meant delays in the mastering, approval process and physical manufacture of the disc and cartridge with Sony and Nintendo respectively."</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067kmvwoj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>So, where does that leave things now? In a <a href="https://rockitgames.com/blogs/news/coc-legend-of-the-gobbos-january-2026-update">new blog post</a>, Rock It says that "the delays have been unacceptable," and that going forward, it will be committed to "only offering games once development is complete and our delivery timelines are fully under our control." But there's still no firm release date.</p>
<p>According to the post, the game disc and cartridges have now been approved for production by Sony and Nintendo, Platinum Edition update included, and much of the extra merch found in the beefy Collector's Editions is either complete or arriving in the warehouse by the end of the month.</p>
<p>The thing is, the production updates aren't consistent between posts — one month, items are complete and ready to go, the next, they're not. Mix-ups happen, of course, but those who dropped $129.99 on the Collector's Edition over a year ago are, rightly, after something a little more concrete.</p>

<p>"I have zero trust in Rock It Games because of this," one user wrote on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrocLegendoftheGobbos/">r/CrocLegendoftheGobbos</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrocLegendoftheGobbos/comments/1qfs5w9/argonaut_acknowledges_delays/">Reddit</a>, "If they would have just told the truth, and admitted things got screwed up, and didn't go to plan, I would have been disappointed, but understood." Others have been so frustrated with the process that they have already requested refunds.</p>
<p>"We’re confident that the regular and Collector’s Editions of Croc are coming soon," developer Argonaut Games said in an update post on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTmH2B5FmHd/">Instagram</a>, "We’re as eager to receive them as all of our customers are!"</p>
<p>When exactly "soon" is remains to be seen, but hey, maybe 2026 will be the year!</p>

            <p>Ubisoft’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">bloodbath of game cancellations and restructuring</a> yesterday has attracted the expected fiery response from unionised workers, with the French game industry union Solidaires Informatique <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:gwmurecu4lbyaqjzsyv2orat/post/3mcxfxwczwk2z">calling a half-day strike today</a>. Cost-cutting and potential layoffs aside, the strikers are protesting against Ubisoft’s decision to mandate a full return to office, with workers given an annual allowance of work from home days instead - something a publisher executive has justified as a move “to enhance collective efficiency” and “the sense of belonging”.</p><!--more-->
<p>Ubisoft management’s latest bout of corpobutchery has seen them bin off six games, including the Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time remake, delay seven others, and confirm the closure of Ubisoft Stockholm. </p>
<p>More layoffs will follow, though Ubisoft have yet to share any precise numbers. It’s all part of the company’s Age of Sigmar-esque transformation into a collection of “Creative Houses” <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">with heavy investment from Tencent</a>, dedicated to a smaller number of hopefully better-selling games – in particular, open world and live service projects, with generative AI dutifully touted as a means of boosting production.</p>
<p>As part of this transition, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-close-the-studio-behind-assassins-creed-rebellion-days-after-the-developers-vote-to-unionise">recently shuttered Ubisoft Halifax</a> (a few weeks after the studio voted to unionise – no connection, they insist) and announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/having-asked-division-devs-to-lay-themselves-off-ubisoft-are-now-cutting-55-jobs-at-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm">layoffs at Tom Clancy’s The Division developers Massive</a>.</p>
<p>In a statement, Solidaires Informatique describe today’s strike as "an initial response to the absurdity of management decisions”, with more action probably to follow. "It is out of the question to let a boss run rampant and destroy our working conditions,” they write, addressing Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot. “Perhaps he needs to be reminded that it is his employees who make the games." The union are also calling for “decent pay rises this year” and “maintaining and extending the teleworking conditions”.</p>
<p>RTO policies are frequently the focus of union action. In October 2024, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/700-ubisoft-staff-in-france-hold-strikes-in-response-to-worldwide-return-to-office-mandate-from-assassins-creed-publisher">700 Ubisoft staff went on strike</a> over a requirement to work in-office three days a week. </p>
<p>Detractors of remote working argue that it’s less efficient and hinders teamwork. As Ubisoft’s senior vice-president of studio operations Marie-Sophie de Waubert told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/we-want-them-to-be-the-best-in-the-world-in-every-segment-were-in-ubisofts-vision-for-its-new-creative-houses">GamesIndustry</a> yesterday, “the one and only objective [for the new RTO policy] is to enhance collective efficiency, to drive the dynamics, the creativity, the sense of belonging.”</p><p>Advocates for remote working argue that it doesn’t materially affect how much workers contribute, and that it can be vital for people with disabilities, family commitments and other practical challenges that make commuting or sharing office space unfeasible. When EA implemented a partial return to the office in May last year, anonymous staff <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-employees-upset-and-confused-at-return-to-office-mandate">offered</a> childcare, medical conditions, and long commutes as reasons for needing an exemption from in-office work.</p>
<p>Advocates for remote working also argue that forbidding hybrid or full remote-working is a “soft layoff” strategy, since some remote workers may have no choice but to move on. That was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/following-mass-layoffs-microsoft-exec-insists-return-to-office-mandate-is-not-about-reducing-headcount">the claim levelled at Microsoft last September</a>, when they imposed a return to the office following thousands of layoffs.</p>
<p>I am very much Team Homeworking, inasmuch as I couldn’t do this job if I had to work in-office 9-5. In general, I think RTO mandates reflect an unexamined belief among managers that people become shirkers and layabouts unless they're kept firmly inside the panopticon.</p>
<p>Arguments continue about RTO beyond Ubisoft. Rockstar’s recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-reportedly-orders-gta-6-developers-to-end-hybrid-working-in-the-name-of-quality-and-polish">implementation of RTO in the name of “quality and polish”</a> is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-this-from-happening-again-uk-politician-calls-out-rockstar-over-gta-6-developer-firings">one of the reasons some GTA 6 workers chose to unionise</a>, shortly before Rockstar laid off a number of workers for “gross misconduct”, in what British unions have called a case of “union-busting”.</p>
