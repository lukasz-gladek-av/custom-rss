			<p><strong>Embark Studio's</strong> new third-person shooter, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/">ARC Raiders</a></strong>, isn't the typical third-person cover shooter you might remember from peak Xbox 360/PS3-era games. It's an <strong>extraction shooter</strong>, which means it's as much about the looting as it is about the shooting, but above all, it's about surviving.</p>



<p>You can fill your backpack with as much high-tier loot as it can carry, but it'll be all for naught if you can't make it back to your home base in Speranza alive. After playing for over a dozen hours (and climbing), there are a few things I wish I knew before I started raiding the surface of Calabretta.</p>

<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-tips-and-tricks-what-you-need-to-know-before-you-start-raiding">ARC Raiders Tips and Tricks - What You Need to Know Before You Start Raiding</h2>



<h3 id="h-track-everything">Track Everything</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Tips-and-Tricks-3-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Look for the little Icon in the top-right, that tells you it's an item you need.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Even when you're just starting out, going to the surface on your first quests, fighting new ARCs for the first time to try and get some high-tier loot, it can all feel a bit aimless if you're just filling your backpack with the first things you find. </p>



<p>You only have so many slots to take things home with you, and only one of those slots is your <strong>Safe Pocket</strong>, where you can place one kind of item to make sure it comes home with you. If you're just grabbing the first things you find as you search the various cabinets, boxes, broken-down ARCs, and any nook and cranny where loot can be found, you'll fill your precious slots faster than you'll realize.</p>



<p>That leaves you stuck in your inventory menu, managing items either by dropping them or swapping them out with an item you found you actually need, and now every breach and search you perform gets bogged down and wastes time, time you may have needed to make it to an elevator or hatch to make it back to Speranza safely. Not to mention the fact that you're leaving yourself vulnerable to other Raiders while stuck in menus. </p>



<p>Take a few minutes before you jump into your next raid, figure out what upgrades you want next, and track their resources. <strong>Only grab items that have a marker in the top-right corner of their box,</strong> indicating it's something you actually need for an upgrade you want. You'll have better, more efficient raids, and upgrade your gear far faster than if you grab everything you see.</p>



<h3 id="h-rely-on-yourself-before-traders">Rely on Yourself Before Traders</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Tips-and-Tricks-5-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>The more self-reliant you are, the better.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>When you start ARC Raiders, you'll meet five traders: <strong>Celeste, Shani, Tian Wen, Lance,</strong> and <strong>Apollo</strong>. They'll each give you quests to complete as you dig further into the game, but they'll also sell you supplies across different categories, like <strong>Security, Guns, Grenades and Gadgets</strong>, and <strong>Health Items</strong>.</p>



<p>If you're having trouble holding on to resources and have the cash, then feel free to buy what you need from them, but, realistically, you'll likely never really need to use their shops. Or at least, once you build a <strong>Refiner</strong> for your workshop, you should be able to break down what you find up top into crafting materials you need, and craft what you're looking for at your <strong>Workbench</strong>. The money you acquire from selling any loot is still useful to have for a rainy day, but it's a far better use of your cash to expand the limit of your <strong>Stash</strong> before spending it all on items that you can craft yourself, especially in your earlier hours.</p>



<h3 id="h-your-experience-will-be-as-chill-as-you-want-it-to-be">Your Experience Will be as Chill as You Want it to Be</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Tips-and-Tricks-2-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>You'll catch more flies with honey than vinegar. </em></figcaption></figure>



<p>There's a lot to be said about how multiplayer games with a PvP aspect should handle matchmaking. I won't get into the meat of it here, but for my money, the way Embark handles matchmaking, at least in my experience, is the way to do it. The team employs <strong>aggression-based matchmaking</strong>, which means you'll get matched up with more PvP-minded players the more you play with a PvP mindset.</p>



<p>But if you're not shooting at other players, if you're just greeting them with a friendly 'hello' and looting alongside them peacefully, then you'll keep getting matched with players of that ilk. ARCs are dangerous enough, and ARC Raiders is arguably a better experience when focusing on the common robot enemy, instead of your fellow Raider, who is just trying to survive.</p>



<p>Of course, it's not fool-proof, even when you go in Solo, which is usually where you'll get a better chance of finding other passive players. But if you want to try and make your looting experience a little safer, strong use of the <strong>"</strong><em><strong>Don't Shoot!"</strong></em> emote can go a long way.</p>



<h3 id="h-being-successfully-sneaky-is-more-audio-than-visual">Being Successfully Sneaky is More Audio Than Visual</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Tips-and-Tricks-4-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>All you need to do is duck into some bushes.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This isn't to say that you should walk into the sightlines of every ARC and potential enemy Raider you come across because you think you'll be far enough away that they won't see you. Maybe that'll be the case with an opposing player, but an ARC can still spot you from a certain degree of distance.</p>



<p>That said, the thing to focus on more than anything is how loud you're being when you're topside. <strong>You'll draw attention to yourself faster the louder you are</strong>, which is why you'll want to be as quiet as you can when up top. On the flip side, you also want to be quiet because it gives you more opportunity to listen closely for other Raiders.</p>



<p>As far as the actual sightlines for ARCs, though, often all you need to do is hide in some bushes to avoid their ire. It's not foolproof, and if you're hurt while trying to hide, your character won't be able to audibly hide the pain, and you'll draw attention to yourself, but it's often all you have to do. <strong>There's a serious lack of available cover Topisde</strong>, and you should try to keep an eye open for any hidey-holes to duck into if you suddenly find yourself in a fight.</p>



<h3 id="h-don-t-lose-track-of-time">Don't Lose Track of Time</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Tips-and-Tricks-1-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Explore all you want, but don't lose track of time.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>When you jump into a session, you're immediately met with a countdown at the top of your screen. It's telling you how much time is left before all the elevators on that map close, and you're left with having to find a Raider Hatch to make it back home.</p>



<p>Obvious as it may seem, <strong>you really cannot lose track of time</strong>. Particularly when you're in your early hours, if you start seeing you're getting to 10 minutes or less to get to an elevator, you should make getting to an elevator your only priority. If you're not paying attention to the map, then you're probably not aware of which elevators have already closed and which ones remain open. <strong>Your stamina only goes so far,</strong> so hoofing it across the map will take you more time than you think, and you can easily find yourself stuck Topside.</p>



<p>Plus, you don't always know what you're going to run into as you try to make the cross to an elevator, if you're not already near one. Losing track of time is the easiest mistake you can make while Topside, and you don't want to make getting home tougher than it already is.</p>

He went on to lead his own group at <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Nintendo_EPD_Production_Group_No._9">Nintendo EPD</a> and played a role in the creation of the 3DS as the producer.</p>
<p>In more recent years, he acted as a producer on games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8</a>, and helped run <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Nintendo_EPD_Smart_Device_Production_Group">Nintendo's mobile division</a>, working on titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/super_mario_run">Super Mario Run</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/fire_emblem_heroes">Fire Emblem Heroes</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/mario_kart_tour">Mario Kart Tour</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Fable: The First Preview]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/fable-the-first-preview</link>
            <guid>1414933</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Let me start by saying that I’m borderline blown away by what I’ve seen from the Fable reboot so far. New Fable developer Playground Games already had my trust – this is a studio that has produced nothing but one open-world masterpiece after another – but after learning a lot more about what the team has in store for its resurrection of one of Xbox’s biggest franchises, I’m even more bullish about where they’re going with it. Playground has turned the ForzaTech engine into a medieval British postcard, combat is multilayered, a thousand NPC townsfolk are waiting to be romanced, co-parented with, divorced from, and landlord over, and there are chickens abound just waiting to be kicked. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside Fable’s big coming-out party at the recent Xbox Developer Direct, I also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/weve-been-working-on-this-game-for-a-really-really-long-time-the-big-fable-interview-with-microsoft-developer-playground"><u>spoke with game director Ralph Fulton</u></a> about the choices the studio has made with this revival, so there’s lots to discuss. But first, if you’ll permit me, a quick Fable history lesson… </p><h3 data-cy="title3">How We Got Here</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Right out of the gate in the early 2000’s, Fable was always fantastic, even if its early days on the original Xbox got a little extra scrutiny because its director at the time, legendary strategy game developer Peter Molyneux, made crazy promises about players planting acorns that would grow into full-sized trees over the course of the campaign. But while that lofty systemic boast never came to be, the game that Lionhead delivered was nevertheless a rich, textured, uniquely British fairy tale that players could meaningfully affect change in, whether their good deeds manifested a literal halo over their heads, their sheer evil caused actual horns to sprout from their skull, or they got married to a townsperson and lived a whole other life outside of the bigger-picture quest within the world of Albion.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fable Screenshots - Xbox Developer Direct 2026</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Lionhead arguably perfected the formula in the Xbox 360 sequel, adding a dog who’d be by your side throughout the story, and Fable 3 tweaked it further still while making the questionable-in-hindsight decision to move the timeline forward by 500 years, thereby changing the entire look and feel of Albion. And then Microsoft <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-xbox-lionhead-studios-mistake"><u>royally screwed the franchise up</u></a> by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/12/e3-2014-fable-legends-forgets-what-made-fable-great"><u>trying to turn it into a 4v1 multiplayer game</u></a> that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/29/end-of-an-era-fable-developer-lionhead-closes-today"><u>cost the studio its entire existence</u></a> (that’s a story for another day), and since then the franchise has been dormant for over a decade.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enter Playground, who produced smash hit after smash hit in Microsoft’s Forza Horizon driving series. Fulton told me that Playground was looking to expand and build a second team after Forza Horizon 3, "I don't remember who said the word Fable first, but as soon as I heard it, I was like, ‘That has to be it. That fits so perfectly.’ It's a series that we adored here and still do.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"And the conversation went from there and it went pretty fast. I think everybody felt... certainly I know the folks we spoke to on the Xbox side felt really strongly that if a studio were to start working on Fable to pick that up, it had to be a British studio. And the fact that we had this great working relationship, the fact that we were making this game [Forza Horizon] that was increasingly important and successful, and had this ambition to scale and to grow, it went pretty fast after that."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">A Bit of the Old, a Bit of the New</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio’s adoration for the series shines through in the gameplay it’s shown so far. There are Hobbes and Balverines to slay, swords to wield, and spells to cast, sure. And the humor and British charm look to be there – look no further than a chicken spell wearing off, reverting the target back to their original form but still flapping their arms and clucking. Or the chicken armor. You even start the game as a child.</p><p>Where Playground is winning serious points with Fable fans like me so far is in its commitment to the game within the game: the town-management aspects.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">But where Playground is winning serious points with Fable fans like me so far is in its commitment to the game within the game: the town-management aspects baked into Fable’s urban areas. You’ll be able to buy property – literally all of it, if you can come up with enough gold, apparently – and become a beloved landlord or a loathed slumlord. Not to mention a kind boss or a horrible boss, should you purchase any businesses. You can also date and marry all of them, have kids with them, and should it come to it, get divorced. There are also jobs to partake in, like blacksmithing.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Where the new Fable breaks from the old one is in the morality. No longer will it be so black or white, Fulton told me. You won’t manifest that halo or sprout those horns. Instead, individual people in each city or town will form their own opinion of you based on how you treat them, meaning you could be a “rich twat” (in Fable’s own words) in one town while getting hailed as a saint in another one. Better still, one of my least favorite aspects of modern role-playing games, procedurally generated content and all of the generic, time-filling tedium it brings with it, is nowhere to be found in Fable. Instead, Fulton told me that every NPC is a unique, handmade, and fully voiced character. That is so refreshing these days that it gets me extra excited to talk to as many of them as I possibly can once I get a build of Fable in my hands.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Clever Fairy Tale Misdirection</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">That goal to make each hero’s story unique extends to the larger world of Albion too. Remember the 2023 teaser trailer that introduced us to Dave, a giant? It turns out that the whole setup for the new Fable isn’t a Jack and the Beanstalk story. Instead, Dave is an “egotistical gardener in a rural village” who finds a magic growth formula. You’ll then have to decide how to deal with him: will you spare him – hopefully this means find a way to return him to normal size and befriend him – or slay him, which will see his giga-corpse splayed over a hill just outside of town for the rest of your campaign, negatively impacting surrounding home prices in the process?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And so if Dave’s foray into gigantism is merely a quest, perhaps that means this Fable isn’t as much of a departure from the originals, lore-wise, as that video had led me to believe. In fact, I point-blank asked Fulton whether or not this is a true reboot or if this Fable is in some way connected to Lionhead’s originals, and he had quite a telling answer for a supposed non-answer. He told me, “I'm going to avoid that question, Ryan. And I'll tell you why. We touch very lightly on story in the Dev Direct piece, but honestly, what we really wanted to do is come out and speak to the detail in the game and answer all those questions that people inevitably have about the game we haven't answered before. We're going to talk more about story later in the year, so I'm not going to say yes or no to that particular question just yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What I would say is with this being a reboot, it felt really imperative for us to clear the space, to tell a story that we want to tell within Albion, which is why this isn't a sequel, for example. This isn't necessarily connected to the original timeline or events or characters, but we do share lore and some of that originating lore of the Fable universe is really important to our story.” Make of that what you will… </p><h3 data-cy="title3">My Big Concern</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">So Fable seems to have the look, the humor, the moral choices, the quintessentially British charm. Playground, to put it simply, seems to understand the assignment here. And the studio, as I mentioned earlier, absolutely gets the benefit of the doubt from me on account of its impeccable track record since its inception. What, then, am I worried about? There is one thing, and it’s a key part of Fable: combat.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To be clear, I’m not in any way judging Fable’s combat based on what we’ve seen so far. How could I? I haven’t played it for myself yet! However, for as talented as Playground is, it’s never made a game with combat before. It’s not that all of the delightful town-management and NPC relationship stuff suddenly means nothing if the combat doesn’t deliver, but Fable will have a big problem if battling Balverines isn’t a blast.</p><p>I'm disappointed by the fact that horses seem to be your only four-legged companions.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, and I suppose I’ll be honest and share one actual disappointment with what I’ve seen of Fable so far: the fact that horses seem to be your only four-legged companions. After the big reveal was decidedly dog-free, I asked Fulton about the decision to ditch the dog, and he admitted, "There are some folks on the team that were relishing me getting this question because I cut it a while back. You know what? For development reasons, right? I don't need to go into any more detail than that, except to say there are a substantial number of people on the team who have yet to forgive me for that decision." Now, I know full well that game development is extremely difficult and that Fulton probably has a very defensible reason for not moving forward with Fable 2’s signature feature – it stung a little extra when he told me that Fable 2 was his favorite of Lionhead’s original trilogy – but as a player I’m still allowed to be bummed out by it. Here’s hoping it’s first on the new features list for the sequel, should we get that far.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Things Are Looking Up</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">On the whole, though, I am truly, genuinely excited and optimistic about the new Fable. I’ve long felt that – particularly in Playground’s hands – Fable has the highest ceiling (in terms of game quality and finally delivering Xbox – and PlayStation, as it turns out – a PlayStation Studios-like Game of the Year award-contending single-player game) of anything currently in Microsoft’s massive first-party games portfolio.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">And though we don’t yet have a specific release date to count down to, Playground is promising that we’ll be playing it this Fall – which basically means “before November” since it’d be patently stupid to try and relaunch this franchise after the better part of a decade in development right up against the incoming game industry meteor known as Grand Theft Auto 6. Here’s hoping that the new Fable lives up to its sky-high potential.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our semi-retired interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

            <title><![CDATA[Attitude Era Edition of WWE 2K26 Revealed, Pre-Orders on January 30]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/attitude-era-edition-of-wwe-2k26-revealed-pre-orders-soon/</link>
            <guid>1414918</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>WWE announced on the January 23 episode of WWE Friday Night SmackDown that there would be a special Attitude Era edition of WWE 2K26. The game’s cover features a multitude of superstars from the era that defined the late 90s and early 2000s in the promotion. Stars on the cover include Steve Austin, The Rock, DX, Undertaker, and more.</p>



<p>As this is a special edition release for the game, they have not announced who will be on the standard cover. Pre-orders are set to go live in one week on January 30.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-more-details-on-what-s-new-in-wwe-2k26">More Details on What’s New in WWE 2K26</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-mode/">Insider Gaming exclusively reported</a> that CM Punk will serve as the centerpiece of this year’s 2K Showcase. Players can relive CM Punk’s iconic career moments and play through dream matches that might have occurred if he hadn’t departed WWE in 2014.</p>



<p>Additionally, Insider Gaming reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new match types are coming to WWE 2K26</a>. Of the four game modes, only one is debuting, while three others return. All of them are gimmick matches that are emblematic of the WWE Attitude Era.</p>



<p>The Inferno Match, where the objective is for one opponent to throw the other into flames surrounding the wrestling ring. Originally introduced in 2008’s WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009, the mode disappeared after its inclusion in WWE 2K14 over a decade ago. </p>



<p>I Quit Matches are also slated to return to WWE Games, last seen in the aforementioned 2K14. That match type is an anything goes contest, where one opponent must make the other say the words “I Quit” into a microphone. That match type first appeared in WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role in 2000. It has been removed several times over the years.</p>



<p>3 Stages of Hell is another returning match type. First appearing in 2001’s WWF SmackDown!: Just Bring It, the unique take on a best two out of three contest, where each fall has a different stipulation, has not been a selectable match type since WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2006 in 2005.</p>



<p>The only new match type rumored to be coming to the game is the Dumpster Match. In that match type, one competitor must put their opponent inside a dumpster and slam the lid.</p>







<p>There’s currently no release date set for the game. It is expected to be playable on all current-gen consoles and PC via Steam. Insider Gaming will keep you up-to-date with the latest WWE 2K26 news.</p>

It’s not just Apple MacBooks and MediaTek-based Chromebooks using Arm chips anymore. There are finally <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/862985/asus-zenbook-a16-snapdragon-x2-ces-early-testing-hands-on">competent Qualcomm Snapdragon laptops</a> running Windows, and — as soon as this spring — Nvidia will finally power Windows consumer laptops with Arm chips all by itself.</p><p>They won’t have an Nvidia graphics chip next to an Intel CPU, but rather an Nvidia N1 system-on-chip at the helm — and overnight, a Lenovo leak revealed that the company has built six laptops on the upcoming N1 and N1X processors, including a 15-inch gaming machine.</p><p>Dataminer Huang514613 posted the product names to X, which also include 14 and 16-inch models of the Ideapad Slim 5, two variants of the 15-inch Yoga Pro 7, and a Yoga 9 transforming 2-in-1.</p><p>You don’t need to take Huang’s word for it alone: <a href="https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht517560-legion-space">this update page</a> for the company’s Legion Space control software still shows the existence of a “Legion 7 15N1X11” gaming laptop, where the “N1X” refers to Nvidia’s gaming SoC.</p><p>And just by using Google, I found a publicly indexed web portal where Lenovo has listings for password-protected “Nvidia N1x Portal Prod” and Nvidia N1x Portal Test” websites, too:</p><div><p>Lenovo may be the world’s biggest laptop maker, but it isn’t the only one prepping such laptops. Dell was tipped to launch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678000/nvidia-arm-gaming-laptop-mediatek-alienware">an Alienware gaming laptop by early 2026</a> as well, and it <a href="https://x.com/Olrak29_/status/2010609089563467907/photo/1">may have been prepping a Dell Premium</a> laptop (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/851047/dell-xps-14-16-13-laptops-brand-return-ces-2026">now XPS</a>) with Nvidia N1X as well. That’s already eight different Nvidia laptops that might be coming.</p></div><p>Three days ago, <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20260120PD216/nvidia-notebooks-launch-arm-windows-2026.html"><em>Digitimes</em> reported</a> that we should expect Nvidia to launch its N1 and N1X laptop platform this spring, with more devices available this summer, after <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20250721PD208/mediatek-nvidia-ai-pc-launch-2026.html">a previous delay</a> — and that the company already has N2 and N2X chips on the roadmap for late 2027.</p><p>While we don’t truly know how much power the N1 and N1X have, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-n1x-soc-leaks-with-the-same-number-of-cuda-cores-as-an-rtx-5070-n1x-specs-align-with-the-gb10-superchip">a Geekbench leak</a> (which has to be taken with a grain of salt; fake specs have been planted there before) suggested the N1X variant may have as many CUDA cores as a desktop RTX 5070 graphics card and 20 CPU cores, like Nvidia’s GB10 “Superchip” in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/798775/nvidia-spark-personal-ai-supercomputer">DGX Spark</a> mini-PC. I’m comfortable sharing that because Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-ceo-confirms-n1-chip-is-actually-gb10-superchip-used-in-dgx-spark">all but confirmed the N1 and GB10</a> are two halves of the same coin.</p><div><p>Nvidia’s Arm PC chips have been a <em>long</em> time coming, but the company has powered consumer devices with Arm before.

            <title><![CDATA[The Most Hilarious Medieval Combat Sim is Finally Entering Early Access Next Week]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hilarious-medieval-combat-early-access-half-sword/</link>
            <guid>1414873</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Half Sword Games has finally unveiled an early access release date for its medieval combat simulator, Half Sword. The physics-based title emerged in October 2023 as a demo that turned (and impaled) heads <strong>very fast</strong>, almost entirely due to it being absolutely hilarious, in the worst way possible.</p>



<p>In Half Sword, you enter the arena against a range of opponents and use tricky, hard-to-master combat mechanics to slice, dice, crush, slash, slam, and impale your foes. It’s brutal, but the physics elements just make it an utter hoot to behold, and it’s finally entering early access on January 30.</p>







<h2 id="h-half-sword-hits-early-access-on-january-30">Half Sword Hits Early Access on January 30</h2>



<p>Half Sword’s demo was a roaring success, finding a social media and content niche that saw hilarious clips surface aplenty. The unique combat simulator focuses on being as realistic as possible while also being downright satirical. In one fight, you could be almost naked, windmilling your balled fists at enemies, and in another, you can be a knight in gleaming armor, decimating a group of peasants.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, more than 6,000 people were enjoying the Half Sword demo on Steam, and that’s with the test product representing a minuscule portion of the full potential of Half Sword Games’ first title.</p>



<p>To announce the impending early access launch, the team published a fantastic new trailer:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Half Sword - Early Access trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-A7eNUfqePg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>They followed this up with a disclaimer of sorts:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Bugs, performance, occasional crashes and other things are being actively ironed out as well as fast as our tiny team can handle.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There’s so much to love about Half Sword, but fair warning – the fiddly mechanics are not easy to master <strong>at all</strong>. It’s the kind of game where a single misstep can result in a total wipeout and the loss of progress, such is the game’s progression system, so you’d best be ready to potentially rage.</p>







<p>Are you looking forward to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2397300/Half_Sword/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Half Sword’s early access launch</a>?

Thankfully, the luxurious hotel Stella Montis won’t have guests looking over their shoulders for loot goblins, and instead features spots for hiking, biking, skiing, and relaxation. It’s for these reasons – and maybe more likely just for the bit of it all – that Arc Raiders players are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qjg3ml/hotel_stella_montis_is_getting_flooded_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>slamming the forest getaway with dozens of five-star reviews</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Great place,” one seemingly earnest review starts. “But I do recommend travel solo for this hotel. Any group bigger than 2 has very high chance of meeting rats in the lobby. Hotel has a medical section which is a hot spot for dead bodies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Also while you are here please try to be friendly to other guests.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first connection to the real-life Stella Montis seems to have arrived shortly after Embark initially teased the new map in <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/everything-you-need-to-know" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an October 13 blog post</u></a>, two weeks before launch. In what was likely an attempt to try and connect the dots before an official reveal, one Reddit user was able to track down the hotel and post about it (above), assuming the new Arc Raiders map could be inspired by a real place.</p><p>Love this place, always leave with 3+ blueprints.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not clear if the sleek metal walls of the video game map are actually named after the Italian inn, but the coincidence was more than enough for fans to latch onto. A review left by a user with the name Bad Wolf seems to be the oldest mention of Arc Raiders, at least on Google, with almost every reply that followed focusing on blueprints, Bastions, “rats,” and Shredders.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I love this place, tons of drawers that gives me epic loot and even Venator blueprint if you have the correct hotel keycard,” another review says, “but be careful about the moving balls that burn you and the vase like robot thingy that would shred you to pieces. The only complain is the raiders with strange red outfit that screams ‘Goop’ crawling in the corner waiting for you to pass by, bring smoke, tagging, and trigger nades just in case.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite Stella Montis’ crushing difficulty and brutal Arcs, almost every Google review from an Arc Raiders player awards the hotel with 5/5 stars – though there are a few outliers. One user left a 3/5, warning of Shredders, while another from this week stuck with a 1/5, complaining of feeling “very sweaty after leaving.” Meanwhile, the company behind the hotel has yet to comment on its newfound connection to a popular video game or the fans who have suddenly become enamored by it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Free Loadout Stella Montis go crazy," one reviewer adds.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>An Ubisoft developer I chatted with back in 2022 was feeling pretty jealous. <em>Elden Ring</em> had just come out and was blowing people away. Despite FromSoftware’s reputation for challenging gameplay and esoteric design, the open-world RPG was <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-goty-2022-dlc-fromsoftware-dark-souls-1849925353">breaking out into the mainstream</a>. It was a hardcore game but it wasn’t only being enjoyed by hardcore gamers. Ubisoft had thousands of people working on open-world RPGs for years. Why couldn’t it make one that felt just as creatively bold, vibrant, and potent?</p> <p>A version of this question has been haunting the French publisher since <a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-recon-breakpoint-is-an-infuriating-mess-1838885246"><em>Ghost Recon Breakpoint</em></a> bombed back in 2019. It wasn’t a terrible game, just kind of a bland and boring one. It became the poster child for the bloated Ubisoft blockbuster that felt designed by committee for no one in particular. Co-founder and CEO Yves Guillemot <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-admits-ghost-recon-breakpoint-has-been-a-disast-1839329787">promised sweeping reforms</a> to get to the bottom of what was going wrong with the publisher’s production processes. Over five years and several organizational “resets” later, it’s not clear the company has gotten any closer to an answer.</p>

 <p>The untenable situation blew up again this week with Ubisoft announcing <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-black-flag-remake-delay-2000661866">major delays, cancelations, cost-cutting, and restructuring</a> that will result in some big short-term operating losses and more long-term uncertainty. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-share-price-crash-prince-of-persia-ai-2000662169">Ubisoft’s market cap</a> before <em>Breakpoint</em> was close to €10 billion. It’s since fallen by 95 percent <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3mczhjprjis24">to just €500 million</a>. The news was jarring, particularly to the more than 15,000 employees across the company’s global network of studios who found out the news alongside everyone else in an end-of-day message from the CEO.</p> <h2>“A boss run wild”</h2> <p>“The strategic and organizational changes we will make in the coming weeks and months will propel Ubisoft into its future. They will allow us to reconnect with our DNA – that of one of the largest and most storied video game companies in the world – and to regain our creative leadership as well as our competitiveness,” part of it read. It went on to explain a new, less bureaucratic structure for decision making and organizing franchises like <a href="https://kotaku.com/division-3-definitive-edition-remaster-destiny-2000658970"><em>The Division</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-remains-a-priority-for-us-ubisoft-says-2000662321"><em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em></a> while also noting that there would be more pain to come as management continues to “make difficult decisions, including stopping certain projects” and “potentially closing select studios.”</p>

 <p>Slipped in between the grand vision and subtle threats was the reversal of a popular hybrid work-from-home policy that would have a direct impact on everyone working at Ubisoft. Staff would be back in the office five days a week, but with the promise of a generous number of work from home days. “The intention is not to question individual performance, but to regenerate our collective performance, which is one of the key elements in creating the best games with the required speed,” Guillemot wrote.</p>

 <p>There was immediate confusion and frustration. One French union representing Paris Ubisoft developers called for a half-day strike. “It is out of the question to let a boss run wild and destroy our working conditions,” Solidaires Informatique <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:gwmurecu4lbyaqjzsyv2orat/post/3mcxfxwczwk2z?ref_src=embed&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.escapistmagazine.com%252Fnews-ubisoft-france-union-strike-solidaires%252F">wrote in a press release</a>. “Perhaps we need to remind him that it is his employees who make the games.” Even more colorful quotes were given to <a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/tech/gaming/il-est-en-train-de-tout-foutre-en-l-air-sur-fond-de-rumeurs-de-licenciements-d-appel-a-la-greve-et-de-fin-du-teletravail-chez-ubisoft-les-salaries-desabuses-s-enflamment-contre-un-patron-en-roue-libre_AN-202601220331.html">French news broadcaster BFM TV</a>. “[Guillemot] is senile like Donald Trump,” one anonymous employee told the network. “He is losing his mind, we need to get him out of the company management [board]. He is screwing up everything and f****** the company.”</p> <h2>Return to office talent drain</h2> <p>Employees have been venting directly on Ubisoft’s internal messaging board as well, based on screenshots shared with me. “A full return to the office will only cause a significant amount of essential talent to leave the company, and nothing is being done to prevent this,” wrote one developer. “Why is top management not taking responsibility or accountability for the many errors and mistakes in the past? Instead, only workers are suffering the consequences.” Another wrote, “Since I joined Ubisoft, I’ve seen more change in the RTO policy than the company’s improvement and success.” A third did not mince words. “This is probably the most embarrassed I have felt working somewhere,” they wrote.</p>

 <p>Particularly galling about the new return-to-office policy for some Paris staff was that they had only recently finished negotiating to ensure two days of work-from-home per week. “It’s only been six months since the situation was more or less ‘back to normal’ and now it’s shattered to the ground by Yves’ sole decision with zero justification, zero documents, zero internal studies proving RTO increases productivity or morale, nothing,” one developer told me.</p> <p>The specific details for the rollout of the return-to-office policy have yet to be communicated to everyone, could vary team by team, and might not go into effect for much of the year. One thing that is clear is that Ubisoft is beginning to consolidate its Paris operations under one roof: the Floresco headquarters that was completed back in 2021. “Over the coming years, Ubisoft is planning to progressively bring together our Paris-area-based teams&nbsp;in the same building in Saint Mandé. This initiative is designed to optimize our workspace, foster greater collaboration between teams, and make better use of existing facilities, while being implemented gradually and in close dialogue with our employees,” a spokesperson for Ubisoft confirmed in an email.</p> <h2>Definition of insanity</h2> <p>There’s concern that these shifts could make it harder for Ubisoft to recruit the talent it needs to improve, or even worse, actively drive away more of the company’s existing veterans. But some employees have also shared broader disappointment with Ubisoft’s recent creative drift. “We need to stop with the trend-chasing, the trying to muscle our way into saturated markets, the sanitizing the edge off of our projects, and most of all the deciding which games get made behind closed doors,” one employee wrote this week on the company’s internal message board. They pointed to the launch of money pits like <em>Skull &amp; Bones</em> and Ubisoft’s many failed attempts at live-service battle royales and extraction shooters.</p>

 <p>In many ways, this week felt like a repeat of two years ago. The company <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-skull-bones-delay-assassins-creed-far-cry-cuts-1849975925">had just canceled several games and delayed a bunch of others</a>. It promised organizational shifts and a doubling-down on the company’s biggest franchises. The stakes were similarly high and the solutions far from clear. “The ball is in your court,” Guillemot <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-assassin-s-creed-mirage-far-cry-delay-canceled-1850001343">wrote to employees at the time</a>. Developers were furious then, too. The CEO later apologized for how the remark was phrased, but two years later some people at Ubisoft feel like nothing’s changed.</p> <p>One current employee posted the following comment internally this week. “To quote one of the greatest villains in a video game: ‘Did I ever tell you what the definition of insanity is? Insanity is doing the exact same f****** thing over and over again, expecting shit to change. That is crazy.’ – Vaas Montenegro.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sims-4-sex-mod-wickedwhims-ea-maxis-2000662724</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://wickedwhimsmod.com/"><span>WickedWhims</span></a><span> is one of the most popular mods for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/the-sims-4"><i><span>The Sims 4</span></i></a><span>. Led by modder Turbodriver, the fan creation, which adds fully animated and interactive sex, expanded relationships, and even a menstrual cycle and birth control for your Sims, has over 16,000 paid supporters on </span><a href="https://www.patreon.com/wickedwoohoo"><span>Patreon</span></a><span>. According to a recent interview, the actual number of people using the mod is far higher than that.</span></p> <p><span>As noted by </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4s-most-notorious-sex-mod-gets-launched-400-000-times-a-day-which-is-more-people-than-i-realized-were-even-playing-the-sims-every-day/"><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i></a><span>, German news site </span><i><span>Taz</span></i><span> published an interview with Turbodriver (who uses his pen name for anonymity) this week. Via Google Translate, when asked how many people use WickedWhims, the modder said that his server is pinged an average of 400,000 times per day. For context, the pings occur whenever someone starts the game with the mod installed.</span></p> <p><span>It’s important to note that, according to publisher EA, </span><i><span>The Sims 4</span></i><span> has accrued more than 80 million players worldwide, a statistic it </span><a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/the-sims-5-update-multiplayer-creator-content-ea-interview-1236142010/"><span>shared with </span><i><span>Variety</span></i></a><span> during an interview in September 2024. Of course, not all 80 million boot up the game every day, and the average 400,000 pings can include repeated sessions by the same person. Still, the mod’s widespread usage provides a valuable and curious insight into how many people are interested in amplifying the sexual content available in the game.</span></p> <p><span>As it stands, the (figuratively and metaphorically) vanilla version of </span><i><span>The Sims 4</span></i> <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/articles/the-sims/the-sims-4/gender-romance-attraction-guide/"><span>includes options</span></a><span> to customize sexual orientation around “men” or “women,” romance dynamics and boundaries, and attraction turn-ons and turn-offs. When it comes to intimacy, however, the act of sex itself isn’t shown, often obscured by shower steam or bed blankets.</span></p> <p><span>Mods like WickedWhims break that barrier with painstaking clarity, while amplifying both visual and simulation options. Sims can be fully controlled during sex—including over 10,000 animations from various creators, </span><a href="https://wickedwhimsmod.com/features"><span>according to the site</span></a><span>—naked bodies can show pubic hair and sweat, and fantasies such as voyeurism are added into the mix.</span></p> <p><span>But as Turbodriver told </span><i><span>Taz</span></i><span>, anyone playing a life simulation wants it to be “as realistic as possible.” That’s why WickedWhims also includes mechanics around a sexually transmitted disease, menstruation cycles, and birth control, among other things. The modder doesn’t intend for WickedWhims to be educational, and considers it a side effect.</span></p> <p><span>“The most confusing thing is that Sims have different fertility levels depending on when they’re in their cycle,” he said, via Google Translate. “Of course, as a man, I had to do some research when I programmed that part of the mod.”</span></p> <p><span>While Turbodriver doesn’t consider himself a feminist activist, he remarked that the mod is a product of his “political convictions,” and that feminist views also influence his work, albeit not exclusively. Moreover, the modder argued that game developers are becoming more open to explicit content, citing </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span> as a title that features nudity, but that there’s still a double standard in the industry when it comes to sexual content.</span></p> <p><span>“Large game developers can include sex scenes in their games without any repercussions,” Turbodriver said. “Indie games, on the other hand, are penalized much more quickly by the platforms, which label them as adult games and show them to fewer people.”</span></p> <p><span>While the number of WickedWhims sessions is definitely noteworthy, it’s important to remember the context in which this activity is taking place. For one, as Turbodriver pointed out, the internet is becoming increasingly centralized on fewer platforms that restrict sexual content of any kind.</span></p> <p><span>The context surrounding </span><i><span>The Sims 4</span></i><span>, too, is important to consider. Developer Maxis recently </span><a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/the-values-that-shape-the-sims"><span>shared a blog post</span></a><span> saying that it remains committed to its values, one of which is inclusivity, and that “The Sims team’s creative control has not changed.” This comes in response to concerns from the community around the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund’s intentions to become the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-shareholders-approve-55bn-sale-saudi-arabia-trump-2000655342"><span>major owner of EA</span></a><span>, as it marches to secure a deal to buy 93.4 percent of shares in a $55 billion deal.</span></p> <p><span>While the deal is pending government approval, the Public Investment Fund is almost entirely owned by a state known for </span><a href="https://www.humandignitytrust.org/country-profile/saudi-arabia/"><span>persecuting and killing queer people</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://theweek.com/60339/things-women-cant-do-in-saudi-arabia"><span>denying women many basic rights</span></a><span>, among other causes for concern. It’s unclear if Maxis will be able to maintain its values if the deal comes into fruition in the future, but it’s clear that players have an interest in mods like WickedWhims which provide forms of expression and experience that go beyond the boundaries of what’s offered in the vanilla game.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A release window has been set for the next game in the Control franchise.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/control-resonant-confirmed-the-game-awards-remedy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">At the 2025 Game Awards,</a> Remedy Entertainment announced the sequel to CONTROL would be released in 2026. CONTROL Resonant is the follow-up game to the popular 2019 action-adventure game. Now, a clear release window for the next game has been confirmed: Remedy announced to investors <a href="https://www.inderes.dk/en/research/remedy-release-of-control-resonant-marks-turning-point-in-investment-story" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in filings at the end of 2025</a> that Resonant would be released in the second quarter of 2026.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are now waiting for the release of Control Resonant at the end of Q2’26 (was H1’27), which has significantly altered our revenue estimates for the coming years. Additionally, we had previously assumed that Annapurna’s share of the game’s sales would be outside of Remedy’s income statement, but it appears that this share will also flow through Remedy. Thus, our revenue estimates have increased accordingly, but Annapurna’s share is reflected as an expense in the income statement as well. Our net assumption regarding Control Resonant’s returns for Remedy over the first three years remains essentially unchanged. We now assume that Remedy will receive royalties from the Max Payne project only in 2027 (was Q4’26), even though the game may still be released in 2026. We estimate that Control Resonant will sell approximately 1.8 million copies in 2026 and approximately 2.2 million copies in 2027. Consequently, Remedy’s revenue is projected to surpass 120 MEUR in 2026–2027, with EBITDA reaching slightly over 20 MEUR. Conditions for strong game sales are favorable, as the original Control has sold over 5 million copies and has additionally been played by over 20 million players across various platforms.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>A fictionalized Manhattan will be the setting for the open-world game. Fans will play as Dylan Faden and learn to control supernatural abilities with the promise that things will only get weirder as more information about the game is released.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Manhattan is at the peak of a paranatural crisis, the likes of which it has never seen, and the Federal Bureau of Control is running out of options. The FBC deploys Dylan Faden, their former captive, to take on a mysterious cosmic entity that is altering the fundamental aspects of our reality. As Dylan, you must harness your newfound supernatural abilities and take on a myriad of mind-bending threats.</p>



<p>Your fight will take you through multiple warped areas of Manhattan, allowing you to explore an unfamiliar world reshaped by a cosmic force that is defiling natural law, distorting gravity, and reordering Manhattan into a geophysical nightmare.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The CONTROL games also share the same universe as Alan Wake. The second game in the Alan Wake series has sold well over 2 million copies. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alan-wake-2-has-sold-over-2-million-copies-and-is-finally-profitable/">here</a>.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will provide updates on the next CONTROL game as more information becomes available.</p>

              <p>Later this year, assuming it doesn’t get delayed again, <em>Fable</em> will take us back to the whimsical fantasy world of Albion for a new adventure developed by Playground Games, the team behind the <em>Forza Horizon</em> franchise. It’s been a long time coming for this one. <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-is-bringing-back-fable-1844482199">It was first announced in 2020</a>! But after that long wait, it is set to return later this year and not just on Xbox. Here’s everything you might want to know about <em>Fable</em>. The new one, I mean. Not the old one, which is also simply called <em>Fable</em>.</p> <h2><strong>What is <em>Fable</em>?</strong></h2> <p><em>Fable</em> is an upcoming open-world third-person fantasy action RPG and the latest entry in Xbox’s <em>Fable</em> series. As in previous games in the series, players will start as a young child who loses their family and becomes a solo hero with their sights set on grand adventure. The franchise has always been known for its British humor and less-than-serious vibes, and the new game is no exception, with lots of silly jokes and people calling you a twat in a thick English accent.</p>

 <h2><strong>Does this new <em>Fable</em> have connections to the old games?</strong></h2> <p>Maybe? For the most part, Playground Games has called <em>Fable</em> a reboot of the franchise and not a direct sequel or prequel to any of the past games. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/weve-been-working-on-this-game-for-a-really-really-long-time-the-big-fable-interview-with-microsoft-developer-playground">But, in an interview with <em>IGN</em></a>, Playground founder and general manager Ralph Fulton alluded to the idea that while there are no returning characters, there is <em>some</em> connection to the past games, telling the outlet: “We do share lore and some of that originating lore of the <em>Fable</em> universe is really important to our story.”</p> <h2><strong>How big is the map in <em>Fable</em>?</strong></h2> <p>Playground Games is famous for its<em> Forza Horizon</em> series, which includes massive open-world maps. But according to Playground Games, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fable-reboot-features-open-world-release-date-fall-xbox-ps5-2000662295"><em>Fable’s </em>open-world&nbsp;map</a> isn’t nearly as big as a <em>Forza Horizon</em> world. That’s because the main character isn’t driving around at 250mph, and so you don’t need that much space. Instead of sheer scale, the studio is focused on detail and immersion. For example, every building in the game is apparently enterable and explorable.</p>

  <h2><strong>Is there a morality system? Will I grow horns if I’m really evil?</strong></h2> <p>Yes, and no. There is a morality system, and the world will react to you depending on what you do and what people think. <a href="https://kotaku.com/fable-reboot-appearance-morality-good-evil-horns-halo-2000662597">But your character’s appearance won’t change based on how evil or good they are</a>, as the morality system in the new game doesn’t treat your actions in such a binary way.&nbsp; An action of yours might make some people see you as evil, while others find that same action noble and admirable. So no more horns.</p>

 <h2><strong>Does <em>Fable</em> have co-op multiplayer?</strong></h2> <p>Nope! This has been confirmed via the official <em>Fable</em> Discord’s FAQ section, which simply states: “<em>Fable</em> is a single-player open-world action-RPG.”</p> <h2>Can I choose my gender in <em>Fable</em>?</h2> <p>Yes. While most of the marketing for the upcoming RPG has featured a woman protagonist, upsetting some angry online chuds, you will be able to choose your gender in the full game.</p> <h2>Are marriages and home ownership in the new <em>Fable</em>?</h2> <p>Yup and yup. Also back are jobs and divorces. You’ll be able to live a horrible life as a repeatedly divorced “hero” who owns many homes and kicks people out for being late on their rent. Just keep in mind that the devs claim that these people might cause you problems in the future if you run into them again.</p>

Instead, <em>Fable</em> is currently slated to launch sometime in Fall 2026.</p> <h2>Will Fable be on PlayStation 5?</h2> <p>Yes. <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-forza-horizon-6-ps5-delay-launch-fable-reboot-2000662665"><em>Fable</em> is launching on PS5</a> alongside Xbox Series X/S, Game Pass, and PC sometime later this year.</p> <h2>Wait, where’s the dog?</h2> <p>Uh… bad news. There is no dog in the new <em>Fable</em>. Sorry.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever fallen down <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wikipedia/comments/fokmsp/stuck_in_quarantine_heres_a_list_of_wikipedia/">a Wikipedia rabbit hole</a> or spent a pleasant evening digging through college library stacks, you know the joy of a good research puzzle. Every new source and cross-reference you find unlocks an incremental understanding of a previously unknown world, forming a piecemeal tapestry of knowledge that you can eventually look back at as a cohesive and well-known whole.</p>
<p><em>TR-49</em> takes this research process and operationalizes it into an engrossing and novel piece of heavily non-linear interactive fiction. Researching the myriad sources contained in the game’s mysterious computer slowly reveals a tale that’s part mystery, part sci-fi allegory, part family drama, and all-compelling alternate academic history.</p>
<h2>Steampunk Wikipedia</h2>
<p>The entirety of <em>TR-49</em> takes place from a first-person perspective as you sit in front of a kind of Steampunk-infused computer terminal. An unseen narrator asks you to operate the machine but is initially cagey about how or why or what you’re even looking for. There’s a creepy vibe to the under-explained circumstances that brought you to this situation, but the game never descends into the jump scares or horror tropes of so many other modern titles.</p>
<p>Your only real form of interaction with the world of <em>TR-49</em> is through a sepia-toned tube display on the left and a four-character <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-flap_display">split-flap</a> on the right that serves as the computer’s only input. You quickly discover that entering specific sequences—each with two letters followed by two numbers, as suggested by the game’s name—brings up library catalog-style entries referring to a vast web of literary works that form the core of the game’s wider fiction.</p>

<p>While the catalog contains short excerpts from each of these discovered works, it’s the additional notes added to each entry by subsequent researchers that place each title in its full context. You’ll end up poring through these research notes for clues about the existence and chronology of other authors and works. Picking out specific names and years points to the codes and titles needed to unlock even more reference pages in the computer, pushing you further down the rabbit hole. Picture something like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/06/her-story-is-a-compelling-new-type-of-interactive-storytelling/"><em>Her Story</em></a>, but replace the cinéma vérité surveillance video clips with a library card catalog.</p>
<p>You’ll slowly start to unravel and understand how the game world’s myriad authors are influencing each other with their cross-pollinating writings. The treatises, novels, pamphlets, and journals discussed in this database are full of academic sniping, intellectual intrigue, and interpersonal co-mingling across multiple generations of work. It all ends up circling a long-running search for a metaphysical key to life itself, which most of the authors manage to approach but never quite reach a full understanding.</p>

<p>As you explore, you also start to learn more about the personal affairs of the researchers who collected and cataloged all this reference material and the vaguely defined temporal capabilities of the information-synthesis engine in the computer you’ve all worked on. Eventually, you’ll stumble on the existence of core commands that can unlock hidden parts of the computer or alter the massive research database itself, which becomes key to your eventual final goal.</p>
<p>Through it all, there’s a slowly unfolding parallel narrative involving Liam, the unseen voice guiding you through the research process itself. Through occasional voice clips, Liam eventually hints at the existence of a powerful and quickly encroaching threat that wants to stop your progress by any means necessary, adding a bit of dramatic tension to your academic pursuits.</p>

<p>I’m being intentionally vague about the specifics here because I think <em>TR-49</em>‘s subtle and well-crafted sci-fi world-building is best experienced by exploring the game for yourself. There’s a real satisfaction in staring at a once impenetrably obtuse research note, recalling a bit of information from a recent cross-reference, and feeling your understanding suddenly click into place. And while the vocal performances can verge on cheesy, the writing captures the monomaniacal intensity of truly obsessive academics to a tee.</p>
<p>One of the game’s best features is a “Notes” sub-menu, which automatically outlines relevant facts (and potential facts) about various authors, groups, and publications as you discover them. This means you don’t have to take page after page of hand-written notes to keep track of the game’s complex connections (and potential connections), as you do in games like <em>Blue Prince</em> or <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>. It makes for a much smoother puzzle-solving experience, even if the automatic notes sometimes pick up on things you may have missed while skimming.</p>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NEIyvjVQCAE?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p><em>TR-49</em> also benefits from being relatively compact compared to some other narrative deduction games. A diligent investigator can reach a conclusion in four or five hours, depending on how thorough they want to be. That makes it relatively easy to keep the broad outlines of the game’s dense but parsable world in your head over a couple of evening play sessions.</p>
<p>There are bound to be some people who see <em>TR-49</em> as akin to a homework simulator, with painful flashbacks to all-nighters spent desperately researching a last-minute college term paper. For anyone who knows the inherent appeal of diving deep into a previously unknown world, though, <em>TR-49</em> is an engrossing work of world-building fiction presented in a truly memorable way.</p>

In the video, a very distinctively Animal Crossing leaf floats down from the ceiling of an empty room, before a hand cursor clicks on it and turns it into furniture, cycling through four different types of IKEA furniture (two bookcases in different styles, a dresser, and a couch). The video description, via TikTok's translation from French, reads, "We still don't accept cash bells. #ikea #animalcrossing"</p><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@ikeafrance/video/7597860813692472608" data-video-id="7597860813692472608"> <section> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ikeafrance?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" title="@ikeafrance" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ikeafrance</a> On n'accepte toujours pas les clochettes en caisse. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/ikea?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="ikea" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ikea</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/animalcrossing?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="animalcrossing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#animalcrossing</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/son-original-IKEA-France-7597860865366412064?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" title="♬ son original  - IKEA France" rel="noopener noreferrer">♬ son original  - IKEA France</a> </section> </blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The background music, while not identifiable immediately as any specific Animal Crossing theme, certainly has the correct xylophone and according sounds going. And the sound effects of clicking and cycling between furniture are 100% straight from Animal Crossing.

    <article>
      <p>I first played mech-based tactics game <em>Phantom Brigade</em> back in 2019 when it was in Early Access on the Epic Games Store, then<a href="https://kotaku.com/phantom-brigade-a-new-turn-based-tactics-game-rules-1845710612?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>I reviewed it</u></a> when it hit 1.0 in 2023. Now here I am, in January 2026, somehow writing about the game <em>again</em>, because it's managed the rare feat of getting a <em>2.0</em> release.</p><p>I thought the 1.0 game was really good! It was a <em>bit </em>thin in parts, but only in the way we've come to expect smaller games from smaller teams to be, so I never saw that as a problem. It was a great game, I had a great time with it, then I got on with my life. I never once thought "man, <em>Phantom Brigade</em> was good in parts, but it really needed some more work".</p><p>So it's been a pleasure reacquainting myself with the game over the last few weeks, as its surprising 2.0 release–<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553540/view/634572213702362190?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>which came out in November 2025</u></a>--has banished any notion that this was in any way thin. The team at Brace Yourself Games have spent the last two years fleshing out every corner of this game, so while the time-based tactics stuff is still there and excellent, a lot of the campaign content, from pilots (who now have classes and traits) to improved menus to a much weightier overworld and mission roster, is now vastly improved.</p><p>Some of these tweaks and additions have come from the team, but others have come from implementing player feedback, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/553540/discussions/0/684112192552884369/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>like</u></a>:</p><blockquote>&nbsp;New salvage and debriefing menus, new mission previews and reward generation, reworked workshop and crafting, improved damage logic and prediction, new options and difficulty settings, comprehensive weapon balancing, subsystem reworks and much more!</blockquote><p>If you never heeded anyone's advice to try this game out, and you are in any way into mechs, tactics games and/or the passage of time, you may as well now that it's even better. But even if, like me, you <em>had </em>played the game and liked it, it's a rare pleasure to get to experience a proper 2.0, <em>No Man's Sky</em>-like release like this, so <em>Phantom Brigade's</em> second time around (which is a free update for existing owners) is absolutely worth revisiting.</p><p>(I don't wanna get Steam salesman-y here, but it's also available as part of a bundle with <em>Invisible Inc</em>,<a href="https://kotaku.com/invisible-inc-the-kotaku-review-1703519658?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>one of the greatest video games of all time</u></a>.)</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qd-0TuUuFaY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Phantom Brigade 2.0 Free Major Update Trailer"></iframe></figure>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/whiskerwood-city-builder-mice-cats-timberton-factorio-indie-steam-early-access-2000662691</link>
            <guid>1414795</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It was around 1:45 in the morning, as I was laying down wooden walkways to help little rodents get to work faster, that I realized I was fully hooked by <em>Whiskerwood</em>, a newly released city-builder and resource manager that blends together <em>Timberborn</em>, <em>Factorio</em>, and <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/sid-meiers-colonization-is-the-best-4th-of-july-video-g-1600113277">Sid Meier’s Colonization</a>.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>Out now on Steam via early access, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2489330/Whiskerwood/"><em>Whiskerwood</em> is a top-down real-time city builder</a> that has you leading Whiskers, lowly mouse peasants and workers, as they travel to new lands in the 1700s by order of the rich, powerful Claws, a group of royal cats. After picking a spot to build a dock for incoming ships and a warehouse to store goods, you start harvesting supplies to begin building up a tiny mouse settlement. Your goal isn’t simply to survive, but also to harvest enough resources, including fish, berries, logs, and rock, to pay off your taxes, which are claimed every so often in-game by a royal fleet. As you do, the amount of taxes you have to pay goes up, and wait a minute…I don’t think these Claws are good people!</p>

  <p>Early on, one of your mice rightfully points out that, hey, the Claws provided the mice supplies to build structures that would enrich the cats, but failed to provide much more than that, leaving the Whiskers basically on their own to figure out how to build a town and not all perish in a few days. Once again, not sure these cats can be trusted.</p> <p>This part of <em>Whiskerwood</em> is currently the least developed, with what sounds like plans to allow a self-sufficient colony to cut itself off from the Claws and even revolt. For now, that stuff mostly sits in the background and provides a good reason to harvest more and more supplies.</p>

 <p>While the game’s recreation of 1700s colonization hooked me at first, what kept me around until way too late the first night I played was the easy-to-understand city-building mechanics and smartly designed UI. Doing anything in <em>Whiskerwood</em> rarely takes more than two clicks. Each menu is easy to read, navigate, and close, which isn’t always the case in games like this. <em>Whiskerwood</em> also does a fantastic job, even in early access, of providing players with all the information they need to know about where mice are going, what they need, what’s missing, which resources are low, and so forth.</p>

 <figure><figcaption>©Minakata Dynamics</figcaption></figure> <p>I especially love the alert banners that appear for important problems, like an injured mouse. Or to let you know that a mouse might have a long trek to the mines from his tiny hovel. You just click on it, and it zips you to the problem, and from there, you’re usually a click away from moving a mouse or tweaking some part of a building.</p> <p>Making that trip shorter or more efficient is a breeze with <em>Whiskerwood’s</em> snappy building and management menus, which feel like they were built by people who understand how vital this stuff is to making a city builder fun. But all of this smart design doesn’t come at the cost of simplification! This is still a complex game that will demand that you create more and more elaborate networks of buildings, conveyors, stairs, transportation, housing, and storage to be able to not only pay your taxes but also survive harsher seasons and weather.</p>

 <p>I’ve only put about five hours into <em>Whiskerwood</em> so far, but based on what I’ve played and the gushing I’ve seen <a href="https://aftermath.site/whiskerwood-review-impressions-pc-city-builder-hooded-horse/">from city builder experts like Luke Plunkett over at <em>Aftermath</em>,</a> I’m excited to keep playing. Hopefully one day my tiny mice will rise up, seize the means of production from the Claws, and gain independence. For now, they’ll need to keep breaking rocks and cutting down trees for those fat cats.</p>

<p>A new job listing shows that Electronic Arts is laying the foundation for the next game in the Mass Effect series.</p>



<p>It has been the better part of a decade since the last release in the Mass Effect series, 2017’s Mass Effect: Andromeda. Now, EA has made a public move to secure the franchise’s direction. A new <a href="https://jobs.ea.com/en_US/careers/JobDetail/Production-Director/212271" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">job listing</a> from EA notes that the company is seeking a production director to serve as a leader on the next title in the game series.</p>



<p>EA is hoping the new Mass Effect Production Director has 10+ years of experience on AAA titles, deep ARPG and RPG knowledge, and proven team-building.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are looking for a Production Director with a passion for the Mass Effect universe to serve as a high-impact leader on our next Mass Effect title. You will partner closely with creative leadership, studio teams, and internal and external partners to champion the game’s vision and ensure its execution at the highest quality bar.</p>
</blockquote>

<figure></figure>



<p>In November 2025, Mass Effect executive producer Mike Gamble proclaimed that EA and BioWare remain<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-confirms-next-mass-effect-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> committed exclusively to the series</a> and noted that there are more stories to tell in the universe. It has also been suggested that many believe the next title in the series will be a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-moves-some-employees-to-other-ea-projects-while-developing-mass-effect-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make-or-break moment for BioWare</a> after the turbulent development of Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>







<p>There’s also a TV series in the works at Amazon. However, it has been confirmed that the series will not adapt the original game trilogy and will be an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mass-effect-tv-series-amazon-trilogy-original-story/">original story set after the events of the third game.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the grim dark world of <em>Warhammer 40k</em> it appears that the masters at Games Workshop have sent out their legal arbiters again. This time the arbiters (or as others may call them, lawyers,) have fired off a <em>Void War </em>DMCA, taking down the video game from Steam.&nbsp;</p><p>Released last June, <em>Void War</em> is an <em>FTL</em>-like roguelite game that heavily homages the Games Workshop created <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6bc2812a-69f3-4947-89d3-4c79996f4d0f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer 40k</em></a>. In fact, when I <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/10-steam-next-fest-best-demos-february-2025" rel="nofollow">wrote about it as part of Steam Next Fest</a> in February 2025 I said that it seemed to have "scrubbed off" references, as in changing names and other elements sometimes called 'filing off the serial numbers'.</p><p>While not a huge success, <em>Void War</em> had done pretty well for itself on Steam, until last night when the game was mysteriously removed from the PC store front. At first there was no comment from the developer, and then a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2853590/discussions/0/685243800199705595/" rel="nofollow">general post</a> made that they were working with Steam to rectify the situation. Speculation abounded, but this afternoon, they provided a more in-depth response confirming that it was indeed a DMCA takedown.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>According to Tundra Interactive, they have not received any other communication from Games Workshop (and in fact <em>Void War</em> is up <a href="https://tundra-interactive.itch.io/void-war" rel="nofollow">on Itch.Io still</a>) and Valve provided merely the information of Games Workshop's public facing infringements inbox, and the name 'Mal Reynolds'.&nbsp;</p><p>For sci-fi fans, that name may ring a bell, as it is indeed the same as the main character from <em>Firefly</em>, which has led to Tundra Interactive wondering if someone else filed the <em>Void War</em> DMCA takedown. Their attempts to contact Games Workshop to confirm have so far failed to be replied to. In the meantime, Tundra Interactive is going through the DMCA process and says they will, "share further updates when we have confirmed information."&nbsp;</p><p>We also reached out to Games Workshop to inquire, but they did not immediately respond to our inquiry. In the interim, <em>Void War</em> isn't available on Steam though you can still see their <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2853590/discussions/" rel="nofollow">forums</a> there. If you want to pick up <em>Void War</em>, it's in early access and <a href="https://tundra-interactive.itch.io/void-war" rel="nofollow">available on Itch.io</a> for the moment. That version will also provide you with a Steam key if/when this current situation is resolved.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier this week, Xbox gave us an idea of when to expect its two biggest games of 2026: <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-everything-we-know-xbox-biggest-map-online-play-ps5-release-date-2000662346"><em>Forza Horizon 6</em></a> will land on May 15, and the long-awaited <a href="https://kotaku.com/fable-reboot-features-seamless-open-world-and-is-launching-this-fall-2000662295"><em>Fable</em> reboot</a> will arrive sometime in the fall. But oddly, while <em>Fable</em> is launching on the same (as-yet unknown) day on Xbox and PS5, <em>Horizon 6</em> isn’t. Instead, its PS5 version will arrive sometime after the Xbox release. When pressed on why this was the case, one Xbox exec provided a confusing answer.</p> <p><a href="https://keleops-usa.slack.com/archives/C099JF8RR7T/p1769193061207769">In a new interview with <em>GamesRadar</em></a>, Xbox Game Studios head Craig Duncan told the outlet that he and Xbox have a “pretty simple view” about bringing their games and franchises, like <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-remake-campaign-evolved-playstation-cross-play-2000638951"><em>Halo</em> and <em>Gears of War,</em></a> to more platforms. “We want our games to reach the most players that we can,” explained Duncan. “It’s rarely more complicated than that. It’s like, how can we get this game to as many players as we can?”</p>

 <p>Okay, sure, we’ve heard this before from Xbox. They want to be on more platforms and give people more ways to play. Fine. But when asked specifically why <a href="https://kotaku.com/fable-reboot-appearance-morality-good-evil-horns-halo-2000662597"><em>Fable</em></a> is launching at the same time on Xbox and PS5, but <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-game-pass-early-access-price-increase-premium-edition-60-120-2000662606"><em>Forza Horizon 6</em></a> isn’t, Duncan admitted that “sometimes we are inconsistent.”</p> <p>“You see some games in one place, some games in multiple places,” Duncan told the outlet. “Just know that we’re going to work on that, and we’re going to try and be more consistent with what we do.”</p>

 <p>According to him, Xbox won’t commit to every future game launching day one on PS5 because the company wants to “maintain optionality.”</p> <p>“If we’re only in a position to release a game on a platform and not have it show up really well? Then I think we wouldn’t do that. I think we would have a conversation internally and go, ‘Hey, unless we can do it really well and do the right thing by those players, then…’ and that’s when you get into conversations of, well, maybe we can ship it afterwards. Because teams are only a set size. We only have a certain amount of…ultimately, it all comes down to resources. Not everything is limitless. So we just want to do the best job, by each platform, by each game.”</p>

 <p>According to Duncan, sometimes games need extra time to get them running on a different platform. And that does sound plausible. But it is very convenient that <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>, a super hyped-up sequel to one of Xbox’s biggest hits, isn’t coming to PS5 right away. Meanwhile, <em>Fable</em>, a long-delayed reboot of a franchise that has been MIA for over a decade, is launching on PS5 as well as Xbox. You could theorize that Xbox wants to keep <em>Forza</em> on its platforms, like Xbox Cloud and Game Pass, as exclusives for an extended period of time, and push people to play there. Regardless, it’s clear that the future of <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-ceo-halo-ps5-more-multiplatform-games-1851482805">Xbox’s multiplatform strategy</a> is kind of all over the place and will likely continue to be that way for the foreseeable future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Remedy's Alan Wake 2</strong> had a great reception when it launched in late October 2023. It received excellent review scores (<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including a 9 from Wccftech's Francesco De Meo</a></strong>), many awards (three at TGA 2023: Best Game Direction, Best Narrative, and Best Art Direction), and even became the <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-is-remedys-fastest-selling-title-at-1-3-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>fastest-selling game released by the Finnish studio to date</strong></a>, with <strong>over 1.3 million units</strong> sold as of February 2024. However, sales slowed down quickly afterward. As of late November 2024, Remedy <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-still-hasnt-recouped-all-its-development-and-marketing-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had to admit to its investors</a> that the development and marketing costs hadn't yet been fully recovered. That only changed in February 2025, when the game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-has-sold-2-million-units-remedy-has-a-new-unannounced-project-in-the-works/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally broke the 2 </a></strong><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-has-sold-2-million-units-remedy-has-a-new-unannounced-project-in-the-works/" target="_blank"><strong>million-unit mark</strong></a>&nbsp;and began</span> generating royalties for the studio.</p>



<p>Obviously, this relative underperformance for a title that most genre fans agree is very well-made was discussed thoroughly by fans and industry professionals alike. Two of the main factors identified were <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2/">th</a><a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e</a><a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2/"> lack of a physical release at launch</a> (which only changed a year later) and, most importantly, the fact that the PC version was and is still only available on the <strong>Epic Games Store</strong> rather than <strong>Valve's Steam</strong>, by far the largest game distribution store on the platform. The permanent exclusivity of Alan Wake 2 didn't sit well with some gamers, who to this day refuse to install the Epic Games Launcher to buy and play the game. </p>



<p>The discussion on the subject was suddenly reignited this week by <strong>Larian's</strong> outspoken <strong>Director of Publishing</strong>, <strong>Michael Douse</strong>. It all started <span>with the comments of&nbsp;<strong>New Blood Interactive CEO Dave Oshry</strong>, who noted on social media that </span><a href="https://wccftech.com/having-your-game-be-free-on-epic-is-great-advertising-for-steam-sales-says-indie-pub-after-blood-west-sales-spiked-while-it-was-free-on-egs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>giving away a game for free on the Epic Games Store also boosted sales of the same game</span> on Steam</a>.</p>



<p>Addressing that claim, Epic Games founder and CEO <strong>Tim Sweeney</strong> <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2013717884711633121" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responded</a> that 'gamers and developers win by having more options and better deals', adding with a jab to Gabe Newell and his famous acquisition of a massive yacht that <strong>the Epic Games Store is now '55-60%' of Steam's userbase</strong> and that, unlike Valve, the company is reinvesting some of its revenue into the Free Program to the benefit of both developers and users.</p>



<p>That's when Douse <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2013963017197691329" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went ahead to say</a> that Remedy '<strong>seemingly went into financial crisis</strong>' because of the game's Epic Games Store exclusivity on PC, losing '<strong>potentially hundreds of millions</strong>' by not launching on Steam.</p>



<p><em>I understand Epic entirely funded Alan Wake 2 but this altruistic pro-developer talk doesn't sit well when Remedy seemingly went into financial crisis because they couldn't tap Steam for AW2 sales suffering potentially hundreds of millions in lost revenue.</em></p>



<p><em>Not that they need the money, but a % take to Epic could've recouped dev costs + more. Competition is good, and important, but it is difficult to buy the message when there are demonstrable cases of games underperforming as a result of the tactic. Ultimately, the viability of the store sits on their ability to convert hundreds of millions of Fortnite players into mid-hardcore premium gamers, and I don't see the Fortnite brand attempting to do that. The Apple &amp; Google stores spent a decade devaluing games &amp; apps to a point where it is largely impossible to sell a premium game there in a way that doesn't massively devalue it on other systems. Giving everyone everything for free might bump numbers but doesn't create a viable storefront from which to sell premium experiences.</em></p>



<p>In a surprising twist, Alan Wake 2 developer Remedy <a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/2014375181507047630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actually chose to answer Douse directly</a>, outlining that <strong>there would be no game at all without Epic's help</strong> and stressing that <strong>they received a 'very fair' publishing deal</strong>.</p>



<p><em>Hi. There would be no Alan Wake 2 without Epic Publishing. The publishing deal with Epic was very fair to Remedy. While these complex deals can often take even a year to reach their conclusion, and may not always be fair to the developer, this one was. And it only took months to get done. Epic Games was, and is, an excellent partner to us. Steam or no Steam.</em></p>



<p>To be honest, while Alan Wake 2 would have sold more if it had launched on Steam, it is unlikely that it would have really garnered a large amount of extra sales. The first installment sold a similar amount, after all, and it didn't have that issue. Moreover, it isn't like it's the only Remedy game to suffer this fate. <strong>The studio is known for its portfolio of great games that never quite sold as well as they should have</strong>, with the exception of <strong>Control</strong>, which is, however, in a much more popular genre. If there's anything the studio regrets right now, it is more likely to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-ceo-steps-down-after-9-years-following-fbc-firebreak-disaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>the disastrous</strong> <strong>FBC: Firebreak</strong></a>.</p>



<p>It was already excellent news for gamers (and for Epic itself) that <strong>a sequel was made at all, which was far from guaranteed</strong>, and even more so that it turned out to be <strong>a fantastic survival horror game</strong>, thus keeping the Remedy Connected Universe going. On that note, a new entry will be released this year: <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/control-resonant-switches-protagonist-brings-the-action-in-open-ended-manhattan-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CONTROL Resonant</a></strong>, a full-fledged action RPG <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/control-2-will-be-made-on-a-smaller-budget-than-alan-wake-2-as-remedy-goes-from-surviving-to-succeeding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made on a lower budget than Alan Wake 2</a></strong>, making it more likely to turn profitable in a short time.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-store-poke-court-nyc-manhattan-robbery-donation-2000662652</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>Earlier this month, Poké Court, a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card and collectible shop in the Manhattan Meatpacking District, was holding a community event where fans gathered to decorate top loaders for their cards. The event was a first of its kind for the store, which opened in November. But that’s not why the people there that night will remember it. The event was crashed by </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-shops-robbed-100k-nyc-masked-thieves-anime-backpacks-recently-opened-2000660233"><span>a group of masked robbers who held the store up at gunpoint</span></a><span>, smashed glass cases and shelves,&nbsp; and stole over $100,000 worth of collector’s merchandise. “They just grabbed whatever they could,” said owner Courtney Chin.</span></p> <p><span>Stories like this have unfortunately become </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2026-01-23/pokemon-card-thefts-are-hitting-collectors-across-southern-california"><span>more and more common</span></a><span> as the scalper market has become a quick money-making scheme for people who don’t even care about Pikachu, Charizard, or any of the other monsters in the series. Stores have reported everything from armed robberies and being assaulted with pepper spray to people tunneling into stores like they’re in a heist movie.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>A store in Huntington Beach, California got hit right before the recent Christmas holiday. Thieves reportedly burrowed through some part of the shop’s roof. “It’s hard not to worry with so many other stores being hit,” the owner, Jerry Hernandez, </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2026-01-23/pokemon-card-thefts-are-hitting-collectors-across-southern-california"><span>told the </span><i><span>Los Angeles Times</span></i></a><span>. “I feel like once we got hit and some of the other shops got hit it created a snowball effect.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000662648" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662648"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662648">© Photo: Kenneth Shepard</figcaption></figure> <p><span>When I went to Poké Court this week, located on a cobblestone side street close to the Hudson River, the shelves were mostly still empty, but they did have a bouquet of flowers sitting on them next to some of the Pokémon card top loaders fans had come together to decorate. If I hadn’t already known about the smash and grab, there would have been little to suggest Poké Court had been the target of a terrible crime.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>It was the middle of a cold Manhattan January afternoon, and the store still had dozens of customers coming in and out to joyfully buy and open trading card packs at the shop’s bartop. But if you paid attention, there were clues to what had happened. Before I even spoke to anyone in the store, a customer was offering their condolences to the staff, who graciously accepted their kind words. In the corner of the entrance, Chin was putting the store’s new security system through its paces.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2>“A world we must defend”</h2> <p><span>Chin started what would become a brick-and-mortar shop in one of the most expensive real estate markets in the country out of her second bedroom after getting back into </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>collecting in a “really intense way.” She wanted to create something more “specialized” than your average card shop. Trading cards have become such a lucrative hobby and business that most collectible stores diversify their stock, carrying sports cards alongside the </span><i><span>Magic</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Yu-Gi-Oh</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> packs people love. Poké Court is meant to be a place where </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans can reliably show up and know the store is dedicated to the franchise they’re obsessed with, and is staffed by people with extensive experience and knowledge about its long and hype-fueled history.</span></p> <p><span>“These are my friends who also grew up having the same core memories and really loving the franchise and thinking about all the values of Pokémon that we really resonate with,” Chin tells me. “We love the idea of community. We love the idea of trust, and even the theme song’s ‘being the very best,’ right? It tries to bring out the best in people, and it teaches you about resilience and hardship. And I think there are a lot of core lessons that my generation really took to heart.”</span></p>

 <p><span>While many </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>sellers will go to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-tcg-vendor-scalper-reseller-stream-shows-2000630658"><span>larger community events and card shows</span></a><span>, Chin says that having the brick-and-mortar location makes it less feasible to uproot the shop to do temporary events. But that physical presence also helps anchor the business and foster a local community, one that has weathered the changing, difficult storms of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>collecting’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900"><span>post-Covid, scalper-addled chaos</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“When I first started, I used to price things at MSRP or even below,” Chin says. “I would want to have the best prices so people would always come to my shop and buy from me. Once it became all about money, we would have some individuals—I don’t want to assign a label to them—but they would come and just buy everything and then immediately sell it. There’s nothing wrong with that. It’s a free market. But then they got really creative and they started botting our site. So we would drop something on our site and then we would immediately get flooded with hundreds of orders from the same individuals buying out all of our products. Then we would get an angry response from our actual customers and our regulars and they’re like, ‘You didn’t save anything.’”</span></p> <p><span>In response, Poké Court has had to adjust prices, which Chin acknowledges raises the barrier to entry for some people. But the lengths to which people would go to buy out all of the shop’s stock for cheap and then flip it became “unsavory,” even escalating into shouting matches and fights outside the store.</span></p>

 <p><span>“It really shouldn’t be about the money but unfortunately that’s what everyone focuses on because it’s so attention grabbing,” Chin says. “Then people get excited, they’re like, ‘oh, my collection is now worth $1,000 instead of $100. I’ve made so much money.’”</span></p> <div> <p>Welcome to Exp. Share, <em>Kotaku</em> ’s <em>Pokémon</em> column in which we dive deep to explore notable characters, urban legends, communities, and just plain weird quirks from throughout the <em>Pokémon</em> franchise.</p></div> <p><span>Fights are one thing, but threats of gun violence were something else entirely. Chin was in the store’s back room when Poké Court’s top loader event was wrapping up. Around 40 customers and 14 employees were in the store at the time, including folks who just wanted to hang out for the festivities. Chin knew something was wrong the second she heard the sound of glass shattering. Employees and customers rushed to the back of the store for safety as the robbers went to work.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000662647" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662647"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662647">© Photo: Kenneth Shepard</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Chin was able to hit the store’s panic button and call the police. Thankfully, no one was hurt, but thousands of dollars worth of vintage and rare merchandise from across the </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> franchise’s 30 years was gone. That’s where most reports about what happened at Poké Court end, but that’s not the whole story.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>“Our courage will pull us through”</h2> <p><span>“I thought that our shop would be deserted and everyone would be scared and employees would resign because they feel like this is an unsafe work environment, but it was almost the opposite,” Chin says. “Everyone really bonded together and wanted to stay here longer. After the robbery, everyone could have gone home, which is the rational thing to do, but everyone, we had 50 people here, and they all wanted to stay. They all stood in line and gave their statements to the police, and they all wanted to be here for each other.”</span></p> <p><span>The New York Poké Court community showed up for each other, but as word of the shop’s story spread, Chin says the broader Pokémon community has reached out in support as well. Big content creators have shared the store’s </span><a href="https://thepokecourt.com/products/poke-court-community-support?utm_source=ig&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=link_in_bio&amp;fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQMMjU2MjgxMDQwNTU4AAGnU0K6HAZne1CZRccxo-cJqqgib4qA0IczzxBbERK_Ihk0YJf_IDG8l87qarA_aem_wDNuUu1z2EFKMndQncv8NA"><span>community fund</span></a><span> that’s raised thousands of dollars. Even big names in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-ketchum-pikachu-final-episode-netflix-1850805389"><span>Ash Ketchum</span></a><span> voice actor </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-ash-ketchum-voice-actor-sarah-natochenny-anime-1850234947"><span>Sarah Natochenny</span></a><span> started reaching out </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DThGXC4jJ5P/?hl=en"><span>on social media</span></a><span>. Chin says the store has gotten an influx of job applications, too.</span></p>

 <p><span>“They’re like, ‘I want to work for you’ and I’m like, ‘We just got held up. I can’t believe you would want to spend more time in this spot.’ So I think that it’s very encouraging that people are bouncing back even harder than ever. We’re not going to let a robbery stop us.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000662649" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662649"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662649">© Photo: Kenneth Shepard</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The support has gone beyond just people donating money. Some have offered musical performances in-store while others bring in food for staff. The immediate pillow of support has been a “big morale booster” for the team. While the Poké Court has been in headlines over one of the worst things that could have happened to it, Chin wants people to know that the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>community is more than just collectors chasing the most valuable cards.</span></p> <p><span>“One of the most common misconceptions is that the Pokémon community is full of people who only are in it for the money or only care about investing or are scalpers,” she says. “You just hear the worst, right? But for better or for worse, this robbery has shown how people can come together in a really positive and genuinely heartwarming way to support total strangers, to support their local card shop, to support all the people who were absolutely traumatized by this experience. I’ve just been floored and humbled and I’m so thankful that there’s this massive community.”</span></p> <p><span>As the shop’s story has spread on social media, neighboring card shops around the state have also been reaching out about the stolen merchandise, verifying certification numbers in case the robbers try to sell what they took. The entire thing has made Chin feel like the shop has a “network of friends” that expands far beyond New York City.</span></p>

 <p><span>When I left Poké Court this week, it was just as full of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans as it’s ever been, though it now has additional security. There was a version of the store’s future where fans stopped showing up to buy and open packs, scared off by the threat of violence over a hobby that’s supposed to be about bringing people together. Instead, the store is bouncing back, thanks in no small part to a community that was never in it for the money to begin with. They were in it for each other and the friends they’ve met along the way through a shared love of Pokémon.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-store-poke-court-nyc-manhattan-robbery-donation-2000662652]]></content:encoded>
