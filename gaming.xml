            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24300547/xbox-cloud-gaming-game-library-streaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft is starting to open up Xbox Cloud Gaming to <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/games-apps/cloud-gaming/set-up-smart-tv-xbox-app">existing Xbox game libraries</a> today. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can now stream 50 games that they already own, including <em>Balatro</em>, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, a variety of <em>Final Fantasy</em> titles, and <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>.</p><p>The expansion to 50 more games is just the beginning of opening up the Xbox game library to cloud streaming. “Our library of cloud-playable titles will continue to grow, as we work with our partners around the world to bring you a diverse and expansive selection of great games across devices,” says Ashley McKissick, corporate vice president of Xbox Experiences and platforms engineering.</p><p>The 50 additional games will be available through TVs, smartphones, tablets, and PCs through a web browser. Microsoft is also planning to bring Xbox library streaming to Xbox consoles and the Xbox app on Windows next year.</p><p>This expansion is part of a long-running project known as Project Lapland inside of Microsoft. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/11/24268038/xbox-cloud-gaming-project-lapland-game-library">I revealed last month</a> that Microsoft was planning to start letting Xbox Insiders get access to more games on Xbox Cloud Gaming in November, and these initial 50 games are the start of eventually expanding this to thousands of Xbox games to cover entire libraries.</p><p>The original Project xCloud was&nbsp;<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2019/11/14/expanding-project-xcloud-more-games-more-ways-to-play/">supposed to launch</a>&nbsp;with game library streaming in 2020, but it never did, and Microsoft then announced it would support game libraries on Xbox Cloud Gaming&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/9/23159492/xbox-game-pass-cloud-gaming-library-owned-games-feature">in 2022</a>. That never happened either, and I <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/11/24268038/xbox-cloud-gaming-project-lapland-game-library">reported last month</a> that the work to make this a reality has been complicated. Microsoft has to ready thousands of games on its custom Xbox cloud servers while balancing save files, game updates, and much more. </p><p>While thousands of games will eventually be available through Xbox Cloud Gaming, I’m told some publishers will hold certain games back due to licensing requirements or deals.</p><p>Microsoft was also planning to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24267339/microsoft-xbox-android-purchase-games-us-court-ruling">enable game purchases in its Xbox mobile app</a> for Android in the US in November, thanks to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/10/7/24243316/epic-google-permanent-injunction-ruling-third-party-stores">court ruling</a>&nbsp;last month that forces Google to stop requiring Google Play Billing for apps in the Play Store. Google won a temporary administrative stay on this ruling late last month, so it’s no longer clear when Microsoft will be able to enable game purchases in its Xbox mobile app on Android.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gang-beasts">Gang Beasts</a> is one of the games I think of when I recall the golden days of video game expos, before Covid rolled up and nuked the business model. It casts you as one of several jellybaby pugilists, fighting for dominance over such locations as Ferris wheels and the tops of speeding vans. All of the characters are 1) seemingly drunk, and 2) subject to real-time physics. Your abilities consist of 1) punching, headbutting or kicking people, perhaps knocking them out for a few seconds, and 2) grabbing people and things and either hoisting them skyward like a wrestler, or hoisting yourself skyward like a toddler climbing onto Mummy's head. The only way of defeating people is to hurl them off-map.</p>
<p>Most rounds of Gang Beasts go like this: an absolutely brainless opening scrum before the participants peel off into separate duels. At least one person will throw themselves off a ledge whilst trying to throw somebody else. People will struggle to see what they're doing because they're sobbing with laughter. And then, the finale: two or more players dangling from a precipice, grimly refusing to let go of each other, until somebody manages to headbutt the player holding onto the building.</p>
<p>I love Gang Beasts. I loved it at expos and I love playing it at home with my family. So I'm tickled punk to learn that the Steam version has received a chonky new update, adding a driveable construction crane level and flocks of vicious, cuddly birds. Here's a trailer.</p>
<figure>

</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwDIDelKZ6Y" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/285900/view/4482865501645570061?l=english">As detailed in the announcement blog</a>, Update 1.25 adds a new Crane level that "includes the first implementation of our new driveables system, with players being able to jump into the Crane cockpit to take the controls." Weaponising construction equipment? How very Gang Beasts. But watch out, because Crane also harbours some new and angry wildlife. Survive for long enough, and avian hoodlums will swoop down, seize you in their talons and try to fly off with you. The obvious question: if all the players link arms, can the birds pick up everybody at once?</p><p>The update also adds a few bird-themed costumes - unfortunately, it doesn't look like they give you the power of flight. This is the first proper Gang Beasts update in years, I think, though there have been smaller patches for bugs and whatnot. Are you still playing? In the course of writing this up, I've learned that there might genuinely be some kind of serious Gang Beasts competitive scene. Leave it to gamers to ruin the fun.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

By Niantic's admission, its VPS has over 10 million locations scanned globally from the past five years, and "receive[s] about 1 million fresh scans each week," which are collected from its games—one of which has been quite popular for nearly a decade, meaning players may have unknowingly participated in helping build its LGM.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Similar to a Large Language Model (LLM), Niantic's model scrapes data from real-world locations, and it hopes to use the technology to "enable computers not only to perceive and understand physical spaces, but also to interact with them in new ways."

            <p>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl developer GSC Game World has released a statement on the state of its game, as its sequel finally becomes available to play.</p>
<p>Stalker 2 made its debut today across Xbox and PC, but is already the subject of multiple technical issues - these issues are one of the reasons <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wheres-our-stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">Eurogamer's own Stalker 2 review isn't on the site just yet</a>.</p>
<p>Writing on social media platform X, GSC has addressed these issues and acknowledged the game "may" have some "rough edges" now that it is out in the wild. However, the studio has assured its players will address any niggles that arise in the game, as and when it is able.</p>

<p>"We are absolutely committed to being here, monitoring your feedback and quickly fixing any issues that need our attention," the developer wrote. "In the first few days after release, we'll be working with hotfixes, rolling them out as precisely as possible, but as frequently as we can."</p>
<p>Following this, GSC will release more substantial updates for Stalker 2, as well as free in-game content. More details on the game's roadmap will be shared in December, GSC said, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>"We have big plans for the Stalker universe. In a way, today is both a return and the beginning of a grand new journey," the team closed. "We're blessed to have you before, we're blessed to have you now. The Zone belongs to you. Have fun."</p>

<p>The studio recently released a documentary all about developing Stalker 2 during a particularly difficult time for GSC. The documentary - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-documentary-shares-personal-stories-from-development-against-the-backdrop-of-war">War Game: The Making of Stalker 2</a> - touches on the developer's history and details what it has been like to work on the forthcoming sequel during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-on-hold-ukraine-based-developer-confirms">Russia's invasion of Ukraine</a>.</p>
<p>Since 2022, GSC has delayed Stalker 2 several times and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-developer-reportedly-moving-to-prague-to-finish-game">relocated staff</a> to safely finish the project elsewhere, while others have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-harrowing-update-from-gsc-game-world-the-stalker-2-developer-based-in-ukraine">joined Ukraine's armed forces</a>, and dealt with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-dev-says-russian-hackers-have-leaked-test-build-online-asks-fans-not-to-share">Russian hackers who leaked test builds</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's game time. We need to run through several training scenarios with you before you can take the field again after your injury. So grab your gear and head into the War Games Combat Arena for the first cycle of training, and get ready because you're training against other Spartans who are also eager to prove themselves.</p>

<p><em>Halo Flashpoint</em> is a brand new miniatures game from Mantic Games, of which we've covered several of their products over the years, from the sci-fi skirmish game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/deadzone-3e-two-player-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">Deadzone</a>, the sports battler <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/overdrive-review" rel="nofollow">OverDrive</a>, and their awesome fantasy mass battle game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/kings-of-war-guide" rel="nofollow">Kings of War</a>. In this article, we'll have a look at the <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> Recon Edition set, talk about what it contains and how it plays.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-3.jpg?itok=f4pGHW9A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-3.jpg?itok=HlU0b-hu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> Recon Edition box is a great place for anyone to start their <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> journey (Photo: Mantic Games).</figcaption></figure>

<p>For those who don't know <em>Halo</em> was a popular first-person shooter series of games that started in 2001, with its latest release, <em>Halo Infinite</em> in 2021. <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> is a licensed release between 343 Industries and Mantic Games, and brings the first-person deathmatch game to the tabletop, using Mantic's <em>Deadzone</em> rules system, with some tweaks to add <em>Halo</em> theme to it.</p>

<p>The Halo Flashpoint Recon Edition contains:</p>

<ul><li>8x Spartan models</li>
	<li>Rulebook</li>
	<li>Playmat</li>
	<li>Pre-coloured card terrain and tokens</li>
	<li>10x Weapon cards</li>
	<li>8x Player/model cards</li>
	<li>2x Reference cards</li>
	<li>12x D8 dice</li>
	<li>6x Command dice</li>
</ul><p>The miniatures are single piece and ready to play (also colored Red and Blue, which is a nod to the Red vs Blue <em>Halo </em>TV show). This, combined with the beginner's mission on one side of the game mat, which features a smaller map and the rules printed around the edge, makes getting <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> from opening to play extremely fast and beginner-friendly. The scenery is also printed card, that slots together easily and quickly, so you can get the whole Recon box set up extremely fast.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-1.jpg?itok=WDnYXdjc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-1.jpg?itok=_F2dbpjM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The upcoming&nbsp;<em>Halo Flashpoint</em>&nbsp;War Games expansion will make all your <em>Halo</em> Wargames dreams come true (Photo: Mantic Games).</figcaption></figure><h2>Is Halo Flashpoint A Full Wargame?</h2>

<p>The Recon Edition of the game is just the start of Mantic's <em>Halo</em> plans and works as a starter set for the system, and also as a standalone product. There is a larger version of the game available, the Spartan Edition, which includes more miniatures and scenery, and early next year, Mantic will release the War Games Expansion, which will turn <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> into a full tabletop wargame, with points values and list building, taking it away from the limited draft you have out of the Recon Edition.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-5.jpg?itok=1xTOPiIn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-5.jpg?itok=wSfLAxXw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Halo Flashpoint</em>&nbsp;Spartan miniatures come pre-colored red and blue, but look even better painted&nbsp;(Photo: Mantic Games).</figcaption></figure><h2>How Do You Play Halo Flashpoint?</h2>

<p>For those coming from Mantic's <em>Deadzone</em> rules, much will be familiar here, with a few tweaks for the full <em>Halo</em> thematic experience. For those unfamiliar, games of <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> are played on gridded maps with scenery known as cubes. Models use their movement value to move between cubes, freely placing them within the cube itself. This also covers movement up and down over the scenery. This system keeps everything straightforward for movement, as well as measuring range and working out line of sight for units. This system, like the Deadzone rules they come from, makes this extremely beginner-friendly, but also offers veteran wargames a simple system, so they can focus on the other areas of tactical combat.</p>

<p>To shoot and attack, players roll 3 eight-sided dice (D8) and compare the roll to the Ranged or Fight characteristics on the Spartan's profile card, which details what they need to roll to succeed. Modifiers to the roll add or subtract dice, depending on if the target is in cover, or you are on higher ground, or for melee combat, if there are additional units in the same cube. The target of the attack also rolls 3 dice and compares it to their Survive characteristic, each success cancels out an attack dice. If attack dice remain, damage is dealt.</p>

<p>The <em>Halo</em> experience comes into <em>Halo Flashpoint </em>not only through the miniatures, artwork, and attention to detail that the designers have put into the arms and equipment from the <em>Halo</em> universe, but the way it's designed actually feels like a Team Deathmatch. One of the key mechanics to this is the respawn, which allows removed models to return to the field the next time they would activate, losing their first activation to move back onto the field and then continue with their actions as normal. This removal and slight delay, while simple mechanics-wise, really captures the feel of the game, and with scenarios like Capture the Flag and Stronghold, makes it a perfect example of getting the video game theme onto the tabletop.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-2.jpg?itok=3bdZsGgD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-2.jpg?itok=xXWx2P8O 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Currrently the <em>Halo Flashpoint</em>&nbsp;Paint Set is the only place to get the playable Master Chief miniature&nbsp;(Photo: Mantic Games).</figcaption></figure><h2>Can I Play Master Chief In Halo Flashpoint?</h2>

<p>You can absolutely play Master Chief in <em>Halo Flashpoint</em>, unfortunately just not out of the Recon Edition box. Master Chief is available in the <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> Paint Set, which includes 8 Army Painter paints, a brush, the Master Chief miniature, and a profile card to use him in game.</p>

<p>The Recon Editon includes 2 identical teams of 4 Spartans. Each team contains:</p>

<ul><li>Spartan MK VII - The MK VII comes armed with an MA40 Assault Rifle, they can pin targets down or take them out with the accuracy that comes from a high rate of fire. They also have the Tactician ability,&nbsp;which means you roll&nbsp;more command dice to access extra abilities for the fire team.</li>
	<li>Spartan Brawler - The Brawler has a better Fight stat than the others, but a lower Ranged stat, and they come armed with the close-range but lethal CQS48 Bulldog.</li>
	<li>Spartan Zvezda - The Zvezda has the scout ability, which lets them advance one cube after set up, letting them close on objectives. They have an average shoot and a poor fight stat, but the VK78 Commando they come armed with has Optics, which improves their shooting ability.</li>
	<li>Spartan Deadeye - The Deadeye has the best range&nbsp;stat of the 4 Recon Edition Spartans, and the M392 DMR rifle they come armed with has optics for even better accuracy, and lethal for extra damage on each hit.</li>

<p><i>Halo Flashpoint </i>is one of the best playable out-of-the-box wargames I've seen, with an incredible open-to-table time. While the box itself is fairly limited in play for veteran wargamers with 2 teams of equal Spartan types, it gives a solid starting point for anyone looking to get into the game, and it's perfect for beginners. If you're looking for more variety before the expansion that opens up the game is released, then consider the Spartan Edition that we hope to review soon on the site. The <em>Deadzone</em> rules still hold up, and play perfectly into not only the <em>Halo</em> theme but also captures the overall Team Deathmatch style of the game. Now we wait for the solo Master Chief narrative campaign that Mantic is definitely going to release right?</p>

<h2>Should I Buy Halo Flashpoint Recon Edition?</h2>

<p>If you want an incredible beginner-friendly quick-to-table game, just in time for Christmas, then <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> is for you. If you're a <em>Halo</em> fan, <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> is definitely for you. If you want a great tabletop iteration of Team Deathmatch, <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> is for you. If you want a <em>Halo</em> wargame, <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> is for you, but not just yet, you'll have to wait for the War Games Expansion next year, but still pick <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> up, because you still get the full rules and some great miniatures to start playing with. If you want a huge amount of replayability and variety out of the box, then the Recon Edition might not be for you, but consider the Spartan Edition, which comes with more Spartans and some Elites and we'll comment on how much variety it has when we get hold of a copy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/puella-magi-madoka-magica-magia-exedra-delayed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Upcoming anime RPG&nbsp;<em>Puella Magi Madoka Magica: Magia Exedra&nbsp;</em>has been delayed beyond 2024, and the reasons given by the devs are exactly what you'd expect from a delay.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://madoka-exedra.com/en/news/?id=66647" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a notice on the game's official website</a> (which is in both Japanese and English), Aniplex says that the game has been pushed back to spring 2025. It was originally intended for release sometime this year, but given that we're in mid-November and no release date was forthcoming, a delay probably isn't surprising.</p>

<p>According to Aniplex,&nbsp;<em>Magia Exedra&nbsp;</em>was delayed in order to "deliver the best possible gaming experience" and "ensure even higher quality in the final game", which is a pretty broad statement. This is where we wheel out that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/did-miyamoto-really-say-a-delayed-game-is-eventually-good-but-a-rushed-game-is-forever-bad" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">supposed Miyamoto quote</a> about delayed and rushed games, right?</p>

The devs simply say they're "working diligently towards a release that will exceed player expectations", thanking fans for their patience. Looks like we'll have to wait a little while before we know when we can play this one.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Puella Magi Madoka Magica</em>, it's an anime series that serves as a sort of deconstruction of the classic anime "magical girl" trope; in fact, the Japanese title is&nbsp;<em>Mahō Shōjo Madoka Magika</em>, with&nbsp;<i lang="ja-Latn" xml:lang="ja-Latn">mahō shōjo&nbsp;</i>being the Japanese term for "magical girl".</p>

<p>The story revolves around a group of girls who sign contracts to become magical girls and battle witches, but the narrative and themes&nbsp;<em>Puella Magi Madoka Magica&nbsp;</em>goes for might surprise you if you're expecting a typical magical girl anime.</p>

                <p>The world of Dragon Age is host to a slew of fantastical characters, voiced by a who's who of big names in the world of voice acting--with some sci-fi and fantasy celebrities sprinkled in. From Freddie Prinze Jr. voicing the mighty Iron Bull to Kate Mulgrew as the mysterious Flemeth, one cast member landed the job with a very unconventional audition tape.</p><p>Claudia Black, who made her mark in sci-fi as Aeryn Sun in Farscape, auditioned for the part of Morrigan in Dragon Age: Origins by sending in a recording of her doing a beat poetry version of Sir Mix-A-Lot's "Baby Got Back." Dragon Age creator David Gaider said that the character went through several concepts, but couldn't deny Black the opportunity and listened.</p><p>"I lost my goddamn mind," Gaider said on his <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidgaider.bsky.social/post/3lbdpsilhg22c" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a> account. "Yes, I still have the recording. No, you cannot have it."</p><p>Gaider continued with bringing Black on board and adjusting the character to fit her voice. "Naturally, we jumped on that immediately. As I recall, this was met with resistance from higher up--they had this image of Morrigan as young, like 18 years old (no idea where this came from), and complained that Claudia sounded 'too old.' [Voice director] Caroline [Livingstone} and I were determined, so we pushed ahead. We had to agree to get Claudia to sound 'younger,' which I was dubious about. The first two sessions we asked her to pitch her voice up and it was awful."</p><p>When both Livingstone and Gaider were working with Black to get her to focus on "sounding right," they told her to use her natural voice. It worked. "We loved her performance so much we had the feeling that the team would love it too and forget their nonsense," Gaider added. "They did."</p><p>The character of Morrigan was a touchstone for Gaider and opened up the door for Black to continue her video game voice work in big game franchises like Uncharted and Destiny. She reprises the role once again in Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p><p>"[Morrigan] is the heart of [Dragon Age: Origin]. Way beyond her initial inspirations. Some said 'she's just an ice queen' like some I'd written (Viconia, Bastila, etc.) but such categories are very reductive, I find. She had a voice I could instantly slip into, every time, without fail."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-plans-for-cyberpunk-2077-ps5-pro-patch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt Red has confirmed that it currently doesn't have any plans to release a&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>PS5 Pro patch, so if you were hoping the game was about to get cyber-augmented for Sony's beefy new machine, you're out of luck, unfortunately.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1859151714747552122" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, CDPR crushes the dreams of anyone who was hoping for a PS5 Pro-enhanced version of&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>in just nine words (or ten if you consider "PS5" two words): "we currently have no plans for PS5 Pro patch".</p>

<p>Of course, CD Projekt Red is fully entitled to do whatever it likes with its games, but the lack of a PS5 Pro patch for&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>feels a touch disappointing given the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-opencritic-page-will-warn-players-about-technical-issues" rel="nofollow">history of technical issues</a> (although those issues admittedly weren't anywhere near as bad in the PS5 version).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-ps5-pro-patch-not-coming-combat.jpg?itok=nRZbaz4E 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-ps5-pro-patch-not-coming-combat.jpg?itok=sME3GoAc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>isn't getting a PS5 Pro patch anytime soon, sadly.</figcaption></figure><p>CD Projekt Red also hasn't said anything about its seminal action-RPG&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&nbsp;</em>getting any kind of PS5 Pro patch, so whichever of the studio's two biggest RPGs you're into, you're out of luck if you're a PS5 Pro owner.</p>

<p>It's likely that production on the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-team-relocating-to-boston" rel="nofollow">sequel</a> is taking precedence over further major changes to the original game. Last we heard, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-sold-43-million-copies-as-dev-team-for-sequel-is-being" rel="nofollow">development team for said sequel was being assembled</a>, although naturally, we don't know what the game will be called or when it will launch yet.</p>

<p>Although&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>won't be enhanced for the PS5 Pro, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/full-ps5-pro-enhanced-list-launch" rel="nofollow">host of other games</a> do have enhancements for Sony's new console. Titles like&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls</em>,&nbsp;<em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em>, and the recently-released&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>all have extra visual or performance features on Sony's new console.</p>

            <p>One of my proudest pictures of a 2018 trip to Croatia wasn't of me and my pal. No, it wasn't of the beautiful scenery or the glistening sea either. It was of many cats lying in the sun together outside a little church. I hadn't seen that volume of cats in my life, nor that volume <em>together</em> in one spot, all hanging out. Now, you too can live this magic: there's a demo of this upcoming sidescroller called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neko-odyssey">Neko Odyssey</a> on Steam, and it consists of you taking photos of cats for internet clout. It's nice!</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Neko Odyssey goes for a familiar nostalgic Japanese game look, employing a 2D pixellated style overlaid on a 3D backdrop. It really captures the heart, what with pleasant boppy music and an authentic-seeming town in the demo. Solid vending machine work. Good ramen restaurant layout. Strong abundance of cats.</p>
<p>Cats that you'll want to take photos of, largely by walking up to them and pressing the space bar. The aim? To grow your Insta following for an audience who demands more cat pics, with those likes viewable at the press of a button and a quick doomscroll of your feed.</p>
<p>One of my favourite pics was of a cat whose face was wedged in a crack in a wall.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/neko-odyssey2.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun/Flyhigh Works</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And I like this one of a cat who was sat opposite his owner in a ramen restaurant, clearly annoyed at his lack of a portion.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/neko-odyssey1.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun/Flyhigh Works</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Some cats aren't that easy to take photos of, though. Some demand cat food, while others are perched in hard-to-reach places you'll need to figure out a route towards. According to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2476350/Neko_Odyssey/">Steam page</a>, there's also a "storyline where you'll unravel the mysteries of the town based on the information you capture in your cat photos". I can't say mine have much truth to them.</p>
<p>No, I won't pretend that Neko Odyssey is going to be the next big thing. But <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2476350/Neko_Odyssey/">the demo</a> is pleasant enough for a quick jaunt and a quick hit of the dopamine.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart Of Chornobyl is out today. As you may have read, it's on the buggy side. Buggier than a bucketful of locusts. Buggier than Kafka's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metamorphosis">Metamorphosis</a>. In our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-review">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart Of Chornobyl review</a>, wasteland wanderer James called it "easily the most borked <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> I've played in years", detailing such issues as HUD elements disappearing, stuttery performance, flashing textures and character mouths not working properly. 
</p>
<p>
James didn't encounter any outright game-breaking bugs, and as he noted, a bit of technical scruffiness is to be expected from developers who are weathering the real-life invasion of their country. Still, it's good to hear that GSC Game World have already addressed a number of issues in "the last few days", and there are of course patches on the way.
</p>
<p>
In an email today, GSC Game World claimed that they'd fixed 1125 individual issues since dispatching the review code, ranging from crashing problems to full-on progress blockers. 
</p>
<p>
Some highlights from the changelog: they've quashed a softlock dialogue issue that left you unable to leave one conversation, a problem with missing weapon sound effects, and a glitch that made dead bodies behave in unsightly ways, such as striking A-poses. They've also stopped the game spawning quest scenarios right under the player's nose, and nixed an issue whereby players would accidentally change their reputation with one NPC faction.
</p><p>
As for cosmetic enhancements, GSC Game World say they've cleaned up the UI and animations during dialogue and tweaked the lighting. They've also addressed some performance issues, including a freezing problem during busier cutscenes or when exploring crowded areas, while working to improve the overall frame rate and loading times.
</p>
<p>
Going by James's review and the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 reviews in general, all this is just scratching the surface. GSC Game World sending us a list of things they've already fixed right before the embargo lift feels a bit cheeky - they're trying to head off criticism at the pass. But I can't blame them for wanting players to get a sense of the game's current status as it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/">lands on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Here are a few wasteland gremlins GSC Game World hope to corner and slaughter in the first few patches - there's one coming "shortly after release", to be followed by a series of hotfixes:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
- Just Like the Good Old Days: Emitter in Faust's Cell is indistinguishable from regular mesh and surroundings making it difficult for the player to notice important quest item while progressing through" quest.
</p>
<p>
- The Freedom Colosseum: Player unable to take a part in the fourth round on the arena despite having all preconditions met 
</p>
<p>
- Game Settings &amp; Controls: Keybinding for flashlight activation can not be changed upon entering keyboard settings
</p>
<p>
- Title stability: On some rare occasions title may close unexpectedly right after choosing difficulty setting
</p>
<p>
- Memory Leak caused issues with facials: a memory leak and a visual bug that occurred when the tick of montage instances was disabled while the Face was not rendered.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I personally enjoy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hello-rockstar-please-make-an-open-world-based-on-my-unplayable-xbox-edition-of-red-dead-redemption">roving around in very buggy gameworlds</a>, especially post-apocalyptic landscapes that are subject to reality distortions, where the dipping of the frame rate and the deranging of the textures just feels like scene-setting. But that comes with the important caveat that I am generally being paid to play them.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Heart Of Chornobyl appears to be an engrossing shooter for all its programming warts and bunions. Here's a closing excerpt from James's review: 
</p>
<p>
"I've been battered and sometimes frustrated by S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2, but ultimately there is something admirable about its commitment to challenging you - especially when it simultaneously provides just enough tools to avoid becoming unfair. Between that, its punchy shooting, and some properly superb atmosphere-building, it's done enough to earn the mantle of Good Game."

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s upcoming permanent OG Mode will have its own unique battle pass, developer Epic Games has revealed, separate to that of the game's main Fortnite Battle Royale offering.
</p>
<p>
Epic Games previously revealed that its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-reviving-original-map-as-permanent-addition-featuring-multiple-classic-seasons">hugely-popular original Fortnite map would return permanently in December</a> as a separate mode that looks set to rotate through its various seasonal incarnations. The decision follows the map's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-smashes-concurrent-user-records-as-over-6m-players-log-on-this-weekend">massive but temporary return 12 months ago</a> that gave the game its best-ever player count of 44.7 million participants in 24 hours.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-crew-will-include-the-battle-pass-lego-pass-music-pass-and-more-starting-in-december">blog post</a> today, Epic Games revealed that the new OG Pass, as well as the game's main Battle Pass, plus the next iterations of the Music Pass and Lego Pass (each 1400 V-Bucks) will all be included in the existing Fortnite Crew subscription going forward. 
</p>
<p>
That's a big upgrade for anyone currently paying £10/$12 a month for Fortnite Crew. The changes mean that this subscription will soon include four battle passes for the same price, instead of just the main Battle Pass.
</p>
<p>
There are a couple of other tweaks today, too. The cost of the main Fortnite Battle Pass is being rounded up to 1000 V-Bucks instead of 950, and new Crew subscribers after 1st December will only be able to claim battle pass rewards while their subscription is active.
</p>
<p>
More details on exactly what will be in the new OG Pass and how much it will cost are still to come ahead of the mode's arrival on 6th December.
</p>
<p>At the same time, Fortnite will also offer an all new Chapter 6 version of its evergreen battle royale, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-6-map-features-japanese-theme-leaks-suggest">which looks set to have a Japanese theme</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Almost a decade after the game’s original release, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-syndicate">Assassin’s Creed Syndicate</a> has been patched on modern consoles with a significant performance update.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin’s Creed Syndicate TV spot Trailer [EUROPE]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HT5Ws-RDUI0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> has confirmed that the underrated, Victorian era stealth ’em up now runs at a silky smooth 60 frame per second on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. There’s also the option to simultaneously crank the game’s resolution to 4K though this won’t be available to those playing on the slightly less robust Xbox Series S.</p>
<p>The publisher didn’t give a specific reason for Syndicate’s mini makeover, nor has it hinted at similar updates for other popular AC titles including the Ezio Collection, Unity, and Black Flag. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/25/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february/">With Assassins’ Creed Shadows pushed back to February 2025,</a> it likely wanted to drum up interest in older entries with many players having overlooked Syndicate.</p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Syndicate launched in October 2015 and although it was met with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/10/22/assassins-creed-syndicate-review/">generally positive reviews</a>, fans had become overfamiliar with the franchise’s time-hopping, open world formula even if introduced dual protagonists and a genuinely interesting setting. This would be the final instalment before Ubisoft hit the reset button, transporting players back to Ancient Egypt in 2017’s Assassin’s Creed: Origins. Its debut drew a line in the sand and would serve as the foundation for future titles, treading further and further into action RPG territory.</p>

<p>Last year’s Assassin’s Creed Mirage went against the grain with a smaller, more focused adventure that dialled back many of those roleplaying systems. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/04/assassins-creed-mirage-review/">our review</a> we scored it a fair 7/10, Aran saying: “Assassin’s Creed Mirage will appeal to anyone who’s been pining for a return to the old school open world stealth of the earlier games. It’s pretty much exactly that with a few extra refinements and additions. Some of those additions are a bit distracting and immersion breaking, but nothing gets in the way of some good old fashioned assassinations.”</p>

			<p>A <a href="https://x.com/FN_Assist/status/1859251588688162930?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1859251588688162930%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">huge change to the microtransactions</a> is coming in Fortnite, meaning that you can get a ton of content for a fixed price each month. As of <a href="https://wccftech.com/all-passes-in-fortnite-to-progress-simultaneously-by-earning-xp-coming-december-1/">December 1</a>, Fortnite Crew will give you access to all of the following for no additional cost as long as you are an active subscriber:</p>
<ul>
<li>Battle Pass</li>
<li>Music Pass</li>
<li>Lego Pass</li>
<li>Any other new Pass that arrives</li>
<li>1,000 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Monthly Crew Pack</li>
<li>Crew Pack legacy styles</li>
<li>Rocket Pass Premium</li>
</ul>
<p>To get all of this content and the premium tracks of each pass, you simply have to pay $11.99 a month. This is a huge change from what it was previously, where you'd have to pay for each pass separately. It hasn't been stated why this change has been made, but there is already a lot of positive buzz around it on social media. Of course, since this means that players will have to pay substantially less to be able to access all of the rewards available, players are beginning to wonder what the catch is. Why would a huge company be favorable towards the players?</p>
<p>So far, it seems that you have to consistently be subscribed to Fortnite Crew to be able to get the rewards, whereas previously, players found that they could pay for Fortnite Crew every other month to get rewards at half the price. However, the rules have been updated to stop Fortnite players from doing that.</p>
<p>It's been stated that for new subscribers to Fortnite Crew, premium rewards on the Battle Pass will only be available to claim if your Fortnite Crew subscription is active. This means that if you cancel it halfway through the pass duration, you won't be able to claim any of the Premium rewards. Instead, you'll now only be able to claim premium rewards from the Battle Pass until the end of your current billing period rather than the remaining duration of the pass.</p>
<p>However, for players who are currently subscribed to Fortnite Crew or subscribe before December 1, there will be no changes made to you can claim premium rewards on the Battle Pass. However, should you cancel your Fortnite Crew subscription after December 1 and then resubscribe after your previous subscription has expired, you'll then be considered a new subscriber and will be in line with the new rules for the pass system.</p>
<p>To get any premium rewards on the Music Pass and Lego Pass, an active Fortnite Crew subscription will be needed to get access to the premium tracks. This will also apply to any new battle passes that are added in the future.</p>

<p>Unknown 9: Awakening Developer Reflector Entertainment has announced that it is reducing the studio’s total workforce by 18%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developer of Unknown 9: Awakening announced on its <a href="https://reflectorentertainment.com/en/news/message-to-the-reflector-community" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/unknown-9-developer-reflector-entertainment-reportedly-suffers-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameIndustry.Biz</a>) that it is shifting its focus as it enters a new phase of development. These changes aim to help the studio deliver on its objectives more efficiently and ensure that each team member can contribute meaningfully to ongoing projects. As a result, 18% of the workforce has been laid off.</p>



<p>Reflector Entertainment has announced that this decision is due to their “current reality,” which prevents them from guaranteeing “tangible work” for all employees. The studio will offer severance packages and access to medical support, emotional assistance, and career planning resources to ensure a smooth transition for those affected.</p>



<p>Moreover, the developers have stated that this decision will allow them “to take the necessary time” to refine and perfect their upcoming projects. The studio has released Unknown 9: Awakening and has two key production lines entering the early stages of development. They require their staff to be “laser-focused on contributing to the projects that wholly benefit from their skillsets.”</p>



<p>In other news, Thunderful recently announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/thunderful-announces-second-wave-of-mass-layoffs-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a second wave of mass layoffs</a>. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/it-cost-unity-205-million-to-make-mass-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it cost Unity $205 million to make mass layoffs</a>.

The headset has allegedly been in the works for some time and was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-stream-deckard-standalone-vr-headset-rumor">first reported on in 2021</a>. Though Valve already released one VR headset in 2019, the Index, it requires multiple base station sensors and connection to a PC.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review-in-progress.1040751/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A certain kind of friction can go a long way in creating a challenging and punishing game that’s also gripping. When developers leave you to figure things out for yourself amid dangerous enemies that can kill you on a moment’s notice, rarely giving you an easy way out of a mess, it becomes clear that the survival instincts embedded in the STALKER series are very much alive in the long-awaited STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl. Then there’s the type of friction that prevents you from engaging with it in earnest, like poor technical performance, bugs that are sometimes hilarious but at others game-breaking, or nonsensical enemy behavior. STALKER 2 has both kinds of friction in equal measure. It just can’t stop getting in its own way, but for all that’s working against it, there’s an underlying greatness that surfaces every now and then.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">STALKER 2 is a massive game; as of this writing, I’m about 20 hours into my playthrough and still have so much left to do in The Zone in both the main story questline and in side missions that I’m having to squint to see a light at the end of the tunnel. Due to the review copy coming in just a week before launch and a progress-halting bug in the main mission (which cost me a day of playtime and required me to reload a previous save that made me lose about four hours of progress in order to avoid it), I haven’t been able to finish it in time to give you a final verdict at launch. And for a series like STALKER, where the resolutions to the story’s mysteries are inherent to how it’s earned its cult following, seeing it to the end is of utmost importance, regardless of the roadblocks I have to truck through to get there.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Chornobyl Exclusion Zone – the site around the tragic, real-world 1986 nuclear meltdown – remains the heart of STALKER, both as a brutal and sometimes stunning open world, and a fascinating setting that’s integral to Ukrainian history. Physics-defying anomalies work as deadly hazards scattered around its huge map, while equally dangerous mutated wildlife lurk about and supernatural phenomena amid the nuclear fallout instill a sense of danger around every corner. Stalkers – mercenaries who make a living in The Zone taking on risky jobs – from various factions are also on the hunt throughout; it’s a harsh place to eke out a living. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In that respect, STALKER 2 is a masterclass in atmosphere: stunning dynamic weather, pitch-dark nights, and radioactive storms that paint the sky a hellish red or toxic green keep things both eerie and threatening in different ways over time. Even something as small as hearing the patter of rain from inside a dilapidated ship pulls you into Chornobyl’s wasteland. It’s familiar to anyone who’s played the original STALKER series (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/03/19/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl-review">Shadow of Chornobyl</a> in 2007, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/09/05/stalker-clear-sky-review">Clear Sky</a> in 2009, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/02/06/stalker-call-of-pripyat-review">Call of Pripyat</a> in 2010) and as a veteran of those games myself, it’s an odd comfort to be back in The Zone.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>STALKER 2 retains a lot of the design principles of the series – for better and worse.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The main story provides a throughline to follow, but it isn’t the kind of thing that’s going to light a fire under you in its early hours. Skif – our character – is set up and betrayed in the opening mission, which leads him down a rabbit hole that ropes in the scientific organization SIRCAA and the Zone’s de facto military, a group known as The Ward. I don’t always need a grand adventure or virtuous purpose, but it was a little underwhelming that many of the goals in the beginning boil down to finding a <em>guy </em>who knows where to find <em>another guy</em>, becoming a continuous chain of finding <em>more guys</em> in hopes of finally finding the <em>actual guy</em> you’re looking for. Fortunately, once STALKER 2 got off the ground it started weaving in the familiar themes seen in the previous games, such as finding the truth about mind-bending psi emissions, the risks with research in The Zone, and cultish groups clashing with governmental organizations. Then it started to pick up steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Games like STALKER are quite rare to see at this scale these days, and even 14 years since its last iteration, STALKER 2 retains a lot of the design principles of the series – for better and worse. It leans into mechanics we commonly see in hardcore survival games nowadays, putting you into situations where you must make deliberate decisions on how to engage enemies and which environments to explore. There’s gear wear that can cause malfunctions, high damage in combat so just a few hits can kill you, bleeding wounds if you survive that, hunger to keep at bay, radiation levels to hold down, limited inventory weight to manage, and constant looting in order to survive. It’s inelegant, though at times I mean that as a compliment because I admire how very little is streamlined. I started to see how its systems come together after enough poking and prodding and managed to find the type of friction I enjoy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like in a harsh world like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragons-dogma-2-review">Dragon’s Dogma 2</a>, there’s no easy fast travel around The Zone, so if you want to get from place to place quickly you need to find the right NPC and pay up. If you go on foot, you’re in for a long trek with rogue Stalkers, anomalies, and mutants who can stop you in your tracks. (Not going to lie: save scumming will stave off some of that potential frustration, and I’m not too proud to make use of it.) This isn’t an RPG in a gameplay sense either, so there are no progression systems or skills to unlock other than the constant hunt to find good gear, upgrade it at shops, and pack just enough items to survive while staying nimble. Side quests can bring in some much-needed cash or lead to rare loot, or they may not even pay off in a tangible way. However, there is sometimes an intrinsic value in the exploration of The Zone, even if only a handful of those side quests have actually been worthwhile.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat has bounced between being intense, high-stakes shootouts or unsatisfyingling unfair futility. The main difference between those two scenarios is in the bizarre behavior of the enemy AI. Regardless of the difficulty setting, enemies are often dumb as rocks, walking in nonsensical patterns while engaged and completely unaware of their surroundings. Yet their immediate pinpoint accuracy and near-perfect vision (even in pitch darkness) still make things tough, and not in ways that make sense. Erratic mutant movement is more annoying than it is challenging, and takes off a bit of the horror-ish edge that they sometimes instill. I’ve seen more believable and consistent enemy behavior from the old STALKER games, so it’s disappointing to see steps backward more than a decade later. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Solid gunplay picks up a lot of the slack in the combat’s faults.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are bright spots within those combat encounters, though. I’ve learned to work within the confines of the sporadic bad guys, always ready to patch up and heal to survive and take precise shots from smart positions. Sometimes fights break out from dialogue gone awry and enemies are very quick on the draw, and I just had to concede the fact that I would take massive damage if I survived at all. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">STALKER 2’s solid gunplay picks up a lot of the slack in its combat’s faults. Whipping around a decked-out assault rifle with a nice red dot sight to make headshots easy, or pumping shells into a mutant from a fully modded shotgun and slowing its charge with their impact had me looking forward to those high-stakes, kill-or-be-killed situations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Within those highs, however, is the frequent reminder that STALKER 2 isn’t in great technical shape. Even on a PC with an RTX 3080, a 13th-gen Core i7 CPU, 32GB of RAM, and an NVMe SSD, it chugs on modest settings. Playing with everything on low graphics options and balanced DLSS gives me similar frame drops and large-scale hiccups as it would on medium-high settings and higher quality DLSS, even if the baseline frame rate is <em>marginally</em> better (but still well below a consistent 60fps). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fact that poor technical performance on PC is the least of my worries says a lot about how STALKER 2 is in desperate need of patches. These problems include (but are not limited to) NPCs walking through walls, textures artifacting, sound effects and dialogue happening out of place, environmental details erratically popping in and out, or objects clipping through each other. Inoffensive, non-critical bugs can be whimsical in some sense – like when an enemy’s body cartwheels into the sky after being shot – and simply accounted for as unexplained phenomena as you focus on the tasks at hand, but the frequency and severity chipped away at my enthusiasm for STALKER 2, especially when it came to glitched quest objectives that wasted my time.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl Review - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard to say whether or not things will be patched by the time it’s released into the wild today, I just hope that the worst game-breaking bugs I encountered can be resolved in due time. During my playthrough, I once had an objective to meet with an NPC inside a building, only to find I could not interact with any of the doors to get in. After a minute of being in the area I was teleported inside the building, but there were no dialogue options that could progress the mission with the NPC in question. The only way to work around this was to go back to a save from four hours prior and make a different story decision so the proper triggers would initiate in subsequent quests. There have been other instances like this with sidequests, but those are less critical since I could just ignore them and move on if an objective didn’t trigger or change after completing what I was tasked with, but that’s an aggravating way to play a game. It’s bugs like that that truly keep STALKER 2 from really coming together. It feels as though it’s held together by duct tape – and given <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-delayed-again-this-time-by-2-months-so-the-dev-can-fix-more-unexpected-anomalies">the stories about its development</a>, it’s not hard to understand why.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are times when everything is working – or working well enough, at least – when STALKER 2 is a rare treat that scratches the same itch of those older PC games, where the onus was on you to figure out how to survive and thrive in an unforgiving place that doesn’t care about you. Considering that there’s so much more left to play, I still have hope that it’ll be somewhat smoother sailing ahead, because as I’ve gotten further in the main story, the more intriguing its dilemmas and combat encounters have become. So far, however, I’ve had to fight against STALKER 2 itself as much as I’ve had to fight against all the enemies and anomalies that litter The Zone. Sometimes it makes no damn sense; it compels me, though, and I’ll see this through to the end and get back to you with a final review as soon as I can.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
