            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/06/star-wars-outlaws-update-1-5-1-adds-dlss-4-and-better-pssr/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Star Wars Outlaws patch 1.5.1 has been released, fixing a couple of bugs and introducing the latest versions of DLSS and PSSR upscaling.</p>
<p>On PC, DLSS 4 has been added to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, supporting multi frame generation for the GeForce RTX 50 series, but also bringing a new transformer model to the table for all generations of RTX cards, improving the quality of the machine learning upscaling effort. Additionally, this transformer model also affects DLSS Ray Reconstruction to improve the fidelity of ray tracing in general, and can be used for super resolution and DLAA for anti-aliasing.</p>


<p>Over on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>, Star Wars Outlaws now supports a newer version of PSSR upscaling, hoping to address complaints about the image quality from around the PS5 Pro’s launch. While it was expected to be possible, this is the first time that we’ve publicly heard about Sony being able to upgrade the PSSR upscaling model on PS5 Pro, so this is definitely very interesting and could see improvements rolled out to other games, though it will likely require game updates as opposed to having Sony unilaterally update the model across the whole system.</p>
<p>Here’s the full patch notes for Star Wars Outlaws Title Update 1.5.1:</p>
<p><em>Star Wars Outlaws on PC now features DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation for GeForce RTX 50 series, which boosts FPS by using AI to generate up to three frames per traditionally rendered frame. DLSS 4 also introduces faster single Frame Generation with reduced memory usage for RTX 50 and 40 Series, and new transformer AI models for DLSS Ray Reconstruction, Super Resolution, and DLAA for all GeForce RTX GPUs, which enhances stability, lighting, and detail in motion.</em></p>

<p><strong>Streaming:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crashing issue on streaming platforms when travelling to Renpalli Station</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PC:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for NVIDIA series 5 GPUs</li>
</ul>
<p>PS5:</p>
<ul>
<li>PSSR has been updated to the latest version for PS5 Pro users</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All platforms:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where Kay could not dismount the speeder when on a steep incline</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where audio from overhead ships would be louder than expected</li>
</ul>
<p>On the whole we rather enjoyed the game (stealth sections and otherwise), with Gamoc saying our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/26/star-wars-outlaws-review/">Star Wars Outlaws review</a>, “Star Wars Outlaws is an open world scoundrel-’em-up that clearly builds on Ubisoft’s familiar format, but that’s not a bad thing. The rep system in particular is interesting, as the constant fluctuations belie any kind of loyalty you might show otherwise, but most importantly, this game lets you just be in the enduring Star Wars Universe. It’s not perfect, but stealing for crime syndicates, fighting the Empire, speeding across alien landscapes, and so much more is a dream come true.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/2k-reportedly-fires-project-ethos-studio-head-after-underwhelming-reveal.1102053/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/2k-project-ethos-studio-head-fired-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2K Games has reportedly fired Michael Condrey, the president of&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos&nbsp;</em>developer 31st Union, following what the publisher sees as a disappointing reveal for the game last year.</p>

<p>If you don't remember&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos</em>, I don't blame you. It's a roguelike hero shooter that was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/project-ethos-2k-roguelike-hero-shooter" rel="nofollow">announced by 2K back in October</a>, but it's been relatively quiet since then, and if this report is anything to go by, I guess we now know why.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/michael-condrey-projet-ethos-31st-union-2k-games-1851756173" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kotaku</a> (which cites "sources familiar with the studio"), Condrey was removed from his position as the studio head of 31st Union three days ago, but he'll remain as an advisor on the project, although what exactly that will entail is unclear.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/2k-games-project-ethos-shooting.jpg?itok=XceoEUKS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/2k-games-project-ethos-shooting.jpg?itok=uZqdKru4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Project Ethos&nbsp;</em>developer 31st Union's studio head has apparently been fired.</figcaption></figure><p>In a statement given to Kotaku, 2K commends Condrey's "dedication, passion, and work ethic", but says that he will be "transitioning his role in the short term to focus on advising on the future of&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos</em>".</p>

<p>The studio says it's still "very committed" to finding a "forward path" for&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos&nbsp;</em>"and the people and culture of the 31st Union studio", so it doesn't sound like the game will be canceled or the studio will be shut down, at least.</p>

<p>As Kotaku points out, however, Take-Two is set to announce its quarterly financial results later today, and it's entirely possible that the studio could make some kind of reference to&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos&nbsp;</em>and its future then.</p>

<p>Of course, at the moment, there's a much bigger prize in Take-Two's eyes, namely the impending release of&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025" rel="nofollow">still apparently set for this year</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grand-theft-auto-6-take-two.jpg?itok=r9oyPo9u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grand-theft-auto-6-take-two.jpg?itok=r8qCJkT4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>'s release is still on the cards for 2025.</figcaption></figure><p>If 2K's parent company Take-Two does cancel&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos&nbsp;</em>and shut down 31st Union, it wouldn't be the first time the company has done something like that.</p>

<p>Although it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-denies-roll7-intercept-closure" rel="nofollow">denied doing so</a>, Take-Two reportedly closed down two of its subsidiaries, namely&nbsp;<em>OlliOlli World&nbsp;</em>developer Roll7 and&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program 2&nbsp;</em>studio Intercept Games, last year.</p>

<p>Additionally, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-private-division-sale" rel="nofollow">sold its indie label Private Division</a> to a then-undisclosed buyer in November, with that buyer subsequently reported to be a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-annapurna-staff-private-division-ips" rel="nofollow">company made up of ex-Annapurna Interactive staffers</a>&nbsp;following mass resignations at that company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/annapurna-interactive-staff-resign-after-company-spin-off-talks-fail" rel="nofollow">in September</a>.</p>

<p>At any rate, for now, at least,&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos&nbsp;</em>remains in development and 31st Union remains an active studio. We'll have to wait and see how long that lasts. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/greenheart-necromancer-reinvents-the-idle-game-shows-how-to-rethink-predatory-mechanics<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content" data-testid="featured-image"><p><span>Image via Silverstring Media.</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1449230/Glitchhikers_The_Spaces_Between/">Glitchhikers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer Silverstring Media is back with another boundary-pushing game. This week the studio announced </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2127570/Greenheart_Necromancer/">Greenheart Necromancer</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, an "idle game" where players tend to a small balcony garden using the dark arts. Like many idle games, it's meant to be played over long periods of time, with players taking time away from their game and making an effort to come back and tend to their plant after time has passed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But unlike most idle games think </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>AdVenture Capitalist</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>AFK Arena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Idle Heroes</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the devs at Silverstring want to avoid the "predatory microtransactions and stress" built into the genre. As studio director Lucas J.W. Johnson and creative director Claris Cyarron explained to Game Developer in a recent chat, the game is meant to relax players and possibly help them manage their attention, rather than urging them and harvest resources as soon as their in-game timers are up.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How? Through two primary means: giving players reason to let timers run for ages without checking them, and creating a relaxing environment that takes the sting out of "failure." Or in words players would understand: it's to capture the experience of being a mediocre gardener, but having the power of botanical necromancy to back them up.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Greenheart Necromancer"><span>Greenheart Necromancer</span> wants you to walk away from the game</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Cyarron explained to Game Developer that development on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Greenheart Necromancer</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> started after an internal game jam, where the small team settled quickly on wanting to make a game about a "balcony garden," the same kinds they'd made in their own apartments during the COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020. She nodded to the plant looming over Johnson during our call, a lemon tree named "Linus" that unfortunately has bug infestation issues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She said the idea of turning the idle game genre on its head was an early part of the project—"flipping the script" on what they feel are "pernicious and problematic" game mechanics is part of the team's ethos.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But how exactly are idle games "pernicious and problematic?" Your mileage may vary on "problematic" (they're certainly not as compulsive as gambling, and don't risk players burning away their life savings), but the most successful ones do lure players' attention by juggling carrots and sticks that make them stare at timers ticking down the way a soufflé chef carefully watches their creation.</span></p><p>Image via Silverstring Media.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The pleasant feeling that comes with precisely managing those timers is usually drawn further and further out, encouraging players to either watch advertisements or purchase microtransactions to speed up timers. Combine that with the satisfying sound design, vibrations, and visual effects that have been A/B tested into oblivion, and you have a genre designed to extract as much time, attention, and money from players as possible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It very quickly preys on the dopamine loop of wanting to see the next thing happen, so you keep your eyes on [the game] longer than you probably should," said Cyarron.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's up for debate how "problematic" that is for the general public, but players who struggle with compulsive behaviors (particularly neurodivergent ones who struggle to focus or otherwise might hyperfixate on games) can see what should be a fun simulation game slowly turn into something that feels like an obligation or a chore (this writer has experienced this on multiple occasions and has now largely sworn off free-to-play mobile games).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And when games become chores, the fun fades away.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The hope, Cyarron and Johnson said, is that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Greenheart Necromancer</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> never feels like a chore. At best, they want it to be a "coworking app," something players can have running on another monitor or device, pumping out "chill beats" and showing their plants swaying in the wind.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="It's okay to let your plants die">It's okay to let your plants die</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the real world, gardening is a chore because if you don't keep up with your plants, they die. And most people don't get into gardening to kill plants. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Greenheart Necromancer</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, death is fine, because the player character is...well, a Necromancer. She's a "socially anxious" witch who, like many pandemic gardeners, doesn't know much about taking care of plants and struggles to keep them alive.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Luckily when you can bring life back from the dead, the sting of failure falls away.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But it's more than just about rolling back the clock. Johnson said that the team has been experimenting with creating progression paths that only open up when players let plants die, so walking away from the game for a few days while you're on a trip opens doors instead of resetting them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Rather than thinking of the 'down state' as a failure state, the down state is just another moment where the game is waiting for the player to input something without any sort of punishment," added Cyarron.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can also see in the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/hxuAF_mzQyY?si=g6Hf83e2WQ6pvXuQ">announcement trailer</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> how the team is using slower—though still pleasant—animations to draw out each interaction with the plant, a contrast from the animations and visual effects in traditional idle games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The result is a game loop meant to sit alongside other parts of the player's life, rather than take time away from it—though that sense of "sitting alongside" will be different for different players. Cyarron explained she has Attention-Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and her ability to focus on tasks manifests differently than that of her coworkers (some who might struggle more, others who struggle less).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Being able to accommodate the many ways players manage their time and attention will be a key test for whether </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Greenheart Necromancer</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> can truly break ground in the idle game format.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The attention economy comes for us all">The attention economy comes for us all</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's definitely something in the air when it comes to conversations about "the attention economy." You've probably heard the line "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/curtsteinhorst/2024/02/06/lost-in-the-scroll-the-hidden-impact-of-the-attention-economy/">everything competes with TikTok</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">," a reference to how the short-form video app has been so finely tuned to keep users scrolling from video to video, eating up time they could be spending on anything else. As Allison Stanger noted in a piece at </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/01/difference-between-tiktok-and-free-expression/681375/">The Atlantic</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, "platforms such as TikTok and its American-founded counterparts Facebook, Instagram, and X aren’t mere communication channels; they’re sophisticated artificial-intelligence systems that shape, amplify, and suppress human expression based on proprietary algorithms optimized for engagement and data collection,"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Attention is the substance of life," TV host Chris Hayes writes in his new book </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://sirenscallbook.com/">The Siren's Call</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a deep dive into how modern technology and the economics of the internet have shaped our behaviors and politics. "Increasingly it feels as if our experience is something we don't fully agree to, and the ubiquity of that sensation represents a kind of rupture. Our dominion over our own minds has been punctured. Our inner lives have been transformed in utterly unprecedented fashion. That's true in just about every country and culture on earth."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So while attention-grabbing idle games are the most useful reference point for the design sensibilities of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Greenheart Necromancer</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, its makers acknowledge they aren't working in a vacuum, and that there's renewed focus on how games of all types eat up the time and money of players. "Think of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stardew Valley</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Johnson said, noting he loves using as an example because it's game he loves. In theory, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stardew Valley</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a cozy game about getting out of busy city life and starting a calmer life out on the farm. "But the game design has this intrinsic need [for the player] to be as efficient as possible."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's because when players start out, they're tasked with pleasing the spirit of their dead grandfather at the start of the third in-game year. To make sure the ghost is happy, players have to quickly learn the efficiencies of running their farm, incentivizing the creation of Rube-Goldberg machines that pump out milk, eggs, and produce at lightning speed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a tough line to walk critiquing that feature—after all, that standard (and other milestones throughout the game) is the challenge moving players forward and helping them learn the systems. Without it, millions of players wouldn't have fallen in love with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stardew Valley</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The conversation goes broader though. Cyarron pointed out that players are </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/c6vpzs/anybody_else_kind_of_tired_of_open_world_games/?rdt=49893">expressing exhaustion with huge open world RPGs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">—they may want to spend time in that game world or otherwise enjoy the experience, but the idea of hours and hours of devoted attention to see all the great work the developers put into the game is losing its shine for some folks.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I'm glad the player base is starting to have conversations about how many hours becomes 'disrespectful,'" Cyarron said. "We've all had experiences of going into a game world and then bringing something out from it with us that we carry for the rest of our lives."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That's one of the promises of games, that's why I love this shit. You can definitely have that in those [open world games], but that's not the only way games can have that impact...there's got to be ways that just aren't about dumping all of these hours and also your attention."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Whether you agree or disagree with the Silverstring team's thinking about attention-grabbing gameplay mechanics, their work on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Greenheart Necromancer</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> shows one thing: there's plenty of room to explore in genres ruled by free-to-play giants. Maybe your next great game will "flip the script" on a game genre or mechanic you don't enjoy.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

			<p>A new Star Wars Outlaws update is now live on PC and consoles, introducing support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 on PC and a PlayStation 5 Pro-specific improvement, among other small fixes.</p>
<p>Title Update 1.5.1, which is around 3 GB big on PC and Xbox consoles and 1.93 GB big on PlayStation 5, introduces NVIDIA DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation support on PC, allowing owners of any NVIDIA RTX graphics card to enjoy better image quality with the new Transformer model and RTX 50 series graphics card owners to boost FPS by using AI to generate up to three frames per traditionally rendered frame.</p>
<p>The new Star Wars Outlaws title update also brings, as mentioned above, a PlayStation 5 Pro-specific improvement, updating the PSSR upscaler to the latest version, which addresses some image quality issues that were very clearly noticeable in the previous version of the game. Additionally, the update fixes a few other small issues on every platform, as detailed in the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/it-it/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/1O5273Z4vy6zpjNxkW4htN">official patch notes.</a></p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws launched last year in a far from optimal state, but developer Ubisoft Massive has consistently improved the game, fixing the biggest issues and tweaking the gameplay as needed. In a previous update, the developer also removed some divisive <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-star-wars-outlaws-patch-drops-forced-stealth-missions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stealth missions to </a>enhance the experience.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

Its budget was a quarter of what anybody else would spend.” </p><p>Whether <em>Space Marine 2</em> proves to be the exception or the new rule remains to be seen. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-shawn-layden-aa-space-marine-2-fortnite-1851675017&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-shawn-layden-aa-space-marine-2-fortnite-1851675017">Others warn</a></span> that the mid-level space it’s playing in is essentially dead for all but the biggest standouts, swallowed up by <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Call of Duty</em>, and other mega-hits that consume an increasing amount of money and time from a limited number of players.

                <p>Despite a decade of anticipation from Dragon Age fans, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-had-far-fewer-players-than-ea-expected/1100-6528964/" data-ref-id="1100-6528964">EA confirmed</a> that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> failed to meet the company's financial expectations <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-reacts-to-dragon-age-the-veilguard-coming-up-short-and-explains-what-happened/1100-6529252/" data-ref-id="1100-6529252">during a recent earnings call</a>. EA CEO Andrew Wilson said that The Veilguard's underperformance is a reflection of the "evolving industry landscape." EA's CFO Stuart Canfield went one step further <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Q3-FY25-Earnings-Call-Transcript-FINAL.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">and seemed to suggest</a> that The Veilguard would have performed better if it was a live-service game. Now, a former Dragon Age developer has shared his response to EA.</p><p>Ex-Dragon Age creative director Mike Laidlaw posted his thoughts on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikelaidlaw.bsky.social/post/3lhhb477frc2h" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a>, where he facetiously asked "Who'd be silly enough to demand something like that? ...Twice." At one point during its development, The Veilguard <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-boss-discusses-ditching-live-service-and-multiplayer-focus-for-the-veilguard/1100-6527540/" data-ref-id="1100-6527540">was going to be a live-service title</a> before the decision was made to reverse course and go back to a single-player experience.</p><p>"Look, I'm not a fancy CEO guy," wrote Laidlaw. "But if someone said to me 'The key to this successful single-player IP's success is to make it purely a multiplayer game. No, not a spin-off: fundamentally change the DNA of what people loved about the core game,' to me, I'd probably, like, quit that job or something."</p><p>Laidlaw actually did quit his job at BioWare, and he went on to found an indie studio called Yellow Brick Games, which recently released its first game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/eternal-strands-review-magic-weaver/1900-6418331/" data-ref-id="1900-6418331">Eternal Strands</a>.</p><p>If EA executives really believe that live-service would have made The Veilguard a success, it calls into question whether the company will make Mass Effect 5 into a live-service experience. BioWare was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-dragon-age-the-veilguard-comes-up-short-bioware-undergoes-changes/1100-6529105/" data-ref-id="1100-6529105">hit with a number of layoffs</a> after The Veilguard's poor performance, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioware-reportedly-has-fewer-than-100-staff-members-left/1100-6529194/" data-ref-id="1100-6529194">now reportedly has less than 100 devs left</a> to work on the next Mass Effect.</p>

                <p>The final <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2 </a>Episode, Heresy, is now live, bringing with it plenty of new additions. There have been tweaks to the subclasses, meaning that crafting the best <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-episode-heresy-best-builds-for-hunter-warlock-and-titan/1100-6529242/" data-ref-id="1100-6529242">Destiny 2 builds</a> has changed all over again. What use is a great build without some fun new weapons to wield alongside it, though? We’ve got a full list of all of the new guns added to Destiny 2 for Heresy.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Destiny 2 Heresy Exotics</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4439788-destiny-2-heresy-lodestar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439788" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4439788-destiny-2-heresy-lodestar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439788"></a><figcaption>Lodestar Exotic trace rifle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4439788-destiny-2-heresy-lodestar.jpg"></figure><h3>Lodestar</h3><p dir="ltr">This Arc Exotic Trace Rifle fires a low-intensity Starlight Beam and boasts enhanced stability and accuracy. Dealing Arc damage from any source will align the weapon’s battery coils. When alignment is complete, press your alternate weapon action button to disengage the safety. This will enable a hip-fired Starlight Beam to apply Jolt to any targets damaged for a short time. You can slow the rate at which the battery drains by aiming down the weapon’s sights. This new Exotic can be obtained in the season pass, and its Arc energy means it’s a perfect pairing for the Arc adjustments that have been made for all classes.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Finality’s Auger</h3><p dir="ltr">This Solar Linear Fusion Rifle is the Exotic you can get from completing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-new-dungeon-sundered-doctrine-release-date-race-details-and-everything-to-know/1100-6528872/" data-ref-id="1100-6528872">Sundered Doctrine dungeon</a>. Its Ruinscribe’s Forge perk allows you to hold your alternate weapon action button to fire a special projectile that will deploy a Ruinscribe Turret. This costs three ammo to fire, and can be aimed towards the sky to provide the best and clearest sightlines for the turret. When deployed, the turret will automatically shoot at nearby enemies. While the turret is deployed, Finality’s Auger can paint targets with its laser projectiles, making the turret prioritize those painted targets, firing more powerful rounds at them. You can use the alternate weapon action button to trigger the laser fire mode on or off. While this weapon isn't yet viewable in-game, you can expect to see it following the first completion of the new dungeon.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4439789-destiny-2-heresy-barrow-dyad.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439789" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4439789-destiny-2-heresy-barrow-dyad.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439789"></a><figcaption>Barrow-Dyad Exotic submachine gun</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4439789-destiny-2-heresy-barrow-dyad.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Barrow-Dyad</h3><p dir="ltr">One of the most interesting-looking weapons in Destiny 2 to date, not much is yet known about Barrow-Dyad. It was revealed during the Heresy broadcast on Bungie’s channels, and seems to be an overpowered Strand SMG. Its intrinsic perk, Panic Response, means that it generates Blight by dealing damage to enemies. When not firing, Blight depletes, and the magazine is refilled automatically. Reloading manually will convert the stored Blight into Blighted Seekers, which hunt down enemies and deal Strand damage when bouncing between multiple foes. Taken Divergence, another of Barrow-Dyad’s perks, grants large amounts of Blight if you hit three or more targets in rapid succession. While it’s not yet known how you grab this weapon, we’d place our bets on it making an appearance during one of Heresy’s Exotic missions.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4439792-destiny-2-heresy-weapons.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439792" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4439792-destiny-2-heresy-weapons.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439792"></a><figcaption>The Destiny 2 Heresy seasonal weapons</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4439792-destiny-2-heresy-weapons.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr"><span>Destiny 2 Heresy seasonal weapons</span></h2><p dir="ltr">There are four new weapons available to get through Heresy Act 1’s seasonal activity, The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-nether-activity-explained-and-how-to-get-secret-loot/1100-6529277/" data-ref-id="1100-6529277">Nether</a>.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Adamantite</h3><p dir="ltr">Adamantite is a Strand Auto Rifle capable of healing allies and injuring enemies. Dealing damage to targets will build a restorative charge that can be deployed at an ally to heal them by hip firing. Rapid healing will also increase the weapon damage of your ally, and spawn additional Unraveling projectiles that will seek out and injure nearby foes.</p><p dir="ltr">In its first perk slot it can roll with:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Reciprocity</li><li dir="ltr">Slice</li><li dir="ltr">Unrelenting</li><li dir="ltr">Subsistence</li><li dir="ltr">Ensemble</li><li dir="ltr">Demolitionist</li><li dir="ltr">Pugilist</li></ul><p dir="ltr">In its second perk slot it can roll with:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Elemental Honing</li><li dir="ltr">Hatchling</li><li dir="ltr">Circle of Life</li><li dir="ltr">Tear</li><li dir="ltr">Attrition Orbs</li><li dir="ltr">Frenzy</li><li dir="ltr">Kill Clip</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">Psychopomp</h3><p dir="ltr">One of the catchier names of the new weapons, Psychopomp is an Arc Grenade Launcher with burst-fire projectiles. Each one creates a lingering pool on impact that deals damage over time--think Witherhoard, but without taking up an Exotic weapon slot. In this way, it's reminiscent of Lost Signal which behaves similarly, and was added during Episode: Echoes. In its first perk slot it can roll with:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Envious Arsenal</li><li dir="ltr">Eddy Current</li><li dir="ltr">Ambitious Assassin</li><li dir="ltr">Feeding Frenzy</li><li dir="ltr">Pugilist</li><li dir="ltr">Stats for All</li><li dir="ltr">Threat Detector</li></ul><p dir="ltr">In its second perk slot it can roll with:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Harmony</li><li dir="ltr">Elemental Honing</li><li dir="ltr">Frenzy</li><li dir="ltr">Full Court</li><li dir="ltr">Rolling Storm</li><li dir="ltr">Demolitionist</li><li dir="ltr">Unrelenting</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">Watchful Eye</h3><p dir="ltr">Watchful Eye sits in the Power weapon slot, and is an Arc Machine Gun. It rolls with Aggressive Frame, meaning it has high damage at the sacrifice of high recoil. Aside from that, it seems to be your run-of-the-mill Destiny 2 Machine Gun.</p><p dir="ltr">In its first perk slot it can roll with:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Overflow</li><li dir="ltr">Dynamic Sway Reduction</li><li dir="ltr">Mulligan</li><li dir="ltr">Wellspring</li><li dir="ltr">Hip-Fire Grip</li><li dir="ltr">Field Prep</li><li dir="ltr">Eddy Current</li></ul><p dir="ltr">In its second perk slot it can roll with:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Jolting Feedback</li><li dir="ltr">Rolling Storm</li><li dir="ltr">Killing Tally</li><li dir="ltr">Elemental Honing</li><li dir="ltr">Surrounded</li><li dir="ltr">Target Lock</li><li dir="ltr">Sword Logic</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">Abyssal Edge</h3><p dir="ltr">Abyssal Edge is a Strand Sword that has the Wave Sword Frame intrinsic perk. This means its heavy attack can deploy a shockwave to uppercut and launch you into the air.

            <p>Roblox shares have dropped by 20 percent after the platform's reported daily active users fell short of analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>For the fourth quarter (ending 31st December), the number of daily active users fell by four percent to 85.3 million compared to the previous quarter, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-06/roblox-shares-plummet-after-miss-on-daily-active-users-bookings?srnd=undefined&amp;embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a> has reported. Wall Street analysts had forecasted 88.4 million. Overall player engagement also declined by 9.7 percent in the same period to 18.7bn hours.</p>
<p>Bookings, the company's measure of sales, totalled $1.36bn (£1.09bn), also falling shy of its forecast of $1.37bn(£1.1bn).</p>

<p>In an earnings call, Roblox CFO Mike Guthrie noted growth in Eastern Europe was "quite a bit slower" than anticipated, owing to a ban of the platform in Türkiye over child safety concerns.</p>
<p>That ban took place in August last year, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-responds-to-platform-ban-in-turkiye">Roblox responding at the time</a>: "We respect the laws and regulations in countries where we operate and share local lawmakers' commitment to children. We look forward to working together to ensure Roblox is back online in Türkiye as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Now, Guthrie has stated this last quarter was "the first full quarter where Türkiye has been off".</p>
<p>On a more positive note, in this quarter Roblox shared a record $281m with its game developers. CEO David Baszucki said in the earnings call this reflected the company's commitment to paying creators.</p>
<p>Back in 2021, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-exploiting-young-game-developers-new-investigation-reports">report by People Make Games</a> accused Roblox of exploiting children as young developers. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-studio-boss-children-making-money-on-the-platform-isnt-exploitation-its-a-gift">Roblox Studio head Stefano Corazza further discussed this with Eurogamer</a> last year, with the company later clarifying it does not hire minors.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> will get an official prequel story, fittingly told by a tie-in manga series. 
</p>
<p>
But rather than simply adapting the story of Ubisoft's upcoming feudal Japan stabathon, the series will instead be set some time prior.
</p>
<p>
The manga's first slice will be available in Japan alongside Shadows itself, when it arrives on 20th March. Elsewhere in the world, however, we'll have to wait a little longer.
</p>
<p>
"Follow the story of a young Assassin apprentice, as she fights against the growing presence of the Templars order in Japan," reads Ubisoft's description of the manga series. "Available in Japan at the launch of the game and later elsewhere."
</p>
<p>
Cover art for the first issue shows a young female Assassin wielding a sword as well as the iconic Hidden Blade. Is this Naoe, the shinobi co-protagonist of Shadows itself? I'm not sure. 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AssassinsCreedShadows?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AssassinsCreedShadows</a> will get its own manga!</p><p>Discover the official prequel of the game. Follow the story a young Assassin apprentice, as she fights against the growing presence of the Templars order in Japan.</p><p>Available in Japan at the launch of the game and later elsewhere. <a href="https://t.co/TLn6DyOVB7">pic.twitter.com/TLn6DyOVB7</a></p></div>— Assassin's Creed (@assassinscreed) <a href="https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1887426010427089267?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 6, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
For starters, the moment that Naoe obtains the Hidden Blade for the first time is actually shown early on in Assassin's Creed Shadows itself - meaning she likely isn't the menacing looking Assassin shown here. Beyond that,  its opening sequences - which Eurogamer has now played - seem to indicate Naoe isn't yet versed in who either of the Assassins or the Templars are.
</p>
<p>
So, this looks to be an entirely different protagonist entirely - unless Ubisoft has some other kind of time-wimey shenanigans going on.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-spoilers-splurged-on-adult-cartoon-website">spoilers for the upcoming Assassin's Creed Shadows popped up online</a> after the game's unreleased artbook was leaked via an adult cartoon website.
</p>
<p>
"Shadows looks to be very much on track to become that feudal Japanese fantasy we've long been hankering for," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">Eurogamer's Assassin's Creed Shadows hands-on preview</a>. "If Ubisoft can stick the landing on this one, it will be worth the extended wait."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bandai-namco-staff-count-falls-by-100<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The staff count at&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>publisher Bandai Namco has fallen by over 100 in the last ten months, a new report has revealed.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/bandai-namco-studios-staff-silently-reduced-by-over-100-people-japan-pension-service-database-shows/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>, the Japanese online pension registry, which shows how many employees business have enrolled, shows a diminished number of staff in February when compared to April 2024.</p>

<p>Automaton says that the register showed Bandai Namco employed 1,294 people in April 2024, but that this number had fallen to 1,177 as of the last update, which took place on February 4th. That represents a drop of 117 people.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bandai-namco-staff-count-falls-unknown-9-awakening.jpg?itok=5yVeWH-J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bandai-namco-staff-count-falls-unknown-9-awakening.jpg?itok=ogKop7Ra 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's fair to say not every recent Bandai Namco game has been a success.</figcaption></figure><p>Bandai Namco doesn't seem to have publicly announced these layoffs, although recently,&nbsp;<em>Unknown 9: Awakening&nbsp;</em>developer Reflector Entertainment, a subsidiary of Bandai Namco, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unknown-9-awakening-layoffs-cancellation-reflector" rel="nofollow">revealed it would lay off</a> an unknown (no pun intended) number of staff.</p>

<p>As Automaton points out, a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-15/bandai-namco-begins-to-cut-headcount-after-culling-game-titles" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>&nbsp;in October alleged that Bandai Namco staff were essentially being coerced to leave the company voluntarily through the use of "oidashi beya", or "banishment rooms".</p>

<p>Employees were allegedly placed in these rooms with no real tasks to complete, effectively pressuring them into leaving the company and circumventing what Bloomberg calls "some of the world's strictest labor protection laws".</p>

<p>Bandai Namco itself denied those reports, and the reduction in headcount at the studio naturally doesn't provide any kind of evidence that oidashi beya were being used, but it does look like the studio underwent a fairly significant staff drop between April and February.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-bandai-namco.jpg?itok=CPbVS1Pf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-bandai-namco.jpg?itok=mYs-zAVA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bandai Namco is gearing up to release&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>this year.</figcaption></figure><p>It's also worth noting that since this staff reduction hasn't been officially announced, it might not even technically be correct to call them "layoffs", since some staff may have left voluntarily or retired.</p>

<p>This report also comes after Bandai Namco released its <a href="https://www.bandainamco.co.jp/files/ir/financialstatements/pdf/20250205_en_Result.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial statement</a> for the nine-month period between April and December 2024, which shows growth in both profit and sales for the company.</p>

<p>That boost is, according to Bandai Namco, attributable in part to things like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-5m" rel="nofollow">"massive success"</a> of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>, as well as strong sales for both&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">Elden Ring</a>&nbsp;</em>and its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales" rel="nofollow">DLC&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a>.</p>

<p>The VALORANT Esports division of Riot Games announced today that Sony gaming gear brand INZONE will operate as a primary sponsor for the VCT EMEA league through the end of 2026. INZONE branded monitors will be primary display used at the Riot Games Arena in Berlin.</p>



<hr>



<p>Officially, INZONE will act as a “Main Partner and the Official Gaming Display Partner” for the VCT EMEA league. INZONE is no stranger to VALORANT sponsorship: the brand already sponsors the use of its headsets in the VCT. Two prominent organizations in Fnatic and ZETA DIVISION also have pre-existing sponsorship deals with the company. INZONE says Fnatic even helped design the monitor used on stage, which features a unique picture mode optimized for VALORANT.”</p>



<p>As part of the sponsorship deal, INZONE will put INZONE M10S OLED monitors in “coach rooms, practice areas, and co-stream rooms,” per the official announcement. They will also be highlighted at the “1v1 station in the fan zone” during match days. INZONE branding and advertisements have already been featured on the broadcasts, alongside other sponsors PaysafeCard and Red Bull.</p>



<p>While the addition of INZONE as a main sponsor is a welcome addition to VALORANT Esports and Riot Games, many viewers are curious to see if and when gambling sponsors are eventually implemented. This past December, Riot confirmed to Insider Gaming that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-policy-change-betting-sponsorships/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teams in Americas and EMEA would be allowed to “explore” partnerships with Riot approved betting platforms</a>. At the time, Riot stated that no betting brands would appear on broadcasts or socials: “Riot-owned channels will stay betting-free.” But based on the success of betting partnerships with teams, Riot could easily change the rules. Back in 2021, after barring TSM from using cryptocurrency exchange partner FTX in their name, Riot themselves <a href="https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/sources-lcs-lands-seven-year-ftx-sponsorship-deal-as-first-crypto-exchange-partner-of-any-riot-league" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">landed a seven year sponsorship deal</a> between the LCS and FTX.</p>

            <p>
Excellent indie adventure Dungeons of Hinterberg will belatedly launch on PlayStation next month.
</p>
<p>
A PS5 version will become available on 13th March, after previously arriving for PC and Xbox Series X/S last summer.
</p>
<p>
This new version will also include a "new, secret bonus episode", publisher Curve Games said today - though details of what exactly this will be remain under-wraps. Presumably, the PC and Xbox versions will get this addition via a free update too.

<p>
If you're yet to try Dungeons of Hinterberg, it's an enjoyable Zelda-inspired adventure that splits its time between exploration and combat in various Alpine biomes, breezy dungeons filled with monsters and puzzle-solving, and then a social side set within a nearby town full of residents to befriend and side-quests to take on.
</p>
<p>
"Combat and RPG progression get an ingenious social twist in this disarming slice of fantasy," our Chris Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-of-hinterberg-review">Eurogamer's Dungeons of Hinterberg review</a>, reserving particular praise for the game's overall narrative.
</p>
<p>
"The protagonist's story hinges on burnout, but also the question of how one should spend their time and what they should value," Donlan wrote. "The story that unravels in the village, meanwhile, slowly starts to blur the distinctions the game has been careful to build up, touching on everything from the cost of tourism to the question of authenticity. It's gripping stuff."
</p>
<p>
"If you play games for escapism, there are few this year that did it better," Chris Tapsell added, recommending Dungeons of Hinterberg in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-50-best-games-of-2024-ranked">Eurogamer's best games of 2024</a>. "It's a dreamy, warm-hearted, timely and deeply welcome retreat."

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bloodborne-psx-demake-taken-down-by-sony-dmca.1101924/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-psx-demake-dmca-sony<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A fanmade&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>demake that reimagined the PS4 action RPG as a PS1 game has been hit with a Sony DMCA notice, meaning it's no longer available for download.</p>

<p>The aptly-named&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne PSX&nbsp;</em>(using the console's early PlayStation X codename) was previously available on Itch.io, but a <a href="https://itch.io/takedowns/1370201" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">takedown</a>&nbsp;was issued by Sony yesterday, and the game's <a href="https://b0tster.itch.io/bbpsx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">page</a> now simply leads to a single line of text stating its files have been "suspended for copyright or trademark claim".</p>

<p>This is the second&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>-related DMCA notice Sony has issued in a week. Last Friday, modder Lance McDonald revealed he'd received a DMCA instructing him to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-60fps-patch-dmca" rel="nofollow">take down his 60fps patch</a> for the game, an instruction with which he quickly complied.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodborne-psx-demake-dmca-lantern.jpg?itok=WgvfGR1F 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodborne-psx-demake-dmca-lantern.jpg?itok=e4SISVv_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lilith Walther's&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne PSX&nbsp;</em>demake is no longer available to download thanks to a DMCA.</figcaption></figure><p>These DMCA notices have sparked speculation that Sony could be about to announce its own official&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remaster; after all, there's got to be a reason Sony is suddenly taking notice of&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>-related fan projects online, right?</p>

<p>Well...not necessarily. This isn't the first time Walther has run afoul of Sony with regards to&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>fan projects; last year, she was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightmare-kart-bloodborne-kart-release-date" rel="nofollow">told by Sony</a> that she needed to scrub the&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>branding from racer&nbsp;<em>Nightmare Kart&nbsp;</em>and release it as its own thing.</p>

<p>Of course, it's possible that was also part of Sony's plans to release a&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remaster, but many months have passed between then and now, and no&nbsp;remaster or remake of the game was revealed in the interim.</p>

<p>It's entirely possible that this DMCA, as well as the one aimed at McDonald, just represents Sony's lawyers suddenly waking up and realizing they need to look busy, but as a huge&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>fan myself, I understand the need for hope.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodborne-kart-nightmare-kart.jpg?itok=SQI8iow2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodborne-kart-nightmare-kart.jpg?itok=1dIYdGt1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Nightmare Kart&nbsp;</em>was once known as&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne Kart&nbsp;</em>before Sony got involved.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Bloodborne</em>'s age and relatively poor performance on PS4 have resulted in repeated calls for a remaster or remake over the years, but Sony has yet to heed those calls.</p>

<p>However, a State of Play presentation is rumored to be landing next week, as <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1885748440132456877" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">hinted at</a> by Switch 2 date leaker NateTheHate. It's possible that Sony intends to reveal its own&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remaster during that presentation, and that that's the reason behind the increased DMCA frequency.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see. In the meantime, you can still check out the original&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/bloodborne/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS4</a> (and PS5 via backwards compatibility).</p>

After flying off from Earth following his brutal pummeling of his son and the world finding out he was a genocidal maniac looking to conquer them to continue the Viltrumite race at the end of Season 1, the show has largely been devoid of his enthralling mixture of superhero stoicism and brutal pragmatism. After the third episode of the current season, it’s clear his son Oliver (Lincoln Bodin) is ready to pick up that mantle, and Simmons is ready for it. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193781" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Top Five Anime Couples Who Never Got Together" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="223" data-playlist="193781,197298,197284" data-current="193781"><div><p>Top Five Anime Couples Who Never Got Together</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193781/193781_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193781/193781_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193781/193781_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193781/193781_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19239.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="f21e10ac63e9f4a566d32e835951aeda" data-recommend-id="image://f21e10ac63e9f4a566d32e835951aeda" data-format="jpg" data-width="1315" data-height="145" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kotaku Spoiler Warning banner" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kotaku Spoiler Warning banner" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="in-house-art" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f21e10ac63e9f4a566d32e835951aeda" data-recommend-id="image://f21e10ac63e9f4a566d32e835951aeda" data-format="jpg" data-width="1315" data-height="145" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kotaku Spoiler Warning banner" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At the end of this season’s third episode, entitled “You Want A Real Costume, Right?” the Mauler Twins (Kevin Michael Richardson) launched an EMP missile to destroy Earth’s communications network to incentivize people to pay to use their shielding system. While Invincible (Steven Yeun) darted to the sky to stop the missile from impacting, his younger brother, overly excited to use his newfound powers to fight evil, does battle with the pair of villains. Earlier in the episode, the show expertly displayed Oliver as a carefree child still figuring out how to fly, pestering his big brother to hang out and train him, and strutting around in his new superhero suit. Up until his duel with the Mauler Twins, we were made to believe Oliver’s superhero inexperience was simply an excuse for lightheartedness. We forgot for a second that Viltrumite blood still burns in his veins.</p><p>In a matter of seconds, Oliver kills one of the Mauler Twins by flying through his body. Before killing the second one, the blood-soaked preteen coldly says, “That’s what happens when you’re a bad guy.” His actions become more disturbing when he seems to revert back to childlike innocence, pleading that his murders were accidents. When we spoke with Simmons, even he couldn’t believe what his fake son had done.</p><p>“We get shocked and surprised by some of these plot developments as we read them before we put them down,” the actor said. “Oliver is a really cool new character that hopefully keeps people guessing.”</p><p>When asked if Oliver’s pragmatic reasoning for killing the bad guys was inherited from his father, Simmons slyly answered, “Nothing’s ever Omni-Man’s fault. Omni-Man is always innocent of any wrongdoings.” The sarcasm in his voice and smirk on his face told us all we needed to know. The child who wanted to honor his homicidal father by donning the name Omni-Kid earlier in the episode isn’t too far removed from his exiled father. But, him reverting back to a clueless child who claims to have accidentally killed two villains we all saw him murder with clear, cold intention means either his Viltrumite killer genes are (literal) sleeper cells that activate when someone disrupts his moral compass or Oliver knows he’s a killer at heart, but must act docile in order to ingratiate himself with the Earthlings he may one day conquer. </p><p>If this is only the third episode of what is already shaping up to be the best season of <em>Invincible</em>, we’re in for a hell of a ride. Now, let’s bring Omni-Man back from space jail immediately. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wizkids-baldurs-gate-iii-miniature-review-theres-something-off-about-that-ox<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After the incredible popularity of <em>Baldur's Gate III,</em> and with Wizkids returning to previous <em>D&amp;D 5e</em> expansions, it was only a matter of time until players could get their hands on a set of <em>Baldur's Gate</em> minis focusing on characters from the incredibly popular video game by Larian, as well as the <em>5e</em> adventure <em>Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus.</em></p>

<p>I received the <em>Icons of the Realms: Baldur's Gate III</em> Characters, the iconic party that adventures with your Tav, as well as eight of the Blind Boxes containing a mix of miniatures based on creatures you might see around<em> Baldur's Gate</em>, be part of the Descent into Avernus Adventure, or be important characters from Baldur's Gate III (including a suspicious looking Ox…).</p>

<h2>Icons of the Realms: <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> Characters</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-dd-baldurs-gate-iii-minis-bg3-party.jpg?itok=M7FEzcWS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-dd-baldurs-gate-iii-minis-bg3-party.jpg?itok=UcsL9NMU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The <em>Baldur's Gate III </em>Characters box comes with seven pre-painted miniatures highlighting the different BG3 party members along with Withers.</p>

<p>Each member of the party is sporting their iconic weapons; the large battle axe Karlach is holding against her body, Lae'zel holds her sword high above her head ready to strike, Shadowheart holding Selune's Spear Of Night out from her, and Astorion holding out one hand as if to invite you towards him while brandishing a dagger in the other.</p>

<p>For fans of Wyll he holds his sword outstretched as if mid-duel and is sporting the horns he can obtain early on for breaking his pact with his patron.</p>

<p>The outfits each character wears aligns with their promotional artwork meaning that even from a distance each is immediately recognizable and whether you want to purchase these minis to display or to throw the <em>BG3 </em>party in for a crossover at your own table you wont be disappointed.</p>

<h2>Adventures From <em>Baldur's Gate</em> Miniatures</h2>

<p>As with all Wizkids miniatures each blindbox has with it three Medium or Smaller miniatures and one Large miniature. There will always be some good multi-purpose stuff, while also ensuring you're going to get an impressive miniature to throw down at your table.</p>

<p>As I go through the different minis that I unboxed I'll break them out into generic <em>Baldur's Gate</em> creatures or those specific to Descent Into Avernus and those that fans of <em>Baldur's Gate III</em> will recognize.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-dd-baldurs-gate-iii-minis-bg-generic-small.jpg?itok=9wUflSGG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-dd-baldurs-gate-iii-minis-bg-generic-small.jpg?itok=NZp3WvAc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h3><em>Baldur's Gate</em> Miniatures</h3>

<p>For the more generic <em>Baldur's Gate</em> miniatures in the Small and Medium variety I opened:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Imp</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Intellect Devourer</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Goblin Novice and Goblin Sharpshooter</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Two Duergar</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Two Bugbear Assassins, and</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Doppelganger</li>
</ul><p>A thing I am always thankful for in the Blind Boxes are that there are a healthy number of standard enemies. Having a high-quality Wizkids miniature of a dragon is great for the few and far between times where that specific dragon will appear but the above listed minis could be used anywhere and everywhere.</p>

<p>The Goblins are of the yellow-skinned variety brandishing a club and a shortbow, allowing for visual differences (even if Novie and Sharpshooter don't exactly have a stat block outside of BG3).</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-dd-baldurs-gate-iii-minis-bg-generic-large.jpg?itok=e921JNbP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-dd-baldurs-gate-iii-minis-bg-generic-large.jpg?itok=TondPapL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Large generic <em>Baldur's Gate</em> miniatures I opened include:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Gnoll</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Warg</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Bear</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Minotaur</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Spectator, and</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Bulette</li>
</ul><p>Again a fantastic range of miniatures. Bears for a random forest encounter (maybe it's a Druid in disguise), Gnoll once the party has adventured a bit further, and then for some deadlier encounters you can break out the Spectator and Bulette.</p>

<p>The design of the Bulette is completely different from the once previously included in Sand and Stone. Unlike the previous one, which was partially exposing itself from the ground that it's burrowed into, the new Bulette miniature stands totally above ground, showing off it's metal top coat that glistens in the light. Underneath its fleshier stomach is exposed.</p>

<h3><em>Baldur's Gate III </em>Miniatures</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-dd-baldurs-gate-iii-minis-bg3-medium.jpg?itok=GAFTL6hq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-dd-baldurs-gate-iii-minis-bg3-medium.jpg?itok=fN9IjHHf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Of the miniatures that I got that were explicitly flavors of <em>Baldur's Gate III </em>for the range of Tiny to Medium sized creatures I opened:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Dark Justicar</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Fist of Bane</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Flaming Fist Soldier</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Githyanki</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Halsin</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Hollyphant</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Necromyte of Myrkul</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Omeluum</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Orin the Red</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Priestess Gut</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Reaper of Bhaal</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Sovreign Glut</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Zevlor</li>
</ul><p>For fans of the game there's plenty to be excited for from important named characters like Umeluum, Halsin, and Priestess Gut to the interesting enemies you'd encounter like the Flaming Fist Soldier.</p>

<p>I always enjoy when a character is posed in a way that allows you to understand who they are or what affinities they have. In this way Priestess Gut creating an arch of power over her head make it a really interesting piece for your table.</p>

<p>The Dark Justicar wears contrasting blacks with golden armor brandishing his sword and the Githyanki holds up a crossbow ready to strike. Putting so many of these characters together the theme of 'red' really does seem to show up a lot though.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-dd-baldurs-gate-iii-minis-bg3-large.jpg?itok=kM-uNREE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-dd-baldurs-gate-iii-minis-bg3-large.jpg?itok=0-ykApNz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The large <em>Baldur's Gate III </em>miniatures that I opened include:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Lump The Enlightened</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Shambling Mound</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Slayer of Bhaal</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Strange Ox</li>
</ul><p>I love how much of a strange mix of miniatures this is. Lump is great as an Ogre miniature but manages to also bring a smile as you remember the strange circumstance of an Ogre swallowing a Headband of Intellect. Likewise having the Strange Ox, that for all intents and purposes could be a simple Ox miniature, present in this collection brings back fond memories of strange conversations.</p>

<p>Taking a turn for the terrifying the Shambling Mount miniature here, while described generically has the same blueish light emanating from within like that of the Shadow-Cursed Shambling Mound. For something that is meant to be glowing blue I do wish they used a blue transparent plastic instead of just painting those areas blue.</p>

<p>The last of the giant minis was the Slayer of Bhaal, or simply a Slayer in <em>Baldur's Gate III.</em> This is one of those excellent miniatures that can be used for anything that you want to scare your players with. It looks fast, it can slice and dice, and will be able to easily throw your players around. A very nice and precise touch on close inspection is the almost orange glow from the eyes.</p>

<h2>Wizkids <em>Baldur's Gate III</em> Miniatures Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>While the blind boxes advertise both Adventures From <em>Baldur's Gate</em> and <em>Baldur's Gate III </em>this set is really there for the fans of <em>Baldur's Gate III.</em> Every miniature, even the generic ones, will be more aligned with the models that you'll be more than familiar with if you've played <em>Baldur's Gate III.</em></p>

<p>This sense of knowing is also extra fun when you'll pull these out in games to come and will get to be brought back to&nbsp;</p>

<p>First up, the Datavault is a new area on the Resilient. Completing in-game challenges will give you the chance to earn Research Data, which you can use to unlock information on elements of the game's world, as well as new cosmetics.</p>

<p>A new PvP map, Tomb, has also been introduced. The map is&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s smallest, but it utilizes "a different approach" to its brethren when it comes to design, so make sure to give it a look if you want a more unconventional PvP experience.</p>

<p>What's more, if the base challenge of&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s PvE modes wasn't enough for you, a new Absolute difficulty mode has been introduced that features "new, more diverse enemy packs" and limited resources to contend with.</p>
