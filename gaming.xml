            <p>I write this week's list of new PC games in a spirit of terror, for a strange man is at my window with a ladder. Has Santa Claus come early? Have Sony's goons found me at last, after swearing vengeance for that 8/10 I handed God Of War 3 as a cub reporter? Does the motion detector on the light over the apartment block door need fixing? There is no time to enquire and certainly no time to flee, for there are video games we must discuss.</p><!--more-->
<p>On Monday 5th August, a gentle start in the shape of RPG life sim <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2142790/Fields_of_Mistria/">Fields Of Mistria</a>.

On Wednesday 7th August, pied piper simulator <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/creatures-of-ava">Creatures Of Ava</a>.

<p>As ever, all of this is sponsored by the original Man in the Window, the Maw - an enveloping and esurient entity from realms beyond ken, always hungry for another helping of video game news, always threatening an interdimensional invasion if left unfed for too long.

            <p>HBO has released its first teaser for the second season of The Last of Us.</p>
<p>The teaser is short, but gives us a look at some returning and new faces coming to the second season. New faces include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-casts-kaitlyn-dever-as-abby-for-season-two">Kaitlyn Dever as Abby</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-adds-schitts-creek-star-catherine-ohara-to-its-cast">Catherine O'Hara's still to be named character</a> (although previous rumours suggested her character will be called Gail).</p>
<p>You can check out the teaser below, towards the end of HBO's latest sizzle reel. It starts at around the 01:15 mark. After the trailer, I will be breaking down a few bits I noticed, so <strong>please be aware of spoilers for The Last of Us Part 2 (the video game) below</strong>.</p>

<p>The first clip we see is panning down on a party scene, lit up by fairy lights. The back of a girl's head can be seen, as she watches out over the dance floor.</p>
<p>This is Bella Ramsey's Ellie, and the scene shown here is basically a carbon copy from that same moment in the game.</p>

<p>While the above footage is playing, we hear a woman's voice asking "Did you hurt her?", to which Pedro Pascal's Joel replies: "No." The trailer then pans to Ellie's scared arm, and her tattoo.</p>
<p>In the game, it is revealed that between the events of The Last of Us and The Last of Us Part 2, Ellie covers her bite mark (which she received in the shopping mall with her friend Riley during the series' DLC, Left Behind) first with a chemical burn and later, by getting her ex-girlfriend Cat to tattoo over the area.</p>
<p>The moment shared in HBO's teasers appears to be Ellie getting the tattoo, suggesting that we may meet Cat during the show's second season (or, this is just a brief flashback scene and Cat's hands may be all we get to see).</p>

<p>After seeing Ellie's arm, we get to see the lady who was speaking to Joel, and it's Catherine O'Hara's character. I previously wondered if O'Hara would play either a member of the WLF or a Seraphite, but she appears to be a Jackson resident given her seemingly close relationship with Joel.</p>
<p>O'Hara previously said she had filmed scenes with both Joel and Ellie, so I now wonder if she will try and act as a mediator between the two during the Jackson scenes (those who have played the game will know there is friction between Joel and Ellie after the events of Part 1).</p>
<p>My other theory is she is some kind of resident therapist that Jackson's community confides in. Her role in the series was previously said to be an all-new character, so that would fit. The first season did also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunners-discuss-joels-panic-attacks">address Joel's trauma and mental health</a>, so this could be the next evolution of his journey.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Right now, I am not exactly sure what is happening in this next scene. Ellie can be seen screaming as someone slightly off screen tries to hold her down on a bed of sorts.</p>
<p>First, I wondered if this was a traumatic dream Ellie was having, and she is picturing herself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunners-explain-joels-john-wick-moment-as-a-god-mode-power-up">inside the Firefly hospital unable to stop Joel from his killing spree</a>.</p>
<p>I then wondered if this was someone else pouring the chemicals on her bite scar, and Ellie screaming in pain. This would suggest that Ellie and Joel had confided in several other members of the Jackson community, though, so I am not sure how likely this is. Thoughts welcome!</p>

<p>We are back outside for the next brief clip, which shows a snowy landscape with a large walled structure - Jackson - being stormed by a large horde of running assailants. While we can't see their faces, it is fair to assume that this is a horde of infected runners.</p>
<p>The next clip show's Gabriel Luna's Tommy using his gun to shoot out into the snow, I assume at these very runners, defending Jackson. In the game, Jackson's residents regularly patrol the surrounding areas to defend the settlement from infected.</p>

<p>The next few clips are again brief, but we get our first official look at season two's Seraphites, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/isabela-merced-cast-as-dina-in-hbos-the-last-of-us-adaptation">Isabela Merced as Dina</a> and Jeffrey Wright, reprising his role as Isaac.</p>
<p>Previous images had leaked of Merced on set with Ramsey, as they filmed in Canada. An image of Wright also appeared online, and appeared to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-casts-jeffrey-wright-reprising-his-role-as-isaac">suggest we will be learning more about Isaac's backstory when season two airs</a>.</p>

<p>At last, we now get our first very quick glimpse of Dever's Abby. This image is again almost a carbon copy of the same moment in the game. We see Abby wearing a dark beanie hat fleeing from a swarm of infected.</p>
<p>She is on the cusp of being overcome by the swarm, with a wired fence being pressed down over her as she tries to crawl through the snow to safety.</p>

<p>The final few images from the teaser show a horseback ride in the snow (something we again see in the game).</p>
<p>We also see Ellie and Dina in a subway running from a clicker. I am going to suggest this represents The Last of Us Part 2's 'Tunnels' section, where the two make their way through train cars while fighting off enemies.</p>

<p>The final shot from the teaser shows Joel, a tear rolling down his cheek, telling O'Hara he saved Ellie. At the start of The Last of Us Part 2, Joel confides in his brother Tommy. He may well still do this in the series, as well, but I wonder if this tête-à-tête between Joel and O'Hara's character will be what opens the season. </p>
<p>The teaser then ends.</p>

<p>So, what do you think so far? I would have loved to see more of Abby, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-adds-danny-ramirez-tati-gabrielle">and the WLF</a>, but this really was just a teaser so I am sure we will see more of them in the coming months.</p>
<p>The second season of The Last of Us is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-now-confirmed-for-2025-release">due to air in 2025</a>. It will not cover the entirety of the second game, but will have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunners-promise-a-lot-more-infected-next-season">"a lot more infected" than in the first season</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Gavin Verhey’s Friday announcement of <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/announcing-mystery-booster-2">Mystery Booster 2</a> — the follow-up to one of 2019’s most sought-after products in the world of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/magic-the-gathering">Magic: The Gathering</a> (MTG) — came as a welcome surprise.</p>
<p>But what are Mystery Boosters, why are they so popular and are they coming to Magic Online or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mtg-arena">MTG Arena</a>?</p>
<h2><strong>What are MTG Mystery Boosters</strong></h2>
<p>The original Mystery Booster was released in 2019 as a way of playing purely random Magic. Each pack contains 15 cards from a pool of <a href="https://www.mtggoldfish.com/index/MB1#paper">1694 cards of equal rarity</a>.</p>


<p>That means you had equal chance to open a Mana Crypt or Rhystic Study as you did an Earth Elemental or Dead Reveller. Two of those cards are incredibly powerful (and expensive). Two of them are not.</p>
<p>But if you’re opening Mystery Booster, you’re not doing it for the monetary value — you’re either doing it to play purely random Magic or you’re doing it get your hands on one of those all new, sweet-looking Playtest Cards.</p>

<h2><strong>What are MTG Playtest Cards?</strong></h2>
<p>The brains behind Magic the Gathering test cards as they design them. Sometimes things get powered up or powered down. Sometimes they never see the light of day — they could be too powerful, too difficult to make work within the game’s rules or simply they’re just too silly.</p>
<p>The Mystery Booster Playtest Cards take this idea and brings it to the public to enjoy.</p>
<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmb2/13/stack-of-paperwork">Stack of Paperwork</a>, for example, changes the rules of the game to ‘put damage on the stack’ — a rule that was removed in 2010 to simplify the game and make certain decisions a lot more meaningful. Obviously, while this card will make the old guard laugh and look back with nostalgia, reintroducing that rule now would makes things a lot more difficult. As such, each Playtest Card comes with the following disclaimer at the bottom: “Test card — not for constructed play”.</p>
<p>But not all Playtest cards add wonky rules. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmb2/45/one-with-death">One with Death</a> simply kills you and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmb2/102/slivdrazi-monstrosity">Slivdrazi Monstrosity</a> is so powerful it would simply get immediately banned. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmb2/96/personal-decoy">Personal Decoy</a> would just be annoying to play against.</p>
<p>This theme continues in Mystery Booster 2, which bring a whole bunch of meme-y Playtest Cards for fans to enjoy. One new card even changes the rules on the spot so that you’re no longer playing best of three, but best of one.</p>

<p>It also brings white-border cards back and occasionally uses the Future Sight frame — treatments that different parts of the community will love.</p>

<p>The short answer is no.</p>
<p>The long answer is that there are a couple of issues holding Mystery Boosters back. First and foremost are the Playtest Cards. While they are great fun, their rule-bending nature means that while they’re perfectly intuitive to play in real life, the amount of coding required to get them to work properly on MTGO or Arena is probably just not worth the effort, as far as Wizards of the Coast (WotC) is concerned.</p>
<p>This is why we’ve never had the jokey ‘Un’ sets on either client. They’re great fun, but they fundamentally break the rules in ways that the game engine cannot cope with.</p>
<p>Since Playtest Cards are a big part of Mystery Boosters, putting everything expect those online would probably have people kicking off. But that’s not the only issue.</p>
<p>The second — and possibly bigger — issue is that WotC simply doesn’t want to put Mystery Boosters online.</p>
<p>WotC could conceivably add the boosters to MTGO without the Playtest Cards — since the set is all reprints, these cards are already all on the client. The issue is that these boosters were designed as convention-edition packs, to play in real life. They’re not even going to be available to buy in your local game store.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">MB2 is meant to be a special experience for players at conventions. These will be at cons of all types (MagicCon and more!) long term, like MB1. There will be lots of it!</p>
<p>As an extension of the con experience, they'll also be in Festival in a Box, available online. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wotcstaff?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#wotcstaff</a></p>
<p>— Gavin Verhey (@GavinVerhey) <a href="https://twitter.com/GavinVerhey/status/1819809131772969147?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>So while WotC could easily bring the cut-down booster to MTGO, it seems they just don’t want to.</p>
<p>As for Arena — a client with a much smaller, more controlled card pool — the idea of getting any sort of Mystery Booster is sadly a bridge too far.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xdefiant%E2%80%99s-grassroots-esports-scene-is-starting-to-develop.944670/</guid>

<p>Recently, a low-tier, grassroots esports league was revealed for XDefiant, Ubisoft’s all-new competitive FPS built around the company’s ecosystem of brands and franchises. This is one of the first such competitions to emerge, and while it’s relatively unassuming, it’s a bold step in the right direction, as there are predictions that XDefiant will one day host a thriving esports scene.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-next-generation">The Next Generation</h2>



<p>The ‘XDefiant HP League’ is being dubbed as EU and NA’s biggest XDefiant league, and soon, the European branch of the tournament will kick off. This news was broken first by <a href="https://esports-news.co.uk/2024/08/04/xdefiant-hp-league-launches/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Esports News UK</a>, with the site’s Dom Sacco sitting down with Ace, the owner of the HP League:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve built and designed this league for everyone, not just the players. I want to inspire greatness from the community and provide a platform for everyone to be able to thrive off – and start showcasing the beauty of amateur esports!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This full-fledged tournament boasts a board of casters and a production team, and it’s expected that the first EU portion of the competition will feature more than 64 teams spread across six divisions. It has been noted that the prize pool will exceed £10,000 ($12,000). </p>



<p>These grassroots tournaments are the bedrock of the esports scene for any game, as the only way to go from here is up. I caught up with Ubisoft at the recent BLAST R6 Manchester Major and learned that the official competitive scene for XDefiant won’t be launched until at least the second year of the game, as Ubisoft first needs to add a slew of features including spectator tools and a solid private and custom-based match system.</p>

<p>Another champion has been crowned at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh, with Alliance winning the Apex Legends category and securing the $600,000 grand prize. In an intense showdown that lasted more than seven hours, the teams competing in the Apex Legends tournament made history, playing a whopping <strong>thirteen games </strong>before the victor lifted the trophy.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-going-the-distance">Going the Distance</h2>



<p>The reason why the final stage in the Apex Legends tournament took seven hours sits with the competition’s structure. It’s a similar layout used in other battle royale-based events, and it requires the winning team to secure 60 points and <strong>then </strong>a win in a final match. It’s the same model that’s used in the World Series of Warzone.</p>



<p>Because of how this model works, teams can keep coming up to ‘match point’ as play progresses, and ultimately, you could have stacks of teams sitting on more than 60 points, all of which need that one final win to secure the trophy. This is what happened at the Esports World Cup, and it took a staggering <strong>thirteen matches </strong>before Alliance picked up the last win needed to grab the top spot.</p>



<p>By the time the dust had settled, Alliance sat on 112 points – only Team Falcons had more points, but Alliance had the fortune and skills to secure that all-important win first. As the final stage unravelled, underdog teams just kept proving the crowd wrong, pushing the series further beyond what seemed possible, breaking the record for the most matches in a LAN final <strong>ever</strong>.</p>



<p>Ultimately, it was the EU side of Alliance that secured the win in the thirteenth round, netting the 1,000 Club Championship Points and the lion’s share of the prize pool. </p>

<p>Team BDS has recovered from a crushing loss at the BLAST R6 Manchester Major to win the Rainbow Six Siege category of the Esports World Cup. In a dominant display, the team stormed through the competition to secure the top prize – a $750,000 bundle of cash and 1,000 Club Championship Points.</p>



<p>This was a well-deserved win – Team BDS played phenomenally during this entire tournament.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-vive-team-bds">Vive Team BDS</h2>



<p>Team BDS is represented by some of the all-time best Rainbow Six players. Leading the charge is Shaiiko, arguably the number-one player with the boldest profile in the competitive scene. Following a lengthy ban that ran from 2017 to 2019, Stéphane ‘Shaiiko’ Lebleu burst back into the landscape with a dominating focus. </p>



<p>Since re-appearing on the scene, Shaiiko has won Gamers8 <strong>twice</strong>, two Majors, and has picked up the top spot at 26 further tournaments, all of which have been with Team BDS.</p>



<p>This past weekend, Team BDS stormed through the group stage, decimating the likes of Team Cruelty and w7m to push forward into the playoffs. It was there that history was made, with Team BDS wiping out FaZe Clan, FURIA, and finally, w7m (again) to secure the trophy. </p>



<p>Now, we look to the unravelling esports schedule for Rainbow Six moving forward. In November, the BLAST R6 circuit moves to Montreal for another Major, and to kick off 2025, the Six Invitational lands in North America. There’s plenty to look out for as a Rainbow Six esports fan.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/someone-added-sliding-to-fallout-4-and-it%E2%80%99s-kind-of-brilliant.944661/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-4-sliding-enhanced-movement-mod/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>People often get creative when designing and developing Fallout 4 mods, but one of the latest and most recently popular mods is relatively mundane, but so well done. It’s called Enhanced Movement, and it was released on Nexus Mods by a modder called bp42s. This mod offers such a huge improvement in exchange for something so simple.</p>



<p>Enhanced Movement adds a few new mechanics, such as <strong>sliding</strong>, and it tweaks existing movement-based fundamentals to make everything feel more <strong>realistic</strong>. For instance, your player feels like they have weight after jumping from a height, their movement speed is adjusted if they run in a certain direction or manner, and stamina decreases when sneaking and swimming.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-simple-but-super">Simple but Super</h2>



<p>Enhanced Movement (dug up by <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-4/mod-movement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a>) is one of the most recent mods to his Nexus that I’d wholeheartedly recommend installing. It offers a sweet depth to the customisation of in-game movement mechanics that genuinely make Fallout 4 feel so much more intense and immersive. </p>



<p>Other mods do the same thing, such as introducing inertia and player weight, but Enhanced Movement feels much more comprehensive and fleshed out.</p>



<p>In the mod menu, you can tweak AP costs and debuffs, and you can switch on or off various animations and elements of the mod. It’s a run-of-the-mill thing in that respect, but it’s in live play that you feel the biggest differences. In the below walkthrough of the mod, you can see how well-animated and smooth sliding is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/86278?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in Fallout 4 with Enhanced Movement</a>:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>This isn’t bp42s’ first rodeo, though. On Nexus, this modder has released 47 different downloads ranging from a karma system to a mechanic that encourages <strong>fear </strong>in enemies when they see you wearing Power Armor. The Enhanced Movement mod is the latest in a very long line of top-tier contributions bp42s has made to the Fallout 4 ecosystem.</p>

<p>The first real teaser for The Last of Us season two has been revealed by HBO, showcasing a wild array of content coming in 2025. One of the most important things to note is that the clips show us a universe outside the games. Many were expecting The Last of Us season two to mimic 2020’s The Last of Us Part II, but that won’t happen, per the reveal. It seems the showrunners have pushed the boundaries of what we know to give us a little more meat on the bones.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-saved-her">‘I Saved Her’</h2>



<p>If the showrunners were planning on staying true to The Last of Us Part II, Pedro Pascal’s Joel Miller would be written out within the first episode, but it looks like they’re intent on going deeper with the second season of the award-winning series.</p>



<p>In the short clip published to social media, we see a series of shots that aren’t replicated in the game, such as Joel wrestling with his decision, Tommy defending Jackson against an onslaught, Isaac taking matters into his own hands, and Ellie being rushed into surgery (or so it seems). </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>We also get our first look at Kaitlyn Dever as Abby in a recognisable scene, plus we see Isabela Merced’s Dina and we see the Seraphites running through a dark forest. It’s unmistakably The Last of Us Part II but there’s a little more mixed in to keep things fresh.</p>



<p>This concept was alluded to by the showrunners and writers several months ago, with them stressing that they don’t necessarily need to follow a like-for-like path as they explore The Last of Us in television form.</p>

Become Kazuya Kinoshita, a worthless college student at a Tokyo university, and live the part-time job lifestyle on Enoshima with charming heroines Chizuru Mizuhara, Ruka Sarashina, Sumi Sakurasawa, and Mini Yaemori in this game-original story. Additionally, by viewing all endings, you will be able to witness Mami Nanami’s story.</p><p><strong>An Original Story Set in the Summer on the Island of Enoshima</strong></p><p><a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> an original love story that could have occurred during the third season of the TV anime. Kazuya Kinoshita gathered the funds to shoot a movie starring Chizuru Mizuhara via crowdfunding, but it turned out not enough! To make up for the insufficient funds, Kazuya Kinoshita stays on the island of Enoshima for the summer working part-time jobs with the four heroines. It will be impossible for something not to happen while under the same roof—Kazuya Kinoshita’s delusions are in full effect!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Each Heroine is Fully Voiced</strong></p><p>Each heroine is fully voiced by their same voice actor from the TV anime, allowing you to enjoy the game as if you were watching the show. This includes Chizuru Mizuhara (voiced by Sora Amamiya), Mami Nanami (voiced by Aoi Yuuki), Ruka Sarashina (voiced by Nao Touyama), Sumi Sakurasawa (voiced by Rie Takahashi), and Mini Yaemori (voiced by Yuu Serizawa). Additionally, the game features a game-original theme song called “Cider no Mukou” sung by the five heroines.</p><p><strong>Limited Edition Includes a Four-Disc Drama CD and Official Soundtrack</strong></p><p>The limited edition includes a four-disc drama CD and original soundtrack. The drama CD features four situations that recreate Kazuya Kinoshita’s delusions (maid, non-blood-related sister, newly-married life, and high school student), allowing you to experience fantasy situations as imagined by him. The soundtrack CD features over 30 tracks and totals at over two hours in length, and includes the game-original theme song “Cider no Mukou” sung by the five heroines.</p></blockquote><p>View the first screenshots and box art <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/gallery/rent-a-girlfriend-the-horizon-and-the-girl-in-the-swimsuit/august-4-2024/">at the gallery</a>.</p><h2><span>Screenshots</span></h2><div id="carousel_903460"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Nintendo's Q1 2025 <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/240802_2e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial report</a> has been released, and the numbers regarding hardware sales aren't too surprising overall. Nintendo Switch sales have decreased significantly, with 2024 being their lowest year. This quarter of the fiscal year, they sold 2.1 million Nintendo Switches between April 1 and June 30, a significant decrease of 46%.</p>
<p>Their total net sales are down by 46.5%, to 246.6 billion Yen, compared to 461.3 billion Yen during the first quarter of 2024's fiscal year. Their operating profit decreased by a significant 70.6%, with ordinary profit dipping by 55.3%. However, this most likely doesn't come as a surprise to most people.</p>
<p>With the Nintendo Switch being seven years old, it is not surprising that sales are starting to drop significantly. Both their dedicated video game platforms, mobile games, and IP-related income experienced severe drops. Consolidated hardware sales dropped by 46.4%, with mobile and other IP-related incomes dropping by 53.8%.</p>
<p>Nintendo acknowledges the overall drop in mobile and IP-related sales, saying it's "mainly due to the decrease in income from visual content related to The Super Mario Bros. Movie."</p>
<p>That said, they made a 42.8% profit on other sales, such as merchandise from official Nintendo stores and playing cards, which brought their sales up from 1.9 billion Yen to 2.8 billion Yen.</p>
<p>All of the Nintendo Switch models suffered a significant blow to sales. The original Nintendo Switch suffered the least with a drop of 18.4%, with&nbsp; <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-lite-oled/">Nintendo Switch Lite</a> sales dropping by 56.1% and Nintendo Switch OLED Model sales dropping by 46.3%</p>
<p>Looking at their software sales, two of their IPs were on top for selling over a million units. These two games were Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Luigi's Mansion 2 HD. One other title reached a million units, but it is not disclosed in the financial report as to which game that is.</p>
<p>Sales are drastically different from the previous fiscal year's first quarter. Last year saw the release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which also saw special edition Nintendo Switches released to celebrate the release. Alongside Zelda, The Super Mario Bros. Movie was released, which boosted sales massively.</p>
<p>Overall, the sell-through in this fiscal year is below the level of previous years. Despite that, sales for Princess Peach: Showtime! and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door remained stable. However, these two games combined don't match the amount of sell-through sales Nintendo made with The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Princess Peach: Showtime! and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door account for approximately half of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's sales.</p>
<p>Nintendo has a jam-packed year for game releases, so it's possible the next quarter of the fiscal year will be better for them, with games such as The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom and Super Mario Party Jamboree being released.</p>

        <p>"F*** it, I'm putting my clown makeup back on."</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Brace yourself, Half-Life fans – rumours of Half-Life 3 have been resurrected once again, this time originating from the unassuming resume of a voice actor.</p>
<p>There's a chance that by the time you read this,  Natasha Chandel's <a href="https://www.natashachandel.com/resume/">website</a> has already been, uh, revised, but right now, if you scroll down to the "voice over" section, you'll see reference "Project White Sands (video game)".</p>
<p>Chandel did not name the character(s) she provided voice work for, but the project is clearly marked as belonging to Valve.</p>

<p>As noted by the members of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ek3943/valve_is_working_on_a_title_under_the_codename/">Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit</a>, "white sands" is much more likely to pertain to Half-Life 3 than, say, Left 4 Dead 3, not least <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ek3943/comment/lghyf57/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">because</a> "White Sands is a park in New Mexico...

<p>Is this all-out proof? Nope. Sorry. But at the very least, it's proof Valve is possibly developing another game in addition to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-theres-leaked-footage-of-valves-new-game-deadlock">Deadlock</a>, and if it's <em>not</em> Half-Life-related, that is an extraordinarily cruel codename to use…</p>
<p>Court documents recently revealed detailed employment statistics for Valve, the company behind the ubiquitous PC storefront Steam, the Steam Deck handheld, and - yes, still - a team dedicated to game development.</p>
<p>Altogether, that's just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-is-massive-but-far-fewer-people-work-at-valve-than-you-might-think">371 people employed by Valve in 2021</a>, for a company believed to bring in around $6.5bn a year. EA, home to FIFA/FC, which also generates around $6.5bn annually, had 13,700 staff on the payroll this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
