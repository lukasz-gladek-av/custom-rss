            <p>Our former editor Katharine "Thorsbane" Castle has long since quit these turgid shores for the sunny uplands of Eurogamer, where the consoles multiply like rabbits, but her legacy endures. For instance, it's thanks to her that I know and am excited about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roots-of-yggdrasil">Roots of Yggdrasil</a>, a roguelike deck- and city-builder which casts you as a posse of vikings in a flying longship, touching down on floating islands to found a quick settlement and harvest some magic before the apocalypse - here known as the Ginnungagap, a swirling purple void - catches up with them.</p>
<p>Katharine called it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/roots-of-yggdrasils-gorgeous-roguelike-citybuilding-is-a-real-grower">"a real grower"</a> before the early access release in January, likening it to both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dorfromantik">Dorfromantik</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-banished-vault">The Banished Vault</a> - a chalk and cheese comparison if ever I heard one. Well rejoice, perverted chalk-and-cheese mixers, because Roots of Yggdrasil now has a 1.0 release date - 6th September 2024.</p><!--more-->
<p>"We had planned another patch before releasing 1.0, but as we worked on it, we realized bundling all the changes together made way more sense," developers ManaVoid Entertainment comment in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2071430/view/4190113770900051871?l=english">a Steam post</a>. "That means the next patch is going to be BIG." Here's what you can expect: new events, including new characters to bandy words with from biome to biome, and new Runic Stones, which can be used to add keywords to your cards. For example, if you stick "Retain" on a card, it'll stay in your hand at the end of your turn.</p><p>There will be new building cards, too, such as raiding camp and cart maker, and a fourth playable scion to unlock, with their own story and quest. Existing characters will get endings for their story quests. Quality of life improvements include cleaned-up scion blurbs when preparing for each run, and a clearer presentation of whether your scion or housing will level up if you succeed at a trial.</p>
<p>They've also rebalanced the Holt environment that forms the persistent and evolving staging area for this particular roguelike. "Overall, we felt the progression was a bit too slow and also too restrictive," the devs explain. "Expect less requirements on Holt buildings in the future and more ways to obtain amenity tags. We also don't plan to wipe anything, so if a building you placed gets rebalanced, you'll be able to simply remove it and replace it elsewhere if you prefer!"</p>
<p>All this comes with the caution that the game's price will increase "slightly" when it leaves early access. But there will be a launch discount, too, so you hopefully won't suffer if you hold off till September. Anybody here played this recently? How has the early access build come along since Katharine's day?</p>

            <p>
Following a bit of a tease at least year's BlizzCon, Blizzard has given Overwatch 2's 41st hero the full reveal treatment. And that's not all! Juno, as the shooter's new Martian space ranger is known, is available to play right now for a limited-time.
</p>
<p>
When Blizzard first teased Juno last year, she was known only by the codename Space Ranger. It was, however, confirmed, she'd be Overwatch's first Martian character, as well as a "highly mobile support hero". Eight months later and we now have a much clearer idea of who Juno is and what she can do, thanks to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GspacNMHSbM">brand-new gameplay trailer</a> showcasing her core abilities.
</p>
<p>
Sporting a kind of retro futuristic look, complete with jet-infused roller-boots and a ray gun, Juno leans heavily on speedy traversal. Her passive Martian Overboots ability can be triggered while airborne, enabling her to hover for a limited time, and it can be paired with her Glide Boost,  which lets her glide horizontally with increased movement speed.

<p>
As for that dinky weapon, it's officially known as a Mediblaster, and its primary mode of fire is capable of healing allies and damaging enemies. Juno's secondary fire, meanwhile, takes the form of Pulsar Torpedoes, homing misses that can lock on to enemies and allies alike, harming or healing them respectively over time.
</p>
<p>
Then there's the gateway-like Hyper Ring, which grants teammates a temporary speed increase as pass through it, and her ultimate is the Orbital Ray. This massive beam from outer space travels forward, healing allies and increasing their damage as it goes.
</p>
<p>
Juno officially joins Overwatch 2 in Season 12, which begins on 20th August - but players can put her through her paces from today, 19th July, until 21st July on all platforms. She'll be available in all game modes except Competitive for the duration of her trial, as well as the No Limits mode in the Overwatch arcade.

As a result, yesterday representatives of publisher NetEase and its subsidiary, Starry Studio, posted on the massively popular 500,000-person <em>Once Human</em> Discord, begging fans to go to the game’s Steam review section to boost the rating to “positive” or higher.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.oncehuman.game/news/update/20240718/40780_1167927.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.oncehuman.game/news/update/20240718/40780_1167927.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">But the game’s July 18 patch</a></span>, which was full of bug fixes, caused some unexpected problems. It has been essentially eating some players’ items when they tried to deposit them, and ruining some bases people had spent decent chunks of time building. This all came after extended server maintenance to complete the update in the first place. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/OnceHumanOfficial/comments/1e6tjjc/after_patch_update_i_lost_my_home/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OnceHumanOfficial/comments/1e6tjjc/after_patch_update_i_lost_my_home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Players have since shared</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/OnceHumanOfficial/comments/1e6ex5f/base_disappeared/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OnceHumanOfficial/comments/1e6ex5f/base_disappeared/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">images of busted homes</a></span>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/OnceHumanOfficial/comments/1e6jtfz/my_friends_base_after_the_patch/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OnceHumanOfficial/comments/1e6jtfz/my_friends_base_after_the_patch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the <em>Once Human </em>subreddit</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/app/2139460/discussions/0/4515505180235671253/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2139460/discussions/0/4515505180235671253/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and Steam Page</a></span>,  asking one another for help getting them restored.  “Been walking around tonight thinking why do people build half bases without walls,” joked one player. “Now I know why.”</p><p>“We apologize for the inconvenience,” representatives for the game posted on the Discord today under the title,<strong> </strong>“Fixes for ‘Deposit Function Causing Item Loss’ and ‘Territory Module Loss’ Issues.” The developers added, “Both problems have been identified and are currently being resolved as quickly as possible.” <em>Once Human</em>’s developers said players who lost items will get them replaced through the in-game mail and all players impacted negatively by the patch will get “extra compensation.” </p><p>Amid this latest mess, the original post asking players for positive reviews was deleted (I only saw it initially because of the auto-ping notification from the Discord server). It’s unclear if there will be a new call-to-action  once the mini-crisis has fully-passed, or if NetEase has thought better of asking players to juice the Steam rating—a not altogether unreasonable ask given how many players do like the game, and the fact that it’s still being held down by unsubstantiated criticisms of<em> Once Human</em>’s data collection policies. </p><p>“Bad reviews like that can do so much harm to the game and might be the reason that it may die which I hope from the bottom of my heart that this will not happen,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/OnceHumanOfficial/comments/1e1b6r2/i_wish_the_reviews_would_get_positive/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OnceHumanOfficial/comments/1e1b6r2/i_wish_the_reviews_would_get_positive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> one fan on the subreddit last week. And the tide does seem to be turning. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139460/Once_Human/?gad_source=1#app_reviews_hash&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139460/Once_Human/?gad_source=1#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Despite plenty of complaints</a></span> about the latest patch issues, most of the negative Steam reviews have begun tapering off. We’ll see how that holds up after <em>Once Human</em> reaches its first map and character reset at the end of August. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It didn’t work.</p><p>I purchased a copy of it when it launched in 2022, and sunk around 10 hours into it to mixed results. I definitely clicked with it here and there, but when it got tougher…I wasn’t here for it. Or, rather, other things in life grabbed my attention instead. Sure, I could see the appeal of mastering a tough challenge, but I already have my fair share of challenges in other hobbies and, well, <em>life </em>itself. So it drifted. I’d try it every now and then, including a few months ago, and just couldn’t get into it in a sustainable way.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/flintlock-game-review-soulslike-ashen-difficult-1851595559&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/flintlock-game-review-soulslike-ashen-difficult-1851595559"><em>Flintlock: The Siege Of Dawn: </em>The <em>Kotaku</em> Review</a></span></p><p>And then I played, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/flintlock-game-review-soulslike-ashen-difficult-1851595559&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/flintlock-game-review-soulslike-ashen-difficult-1851595559">reviewed, <em>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn</em></a></span>. Like many soulslikes, it’s got its work cut out for it trying to make it in a genre with fans that have very discriminating, and often developer-specific, tastes. <em>Flintlock</em> is a much easier take on the <em>Souls</em> format though, and that really helped me cut to the chase a bit more, find the joy of more intentional combat and the dopamine drip that results from steadily moving through a world, one tough battle at a time. It was a nice set of training wheels for me and provided some joy on its own merits as well. And around halfway through that game, I felt a confident and excited urge to jump into one of FromSoftware’s masterpieces with the intention of finishing it. </p><p>That game turned out to be <em>Elden Ring</em>. I considered others, but the open, wandering spaces of <em>Elden Ring</em> feel a bit more inviting. I spun up a new character and have since sunk six hours into this fresh, new attempt. Having just gotten through a fight that literally took me around an hour and a half to complete, accompanied by a dear friend who’s willing to help me unpack the game’s cryptic systems and provide me with some encouragement, I think I’ve cracked it. I’ve got some good momentum. I understand this genre and this game better now. </p><p>Also, this playthrough of <em>Elden Ring</em> is coming at a time where I’m facing some steep personal challenges, unexpected failures, pains, and regrets. Yet, there’s opportunity and an uncertain future full of trials and struggles where I can easily see myself coming out intact and stronger. In getting sent to “You Died” screens constantly, with the courage to get up and do it again, I’m wondering if <em>Elden Ring</em>’s gonna have more to offer than just a fun, if not challenging, way to pass the time. — Claire Jackson</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="209678f4949d13482011eb680facaf59" data-recommend-id="image://209678f4949d13482011eb680facaf59" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A space explorer stares out at islands floating in the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A space explorer stares out at islands floating in the sky." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hello Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="209678f4949d13482011eb680facaf59" data-recommend-id="image://209678f4949d13482011eb680facaf59" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A space explorer stares out at islands floating in the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, Windows (Steam Deck OK)<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Touch some alien grass and maybe some water too</p><p>I won’t claim to be an OG, but I’ve been on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/no-man-s-sky&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/no-man-s-sky"><em>No Man’s Sky</em></a></span>’s side since the very beginning.

I’ve cheered it on through numerous of its updates, and even flirted with the possibility of coming back numerous times. The “Atlas Rises” update in particular, which added a whole new story to <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, was very enticing, but I stayed away for a bit longer. It wasn’t till the “Next” update that I booted the game back up, since it finally introduced proper multiplayer and overhauled the game to be <em>much </em>closer to the vision of it I’d always had. Even then though, I played for a short while and fell off because time didn’t really allow for much else.

Sure, I’ve been running through <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> for the past month-and-a-half at this point, slowly catching up to the recently released <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-steam-reviews-1851570344&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-steam-reviews-1851570344"><em>Dawntrail</em></a></span>, but it’s time for something different. <em>FF11 </em>first released in 2002, and has been steadily getting updates ever since. At the start of this year, egged on by a great deal in the Steam winter sale, I purchased <em>FF11 </em>and dove in. My first foray into the dated MMO was spent struggling through the game’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.inverse.com/gaming/final-fantasy-xi-log-in-process-sucks-man&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/final-fantasy-xi-log-in-process-sucks-man" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">frustrating set-up</a></span>, but I did eventually figure it out and start exploring the world with a friend. I declared that 2024 would be the year of <em>FF11</em>, at least for me. </p><p><br>In the months since I created my character, the constant itch to play <em>FF11 </em>has remained. That has only been enhanced by my time with <em>FF14</em>, which is a sleeker and more approachable MMO, but one that lacks the particular old-school charm of its online predecessor. <em>Final Fantasy 11</em>’s world of Vana’diel has a unique friction to it, something rooted in a more adversarial relationship with the player. Die too much and you can lose levels; enemies often drop loot in password protected chests you need to solve or watch disappear; and NPC party members must be recruited one-by-one through special missions. It makes every step of progress feel hard-earned in a way that I find extremely satisfying. The experience has been made easier in the two decades since the game’s original release (like the addition of the NPC party members), and there are plenty of helpful beginner’s guides out there. It would be perfect timing for any <em>FF14 </em>players, since<em> Dawntrail</em>’s Alliance Raids will be an homage to Vana’diel. — Willa Rowe  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5dd9100c576b70ef1df4625c3679b7c7" data-recommend-id="image://5dd9100c576b70ef1df4625c3679b7c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1650" data-height="928" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of a speed run mode shows different game level selections from Nintendo's history." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of a speed run mode shows different game level selections from Nintendo's history." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5dd9100c576b70ef1df4625c3679b7c7" data-recommend-id="image://5dd9100c576b70ef1df4625c3679b7c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1650" data-height="928" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of a speed run mode shows different game level selections from Nintendo's history." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Switch<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Prove I’m the best around, and nothing’s gonna ever keep me down</p><p>In my NES-playing youth, it was common for me to make up my own challenges to tackle after I’d mastered a game the “normal” way. Can I beat <em>Mega Man 2 </em>mostly just using the Buster? Can I beat <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>without relying on mushrooms or other power-ups? Things like that. And I know I’m not the only one. In talking to others over the years, I’ve learned it was quite common for kids to devise challenges that gave us new goals to shoot for and lent new replay value to NES games we’d otherwise mastered. Now, Nintendo has put out its own collection of time-based challenges for its own first-party NES games (sorry, <em>Mega Man 2</em>), and I’ll be spending a fair chunk of this weekend seeing if I’ve still got the stuff. </p><p>Weirdly, despite being called <em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition </em>(emphasis on “World Championships”), apparently there aren’t leaderboards for its many challenges, so you can’t actually compete directly with your friends or the wider world. (There is one weekly challenge everyone can participate in which <em>is </em>ranked, but, for now at least, that’s it.) This is an absolutely puzzling decision to me, albeit one that seems par for the course for Nintendo, which historically seems to struggle with implementing online features in a smart, player-friendly way. All week, as I’ve been anticipating this game, I’ve been thinking back on how the Xbox 360 era of Xbox Live was a golden age for leaderboard competition and online activity. It was a time when I gleefully invested hours in playing <em>Pac-Man CE </em>or <em>Geometry Wars </em>in an effort to surpass my friends on the high score charts, and I’d hoped this game might rekindle some of that competitive enthusiasm in me, but for NES games. It seems that’s not to be. </p><p>Still, I’m keeping an open mind. I love many of the games featured here—<em>Metroid</em>, <em>Zelda II</em>, <em>Donkey Kong</em>—and even those I don’t love (like <em>Ice Climber</em>) I think could be the stuff of entertaining one-off challenges, so I’m eager to jump in and see just what sorts of tests of skill Nintendo has devised. Perhaps my friends and I will just have to resort to sharing our best times in a group chat or something, which won’t be nearly as cool or seamless as doing so via an in-game leaderboard, but I’ll take what I can get. And I’m already thinking about how that <em>NES Edition </em>in the name implies that this may be the first of many. Nintendo, please, for the sake of all that is good and holy in this world, add proper leaderboards by the time you get around to making the <em>SNES </em>edition. Please! — Carolyn Petit </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0ccf586bb0d136eb6999b7bc34b8122a" data-recommend-id="image://0ccf586bb0d136eb6999b7bc34b8122a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Monsters pour forth from a portal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Monsters pour forth from a portal." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0ccf586bb0d136eb6999b7bc34b8122a" data-recommend-id="image://0ccf586bb0d136eb6999b7bc34b8122a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Monsters pour forth from a portal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Windows (Steam Deck OK)<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Get the Platinum trophy </p><p>If this were the PS2-era,<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kunitsu-gami-path-goddess-tower-defense-hands-on-1851532868&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kunitsu-gami-path-goddess-tower-defense-hands-on-1851532868"><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em></a></span><em> </em>would be one of those games that would have come out, been mostly ignored, and then disappeared only to live on in the memories of people who raved about it to anyone who would listen. Hell, it might never have gotten localized at all. But it’s 2024, and everyone will get a chance to give <em>Path of the Goddess</em> a try, and they should. Capcom’s mashup of tower defense and old-school arcade action games is dressed up in Japanese folklore with a vibrant art style and incredible soundtrack. It’s fun, meaty, and doesn’t try to do more than it can. It’s a refreshing departure from games that put big-budget presentation over compelling gameplay and pile on needless systems to pad out play time. </p><p>You play as a warrior named Soh, tasked with escorting a maiden down a mountain so she can purge the evil spirits that have infested it. You train villagers to take on specific roles, and then order them around the battlefield to fight off hordes of demons until the sun comes up. Between missions, you rebuild the villages you encounter to unlock new abilities, classes, and equipment. It’s a solid formula that sings thanks to crisp combat and attention to every little detail from the development team. You can feel the love, care, and creativity in even the smallest elements, especially the UI which is masterfully incorporated into the overall presentation. There are flaws and tedious parts to be sure, but for a $50 game (it’s also on Game Pass), <em>Path of the Goddess</em> nails everything it <em>needs</em> to do and more. — Ethan Gach </p><hr><p>And that wraps our picks for the weekend.

<p>EA Sports College Football 25 is officially available for everyone, but the success of the game has been going on for days. EA Sports has announced that 2.2 million unique players played College Football 25 during the three-day early access period. </p>



<p>On top of that 2.2 million players, another 600,000 players played via the EA Play 10-hour trial that was available.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inside-the-response-to-college-football-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming previously reported</a>, the original internal expectations for the game were to hit the mid-$100 million for revenue in order to be a “success”. That number, based on the player count who purchased the $99.99 Deluxe Edition, has already been surpassed. Just simple math puts the game at around $220 million in Deluxe Edition sales already.</p>



<p>“There was a feeling that we had something special based on the trailer views and interactions online, but the way it’s transitioned to actual sales and players has me lost for words,” one source said earlier this week.</p>



<p>On Thursday, <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1813973638275850649" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mat Piscatella of Circana</a> said that the game was third in US daily active users on Xbox behind just Call of Duty and Fortnite. On PlayStation 5, it was fourth behind Call of Duty, Fortnite, and Grand Theft Auto 5. </p>



<p>College Football 25 is available now for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. </p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">One of the biggest points against any sort of augmented reality, mixed reality, or virtual reality is that the headsets are just too big and bulky. "Once they're just like wearing a pair of glasses," people will often say, "then I'll be more interested." Well, the latest iteration of Viture's virtual display glasses, the Viture Pro XR, are about the closest I've seen a device get to that point.</p><p dir="ltr">True to its name, the Viture Pro XR is an XR or "mixed reality" headset that works as a virtual display. While it's not an all-in-one device like the Apple Vision Pro, you can hook up the Viture Pro XR to a wide range of devices and use it as a monitor for office work, a personal home theater for watching movies or YouTube, or a giant screen for gaming. The screen reaches up to 1080p resolution and 120Hz refresh rate. Best of all, they look like a chunky pair of sunglasses. While you won't be mistaking these for a pair of Ray-Bans, they nonetheless sport a design that looks unmistakably like sunglasses--ones that just project a giant screen in both lenses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4328837-vitureproxr.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328837" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4328837-vitureproxr.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328837"></a><figcaption>Viture Pro XR glasses</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4328837-vitureproxr.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">We tested the Viture Pro XR over the last few weeks, specifically to determine its viability for gaming. After several sessions across multiple games and consoles, it's fair to say the Viture Pro XR lives up to its promise as an affordable virtual display--once everything is set up and the glasses are finally on your head, the experience is largely great. But, as you'll see, it can take some trial and error get to that point.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Setup</h2><p dir="ltr">Depending on which devices you use the Viture Pro XR glasses with, the setup is either super simple, or annoyingly cumbersome.</p><p dir="ltr">The core components are simple enough to get together--the glasses attach to whatever external devices you're watching via a USB-C cable that secures magnetically to the end of the right arm of the glasses, attaching just above the ear. If you're using the glasses with a device that supports DisplayPort over USB-C--such as a Steam Deck, iPhone 15, and select laptops--this is all you need to connect the two. However, desktop PCs and consoles like the PS5 or Xbox will require an additional HDMI adapter, and the Switch needs and entire separate battery pack before you can use the glasses with it--and these extra dongles and attachments require separate purchases on top of the Viture Pro XR's normal $450 price tag.</p><p dir="ltr">Regardless of which devices you're connected to, you will need to be seated relatively close to it since the Viture Pro XR uses a hardwired USB-C connection, and the included cable is only four feet long. This is less of an issue when using it with a portable device like a Steam Deck, Switch, smartphone, or laptop since those devices are going to be kept nearby anyway. Using it with a console or desktop PC, however, is more cumbersome. For example, you won't be able to sit back on your couch and play PS5 from across the room. You'll need to be seated right next to it for the cable to reach.</p><p dir="ltr">Again, the spacing considerations are less of an issue if you're using a nearby portable device or seated at a desk next to your PC, but it's the first or several small limitations that hamper the Viture Pro XR's viability for many users.</p><p dir="ltr">Once the Viture Pro XR glasses are connected to your PC, smartphone, or console, you'll next need to adjust the fit and focus to match your head and eyes. While the glasses themselves are somewhat bulky--no one is going to mistake these for a real pair of sunglasses--they are light enough to stay comfortable for longer play sessions. The trick is making sure you find the right fit for the nose rest. The glasses come with multiple nose rest shapes and sizes, and it's very quick and easy to swap them out. Unfortunately, in my case, I never quite found the "perfect" option for my face since different bits rest at different points on your nose, which affects the viewing angle of the screens inside the lenses. The issue was compounded by my ears being drastically uneven on the sides of my head, so glasses were always slightly askew or uncomfortable--which is a problem I encounter with all glasses. Others will likely find them much more comfortable to wear--one my colleagues with evenly aligned ears found them to be quite comfy--and I appreciate that users get multiple nose rest options out of the box. I do wish there were more customization options like extendable/retractable arm lengths and pivot points for folks like me with uneven ears.</p><p dir="ltr">On the other hand, dialing in the focus on the screens themselves was a cinch. There is a keystone dial on top of each lens that you turn to adjust the focus. I don't wear glasses in my daily life, so there wasn't much adjustment needed, but there seems to be a decent range to help folks match their eyesight.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Viewing experience</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4328839-viture2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328839" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4328839-viture2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328839"></a><figcaption>Viture Pro XR glasses, battery pack, and Xbox wireless controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4328839-viture2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As you can see, depending on which devices you use them with, it can take a bit to get the Viture Pro XR set up and ready. But once you finally have them on and are playing a game, the experience is excellent--mostly.</p><p dir="ltr">The screens themselves are bright and clear, delivering 1080p picture quality at just the right display size to keep the picture crisp. One thing to note is that there's a noticeable yellow tint to the picture, which is by design to help reduce eye strain. This does affect the colors, but it isn't detrimental. For my part, I tested them on Steam Deck and PS5, and I found the picture quality to be excellent. Another GameSpot editor tested them on Xbox Series X and experienced comparable performance to the PS5<strong>.</strong> My biggest concern was the possibility of input lag, but I was able to play multiple hours of Final Fantasy XVI, Elden Ring, and Returnal without any issues. However, the Steam Deck offered the best experience. The setup is <em>mostly </em>plug-and-play--no additional dongles needed-- through you'll need to download and install the official Viture XR Steam Deck plugin first. Best of all, you can play directly with the Steam Deck's handheld controls. Moreso than any device we tested the glasses with, the Viture Pro XR feels best as an accompaniment for Steam Deck.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're looking for a way to play PS5, PC, Xbox Series X|S, or Steam Deck games while someone else is using the TV and you don't want to be stuck with a tiny screen, the Viture Pro XR is a great solution. The same cannot be said for the Nintendo Switch, unfortunately.</p><p dir="ltr">While the experience on Switch ultimately became just as smooth as the other platforms, it didn't start out that way. On my initial tests, almost every Switch game experienced performance dips when connected to the Viture Pro XR--that is, until I updated my Switch's firmware a few days later and the performance was suddenly improved. Nowhere in the setup manual or other documentation does Viture mention the Switch firmware needs to be updated for them to work properly, and there's nothing within the latest patch notes to indicate issues specific to the glasses were part of the update, so it's possible such issues could crop up again later. Nevertheless, even though the glasses eventually worked as intended on the Switch, I still found them less enjoyable to use with Nintendo's handheld due to the cumbersome extra setup required. You'll need to connect the undocked Switch to a separate battery pack via USB-C. Both devices are then secured with a plastic case (that's also surprisingly difficult to get the Switch out of). Finally, the glasses are then plugged into the battery case, which charges both the glasses and the Switch while in use. You can only play with detached Joy-Con controllers, but that's actually not much of an issue since the Switch and portable battery combo is heavy. Still, the lack of a true handheld mode like Steam Deck was a letdown.</p><p dir="ltr">While I have reservations about the Viture Pro XR's user experience on Switch, the other platforms were much more enjoyable, especially Steam Deck. Nevertheless, there are some smaller quibbles worth mentioning. Most notable is the field of view.</p><p dir="ltr">The Viture Pro XR's virtual screens are surprisingly big, and while that is great for immersion, the experience is hampered somewhat because--just like with a regular pair of sunglasses--your peripheral surroundings are always visible while wearing the glasses. Even worse, at some viewing angles, the projected screens inside the glasses can also appear bigger than what's visible in the lenses. Expect to try out multiple nose rests to find the proper viewing angle, but if parts of the screen aren't visible even after finding the right nose piece, you can also adjust the screen display area in your console or PC's settings to make them fit.</p><p dir="ltr">I also ran into a strange issue with the glasses' transparency toggle. The left arm of the glasses includes brightness controls and a button to toggle the glasses' transparency, letting you see through the glasses or block out whatever is directly in front of you with a single press. However, when two pairs of glasses were connected to a device at once--which Viture lists as a standard feature of the Pro XR--the screens would freeze and glitch out with static and image artifacts for a few seconds whenever one of the glasses' transparency buttons were toggled. While it's a very specific issue that wouldn't necessarily affect the watching experience unless one of the two people were constantly changing the transparency setting, it's still a notable glitch.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4328841-viture1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328841" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4328841-viture1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328841"></a><figcaption>Viture Pro XR Glasses</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4328841-viture1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While those issues did impact the viewing experience, the Viture Pro XR's baseline visual quality is excellent and worked as intended most of the time. The same is also true of the Viture Pro XR's audio quality. In fact, I would say the audio is what I was most impressed with overall. I never ran into any issues, and while I wouldn't say the built-in open-back speakers can stack up to a good pair of headphones or a high-end gaming headset, they were clear and loud enough to do justice to Elden Ring boss fights. Even better, despite being external speakers, they have surprisingly minimal noise bleed; while I was hearing Bayle the Dread's bombastic boss theme, my wife, sitting just a few feet away, said she could barely tell any sound was playing at all.</p><p dir="ltr">And I think that example perfectly describes the Viture Pro XR: When they work, they're great, but the handful of quirks can quickly add up and can limit their usability. That's true of all AR, VR, or XR devices these days, and this is no exception.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Viture Pro XR vs. Viture One XR</h2><p dir="ltr">The Viture Pro XR are just the latest version of the company's XR sunglasses. The previously released Viture One XR and One Lite models are also available, and while the Pro XR eclipses both in terms of specs, they are still similar enough that some users may be wondering whether the Pro XR's higher cost are worth it. The biggest difference is the screens. The XR's screen is larger and brighter, with a wider field of view and higher refresh rate. However, since it's larger, the pixel density is slightly lower on the Pro than the One. While that likely won't be a dealbreaker for most people, it's still worth noting. Another major difference is the that the One and One Lite lack the electromagnetic film on the lenses, which means you need to use physical lens covers to block external light. The Lite also uses a standard USB connection behind the right ear, rather than the proprietary magnetic connectors on the Pro and One.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond physical design and specs, the other difference is device compatibility. The Pro XR and One support the same list of devices--including gaming consoles--while the One Lite only works with PCs, laptops, smartphones, Steam Deck, ROG Ally, and Lenovo Go.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Conclusion</h2><p dir="ltr">The Viture Pro XR achieves what it sets out to do, the technology is sound, and it works great if it fits into your setup and lifestyle--the problem is that the Viture Pro XR's use case feels extremely niche right now, especially given the setup hurdles and uneven device support. Nevertheless, if you're looking for a pair of XR glasses for virtual computing or privacy reasons--and you can work around its quirks--the Viture Pro XR glasses are great once you have them on and are easily one of the most affordable XR displays out there.</p><hr><p><em>Viture provided a product sample for the purpose of this review.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/taliesin-jaffe-talks-asha-of-critical-role-downfall-monk-builds-and-what-ashton<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Critical Role Campaign 3 has begun airing its three-episode prequel special titled <em>Critical Role Downfall</em>. Set in the far past this adventure is the memories of the city of Aeor before it's fall. We had a chance to talk with Taliesin Jaffe earlier this week to learn about his character Asha, her role in Downfall, and how the events of this prequel could affect Ashton of Bells Hells.</p>
<p><em>Critical Role Downfall</em> covers episodes 99-101 of Campaign 3. The game is being DM'd by <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b853d22b-df8b-43ab-afaf-0e3829194c09" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/brennan-lee-mulligan-discusses-sean-finnerty-importance-of-laughing-at-fear-and">Brennan Lee Mulligan</a>&nbsp;(<em>Dimension 20, Game Changer</em>) who previously worked with Critical Role for Calamity. Joining Jaffe at the table are fellow co-creators of Critical Role Laura Bailey (<em>Critical Role, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="feb0b551-7fe5-4f74-9986-717a95c8865c" href="https://techraptor.net/games/last-of-us-part-ii">The Last of Us: Part II</a></em>) and Ashley Johnson (<em>Critical Role, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="feb0b551-7fe5-4f74-9986-717a95c8865c" href="https://techraptor.net/games/last-of-us-part-ii">The Last of Us: Part II</a></em>), as well as Noshir Dalal (<em>Star Wars: The Bad Batch, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a1550c58-472a-4d2d-93f5-1d2835ab0eaa" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/mortal-kombat-1-preview">Mortal Kombat 1</a></em>), Nick Marina (<em>Cobra Kai, Chicago Med</em>), and Abubakar Salim (<em>House of the Dragon, Tales of Kenzera</em>).</p>
<p>As someone who absolutely loved but was scarred by the events of Critical Role Calamity I first wanted to know how Jaffe had felt knowing that he was entering a similar kind of situation with Brennan Lee Mulligan helming the story. "Boy, I was really excited"</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//bsS-aGTq-_4"></iframe></p>
<p>"I'm full enough of myself that I'm very rarely intimidated by other human beings [...] so I knew he was going to bring something very challenging and I was really glad that I was picked for this," Jaffe continued to explain "This kind of thing is my jam"</p>
<p>Later on in our discussion Jaffe hoped that viewers of episode 2 will realise that "Brennan is so cruel and mean, but in a good way. He's very good at finding the specific aspects of our characters that matter to us and really hurting us with that, on a fundamental level"</p>
<h2>Asha, Mortal Aspect Of The Wild Mother</h2>
<p>In talking about Asha Jaffe revealed that playing as a mortal aspect of the Wild Mother wasn't his first choice. "At one point I asked if I could be a Betrayer God because I've got a great idea"</p>
<p>After pitching some of those ideas to Matthew Mercer, the creator of the world of Critical Role, Mercer explained that there were a lot of 'lore things' that were unknown to Jaffe.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/asha-cr-downfall_0.jpg?itok=yBcy4wde 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/asha-cr-downfall_0.jpg?itok=upLIOqTF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"I had a Moonweaver idea and just seeing the way the cast was coming together, and Brennen was very much like 'can you find a different opinion going into it?', especially with Noshir coming in with [The Emissary] it was great because it was essentially the same opinion from two very different vantage points. My take on the Wild Mother has always been a little weird"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was glad to come in and take the essential philosophy I had been putting forward with Caduceus and make a version of what I call 'Perhaps I didn't make myself clear'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seeing the animalistic take on the Wild Mother I noted that the performance Jaffe was giving was accentuating the 'Wild' whereas previous times we've been given a glimpse of the power of the Wild Mother - Especially for Campaign 2 characters Fjord (Travis Willingham) and Caduceus (Jaffe) - she has seemed more mothering.</p>
<p>The quick and simple response I received was that she is nurturing "when things are better"</p>
<p>Talking about what Asha and the Wild Mother were doing prior to the events of Downfall Jaffe revealed "Things are not great, she doens't have a lot of followers and even the natural world [...] is kind of gone or dead"</p>

<p>"Backstory that doesn't really get hit up [Asha] found herself a little patch of forest, hidden away. It is the 100 Acre Woods or the 'Mad Max Thunderdome' little chunk of forest and that's where the food that they're bringing in is from. She's basically started up a cult and that's where those people are. People who wander in are like Tthis is what I want' and she's like 'Great, you live by my rules and if you fuck up I kill you."</p>
<p>Taking on the form of the Wolf was also a deliberate result of the kind of world that the Gods are facing pre-Downfall. As a Wolf Asha is able to take action and it serves to remove that level of compassion and empathy for the human world.</p>
<h2>What Is Asha's Dungeons &amp; Dragons Build?</h2>
<p>Wanting to know a bit more about how Asha was built mechanically I wanted to hear from Jaffe what type of elf she was, being a wolf normally but Wild Shaping into an Elf. Asking whether she was a Lythari Elf Jaffe clarified "No, her actual incarnated for is basically a wolf or direwolf. I essentially dropped one of the feat options of my level 20 build and took what was a Wild Shape but could only do one thing which was to Wild Shape into an Elven form at will as a matter of convenience."</p>
<p>Jaffe began to describe the different situations where Asha would be aware that being humanoid would be easier to get by in comparison to a Wolf. He also revealed that when Asha does "talk it is slow and broken. It's not a muscle that works very well. I don't know if that reads as often as I like but it's almost entirely telepathic.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I essentially dropped one of the feat options of my level 20 build and took what was a Wild Shape"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As regular listener of Critical Role I had remembered Jaffe in the past stating that they had a Monk cooked up for the next EXU. I only got part way into my question before Jaffe cut in to let me know that while Asha is a Monk, Asha isn't the Monk he'd been thinking about.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/asha-introduction.jpg?itok=TKc-D_pP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/asha-introduction.jpg?itok=C75SokKQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Taliesin introduces Asha to the table and the viewers, the binary on her passport reads NATURE</figcaption></figure><p>"That was one of my pitches, that Monk, but I was given a lot of reasons not to do that. I'm going to save them for a future game. That Monk is still going to come along but this was definitely 'I wanted to, but no'"</p>
<p>Wanting to dive more into the mechanics of Asha's build Jaffe played his explanation very close to the chest. He decided that he didn't want to reveal which subclass she was a part of, and not remembering whether her very specific weapon was revealed in Episode 2 or 3 he didn't touch on that either.</p>
<p>"Other than a weapon, that I kind of homebrewed, and not even a very complex one the whole notion [of Asha] was somebody who is very grounded."</p>
<p>Where other gods in the party would be able to show off divine powers for Asha he wanted to make a character that was "cool, not necessarily in a God-level way, but more in a Jackie Chan or Stephen Chow way. It's really being more grounded that anyone else in the group."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's nothing anyone on the outside would see and say 'What is that?' It's like 'oh, this is a very dangerous woman'"</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>A Short Story With A Definitive End</h2>
<p>Stepping away from a character that he's been playing since October 2021 Jaffe and I discussed the differences in making a character for such a short adventure. Discussing this we talked about how there isn't room for events to occur and for them to grow with your character Jaffe also added that "Gods don't change really. They are what they are."</p>
<p>"Giant archetype characters, I really love, just because they're immutable. It's hard to change a fundamental notion of the universe but figuring out how to make sure I wasn't always going to be on the same path and could be swayed one way or the other was hard"</p>
<p>There was a definite appeal for Jaffe in just the experience of playing a character at Level 20, something very rare in most Dungeons &amp; Dragons games.</p>
<h2>What Of Taliesin Can Fans Find In Asha</h2>
<p>Jaffe is known to put aspects that are true to him into his characters. For Ashton, it is his character's chronic pain and how that's shaped him, for Asha I wanted to know what part of him was most true within.</p>

<p>He then paraphrased a quote from Stephen Fry "People seem to forget that it is in nature without human intervention, nature in it's purest form is all life on Earth leaves a life of starvation and dies violently and that is Nature."</p>
<p>Taking that mentality Jaffe joked that "Caduceus was his nice way of explaining that, and Asha is his mean way of saying it."</p>
<h2>A Family Of Gods</h2>
<p>Having spoken about Asha for some time I wanted to dive into the relationship that she has with others at the table. Talking specifically about the meeting between the Prime Deities and the Betrayer Gods at the end of episode 1 I commended everyone on their ability to play such a convincing family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When asked what kind of prep work was done to establish these relations I once again got a short but sweet answer, "none."</p>
<p>Jaffe continued "Roleplayers roleplaying and I can see what Brennan didn't want us to play Betrayer Gods. Honestly, all of us did the 'Can we be a Betrayer God?' but that was quickly squashed."</p>

<p>"I had never really given much thought on the gods as people in Exandria, and treating them more as a family, I don't know how it hadn't occurred to me that they have personality, that they are more of a roman/greecian pantheon."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Years of D&amp;D have numbed me to the notion that Gods are just engines for Paladin"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While he's been playing D&amp;D since High School Jaffe explained that Gods in the games have always felt just like additional rules and that he never really enjoyed the way that they interfaced into the game. "This is the first time I'm going 'Oh wow, these guys are actually cool. How have I not known this for over a decade?"</p>
<p>"I realized also that Asha had a favorite sibling and that they were a Betrayer God and I was like 'oh my god, this is weird that I'm suddenly having this very intense love for one of the characters.'"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Honestly, I wish we'd had nine more episodes. This is three episodes and I want to spend more time with each character including the NPC"</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Active Listening Makes A Good D&amp;D Player</h2>
<p>Noticing Jaffe moving as Asha even when the audience might not notice amid other conversations I asked how he feels remaining in character enhances his performance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/taliesin-jaffe-facial-reaction-critical-role-downfall.jpg?itok=s2Nq6dUH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/taliesin-jaffe-facial-reaction-critical-role-downfall.jpg?itok=p-4gbaDb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Jaffe embodies Asha as he focuses on active speakers with a 'Wild' look</figcaption></figure><p>"It's Active Listening, there's nothing worse for a D&amp;D game that people who don't listen," Jaffe talked on experiences of poetry readings in coffee houses where poets would leave as soon as their part was over. "You're supposed to be participating. You should be the audience you want. 90% of being a player at a D&amp;D table is being the audience for your friends and that's more important, at least for me."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"90% of being a player at a D&amp;D table is being the audience for your friends"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jaffe continued to explain that the importance of engaging when you're part of the audience isn't just to show interest but without paying attention "you're not going to be as interesting, you're not going to have enough to say, you're not going to be able to relate to these people"</p>
<p>"I also love physicality for characters, being in that mindspace means you're sitting there forming opinions, forming notions of the things you want to do with the other players, the things you want to say."</p>
<p>Joking about his specific situation at the Critical Role table Jaffe also added "Especially when you're at a table with people who are really talented it's really easy to look like an idiot"</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/taliesin-jaffe-in-costume.jpg?itok=ZauEFq61 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/taliesin-jaffe-in-costume.jpg?itok=wvVKtZwr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Taliesin Jaffe emerging in costume at The Greek for Episode 98 of Critical Role Campaign 3</figcaption></figure><h2>What Does Ashton of Bells Hells Think Of Downfall?</h2>
<p>Ashton, one of Bells Hells most cynical critics of the Gods, is another active viewer of the events of Downfall. Talking on how Ashton might be processing the revelations of this three episode event Jaffe admitted "I didn't know until we actually got there, it was such an intense experience for me that relating it to [Ashton] is hard"</p>
<p>"Ashton has been really trying to fix the things that are fucking up their life because there's not enough time left to blow up [his] life three more times."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I don't even know how to answer that because I'm still working it out myself"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having to decide on some semblance of an answer Jaffe remarked "It definitely both made things worse and better. [...] Is it better that you know the Gods are people or is it worse?"</p>
<p>While not revealing much for the conclusion of Downfall Jaffe did simply state that there will be some "interesting moments" before bursting out into laughter that he simply didn't know how else to put it.</p>

What drew you to bring horror to racing?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For those who don’t know, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Nightmare Kart</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was originally a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> fan game before it was rebranded. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had a community in-joke about a kart racer spin-off, and that’s where I got the inspiration from!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What interesting elements did horror bring to the idea of a racing game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I loved how a health bar changed the entire feel of the game. Most kart racers don’t have health, so seeing racers get beat up by power-ups before exploding in a gruesome death definitely contributed to the game’s identity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>In what ways do you feel this mechanic alters the emotions players go through while playing? How does it alter the feel of the racing play compared to other racing games?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The simple act of having a health bar that can result in death in a kart racer makes it feel more visceral. It makes players feel more fragile, seeing as a death sends them to the back of the pack or gives them a Game Over during boss fights.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Nightmare Kart</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> offers an array of grisly beings and unsettling beasts as racers. Can you tell us a bit about how you designed the various characters and the opponents we race against?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The enemies that weren’t directly inspired by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> were pulled from the "generic Halloween spooky" side of culture. Things like walking skeletons, mummies, or evil corvids felt appropriate.</span></p><p>Images via LWMedia.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Likewise, what ideas went into creating the equally unique vehicles in the game? How did you create such a variety of vehicles that all felt on-theme?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Each kart is "owned" by one of the characters. When I designed the karts, I designed them as an extension of the characters. For example, Mistress Marie, keeper of the clocktower, rides a clock-themed kart.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts go into creating unique karts based on the type of monster that rides them?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I viewed the kart that was assigned to each racer as an extension of them. Mistress Mary of the Great Clocktower needed a kart and making it clock-themed made sense! The Outsider’s story was that he restrained himself on an operating table before he turned into a werewolf, and that's where the operating table kart idea came from.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>This game is not just about going fast, but also attacking your fellow racers. Can you tell us about how you chose the weapons for the game and how you developed them to be used and aimed by someone racing around complex tracks?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course! The first power-up that I made was the pistol. I liked the idea of using "rated M" weapons for a kart racer, as that is uncommon, and I wanted to make weapons that fit the horror theme. They, of course, were originally based on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> weapons, but even then, the idea of having a blood-soaked axe, a giant rusty razer, or a lever-action shotgun felt appropriate to the theme.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What ideas went into the other things players could do while rushing around (shooting beasts to increase speed, doing tricks, etc)?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most of the ideas came from using </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Souls</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-like mechanics and grafting them onto a kart racer. It was kind of like how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Smash Brothers</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> uses the mechanical identity of their characters and translates them into a fighting game.</span></p><p>Images via LWMedia.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Can you tell us about some of the </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Souls</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>-like mechanics you brought into this racing game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The countering system is what comes to mind immediately. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, attacking opens the player to countering by an enemy bullet. This means that randomly flailing around constantly is disincentivized and forces the player to be more considerate of their approach. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Nightmare Kart</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it’s drifting that opens players up to countering via enemy bullets. Drifting is one of the core mechanics of kart racers, so it felt appropriate to make it vulnerable to countering in this "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Souls</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-inspired" kart racer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into how the weapons would operate (aiming, firing) while racing around a track? What thoughts went into things like weapon effects, firing speeds, trajectories, and the like when your battle arena involves racing around complex tracks?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first power-up I made was the pistol. I wanted it to be similar to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which skipped manual aiming and simply had the hunter fire toward the lock-on target to keep the pace of combat from slowing down. Skipping manual aiming and having the racer shoot toward an auto-lock-on target also keeps the player focusing on racing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When it comes to deciding the balance of the power-ups and levels, it’s a simple example of testing the game over and over again and “adjusting the dials” (so to speak) when it comes to effects, speeds, etc.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Nightmare Kart</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> features boss battles as well. What ideas go into designing a boss fight in a horror racing game? How did you create interesting boss battles for your game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The idea of boss battles was born from the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Souls</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-like mechanical inspiration, but they also offered an opportunity to house all the unique ideas I had. Ideas like a platforming segment or a maze for players to get lost in (which normally wouldn’t work in the "race/battle mode" dichotomy the game exists within) could work in a boss fight, as those operate under a unique rule set.</span></p><p>Images via LWMedia.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Horror is often dark and gloomy, but having to fire weapons and race around opponents requires visual clarity to know where to drive and shoot. How did you create a world that felt bleak and foreboding while preserving the visual clarity players would need to keep things from being frustrating?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Luckily, due to the dark environment, creating a gameplay overlay was relatively easy: just make it bright! The lock-on icon is a white glow, the power ups were white flares, guns shoot white bullets, etc.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What drew you to use a PSX visual style for the game? How did this affect the look and feel of the experience? How did it affect the design of the game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My previous game was a PSX demake of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and seeing as this was originally </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-themed, the assets carried over from that project. I am personally a big fan of the low-poly look, and it also made asset creation slightly easier as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What drew you to make a low-poly remake of </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> in the first place?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I was first introduced to the concept of video game demakes via a Neo Gaf forum in 2017 where people were making mock-up fake screenshots of popular games on older hardware. My favorite game is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and I had fond memories of the PS1 era (and it felt like it would fit </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s aesthetic the best). The rest is history!</span></p><p>Images via LWMedia.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What drew you to release the game for free?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game was always planned to be free, seeing as it was a fan game. Now that the game is an original design and IP, I could have put a price tag on it at the last second, but I felt like it might leave people feeling like they were bamboozled. So, I kept it free.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On that topic though, releasing the game for free released a lot of pressure on the players' side. A lot of discussion around a game is intrinsic to its perceived value compared to its actual asking price, and if the game is free, that all goes out the window. As a result, discussion around the game felt a lot more laid back (in a positive way!), and I still got money from it due to Itch.io’s "pay what you want" payment method, so it was a win-win for everyone!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/game-demos-schim<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in May, I wrote about <a href="https://aftermath.site/schim-demo-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the demo for shadow-platforming game <em>SCHiM</em></a>, a neat-looking indie game I’d been excited about for a while. The full game came out yesterday for PC and consoles; if you played the demo, it’s basically more of that. Maybe <em>too</em> much more, which is not something I expected to feel, and which is making me think a lot about the strengths and pitfalls of the recent glut of Steam demos.</p><p>I write a lot about <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/steam-next-fest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demos</a> on Aftermath. It’s not a beat I intended to create; instead, they’re a good way for me to cover a lot of games without spending a ton of time or money, two things that are in much shorter supply than they used to be now that I own my own site. I like that I can give readers hands-on impressions of smaller or unknown games that they can also check out, instead of writing up a press preview that has limited access and feeds into the marketing machine. And while I’m not in the business of telling anyone what their time or money is worth, I know that things are tough all over, so I appreciate that money won’t be a barrier to a reader checking out a demo I wrote about if they’re interested. And, apart from work, demos are a good way for me to get a sense of whether I might like a game that I’ve either been hearing about or stumbled across.</p><p>With events like Next Fest, Steam has been leaning hard into demos of late, which has definitely increased my awareness of them. In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ajbqhx/why_do_demos_have_such_a_big_comeback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent thread on a game dev subreddit</a>, some developers said they found an increase in wishlists following demos, which help <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/wishlist#:~:text=A%3A%20Wishlists%20can%20be%20an,game%20is%20on%20their%20wishlist." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boost a game’s visibility</a>, or at least remind interested potential players when a game comes out. Others in the thread posited that demos can lead to press and influencer coverage that can help a game, or that demos have become more valuable as more players feel <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-days-before-this-day-in-the-day-before" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">burned by games that don’t live up to their marketing hype</a>. Others, however, also saw downsides: that people get their fix of a game from its demo and don’t subsequently buy it, or that demos can hurt larger games, or those that already have strong marketing, more than they help. And that’s to say nothing of the fact that making a demo is <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/should-you-release-a-demo-for-your-game-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a lot of work</a>, and that there’s no guarantee they’re <a href="https://aftermath.site/demo-trailer-e3-gamescom-pax-tgs-made" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an accurate representation</a> of a full game.</p><p>Which brings me back to <em>SCHiM</em>, a game I’d been excited about since its reveal and whose demo I really enjoyed. A quick recap: You play as a little shadow guy, which is a splotch with adorable googly eyes, who becomes detached from their person and has to find their way back to him. In the full game, you do that across 65 levels of various lengths by jumping from shadow to shadow. Hopping between stationary objects gives way to catching rides on passersby or cars, bouncing off signs or clotheslines, solving little environmental puzzles to create new shadows, or timing your jumps between flickering lights.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="SCHiM - Launch Trailer | PC &amp; Consoles" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4p8ZWSSAhXY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The demo gave a glimpse of the narrative that, as a truncated slice, felt a little confusing. Seeing the full story, told wordlessly, made it compelling and surprisingly moving. You watch the person go through some struggles–a breakup, losing his job, going back to what I think is his hometown to recuperate–and it’s a relatable narrative premise that definitely made me feel for the person and want to see his story through.</p><p>But in terms of gameplay, you mostly do the same thing in the demo you do in the full game. This isn’t a knock–you would hope a demo would be an accurate slice!–but the trouble came for me once I realized that while <em>SCHiM</em>’s bigger levels are creative–traversing a giant automated factory, or exploring the different enclosures at a zoo–and they’re a lot of fun to move through, the game never quite does anything new with the core mechanic the demo shows off. After the first 20 or so levels showed me what the game had to offer, the experience started to feel draggy and repetitive. Despite the number of levels, the game itself only takes a handful of hours to complete, so it doesn’t quite wear out its welcome, but I found myself ready to be done with it far sooner than I expected to when I first booted up the full game, eager to have more of the experience I’d enjoyed so much in the demo.</p><p>When I imagined what I would tell a friend if they asked me about <em>SCHiM</em>, the first response that came to mind was, “The full game is cool, but you could really just play the demo.” It made me wonder if the demo actually hurt the full game for me, showing me the best of what <em>SCHiM</em> had to offer in a way that made the full game feel disappointing. Would I have been less dissatisfied with the shape of the game if the shortened experience of the demo hadn’t been so strong?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>With the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/developers-tell-us-why-early-access-games-are-better-than-ever" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growing popularity of early access games</a>, as players we know how we can burn ourselves out on a game or develop opinions on something that isn’t finished. Do demos have the same problem? Early access games are works-in-progress; while demos are as well, they’re also curated experiences, whether on Steam or at a convention or press event. Designing one is surely a careful balancing act between representing a game well and leaving players wanting more, a careful line to walk with pitfalls on both sides.</p><p>I still essentially enjoyed <em>SCHiM</em>; it’s charming and, as I wrote in May, “feels like <em>play</em> in the way games can sometimes lose sight of.” But it’s weird to feel like the demo was <em>better</em> than the full game, whose only major difference from the demo was that it was longer. For all a demo’s potential strengths, maybe it’s better to experience a game in its entirety once it’s ready, to have the experience developers are <em>actually</em> making and not one designed with the extraneous variables of marketing and Steam wishlists in mind.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hunt-showdown-sequel-esrb-leak-rumor</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hunt-showdown-sequel-possibly-leaked-via-esrb-rating.931983/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hunt-showdown-sequel-esrb-leak-rumor<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An ESRB listing has appeared for a game called&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>, potentially suggesting that a sequel to the popular PvPvE shooter is in the works.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39965/hunt-showdown-1896/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">rating</a>&nbsp;is, as you'd probably expect from a followup to&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown</em>, Mature 17+ owing to "blood and gore" and "violence". The listing also warns that the game will contain in-game purchases.</p>
<p>Much like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hunt-showdown">the first game</a>,&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>, whatever it turns out to be, will be set in the Victorian era and will revolve around the use of "bladed bats, clubs, brass knuckles, and pistols" to kill both monsters and other players, according to the ESRB.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hunt-showdown-sequel-esrb-swamp.jpg?itok=_coYu_jv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hunt-showdown-sequel-esrb-swamp.jpg?itok=SBYM1xEA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hunt: Showdown&nbsp;</em>may well be getting a sequel soon.</figcaption></figure><p>The listing goes on to describe some pretty grisly things you'll be able to see and do in&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>, including "cav[ing] in zombies' heads" and "cut[ting] off their limbs".</p>
<p>According to the ESRB, the game will feature a type of zombie that "explodes into blood and viscera when killed", as well as another one that wears "human skin as a cape". Well, we've all had some pretty extreme Friday nights, no?</p>
<p>I'm not a&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown&nbsp;</em>aficionado, but I'm pretty sure the aforementioned descriptions don't neatly fit any of the game's existing monsters, so&nbsp;<em>1896 </em>could&nbsp;be a followup or a new game rather than an expanded re-release of the original.</p>
<p>Sadly, we haven't had an official announcement from Crytek yet, so we'll have to fall back on speculation and this ESRB rating for now. Hopefully, we'll hear something more in the next few weeks.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hunt-showdown-sequel-esrb-spider.jpg?itok=-Pgq7WCV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hunt-showdown-sequel-esrb-spider.jpg?itok=rdu0QTLQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hunt: Showdown 1896&nbsp;</em>will presumably feature some new monsters.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Hunt: Showdown 1896&nbsp;</em>will, according to the ESRB page, launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S when it does arrive, although no release date is listed.</p>
<p>It is, of course, possible that this is the name Crytek is giving to the current-gen version of&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown</em>, which is due to arrive sometime after the PS4 and Xbox One versions are <a href="https://www.huntshowdown.com/news/hunt-showdown-to-sunset-on-ps4-xbox-one-from-15th-of-august" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sunsetted in August</a>.</p>
<p>That new version is set to <a href="https://www.crytek.com/news/hunt-showdown-reveals-upgrade-coming-15th-august-2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bring an engine change</a>, UI improvements, and a new map to the game, among other things, although Crytek has already announced the relaunch without referring to it as&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>.</p>
<p>It's all to play for right now, so watch this space for any further information from Crytek. Until then, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/594650/Hunt_Showdown/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/hunt-showdown/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/hunt-showdown/9ncmq9dxgxf6" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hunt-showdown-review-bayou-bounty-blues">take a look at our review here</a> to see how it shakes out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24201551/halo-paramount-plus-canceled<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paramount has canceled its live-action <em>Halo</em> series for Paramount Plus, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/halo-canceled-paramount-plus-2-seasons-1235952581/">according to <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a> and <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/halo-canceled-paramount-plus-1236075994/#"><em>Variety</em></a>. But if you’re a fan of the show and want to see it continue, there’s a sliver of hope: both publications report that the show’s producers are shopping the series around, so perhaps there will be a third season. </p><p>The <em>Halo</em> show premiered <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23132662/halo-tv-series-season-1-review-paramount-plus">in 2022</a> and ran for two seasons, with the second <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24063618/halo-season-2-premiere-review-paramount-plus">debuting earlier this year</a>. Pablo Schreiber starred as Master Chief.</p><p>“We are extremely proud of this ambitious series and would like to thank our partners at Xbox, 343 Industries and Amblin Television, along with showrunner and executive producer David Wiener, his fellow executive producers, the entire cast led by Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief and the amazing crew for all their outstanding work,” Paramount said in a statement to <em>THR</em> and <em>Variety</em>. “We wish everyone the best going forward.”</p><p>The <em>Halo</em> show had its issues, primarily the fact that we never really got to see the titular Halo in any kind of detail. Some fans of the games could never get over the decision to show the Master Chief’s face throughout the majority of the show — something that’s never been done in the games. And some folks were <em>really</em> unamused by the romance subplot between the Chief and a human member of the alien Covenant, which included an unintentionally hilarious sex scene. </p><p>The show’s second season was a vast improvement over the first. The season’s first episode and its later depiction of the Fall of Reach — a major moment in the game series — really captured the harrowing yet valorous essence of the<em> Halo</em> games despite <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/24/22994651/paramount-plus-halo-tv-show-halo-lore">not strictly following the game’s canon</a>. Season 2 also added <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/10/24067616/pablo-schreiber-halo-season-two-paramount-plus">more depth to Schreiber’s Silver Team costars</a>, especially from Riz-028 (Natasha Culzac) and Vannak-134 (Bentley Kalu). The games have done a poor job of capturing the humanity of the people under all that power armor, and that was something <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/2/24087962/halo-paramount-plus-episode-five-aleria">the <em>Halo</em> TV series really excelled at</a>, despite all its other faults.</p><p>Hopefully, the showrunners will find a new home for the series to continue what’s been an interesting take on one of the most popular video game series of all time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/pc-motherboard-market-has-seemingly-recovered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>After three-plus years, it seems as though the PC motherboard market has finally recovered from the shortages 2021 and 2022. </p>



<p>According to information from <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20240712PD223/shipments-graphics-card-pc-market-msi.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DigiTimes</a>, the motherboard market is on pace to sell 38.8 million units in 2024 from the big four companies — ASUS, ASRock, Gigabyte, and MSI — out of Taiwan. That’s a 5% increase from the 36.8 million shipments from 2023, and a massive 25% increase from the 30.9 million shipments in 2022.</p>



<p>While it’s not going to hit the 42.7 million shipments from 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic was at it’s peak and people were looking for things to do, seeing the jump from 2022 can only be viewed as a win for manufacturers. It also comes alongside a jump in <a href="https://www.jonpeddie.com/news/shipments-of-graphics-add-in-boards-increase-for-third-quarter-in-a-row/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GPU sales year-over-year</a> that saw a 32% increase as of Q4 2023. </p>



<p>These shipment increases are expected to continue as both AMD and Intel prepare to launch their next-generation CPUs. AMD is set to launch their new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-amd-ryzen-9000-cpus-are-already-at-retailers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryzen 9000 series CPUs</a> later this month. Intel, on the other hand, has its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-next-intel-cpus-have-been-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arrow Lake-S processors</a> coming in the fall.</p>

<p>EA's last college football game before this was 2013's NCAA Football 14. EA and the NCAA broke off their partnership due to a variety of reasons, including legal problems and lawsuits. Instead, EA brokered separate licensing deals to feature all 134 FBS schools in College Football 25. And in a major change, EA is paying athletes to be in the game as part of Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals.</p><p>College Football 25 is available on console for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, but not last-gen consoles, PC, or Nintendo Switch.</p><p>If you're just getting started with College Football 25, you may want to check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-release-day-preorder-buying-guide/1100-6525115/" data-ref-id="1100-6525115">College Football 25 starter guide</a> that runs through all the key things to know.</p>

		<p>The indie hit horror game, The Mortuary Assistant, is coming to console with the expanded and enhanced Definitive Edition release.</p>
<p>The Mortuary Assistant – Definitive Edition will be available across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch on 2nd August 2024. It will also be a free update for the PC version of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Mortuary Assistant - Definitive Edition" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AnEMbIsyxiQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Launching for PC in 2022, The Mortuary Assistant gained a quick following for all its spooky, haunted vibes – this always goes down well with Twitch streamers.</p>
<p>The game puts you in the role of Rebecca Owens, a graduate in mortuary sciences and new apprentice at River Fields Mortuary, but as if having to work with corpses wasn’t already eerie and unsettling enough, it quickly becomes clear that the mortuary is afflicted by an otherworldly spirit or creature. A phone call from the mortician themself makes it clear that you’re now trapped inside and cannot leave.</p>

<p>There’s a bunch of new features and content for the Definitive Edition, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embalming only mode – embalm unlimited bodies</li>
<li>New Haunt Events</li>
<li>Additional Lore</li>
<li>New bodies to embalm</li>
<li>New Valentine’s Day seasonal event (Stop by the mortuary in February)</li>
<li>New achievements</li>
<li>Multiple Bug and Stability Fixes</li>
<li>Performance Improvements</li>
</ul>

            <p>
Atlus has released an official Persona 5 coffee line, so you can set up your own iconic Café Leblanc.
</p>
<p>
In collaboration with Jade City Foods, the coffee line includes three different roasts: the Café Leblanc dark roast, Phantom Thieves of Hearts medium roast, or Shujin Academy light roast.
</p>
<p>
The dark roast offers chocolate and caramel notes, the medium roast has fruity acidity, and the light roast has a cherry and chocolate flavour. All are available as whole beans or ground.

<p>

Café Leblanc serves as the base of operations for Persona 5's cast of Phantom Thieves, where the protagonist (Joker) can whip up a brew. It's well known for boosting your SP.
</p>
<p>
The café is also known for its curry, so it's fitting that Atlus is also releasing a line of hot sauces alongside the coffee.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>
These sauces are - suitably - named after the game's fire spells (Agi, Agilao, Agidyne) as well as the characters Joker, Violet, and Crow. Flavours range from roasted jalapeno, to scotch bonnet, and reaper. 
</p>
<p>
Just be careful with those. As my mother always says, "a tickle on the tongue means a tingle on the bum".
</p>
<p>
All items are available on the <a href="https://jadecityfoods.com/">Jade City Foods website</a>: £15 per sauce, or £16 for a bag of coffee. It's US based but shipping is international. There are also bundles available for multiple items.

</p>
<p>
And if Persona 5 isn't your thing, there are other foods available based on the likes of Naruto, Cuphead, and Ghost in the Shell too.
</p>
<p>
Atlus itself is busy working on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-3-reload-episode-aigis-the-answer-will-release-in-september">Persona 3 DLC Episode Aigis</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atlus-gives-us-a-peek-at-rpg-metaphor-refantazios-story">forthcoming new RPG Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>.

<p>In The Mortuary Assistant, you take on the role of Rebecca Owens, a newly graduated apprentice at River Fields Mortuary – but the job is not quite what it seems.</p>
<p>"Late one night you are called in to handle some embalmings," developer DreadXP teases. "When the Mortician, Raymond, calls the mortuary when you arrive, you soon realise this is a night like none other, and there’s no escape from the demonic forces plaguing the mortuary."</p>
<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-mortuary-assistant-is-getting-a-companion-piece-movie-adaptation">The Mortuary Assistant is getting the silver screen treatment</a>.</p>
<p>The indie horror - which has been a huge hit since it launched in August 2022 - was reportedly plucked for an adaptation before the full game released earlier this month.</p>
<p>Director Jeremiah Kipp says the film will be a "companion piece" to the game, and Kipp hopes to "retain the minimalist setting in and around the mortuary, the fascination with the process of embalming, and the nerve-shredding terror of the gameplay".</p>

			<p>Very little is currently known about The Elder Scrolls VI, but some recent findings may have provided a rather solid hint regarding the game's setting.</p>
<p>As spotted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TESVI/comments/1e6fxao/bethesda_employees_pinterest_account_is_still/#lightbox">Reddit</a> by nitsuaztnarf, an active Pinterest account from a Bethesda Game Studios employee contains a lot of pins for concepts for the upcoming new entry in the series. Judging from these pins, it definitely feels like the game will be set in <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-hammerfell-targeting-2025/">Hammerfell</a>, a vast province located in the west of Tamriel, covered by jungles, wooded mountain ranges, subtropical grasslands, swamps, and deserts.</p>
<p>While this could have been a whole lot of nothing, what makes this The Elder Scrolls VI-related finding interesting is how the profile has been mostly pinning fantasy-related images and concepts since the release of Starfield, indicating these have been indeed pinned for the new entry in the series, and the fact that the profile was set to private a few hours after it was shared on Reddit, an attempt to hide something that wasn't supposed to be discovered.</p>
<p>Very little is known about The Elder Scrolls VI. The game was announced in 2018 together with Starfield, but it is still at least <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-five-years-away/">five years away</a>. According to Todd Howard, it will be the<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-ultimate-fantasy/"> ultimate fantasy world simulator</a>, so it should be a big step forward compared to its predecessor.</p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls VI is currently in development. A release date has yet to be confirmed.</p>

<!-- cache hit 101:single/related:87963907aecae3bbb7e1b88b4075e717 --><!-- empty -->
<p>The FTC says the across-the-board price increases that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/microsoft-asks-many-game-pass-subscribers-to-pay-more-for-less/">Microsoft recently announced</a> for its Xbox Game Pass subscription service tiers represent "exactly the sort of consumer harm from the merger the FTC has alleged" when it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/06/report-ftc-will-file-to-block-microsofts-69b-activision-blizzard-acquisition/">sought to block Microsoft's merger with Activision</a>. In <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca9.344453/gov.uscourts.ca9.344453.121.0_1.pdf">a letter to the court</a> posted as part of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/07/ftc-appeal-in-microsoft-activision-case-shows-us-regulator-isnt-giving-up-yet/">an ongoing appeal by the FTC</a> in the case, the federal regulator alleges Microsoft's moves are a clear example of "product degradation" brought about by "a firm exercising market power post-merger."
</p><p>The letter's primary focus is on the soon-to-be-discontinued $10.99/month Console Game Pass tier. That's being replaced with a $14.99/month Game Pass Standard tier (a 36 percent price increase) that no longer includes "day one" access to all of Microsoft's first-party titles. To maintain that key benefit, "Console" subscribers will have to spend 81 percent more for the $19.99 Game Pass Ultimate tier, which also includes a number of additional benefits over the current $10.99/month option.</p>
<h2>Is this “based on the acquisition”?</h2>
<p>The FTC notes that these changes "coincide with adding <em>Call of Duty</em> to Game Pass’s most expensive tier." Previously, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/sony-calls-microsofts-3-year-call-of-duty-sharing-offer-inadequate/">Microsoft publicly promised</a> that this Game Pass access to Activision's ultra-popular shooter would come "with no price increase for the service based on the acquisition."</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>It's that "based on the acquisition" clause that's likely to give Microsoft some wiggle room in arguing for its planned pricing changes. Inflation is also a sufficient explanation for a large portion of the price increase in nominal terms—the $14.99 Microsoft charged for a month of Game Pass Ultimate <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/5/18296816/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscription-pricing-release-date-rumors">when it launched in 2019</a> is the equivalent of $18.39 today, according to <a href="https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=14.99&amp;year1=201906&amp;year2=202406">the BLS CPI calculator</a>. When Microsoft raised the Game Pass Ultimate monthly price from $14.99 to $16.99 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/21/23768400/microsoft-xbox-series-x-xbox-game-pass-price-increase">just last year</a>—just before the Activision merger was finalized—the company said in a statement it had "adjusted the prices to reflect the competitive conditions in each market."</p>
<p>Microsoft might have a harder time finessing the alleged "degradation" inherent in going from the discontinued Game Pass Console tier to the new, more expensive Game Pass Standard tier. True, the replacement does include the online multiplayer benefits of Game Pass Core, which could previously be purchased separately. But the removal of the long-promised day one access to first party games will heavily reduce the value most subscribers get from the new option.</p>
<p>It's now been over a year since the FTC <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/07/ftc-appeal-in-microsoft-activision-case-shows-us-regulator-isnt-giving-up-yet/">first announced it intended to appeal</a> the ruling that effectively stopped <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/06/report-ftc-will-file-to-block-microsofts-69b-activision-blizzard-acquisition/">its attempted injunction</a> against the merger deal. While Microsoft and Activision have moved forward with their merger since then, courts <a href="https://www.crowell.com/en/insights/client-alerts/ftc-wins-reversal-in-whole-foods">have reversed similar mergers on appeal</a> even after a merger deal has fully closed.
</p><p>Elsewhere in its letter, the FTC makes note of previous arguments that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/microsoft-cancels-blizzard-survival-game-lays-off-1900/">Microsoft's recent round of nearly 2,000 Xbox-focused layoffs</a> is a sign of "reduced investments in output and product quality" post-merger.</p>
