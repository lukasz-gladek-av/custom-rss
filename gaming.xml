            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-model-kits-for-adults<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Model making is a great hobby, but knowing how and where to start is another story. It can be overwhelming for novices: Injection-molded plastic models have been on the market for close to a century, and there are kits of everything from military vehicles to sports cars and anime robots to household objects. Looking at some of the incredible creations of seasoned model builders, it might seem like you need an entire workshop of tools and equipment, the steady hands of a brain surgeon, and years of practice to make something cool-looking, but that’s not the case.</p><p>To make getting into this delightful pastime a whole lot less daunting, I’ve put together a list of kits that are worth checking out. Quite a few of these recommendations are based on my own firsthand experience. Up top are kits that don’t require glue, paint, or much else in the way of supplies, but keep scrolling for some recommendations if you’re ready to get your hands dirty and possibly stuck together. Head all the way to the bottom for essential tools and supplies you’ll need for model kits and where to buy these excellent <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-lego-alternatives">LEGO alternatives</a>.</p><h2>No Paint? No Glue? No Problem!</h2><p>For a very long time, model kits needed to be glued together and painted. Nowadays that’s not always the case. Most model companies offer entry-level kits that come pre-colored and can be easily snapped together. Keep in mind that some kits that advertise themselves as “for beginners” or “entry level” are <em>so</em> simplified it's hard to count them as traditional model kits. However, plenty still offer a satisfying challenge without requiring any messy stuff like paint and glue. Case in point: Gundam! If you’re looking for a beginner route to model kits, and you think giant robots are cool, then either of the following two kits is a good start.</p><div><div id="202708" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Hobby Bandai Hobby HGUC RX-78-2 Gundam Revive Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>1:144 Scale. Recommended age: 15 years and up.</p></div></div><div id="202709" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Hobby Bandai Hobby MG Gundam RX-78-2 Version 3.0 Action Figure Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>1:100 Scale. Recommended age: 15 years and up.</p></div></div></div><p>Gundam kits are classified by grade, the two most common being High Grade (HG), which are usually $15-30 and about 6 inches tall when complete, and Master Grade (MG), which’ll run you around $30-50 and are a couple of inches taller, but usually a lot more detailed and complex. There’s also Real Grade, which is somewhere between HG and MG; Entry Grade, which is for absolute beginners; and Perfect Grade, which is for advanced builders.</p><div><div id="202710" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Hobby 174 Wing Gundam Zero</h3></p><div><p>The Wing Zero HG kit comes with a twin buster rifle, beam sabers, pile driver shield, and machine cannons.</p></div></div><div id="202711" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Hobby Gundam IBO Gundam Barbatos, Bandai Spirits MG 1:100</h3></p><div><p>The Gundam Barbatos 4th form has appeared as an MG, with a reproduced Gundam frame of internal mechanics as well as a recreation of the Suit's Ahab Reactor!</p></div></div></div><p>Gundam modeling (or Gunpla, short for “Gundam plastic models”) has become so massively popular, it warrants its own list of recommended kits. But for anyone who doesn’t care for big anime robots (Why not? Who hurt you?) I've rounded up a bunch of kits that take the same no-fuss appeal of Gundam kits applied to other properties and subject matter.</p><h2>Star Wars Model Kits</h2><div><div id="202715" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Hobby Bandai AT-ST 1:48 Scale Star Wars All Terrain Scout Transport Walker</h3></p><div><p>Y-Wing Starfighter kit has an inner cockpit</p></div></div><div id="202716" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Hobby Bandai Hobby Star Wars 1:72 Y-Wing Starfighter Building Kit</h3></p><div><p>AT-ST from Star Wars was recreated as a detailed model kit with articulated legs, rotating head and weapon systems.</p></div></div></div><p>Bandai has given the Gundam treatment to a number of other beloved pop-culture properties, most notably Star Wars. A good number of characters and vehicles have been turned into pre-colored snap-together kits. Some lend themselves to this treatment better than others; some of the less colorful subjects may look a little bland without a bit of paint or finishing touches. A <a href="https://youtu.be/1i61SlfOD34?si=e9PDSG4ArZ1XNa9R" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>basic wash</u></a> or some <a href="https://youtu.be/raCbD4nkFIc?si=f7ywCKx4JKydISNl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>dry-brushing</u></a> will really make the details pop on the more monochromatic Original Trilogy machines.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><div id="202720" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Hobby Boba Fett, Bandai Spirits Hobby 1/12 Plastic Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>Your favorite Star Wars bounty hunter is now a 1/12 scale model kit with a full array of accessories including interchangeable hand parts.</p></div></div><p>Boba Fett is nice and colorful and looks great without a drop of paint, which speaks to the character’s inherently kitbashed aesthetic. The Stormtroopers looked a little too plain out of the box, so my esteemed colleague <a href="https://www.ign.com/person/b-altano-ign"><u>Brian Altano</u></a> and I personalized them a bit:</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Bandai Stormtrooper Model Kits</h3></div></output><h2>Anime Model Kits</h2><div><div id="202722" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Hobby Son Goku Figure-Rise Standard Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>Recreate iconic scenes from Dragon Ball Z with this standard model kit of Son Goku featuring an upgraded Muscle Build-Up System.</p></div></div><div id="202723" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Hobby Uzumaki Naruto Figure-Rise Standard Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>Enjoy another fan-favorite anime build for Uzumaki Naruto, with superior tooling in the joints. Achieve action poses and signature attacks such as “rasen GAN”, “rasen shuriken”, and “shadow Clone jutsu”!</p></div></div></div><p>If full-color injection-molded action figure model kits work for giant anime robots, why not anime people as well? Bandai’s Figure-Rise line has tackled <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/dragon-ball-z">Dragon Ball Z</a>, Naruto, Digimon, and even some of the human characters from Gundam.</p><h2>Giant Robot Model Kits (That Aren’t Gundam)</h2><div id="202725" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Kotobukiya Kotobukiya Metal Gear Solid: Metal Gear Rex (Black Ver.) Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>From Konami's series Metal Gear comes an epic model kit of the nuclear-armed bipedal tank Metal Gear Rex. Buying options vary and range from $154 and up.</p></div></div><p>Currently sitting at the top of my pile of shame is Kotobukiya’s 1:100 scale Metal Gear Rex. Part of my procrastination is because it’s a big beautiful model kit and I don’t want to mess it up, but also because I built the Metal Gear Sahelanthropus, which was an extremely frustrating build. This may have been because I got it partially from a friend and picked up where he left off, but I think the more intricate and top-heavy design of the Sahelanthropus doesn’t lend itself as well to a physical kit. From what I’ve read, Rex’s more squat form makes for a more straightforward build. Unsurprisingly, a mech designed for a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps1-games-playstation">PlayStation 1 game</a> has less proverbial moving parts than one designed for the PS4.</p><div><div id="202874" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Good Smile Company  Horizon Forbidden West: Thunderjaw Moderoid Plastic Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>This giant model kit comes in at 15" in length and will help you get into (mechanical) beast mode. It's an amazing build for Horizon Forbidden West fans and robot fans alike. Prices vary but start at $107.</p></div></div><div id="202875" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Good Smile Company  Aliens: Power Loader Moderoid Plastic Model Kit</h3></p></div></div><p>Good Smile Company’s Moderoid line of kits come pre-painted, which is great if you just want to put something together and display it, but they’re also on the pricier side.</p><div><div id="202971" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Store Bandai Hobby - Imaginary Skeleton – 1:32 Imaginary Skeleton Tyrannosaurus</h3></p><div><p>Who doesn't want to own a cool miniature dino? This 1/32 T-Rex model kit is highly rated for its attention to detail, including impressive skull and two rows of special teeth on the upper jaw. It's posed in a crouching position so it's ready to jump!</p></div></div><div id="202974" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Store Triceratops</h3></p><div><p>If T-Rex isn't your thing, you can build the 1/32 Triceratops version of this Bandai model kit at a similar price point!
</p></div></div></div><p>Like a lot of Bandai kits, these dinosaur skeletons snap together and are molded in all the right colors. However, since they’re a bunch of bones, they’re monochrome. That said, for anyone who doesn’t have much confidence in their painting abilities, but still wants to paint <em>something</em>, this might be for you. I tried out a bunch of weathering techniques on mine to make it look appropriately prehistoric, and then made a custom base.</p><div id="202972" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Bandai Store 1:1 Cup Noodle</h3></p><div><p>This is a unique and fun model kit for beginners. The inside is filled with 3D scanned noodles, egg, shrimp, and "mystery meat" to bring the food staple to life.
</p></div></div><p>Not quite the weirdest model kit I’ve built (that honor goes to a 1:24 scale urinating dog), but it’s definitely up there. This is basically a Gundam, but it’s soup. It’s completely snap together, though surprisingly, deceptively complex in how it’s assembled. The finished product, without a drop of paint, is impressively hard to differentiate from the real thing, which is funny but also raises some concerns about how closely instant ramen noodles resemble polystyrene.</p><div id="202976" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Aoshima Aoshima Nissan C110 Skyline GT-R Custom White 1:32 Scale Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>This white 1:32 scale Nissan car model kit is affordable, easy to build (with only 30 parts), and fun to display on any collector's shelf.</p></div></div><p>As the name suggests, Aoshima’s The Snap Kit series of model cars are a *snap* to put together, literally and figuratively. Much like Gundam kits, no glue is required and the majority of the pieces come molded in the correct colors. (Stickers are included for the ones that aren’t.) They’re a great option for anyone who’s looking for a quick project that doesn’t require a lot of tools or materials. Without paint, the end result might look a bit more like a toy than a proper replica, but painting is still an option. If that’s the part of the hobby that appeals to you, these’ll get you off to the proverbial races faster.</p><p>I turned The Snapkit’s 2000GT-R Skyline into a beat-up junker, and kitbashed the Prius into a heavy metal post-apocalyptic monster truck. A “Judas Prius,” if you will. That one’s a work in progress; it looks too Halo, not Mad Max enough.</p><h2>Military Model Kits</h2><div><div id="203002" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Tamiya Tamiya 35346 1/35 US Medium Tank M4A3E8 Sherman Plastic Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>Meet the M4A3E8, AKA "Easy Eight" model kit, a perfect build and paint project for history buffs and Fury movie fans alike.</p></div></div><div id="203003" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Tamiya Tamiya Models M1A2 Abrams Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>The "worlds' strongest tank" but smaller! This 1/35 Abrams tank model kit even comes with body figures as an extra touch.</p></div></div></div><p>The beauty of tanks, aside from being a cross between a cannon and a bulldozer, is how forgiving they are of a messy paint job. The real, full-size ones are frequently painted just one color, but get caked with dirt, mud, grease and grime, which is immensely gratifying to recreate in miniature with dry brushing, washes, and pigments. If you screw up during constructing, just call it battle damage! Tamiya makes some excellent armor kits, along with just about any other type of military hardware and/or accoutrement you could ask for, including but not limited to <a href="https://zdcs.link/oeYDg?object_uuid=cfd6c3fb-50a7-497a-ae84-c528d48b421d&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u>1:35 scale farm animals.</u></a></p><div><div id="203007" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Hasegawa 1:72 AV-8B Harrier II Plus</h3></p><div><p>This 87-piece build is great for intermediate builders. The AV-8B Harrier II is  redesigned from the previous generation.</p></div></div><div id="203008" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Hasegawa 1:48 AV-8B Harrier II</h3></p><div><p>This 166-piece build has an impressive scale down from the complex form of the Harrier II.</p></div></div></div><p>The scale of models can be a little confusing, but it’s just fractions. A 1:1 scale model is life size, 1:2 scale is 50% the size of the real thing, and so on. However, different subject matter is suited best to certain scales. Cars are usually 1:/24 or 1:32, and the standard for military ground vehicles, like tanks and trucks and infantry, is generally 1:35. Larger aircraft models are 1:48, but 1:72 isn’t uncommon, and when you get into larger naval vehicles it gets even more fractional. There’s plenty of overlap, so if you want a little truck to go next to your 1:48 helicopter, it probably exists somewhere out there. The scale of railroad models is the gauge of the miniature train tracks being used, which I’m not even going to go into here. The point is: You can get a big Harrier jet or little Harrier Jet, or you can buy two big ones and pretend it’s a mommy and a daddy and a baby jet.</p><h2>Car Model Kits</h2><div id="203011" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Hasegawa 621123 Model Car BMW 2002 Tii 1:24 Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>A classic BMW car model kit that brings a little bit of a challenge.</p></div></div><p>I am admittedly not much of a car guy. My dad, on the other hand, is very much the opposite. As a Father’s Day gift one year, I tracked down Hasegawa’s 1:24 BMW 2002 Tii kit, and painted it to look like a real car he’s been tinkering with and repeatedly repairing for the last few decades. He loved the gift and I had a great time putting it together. The amount of detail and tiny parts in a kit like this might be overwhelming for a novice modeler, but it’ll certainly keep you busy.</p><div id="202999" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Revell Revell of Germany 07051 McLaren 570S</h3></p><div><p>Tip: Get yourself the Revell of Germany kits and not the American ones. Only 8 left in stock of this one!</p></div></div><p>Two companies called Revell make model kits: Revell USA and Revell of Germany. The general consensus among the model building community is that the ones from Germany are excellent and the American Revell kits leave a lot to be desired. I’ve only built the American ones, and I wasn’t impressed.</p><div><div id="203014" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Aoshima Aoshima Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4 11 1:24 Scale Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>This Lambo includes exclusive parts for the R-SV such as the body and engine, plus scissor doors you can open up.</p></div></div><div id="203015" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Aoshima Aoshima Volkswagen 13AD Beetle 1303S ’73 1:24 Model Kit</h3></p><div><p>VW fans love this kit based on the classic 1973 Beetle.</p></div></div><div id="203016" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Aoshima Aoshima Bunka Kyozai 1:24 Mobile Sales Series No. 8 Yakitori Ryuho Plastic Model</h3></p><div><p>This realistic reproduction of a food truck is adorable!</p></div></div></div><p>What’s your dream car? A Lamborghini? What about a kebab truck? Aoshima makes a range of great vehicles, from luxury supercars to civilian automobiles to a surprisingly broad selection of funny little food trucks. </p><h2>How to Get Started with Model Kits</h2><h3>Tools:</h3><div id="202992" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>BXQINLENX  8-Piece Model Tools Set</h3></p><div><p>This basic tool set is ideal for beginners. Tools include pliers, a carving knife, blades, sanding tools, and tweezers. Plus, it comes in a plastic case to take on the go and store the tools in.</p></div></div><p>This is a great little set of tools to get started. If you get serious, it’s worth investing in a nice pair of hobby shears, side-cutters or “nippers” for cutting the individual parts off the runners. The cleaner the cut, the less trimming, filing and sanding needed during assembly. I have a pair of Tamiya side-cutters that I swear by, but the God-tier option in this department is the “God Hand” line (not to be confused with the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/10/10/god-hand-review"><u>PlayStation 2 game IGN gave a controversially bad score</u></a> to a million years ago).</p><div id="202991" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>anezus 12inch x 18inch Rotary Cutting Mat Double Sided 5-Ply Craft Cutting Board</h3></p><div><p>Multipurpose craft mat and cutting board for model builds, cutting, engraving and beyond.</p></div></div><p>A sturdy cutting mat is helpful for not ruining your dining room table and getting yelled at, and also for easily moving your entire project away from the dining room table because you have company coming over and you don’t want people to see the funny little things you make in your spare time. </p><div id="202988" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Tamiya 87038 Extra Thin Cement Glue Fine Tip 40ml</h3></p><div><p>Ditch the glue! Grab some model cement to fill in tiny gaps in your plastic kits or to fuse two pieces together.</p></div></div><p>Model cement is different from regular glue in that it’s actually a solvent that slightly melts the plastic where applied, letting you fuse parts together. This makes it effectively useless on other materials, but for plastic kits, it’s my favorite. A tiny brush is built into the lid, so you just hold two pieces of your model together and apply a drop where they touch. The cement is so thin it’ll usually flow into the crack on its own. </p><h3>Paint:</h3><p>Without venturing into the messy, expensive, and frequently frustrating world of airbrush operation and maintenance, my preferred method of painting models is with a combination of “rattle cans” and water-based acrylics. Primer is key because it gives the surface a finish that paint will adhere to more easily than bare plastic. It’s possible to use regular spray paint from a hardware store, but it comes out thicker and can very easily ruin any fine details. Cans of hobby spray paint produce a fine mist, which is much easier to apply carefully. </p><div id="202982" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>GSI Creos Mr. Hobby B519 Mr. Surfacer 1000 Large Spray</h3></p><div><p>A go-to primer for model kits, Mr. Hobby is a trusted brand for plastic builds.</p></div></div><p>Mr. Hobby’s Mr. Surfacer is an excellent primer that will even out the appearance of a kit prior to painting, covering up imperfections in the plastic while also providing a nice matte finish that paint will stick to really well.</p><div id="202979" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Vallejo Vallejo Basic USA Acrylic Colors Paint Set</h3></p><div><p>The Vallejo brand brings model builders a non-toxic paint set option for model kits and miniatures. Coming in a pack of 16 assorted colors, this set was made for use on both metal and plastic, leaving no brushstrokes behind.</p></div></div><p>Unlike lacquers or enamels, water-based acrylic paint doesn’t need any special thinners or solvents when it comes to mixing or cleanup. Vallejo’s Model Color line comes in every shade imaginable, and the dropper bottles make it easier to avoid spills. </p><div id="202977" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Tamiya Tamiya 86034 PS-34 Bright Red Spray Paint, 100ml Spray Can</h3></p><div><p>This classic red paint comes in a 100ml spray can and brings your model kits a nice, matte finish. It's high quality for its price.
</p></div></div><p>Tamiya has a whole rainbow of hobby-grade spray lacquer, which is a great alternative to hand-painting large areas and worrying about brushstrokes. If the model is mostly one color, laying down a base coat and then doing the details by hand is a good system. It’s unlikely you’ll use an entire can of paint on one kit, so if you grab a color or two per kit, over time you’ll likely collect a nice variety.</p><p>Like any good hobby, model making is basically a bottomless pit of enjoyably wasted time (that’s not actually wasted if you enjoyed yourself). No matter how good you are at it, you’ll inevitably come across someone who’s so much better than you it makes you want to give up entirely. On the bright side, a lot of experts share their work online along with handy tips and tutorials for any skill level. On YouTube, a few accounts you may want to check out are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SpruesNBrews" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>SpruesNBrews</u></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NightShiftScaleModels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>NightShift</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JunsMiniGarage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Jun’s Mini Garage</u></a>.

Happy modeling! </p><h2>Model Kit FAQs</h2><h3>Where is the best place to buy model kits?</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Amazon</strong>: You can find some awesome deals throughout the year, but you’ll also want to be wary of resellers marking up prices. If you find something you like, it’s always worth googling it to see what the going rate is.</li><li><strong>HobbyLink Japan</strong>: Model making is a hobby that requires patience, and sometimes that starts before you even get the kit. HLJ is the biggest online Japanese hobby shop and has a flat-out overwhelming selection of model kits and supplies, plus toys, statues, gacha machine prices, apparel, books, and even adults-only stuff you probably won’t find many places outside of Japan. The catch? Shipping is usually expensive, slow, or both. The cheapest option can take four to seven months to arrive. Cost is generally calculated based on size rather than weight (model kits are big, but light) so it often makes sense to save up and order a bunch of stuff at once.</li><li><strong>MegaHobby:</strong> I haven’t used this one personally, but it’s also got a great selection and it seems like most stuff ships out in six months or sooner.</li><li><a href="https://store.ign.com/collections/model-kits" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>IGN Store</strong></a><strong>:</strong> We've got a modest but solid selection of kits on there, generally of the anime/pop-culture variety. (The best-sellers from HLJ occasionally show up on the IGN Store.) New items are added regularly, and older stuff goes on sale, so it’s worth checking back regularly. </li><li><strong>Your local hobby shop:</strong> No, really! See if there’s a hobby shop near you, and go support it. Those are a dying breed and the people who work there will often actually know what they’re talking about, and it’s also a great place to meet fellow builders of small things. Bear in mind that model building is a broad hobby, and hobby shops usually cater to one particular corner of it. The 80-year-old WWII diorama builder might not know what a Perfect Grade Exia Gundam is, and the kid with a Char Aznable tattoo may not know what a Panzerkampfwagen is, but they both can most likely tell you about drybrushing, panel lines, and gunk wash.</li></ul><p><em>Max Scoville is a senior writer, host and producer for IGN covering video games, movies, toys and collectibles.

One such fan is my wife, who doesn't seem to like any video games at all but absolutely <em>loves </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/super-monkey-ball">Super Monkey Ball games</a>. She played the first Super Monkey Ball game on the Gamecube obsessively and talks about it every time we have any sort of discussion about gaming. So naturally, as soon as I found out Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble was on sale, I immediately picked it up.</p><p>Truthfully, I too am a fan of these games and am very much looking forward to playing it as well.

With an impressive set of 200 courses across 20 worlds, we've concluded that this is classic Monkey ball at it's finest. Our own Nintendo expert <a href="https://www.ign.com/person/MrHurgy">Logan Plant</a> had the chance to go hands on with the game and here's a quick snippet of what he thought in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-review">our review</a>:</p><p>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble was release just last month on June 25 and this is the first and biggest discount we've seen on this game. It's especially surprising after a rather lackluster showing of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-prime-day-nintendo-switch-deals">Prime Day Switch deals</a> earlier this week. If you've been hoping to pick up this game at a discount, now is the time to do so.<br>

<p>After the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ftc-criticizes-xbox-game-pass-price-hike-labeling-it-consumer-harm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly stated that the recent price increase</a> and tier changes to Xbox Game Pass would inflict “consumer harm”, Microsoft has come back with a message of their own.</p>



<p>In a new filing (via <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24888929-20240719-filed-ecf-appellees-microsoft-corporation-and-activision-blizzard-inc-citation-of-supplemental-a?responsive=1&amp;title=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>), Microsoft says that the FTC’s letter is “misleading” and gives an “extra-record account of the facts.”</p>



<p>“It is wrong to call this [Xbox Game Pass Standard] a “degraded” version of the discontinued Game Pass for Console offering,” Microsoft says.</p>



<p>“That discontinued product did not offer multiplayer functionality, which had to be purchased separately for an additional $9.99/month (making the total cost $20.98/month). While Game Pass Ultimate’s price will increase from $16.99 to $19.99/month, the service will offer more value through many new games available “day-and-date.” Among them is the upcoming release of Call of Duty, which has never before been available on a subscription day-and-date.”</p>



<p>The letter adds that the FTC “barely mentioned” during the trial surrounding Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The focus of the trial as that Microsoft could keep Call of Duty off of PlayStation consoles. That, Microsoft says, has nothing to do with the price and tier changes to Game Pass.</p>



<p>“While the FTC has now tried to shift focus to its alleged subscription market, its letter does not map onto its arguments below,” Microsoft said. “Setting aside that it is common for businesses to change service offerings over time, the FTC’s case in all of its alleged markets has always been premised on vertical foreclosure, i.e., that Microsoft would withhold Call of Duty from rivals and therefore harm competition. But even in the alleged subscription market, Call of Duty is not being withheld from anyone who wants it.”</p>



<p>The letter closes with the company saying that there is “no evidence” to harming competition. </p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-review.932475/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>How quickly can you get that very first mushroom in Super Mario Bros. World 1-1? I’m talking down to the millisecond. Shaving off each mushroomy-millisecond, or tackling similarly bite-sized challenges like killing four Oktoroks on a single screen of The Legend of Zelda or leaping to the top of an alien-infested shaft in Metroid, is the most fun I’ve had in Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition, which once again remixes the legendary 1980s library. Unlike WarioWare, NES Remix, and Super Mario 99, though, this time it’s solely focused on speedrunning, and though lacking in challenge variety, it’s still a fun to play these old games in a new way.</p><p>The challenges range from short – such as beating the entire first level of Super Mario Bros – to shorter, and surprisingly the shortest ones are the best. You are ranked on a scale and rewarded with letter grades for the slightest of gains, so repeating the three jumps it takes to collapse boss Wendy O. Koopa into her candy shell in Super Mario Bros. 3 can be reduced to a series of twitchy arcs, mesmerizingly burned into your eyeballs and muscle memory, repeated endlessly to get that precious S rank. It’s fun to challenge yourself, especially knowing that you’re developing skills that can be tested online against others.</p><p>That beautiful precision of Mario’s jump (but not Luigi’s, in both versions of Super Mario Bros. 2) lends itself to speedruns. So, in a different way, do Link’s squat little jabs on The Legend of Zelda’s mathematically rigid, grid-based layout that allow you to race through a dungeon by finding just the right path to swat each enemy before moving on. The best games allow for methodical refinement through repetition. </p><p>On the other hand, there’s Kirby: the slowest, least-maneuverable blob Nintendo has invented; well, besides maybe the Ice Climber or Balloon Fight Guy. All three of them are here, and while the speedruns based around these characters aren’t hard, per se, they just aren’t as fun to repeat. Movements are imprecise and make you feel sloppy – not ideal for an aspiring speedrunner, and that means refining skills in those games is tedious. Thankfully, some of the stinkers like Balloon Fight and Ice Climbers have very few challenges to overcome, so they aren’t much of an obstacle to 100%-ing Nintendo World Championships. However, Kirby’s Adventure, inexplicably, has the most of any game in this collection save SMB3, as if it is some sort of speedrunning icon we should all be aspiring to conquer. It simply is not.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The biggest impediment to aspiring speedrunners is the Switch’s Joy-Con controllers.</p></div><p>The biggest impediment to aspiring speedrunners in Nintendo World Championships is the Switch’s Joy-Con controllers. NES games require precision button presses, and the lag-free Switch handheld mode should be a perfect match (turn on your lag-free Game Mode on that TV when docked!) but the Joy-Cons’ terrible analog sticks, A and B button placement, and whatever those <em>not-a-D-pad buttons </em>are supposed to be, render Nintendo World Championships’ challenges all but unplayable on an out-of-the-box Switch. A clean pair of jumps up that blocky pyramid at the end of Super Mario Bros. World 1-1 at mach speed with the Joy-Con is either impossible, or so unlikely I’ve yet to pull it off once. They simply do not respond to the quickness or accuracy of button pressing the way you need. Luckily, a Pro Controller or other respectable third-party gamepad solves these issues, although the analog stick is still much better than the <em>not-a-D-pad</em> on the Pro. Perhaps the NES controller accessory is the best and most authentic way to play these NES-based games, but I haven’t been able to test it, and the Pro served me well enough.</p><p>The meta goal of Nintendo World Championships is to unlock large grids of things through your speedrun scores and online victories. You can unlock more microgames (there are 156 in total) and cosmetics like pins and pixelated avatars which appear alongside your character in multiplayer. Unlocking everything in a single game’s category unlocks a Legendary challenge, which range from beating an entire dungeon in Kid Icarus or Zelda II, to just straight up beating Super Mario Bros., top to bottom. </p><p>Now, beating Super Mario Bros., even taking it slow, is no small feat – World 8-3 and 8-4 are difficult levels by yesterday’s <em>and </em>today’s standards. But in Nintendo World Championships' runs, dying only sends you back a few seconds to try again. Even though you lose precious time, you won’t need to replay from the start to complete a run – and if you fail to zoom under Bowser’s weird little feet in the end of World 8-4 on the first attempt, you can try again and likely still get the grade you were going for. In this way, I was able to brute force completion of every mission, allowing me to unlock everything and pick and choose what I wanted to replay and refine. I did, however, have to grind for a few minutes occasionally in the online modes to get all the points I needed to unlock every offline microgame quickly (I unlocked and played all 156 in about four hours), and you should be aware that anyone without the required Nintendo Online subscription won’t have access to the online modes (which are some of the fastest point gains) and will have to grind by repeating microgames offline instead.</p><p>Speaking of online modes, there are two: World Championship and Survival Mode. World Championship selects five microgames once a week, giving you seven days to submit your best time across them. The times are ranked world-wide and by your birth year, which sure is amusing – I feel better being judged against my OG NES gamer peers and not the hot new child prodigies with superhuman reflexes. It’s fun to log your best scores, but I wish it would show me what the current leaderboards look like rather than holding them until the end. Competing against a black box (and not being able to watch competitors until after the challenge week concludes) seriously dampens the thrill. </p><p>Meanwhile, Survival Mode is an elimination round that has you playing against the ghost data of other players – basically previously recorded videos of other players that happen on your screen at the same time you’re playing – that you have to best to proceed. The three rounds are always made up of the same games (in alternating orders) that, you guessed it, refresh weekly. This weekly cycle seems oddly limiting – in this competition you at least get results immediately, but after you play the two weekly Survival Mode challenges, all that’s left to do is play them again for points to spend on unlocking items. </p><p>If online modes are a bit stunted by the weekly waits for leaderboards and new challenges, at least the couch competitive mode that allows for up to eight players (sorry anyone stuck with sideways Joy-Cons!) has more immediately accessible content at the ready. In this mode you can compete on one-off games or pre-packaged sets of microgames where points are doled out and a victor declared at the end. The main issue with these is, like in multiplayer WarioWare or Mario Party minigames, those who have practiced the microgames ahead of time will inevitably have a leg up. So inviting seven friends over to watch you win every time is a party foul until they catch up – it’s unlikely that anyone will get the exact pattern right to kill four Oktoroks in the most efficient manner possible on some random The Legend of Zelda screen without having practiced. Luckily, you can choose to practice each microgame as the competition proceeds. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Like NES Remix and WarioWare before it, Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition offers a good way to revisit challenging moments from a selection of classic NES games. The small library has more winners than losers – the shorter and more instantly repeatable the better – and even the silliest of tasks (like refilling Kid Icarus’s life by wallowing in a hot spring) can be goofy fun. Challenging yourself to improve or competing with your friends has some lasting appeal, but the weekly cycle of the online events artificially limits the fun. With its lovingly portrayed and accurate pixel art, music, and gameplay, these sample-sized portions of chopped up ROMs can serve as a good entrypoint for discovering and understanding their appeal for the first time.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s just not every character’s death throw voice line would reveal a possible familial tie. Apparently, eliminating Mei as Juno triggers a voice-over exchange in which the Martian hero says, “Sorry, Auntie!” in response to Mei’s dying gasp. </p><p>This tidbit of gameplay lore is significant not only in that it might confirm the hero shooter’s fourth familial tie among its heroes, but it also seems to debunk a key fan theory about Juno’s identity.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="es" dir="ltr">AUNTIE?! <a href="https://t.co/LYlwwoVNCu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/LYlwwoVNCu</a></p>— Hazelet (@HazeletOW) <a href="https://twitter.com/HazeletOW/status/1814361289537495229?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 19, 2024</a></blockquote> <h2>Juno and Jiayi</h2><p>Late last year, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/17nfh6j/space_ranger_is_99_jiayi_meis_friend_that_works/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>r/Overwatch</u></a> thread theorized that Juno—then known as Space Ranger—was a woman named Jiayi. According to the thread’s original poster, Mei had a new voice line that would trigger while at Lijiang Control Center, where she would reminisce over a friend named Jiaya, who she went to grad school with. </p><p>Seeing as how this voice line cropped up a month prior to Juno’s reveal at Blizzcon 2023, fans quickly began theorizing that Jiayi was the government name for Juno. At the time, the theory seemed solid, considering Lijiang is the location of Overwatch 2’s in-universe Chinese space station, and Juno’s whole gimmick is that she’s an astronaut hailing from Mars. </p><p>This theory took on new life a day before Juno’s limited-time release when X/Twitter user Pampurins posited that <a href="https://x.com/pampurins/status/1813975199458775106?t=yhhk2G2um7mPg7mZqKKKYQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Jiayi could actually be the name of Juno’s mother</u></a>. Pampurin’s revised theory sounds like it's right on the money thanks to the newly discovered voice line interaction.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Shroomiiee (@mushroomiiee) <a href="https://twitter.com/mushroomiiee/status/1814366135648920000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 19, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>While the voice line appears to be considered hard proof that the two are aunt and niece, there’s also a high probability that it is also just a term of endearment, seeing as how the word aunt is commonly used to address older women. IGN has reached out to Blizzard for comment. Regardless, players will likely get an earful of the special voice line interaction during Juno’s weekend of play before her full release comes Season 12 on August 20.</p><p>Isaiah Colbert is a freelance writer for IGN.

Pleasingly bizarre four-wheeled survival game Pacific Drive has officially sold 600K copies, and its developer Ironwood Studios has announced it's celebrating that milestone with a series of content updates throughout the rest of this year. And the first of those updates is now live, offering a bunch of free additions, as well as a bit of daft cosmetic DLC.
</p>
<p>
Pacific Drive's first free update lets players document their travels across the anomaly riddled forests of the Olympic Exclusion Zone using a new photo mode. It's available right from the pause menu and gives player access to various camera settings - including depth of field, focus control, and exposure - as well as numerous aesethetic filters. It's also possible to change weather conditions and time of day while you're in there.
</p>
<p>
Photo mode arrives alongside the new Juke Jet car ability which, once mounted on your station wagon's side rack, provides a horizontal boost that should be handy for dodging and drifting. There're also two new upgrade nodes to be found in the garage's Fabrication Station, unlocking the Smart Matter Deconstructor and Vargas Auto-Pac-Vac. The first lets players toss junk into the Matter Constructor from anywhere in the garage, while the latter deposits materials into the transfer trunk before being filling the rest of the vacuum storage.

<p>
Elsewhere, there's a new performance mode specifically for the PS5 version of Pacific Drive, new points and interest and worldbuilding details in Junctions, a new Coastal Highway map, a new Believer Sticker and Golden Hood Ornament, and more - as outlined in Ironwood's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1458140/view/4370264092250152801">patch notes</a>.
</p>
<p>
The free update (officially version 1.6.2) arrives alongside a new bit of paid DLC known as the Friendly Dumpster Customisation Pack. This features a selection of trash-themed cosmetic items for decorating your station wagon, including the Re-Cycled Steering Wheel, Dumpster Devotee decal kit, Gift Shifter, Air Trashener, Dumpster Idol, and Cuddle Can.
</p>

<p>
As detailed in Pacific Drive's new 2024 post-launch roadmap, this selection of summer DLC will be followed by two more releases before the end of the year. This autumn, players can expect a free update featuring new difficulty modes, game customisation settings, and cosmetics, alongside another paid cosmetics pack. That'll be followed by a winter update, but details around that remain under wraps. More will be revealed "in the coming months".
</p>
<p>
And if you've not yet taken Pacific Drive and its sentient station wagon for a ride through its gorgeous weird rendition of the Pacific Northwest, it's well worth investigating. Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell called it an "exhausting, oddly lovable nightmare" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pacific-drive-review">four star review</a>, and there's currently 40 percent off, meaning you can pick it up for £14.99 on PS5 and PC.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-has-no-plans-to-delay-star-wars-outlaws/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After posting an exclusive 10-minute gameplay video of Star Wars Outlaws <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-M1Lu6iVhg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to IGN's YouTube</a>, Ubisoft has come under a tirade of negative feedback and commentary on what they have seen in the game. The video received more dislikes than likes, which is troubling. In just 24 hours of the video being uploaded to YouTube, the video received 13,000 dislikes to a ratio of 8,000 likes.</p>
<p>However, Ubisoft seems highly confident that people will love Star Wars Outlaws and has no plans to delay the game in any capacity. Despite the negativity being spread online, Star Wars Outlaws is still set for the August 30 release.</p>
<p>The negative commentary was so severe that a financial analyst from Bank of America commented on the situation and asked Ubisoft during yesterday's earnings call whether they were considering delaying the game. While the answer of a firm "no" is in place, they have assured the audience that there is more gameplay footage to come, and it will showcase the game and the wonders players have to look forward to.</p>
<p>From experience, Ubisoft has delayed games to improve them after receiving negative feedback from the audience. However, Star Wars Outlaws has already gone gold, so there is no chance of the game being delayed for further polishing or adjustments.</p>
<p>The feedback for the game seems to be mixed. While there's a general discomfort about Star Wars's fate as a franchise and how it is seeping into every part of the entertainment industry with multiple spin-offs and stories, there are also those who are incredibly excited about a new way to jump into the Star Wars universe.</p>
<p>However, judging by the feedback on YouTube, some feel that Ubisoft has recycled<a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-wont-feature-ubisofts-open-world-house-style-swears-massive/"> the typical open world experience</a> and slapped the Star Wars label onto it. Others felt that the visual effects present in the gameplay video just weren't up to scratch. For a game so close to release, the gameplay video suggests an air of unpolished environments, and the AI for the enemies is shaping up to be quite janky.</p>
<p>Granted, YouTube commentary often veers on the negative, especially against certain companies and franchises. Star Wars is one of those, particularly after the highly controversial The Acolyte Disney Plus series, which has an astoundingly low 3.8/10 score from user reviews on IMDB.</p>
<p>The final reception to the actual game has yet to be seen. While we wait for the verdict, you can find everything we know about Star Wars Outlaws <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/star-wars-outlaws-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-open-world-game-in-the-far-far-away-galaxy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in this article</a>.</p>

                <p>About 10 to 15 years ago, Capcom entered a lull.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-kickstarter-head-of-games-is-former-exploding-kittens-senior-sales-manager<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new Kickstarter head of games has been named. In an attempt to remain competitive with other crowdfunding platforms, Kickstarter's newest Head of Games is one with considerable experience in tabletop marketing, specifically the anarchic card game <em>Exploding Kittens</em>.</p>

<p>According to a report by <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2024/07/19/kickstarters-new-head-of-games-is-ex-exploding-kittens-greater-than-games-sales-specialist-maggie-clayton/">Board Game Wire</a>, the new Kickstarter head of games is Maggie Clayton, replacing Jon Ritter-Roderick. Clayton spent three years as the senior sales manager and North American sales manager for Exploding Kittens Inc.. The company behind a card game so popular it spawned an <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/exploding-kittens-good-vs-evil-card-game-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank">animated Netflix series</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/exploding-kittens-goggles-might-explode-on-you-product-recall-issued" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recalled goggles</a>, and "<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/exploding-kittens-to-produce-limited-run-printable-nfts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">printable NFTs</a>".</p>

This is the studio behind the superhero deckbuilder <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sentinels-multiverse-learn-play-edition-launches-today" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Sentinels of the Multiverse</em></a><em> </em>and the award-winning cooperative strategy game <em>Spirit Island</em>.</p>
<p>Kickstarter's director of outreach, Nick Yulman, had this to say about Clayton's appointment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Maggie’s deep industry experience and respected standing make her an ideal leader for our games team. Her background in marketing and sales at Exploding Kittens, and her collaborations with indie creators at Greater Than Games, give her a comprehensive understanding of what it takes to bring games to life.</p>
<p>It’s striking how beloved she is in the industry – experienced creators and former colleagues have all sung her praises. I’m excited for her to bring a fresh vision to Games at Kickstarter, build on our success, and ensure that we remain the premier platform for launching games.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The appointment of Clayton as the new Kickstarter head of games may be due to rising pressure from competing crowdfunding platforms. According to a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24054381/kickstarter-top-10-biggest-most-backed-board-games-campaigns-2023">Polygon report</a>, tabletop projects on Kickstarter have been in decline since 2022. The platform also garnered controversy regarding its policies on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/23873453/kickstarters-ai-disclosure-terraforming-mars-release-date-price">generative AI</a> and removing alleged NFT-grift <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wonders-of-first-ccg-to-be-removed-from-kickstarter" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Wonders of the First</em></a> from the platform.</p>
<p>For contrast, two other tabletop crowdfunding platforms have come into their own with major success stories. Gamefound has hosted multiple successful campaigns such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/stalker-board-game-coming-to-gamefound" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Stalker The Board Game</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/song-of-ice-fire-tactics-fully-funded-in-under-7-hours" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>A Song of Ice &amp; Fire: Tactics</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/elder-scrolls-betrayal-of-second-era-is-gamefound-hit" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Elder Scrolls: Betrayal of the Second Era</em></a>.</p>
<p>The second platform is Backerkit. While having a lower market share than Kickstarter, the platform has hosted several high-profile projects from industry staples. These include Steve Jackson Games' <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/munchkin-big-box-brings-definitive-game-to-backerkit" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Munchkin Big Box</em></a> and a reprint campaign for Monte Cook Games' cosmic fantasy TTRPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/invisible-sun-return-of-black-cube-live-now-on-backerkit" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I</a><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/invisible-sun-return-of-black-cube-live-now-on-backerkit" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>nvisible Sun: Return of the Black Cube</em></a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24202067/sim-lab-formula-one-racing-gaming-mercedes-amg-petronas<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sim-Lab has just released a new <a href="https://sim-lab.eu/en-us/products/mercedes-amg-petronas-formula-one-team-sim-racing-steering-wheel-2024">$2,499 steering wheel</a> it claims is&nbsp;an “authentic as possible” replica of the wheels Lewis Hamilton uses while driving the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team’s race cars. It’s a lovely piece of hardware to just stare at but a reminder that getting really into simulators can be dangerous for your budget.</p><p>If that price tag has your jaw on the floor, don’t bother picking it up. You can’t just plug the steering wheel into your PC and hit the simulated streets of Montreal. It needs to be attached to a wheelbase, which translates the steering wheel’s turning motions and button inputs to a racing game while also providing force feedback. Those can also set you back several thousand dollars, and one isn’t included with this wheel.</p><p>What makes Sim-Lab’s new wheel so pricey? For starters, it’s officially licensed from the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team, who shared the computer-aided design (CAD) data it uses to build the steering wheels for its multimillion-dollar cars. Sim-Lab’s wheel is as close as you can get to racing with one without replacing Lewis Hamilton as the team’s driver when he moves to team Ferrari next year.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</p><div><figcaption><em>There are nine rotary dials dotting the front of the steering wheel.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Sim-Lab</cite></p></div></div><p>The steering wheel’s body is also a handmade carbon fiber shell. That not only helps it weigh 1,240 grams, but it also ensures it’s extremely rigid, so vibrations and resistance provided by a wheelbase are precisely translated to a gamer’s hands. It’s not going to creak and flex as you steer into a simulated corner at over 150mph.</p><p>Scattered across the wheel are nine rotary dials, 12 buttons, two switches, carbon fiber shifting paddles, anti-static silicone rubber grips, and 25 controllable RGB LEDs providing telemetry data at a glance. If that’s not enough data, the center of the wheel also features a 4.3-inch LCD screen with data layouts that match what Mercedes F1 drivers see.</p><p>To most of us, it might seem like an obscene splurge, but for racing sim fans striving to recreate an authentic F1 experience, the only thing seemingly missing is race engineer Bono <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thef1club/video/6978480535169420549?lang=en">telling them</a> “Okay, Lewis, it’s hammer time.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Think <em>Gears</em>&nbsp;<em>of War</em>’s horde mode with swords instead of guns and the sensibility of the PS2 classic <em>Okami</em>.

You control Soh, a masked warrior guarding the Maiden Yoshiro on her way to get rid of evil spirits called Festering Seethe that have taken over a mountain and corrupted its inhabitants. There’s almost no dialogue and hardly any story. Cutscenes are brief and few and far-between. Instead, <em>Path of the Goddess</em> quickly shuttles you from one level to the next, its main campaign neatly organized between escort missions, boss battles, and time spent rebuilding the places you’ve liberated from the Seethe. It feels refreshingly old-school in that regard.</p><p>Each stage begins at dawn. You run around building defenses and traps, purging the defilement from animals, plants, and villagers, and collecting translucent pink orbs left behind that serve as a key resource. These orbs are spent to carve a path forward for Yoshiro so she can slowly conduct her cleansing ritual across the map. They’re also required to upgrade villagers to various roles from melee wood cutters and long-range archers to shaman healers and tanky sumo wrestlers. Spend all the orbs on Yoshiro and you’ll be defenseless. Waste all of them on your allies and she’ll be dead in the water. </p><figure id="" data-id="e0ed667c6757125ce6edf879547cc309" data-recommend-id="image://e0ed667c6757125ce6edf879547cc309" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Maiden sits at a table where Soh can buy upgrades.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After a few minutes, night falls and the Seethe begin arriving through gates and attacking in waves. While villagers can take down small enemies no problem, bigger ones require swift attention. This is where <em>Path of the Goddess</em>’ action gameplay comes in. Soh has basic single-button-press combos that do decent damage, but adding a heavy attack to the end of each of them strings together a series of dancing sword attacks that you can steer but not cancel. It’s like winding up a toy ballerina and then watching it slash through hordes of enemies. It’s a small but novel innovation that makes combat feel fluid and rewarding even at its most simple and repetitive.<br></p><p><em>Path of the Goddess</em> doesn’t stop there, though. Soh has a dodge and guard attack complete with timed-parry mechanics that add an extra level of depth. Repeated attacks will momentarily stagger an enemy but Soh’s guard can be broken, too, if it’s used too many times in a row, leaving him frozen and vulnerable for a few seconds. Soh also has a special meter that slowly fills up, letting him unleash various ultimate attacks that can turn the tide of a fight in key moments.</p><p>It’s a tight combat loop that slowly gets more interesting over the course of the game as you unlock new abilities and find items that grant you special perks. A small skill wheel lets you invest in a couple dozen upgrades like a higher-risk, higher-reward combat stance as well as charging attacks that break more of an enemy’s stagger meter. The result is moment-to-moment combat that makes you feel strong and agile but not overpowered, built on enough customizable elements that you feel like you have some meaningful options for how to strategize around each new encounter. </p><figure id="" data-id="968f3965fd422e543c3fcb6ccf321c5f" data-recommend-id="image://968f3965fd422e543c3fcb6ccf321c5f" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Soh dances around enemies in a death trap.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The other big part of that strategy is your villagers. Every time you defeat a boss you earn a new mask that represents a different role you can assign to the villagers helping you on your journey. You start from scratch each mission, enrolling whoever you happen to find along the road in your demon-hunting crusade. Basic roles require fewer orbs but aren’t as strong. Ones like the sumo who aggro enemies or the cannoneer which has a slow rate of fire but does a lot of damage cost more.<br></p><p>All of them have different strengths, weaknesses, and use cases, and one of the many things <em>Path of the Goddess</em> gets right is not making any of them feel obsolete or redundant. My favorite by far, though, is the sorcerer. It charges up a spell that gives you a map-wide super you can use instantly if they’re still alive. It feels like getting a nuke killstreak in<em> Call of Duty</em> and it saved my ass so many times.</p><p>Boss fights, for the most part, prioritize enemy designs and animations over unique mechanics. Most of them look incredible, even if gameplay-wise they weren’t the overall highlight of the game for me. Few things feel better in <em>Path of the Goddess</em> than knocking a giant Seethe on its back and then calling in your troops to unleash hell. I’m still thinking about the giant poison toad my cannoneers all blasted at once with giant fireworks, killing it even while I was still incapacitated. </p><figure id="" data-id="219fec6e7d1ecaa3cccbe41724dd4840" data-recommend-id="image://219fec6e7d1ecaa3cccbe41724dd4840" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A ritual is performed to purge the Seethe.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s only one thing dragging <em>Path of the Goddess</em> down and it’s the settlement rebuilding section. After liberating a village you can go back and explore it free of enemies, which mostly means walking around to various sections and assigning workers to fix a house, bridge, gate, or shrine that is on a timer to complete after a set number of battles. There’s no real need to prioritize one set of repairs over another and the most helpful rewards are for finishing every repair in a particular map location, meaning you’re going to have to get it all done at some point anyway. Thus every cool battle is followed by an unwieldy and perfunctory upkeep phase that would have been easier just to manage from the main map menu.<br></p><p>It’s an undercooked system as far as strategy games go, one that stands out in part because of how well-balanced and thoughtfully crafted so much of the rest of the game is. One thing I especially love about <em>Path of the Goddess</em> is the UI, which feels folded into the very fabric of the experience. Soh’s health is shown via a scroll next to his body, the upgrade menu for his abilities is a sword hilt where you swap out the tassel and runes, and the save screen is a long sheet of folded paper that gets stamped.</p><p>They are the small bits of polish that make an already great game even better, and they remind me of the PS2 era when more games felt like they were trying to explore their own path rather than follow in the footsteps of what everyone else had already done. It’s that spirit of authenticity and unwavering commitment to a distinctive vision that makes<em> Path of the Goddess</em> so refreshing right now, especially at this level of budget, production, and quality. When so many games feel like they could have been made by anybody for nobody, <em>Path of the Goddess</em> feels like something unique made for people who never knew how much they’d love it. Creative swings like that don’t always work out. <em>Path of the Goddess</em> is one that definitely does. </p><p><strong>Buy <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmHENCUNlVA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmHENCUNlVA" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fkunitsugami-path-of-the-goddess%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fkunitsugami-path-of-the-goddess%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humble Bundle</a></span></p><p>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city-board-game-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Listen up chooms, Cyberpunk is back in analog form for a second run. I previously wrote about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-red-combat-zone-tabletop-game-review"><u>Cyberpunk Red: Combat Zone</u></a>, an excellent miniatures game where gangs of plastic figures meet in the streets to spill imaginary blood. The new hardware I’m shouting about is Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City. Yes, more gangs and more blood, but this time it’s a proper board game where factions vie for turf and street cred. It’s less about violence, although there is still some of that, and more about strategically spreading your forces to occupy territory, complete jobs, and establish dominance. </p><p>This new game comes from board game giant CMON Games, publisher of hit titles such as Zombicide (on our list of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-teens">best board games for teens</a>), Blood Rage, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-war-for-arrakis-board-game-review"><u>Dune: War for Arrakis</u></a>. While Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City appears shiny and new, its foundation is an iteration on the underrated 2017 title <a href="https://zdcs.link/4AZeG?object_uuid=eba58f92-25a7-4e66-91b6-4bd6e21d5663&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Godfather: Corleone’s Empire</a>. While the biological tissue shares some DNA, the many additions and tweaks layered atop function as jacked-up cybernetics that give this bad-boy a whole new visage.</p><div catalogid="ff5e2f90-fc39-4ab5-980d-d8e161cccfb6" id="198404"><div id="198404" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City Board Game</h3></p></div><p>Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City is a very fast and sleek affair. On each player’s turn they perform up to two actions by moving a token on their playerboard from its state of ready to spent. These map directly to specific actions, so if you want to build another hideout on the map or upgrade your combat deck with new weapon tech, you need to spend the appropriate token. In addition to futzing around with infrastructure, you will mostly be activating your units and moving them about to secure territory. The three unit types all perform different functions and support alternate strategic paths. Solos push people out of important spaces and start fights. Techies purchase Edgerunner mercenaries to supplement your forces, as well as complete Opportunities–elicit jobs–for points. Lastly, Netrunners jack into the network which is a straightforward mini-game where moving down a track comes with risk and escalating rewards. </p><p>The juice in the action system is in when you decide to recall and reset your action discs. This effectively passes your turn, but it’s the primary way you exploit territory and recruit new figures. This step is necessary, however, as if you’ve already performed a particular action that you want to perform again–such as activating Solos or upgrading your combat deck–you will not be able to again until you reclaim your action tokens. The tempo control here is important, as players dictate the pace and aggression of play depending on how often they reset. It’s a fascinating strategic decision that pulls in several directions and offers various tactical considerations.</p><p>While anyone with even a minor amount of experience with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy board games</a> will readily understand this game’s processes, there is a somewhat tricky learning curve. This is due to the difficulty in parsing the unit types and their associated behavior. Each figure type is denoted by the shape of its base. This isn’t difficult, but it can be confusing to pair the unit types with the action discs and the connected Points of Interest on the map. These POIs are special sub-spaces within each district on the board. Gangs will control these positions with a figure, and they function as either a requirement to purchase an Edgerunner and complete an Opportunity, or they provide bonus resources when you netrun. This confounds new players as they struggle to keep these details straight. After a play or two these quirks will be internalized, but this idiosyncratic triangulation of symbology feels a little inelegant in an otherwise smooth design.</p><p>Everything else feels well polished. Most systems are simple yet unrestrained. Upgrading your combat cards for instance has you plucking two from the deck and choosing one to keep. When you add to your deck you remove an existing card, permanently keeping your hand of combat cards at four. This results in upgrades feeling potent as they cycle relatively quickly and see continual use.</p><p>Combat likewise is fast and brutal. Each player in the area selects one card secretly and then everyone reveals simultaneously. The player with the highest strength card wins the combat, with every other player forced to lose a figure from the area. More importantly, cards trigger scoring benefits, even for the losers. This combination of simple efficiency management with a brutal and uncaring edge is the design philosophy at large. The game, much like Night City itself, is unflinching and uncaring. A bad roll netrunning and your hackers short out and end up cold on the slab. A miscalculation in combat and you lose a key space. Combat itself is almost entirely dependent on your technology and not on the meatbags present in the space. It’s a hard world and you can’t afford to be soft.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The game, much like Night City itself, is unflinching and uncaring.</p></div><p>Almost everything present is concise and not overwrought. While this is an advantage to keeping the pace of play lively even at a max player count, it’s a detriment when it comes to the fiction. It does feel as though you are commanding gangers and sowing some chaos, but the narrative threads are relatively thin. Those expecting an adventure comparable to the Cyberpunk 2077 video game will be disappointed. </p><p>The setting here mostly functions as graphic design and a background presence. Opportunities suffer the most, as these jobs of stealing contraband and performing sanctioned hits are described with vibrant titles and brief story snippets, but the fiction is irrelevant and everyone quickly learns to bypass those surface elements and just worry about the mechanical implications. It never feels as though you’re pulling off heists or wild contracts, rather, you’re just grabbing another card in a simple game of set collection.</p><p>To the design team’s credit, they sought to address this failing. One of the most interesting aspects of Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City is the story system. These are narrative scenarios that lay atop the existing game, providing new rules and entire sub-systems to engage. Often, they provide additional ways to earn victory points or unique rewards. They also feature branching story elements, allowing the scenario to veer off in one of two directions.</p><p>The story system injects a much needed element of fiction into the game and frames the action around a prescribed narrative. Like the other mechanisms, they’re not intensely detailed, so you’re not reading lengthy paragraphs. Instead, cards offer a couple sentences of context. The achievement here is in how they connect surprise and drama into the mechanical framework of the game. This system is fantastic, marred perhaps slightly by the fact that they often present situations that randomly favor certain gangs. Each gang possesses an asymmetric ability which typically pushes them towards one or two strategic pathways in the game, and sometimes these story events can inhibit or outright neuter one of those pursuits. It can be frustrating, but the unpredictability of the narrative and how it influences the game is well worth the cost.</p><p>There is also a nagging concern that some may hop into this game and then become dissuaded when they realize there is a truckload of additional content, with the majority being exclusive to the previous <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cmon/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crowdfunding campaign</a> and unavailable at retail. The base game is substantial and a compelling strategy game that feels complete, but there’s no shaking the agony that afflicts some consumers when they realize they can’t get all of the extra expansions that were previously available.</p><p>Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City isn’t quite the augmented behemoth that several of CMON’s best titles are, but it is a very interesting game with several qualities that are stimulating. Its greatest assets will be teased out by those familiar with the intellectual property, but the sturdy mechanical foundation certainly doesn’t hurt. There is a solid chance this ends up as one of the publisher’s most underrated titles, not garnering the respect it deserves, and that would be a shame. </p><h3>Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/dMEYp?object_uuid=eba58f92-25a7-4e66-91b6-4bd6e21d5663&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Bdxb8?object_uuid=eba58f92-25a7-4e66-91b6-4bd6e21d5663&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Get it at Asmodee</a></li></ul></div></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 19, 2024 7:45 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>This is a solid game of gang-on-gang warfare that is as concerned with efficiently managing actions and resources as it is in dishing out bloodshed.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Rockstar's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-warriors/" data-ref-id="5000-20017">The Warriors</a> is one of the oddest games that the GTA developer ever released, though it's quite enjoyable in its own right. According to a recent report from retro gaming site <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/07/rockstar-came-extremely-close-to-releasing-the-warriors-on-gba" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Time Extension</a>, Rockstar came extremely close to releasing a GBA port of the game around 2005, but it was ultimately canned.</p><p dir="ltr">The Time Extension piece attributes the information to an anonymous former Rockstar Games employee. That employee says that the game was essentially finished when it was canceled in 2005, and that it used tech from Rockstar Leeds' GBA port of Max Payne, including the game engine. The piece also states that there's at least one copy of the game out there, but it hasn't yet seen a release due to potential legal concerns.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aLEc6aSe8k" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-aLEc6aSe8k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">According to the source, the GBA Warriors had four-player co-op through the console's link cable, and it was "fun to play." However, it never saw the light of day because the PSP was gaining momentum, and Rockstar was decidedly on the Sony side of the platform war. The employee also cites Nintendo's apparent dislike for promoting M-rated games as a factor in the decision. Rockstar developed a number of original GTA games for the PSP, including Liberty City Stories, but also developed Chinatown Wars for the DS.</p><p dir="ltr">Later in the piece, the source says that Rockstar Leeds was set to work on a Nintendo DS port of Rockstar's classic PS2 game Bully before it was canceled due to similar reasons. However, Time Extension notes that it was not able to fully confirm this latter claim. A few years ago, we learned about Rockstar's shelved plans for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstars-shelved-bully-2-plans-reportedly-revealed/1100-6499266/" data-ref-id="1100-6499266">Bully 2</a>, which would've featured a map three times larger than the original game.</p>

			<p>Not only is there the pre-expansion update coming soon to World of Warcraft, but the actual expansion itself isn't far away at all. For those looking forward to the new expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-wows-most-ambitious-story-arc-to-date-launches-august-26-pre-orders-live-now/">The War Within</a> will arrive at World of Warcraft on 26 August. If you want to get stuck, this guide will tell you what to do before The War Within update comes out.</p>
<h2>Preparing for The War Within Pre-patch</h2>
<p>If you like to farm for mounts or achievements, some will be much harder to get once Dragonflight has passed and The War Within has arrived.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Complete World of Warcraft: Dragonflight's campaign.&nbsp;</strong>If you care about the story, ensuring you are all up to date on the campaign is vital. It'll help fill in the gaps about the Primalists and help you prepare for the upcoming story of The War Within.</li>
<li><strong>Run Raids and Mythic+ Dungeons.</strong> If possible, you want to be as geared up as possible when you begin to walk through the pre-patch. Some of the enemies may be overtuned, which can make brutal fights even harder. Having a good gear level will help massively with that.</li>
<li><strong>Try out some PvP.</strong> If you've never done PvP, now is a great time to get stuck. You can get PvP-specific gear, collect currencies, and exchange them for mounts and titles if you are prepared for a lengthy grind. Keep in mind that you don't have long to complete these things.</li>
<li><strong>Level up your Professions.&nbsp;</strong>While this may seem like something that isn't important, it can help boost your character. Not only can you get potions that will buff you, but you can then go on to complete Standing Orders for other people to earn some quick gold. There are plenty of professions to choose from, and many of them are highly beneficial, especially in the late game.</li>
<li><strong>Complete Non-Awakened Raids</strong>. At the moment, the three Raids in Dragonflight are classed as non-awakened. Once the patch has gone live, these raids will be permanently awakened, meaning you may find it harder to obtain the raid-specific gear and cosmetics you would have gotten from completing them while they were in a non-awakened state.</li>
<li><strong>Grind Renown levels</strong>. If you like to grind reputation levels with different factions, grinding Renown is perfect. Not only does it give you access to great cosmetics, it can also allow you to unlock mounts and other gear that you may find beneficial on your World of Warcraft journey.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is plenty still left to do in World of Warcraft, and it's entirely up to you what you choose to do with the time before The War Within<a href="https://thewarwithin.blizzard.com/en-gb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> pre-patch</a> arrives. Remember, you only have until July 23 to complete all of the time-gated content from Dragonflight before The War Within comes crashing in.</p>

In the modern age, online communities rallying around franchises are often composed of numerous splinter groups, and <em>Star Wars</em> is no exception—it’s got far-right reactionaries, original trilogy boomers, millennial prequel loyalists, Gen Z animated series lovers, and, of course, Reylos. It’s that last group—fans who ship characters Kylo Ren and Rey Skywalker of the sequel trilogy, and who are often women or queer folks—that have felt ostracized by other <em>Star Wars </em>fans in the years since 2019’s <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em>, and are just now feeling justified thanks to <em>T</em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/379647/564546/9358?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Fthe-acolyte%2F39RAA0bOYXQ0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/379647/564546/9358?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Fthe-acolyte%2F39RAA0bOYXQ0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>he Acolyte</em></a></span>. </p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sparks undeniably flew between Kylo and Rey in <em>The Last Jedi</em>, only to be briefly fanned and then snuffed out in the almost universally panned sequel, leaving Reylos convinced there was no love left in the <em>Star Wars</em> universe, and no love for them, either. But then came <em>The Acolyte</em>, the latest Disney+ <em>Star Wars</em> series, and its season finale—and with it, vindication for Reylos.<br></p><p>Former Jedi Padawan Osha (Amandla Stenberg) and dark side practitioner Qimir (Manny Jacinto) end up together, holding hands, staring out at the horizon. Romance (and specifically the kind of enemies-to-lovers romance that fanfic writers love) is back on the cantina menu, so I spoke to several self-proclaimed Reylos via email to learn how <em>The Acolyte</em> speaks directly to them.</p><figure id="" data-id="412c4ed268748cb056871d65537a71b8" data-recommend-id="image://412c4ed268748cb056871d65537a71b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rey and Kylo reach out.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h28618"><a id=""></a><strong>The rise and fall of Reylos</strong></h2><p>“The two holding hands looking off into the sunset, rather than ending up alone. I think for a lot of Reylos, that’s really healing,” Parisi wrote. “It’s really nice to see [<em>The Acolyte</em> showrunner] Leslye Headland not shying away from the romance in interviews when it seemed like during the sequel trilogy the creators tried to be more vague and that only fueled the internet backlash.”<br></p><p>For many Reylos, the sequel trilogy’s failure to center the burgeoning romance between Kylo and Rey pointed to a franchise-wide reluctance to cater to the more feminine side of the fandom. Whereas the prequels put Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala’s love at their center, the conclusion to the sequel trilogy shied away from a full-blown romance, choosing instead to focus on Rey’s newly revealed connection to Emperor Palpatine, even though we learned Kylo and Rey are a “dyad,” a duo that shares a similar spark of the Force. The two share a single kiss near the end of <em>TRoS</em>, immediately after which Kylo dies.<br></p><p>“[<em>The Rise of Skywalker</em>] was probably the only time I have seen two characters kiss on screen and then seen fans instead of saying, ‘oh okay…it was meant to be romantic,’ you had people going, ‘oh it was a platonic kiss.’ The time after TRoS was truly wild,” author Ria Parisi explained via email. “The bad [part of their relationship] came from the final execution and unfortunate backlash. It’s very disappointing and sad to set up two characters who are supposed to be one half of each other and then leave one of them alone.”<br></p><p>“Where Reylo suffered the most was in the disconnect of ideas across the three films,” content creator Sawyer Markham wrote, referencing how the first and last films were made by J.J. Abrams while the middle was done by Rian Johnson, a decision many feel led to bizarre tonal shifts throughout the trilogy. And when the Reylos took to the internet to lament what they felt was a squandered on-screen romance, they faced widespread backlash. It’s important to note that, like all corners of <em>Star Wars</em> fandom, there was a sect of Reylos who exhibited some fairly virulent racism, swapping Kylo in for John Boyega’s Finn in fan art and fan-fic. But much of the anti-Reylo backlash felt rooted more in old-school misogyny than anything else.<br></p><p>“I think any online fandom or fandom subsect that is largely made up of people who aren’t cishet white men is inevitably treated badly. Reylos loved and connected with <em>The Last Jedi</em> in particular, whilst another small but very loud part of the fandom didn’t,” writer and director Laurie Kirwan-Ashman told me via email. “This coincided with the <em>Star Wars</em> fandom being infiltrated by the far-right off the back of Comicsgate, which then turned into a YouTube culture wars money-making grift that has created its own toxic cult.”<br></p><p>In the years since <em>The Last Jedi </em>and <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em>, Disney’s <em>Star Wars </em>stories have mostly avoided romance, but when Headland took the helm for <em>The Acolyte</em>, she made it clear that she wasn’t going to shy away from longing glances and grazing hands. </p><figure id="" data-id="dc9728826ae4a62ec03af9af9332467f" data-recommend-id="image://dc9728826ae4a62ec03af9af9332467f" data-format="jpg" data-width="916" data-height="522" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Qimir wields a saber near Osha's face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Qimir wields a saber near Osha's face." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney / Lucasfilm</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dc9728826ae4a62ec03af9af9332467f" data-recommend-id="image://dc9728826ae4a62ec03af9af9332467f" data-format="jpg" data-width="916" data-height="522" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Qimir wields a saber near Osha's face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h28619"><a id=""></a><strong>Enemies to lovers, for real this time</strong></h2><p>In stark contrast to any other official <em>Star Wars </em>media, <em>The Acolyte</em> wears its ship on its sleeve. “We went from Kylo taking off his shirt and people not getting it was meant to be the set up for a romantic relationship to this show saying, ‘Fine you didn’t get it with that? We’ll make [Qimir] fully nude’,” said Parisi. “And seeing the fans come together again in a way I haven’t seen since right after <em>The Last Jedi</em>, it just feels amazing.”</p><p>Not only did the series unabashedly lean into <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-acolyte-episode-5-qimir-master-review-1851562506&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-acolyte-episode-5-qimir-master-review-1851562506">Manny Jacinto’s sex appeal</a></span>, giving us what may be the first <em>Star Wars </em>character who’s canonically naked on-screen, but it subverted typical series tropes—Osha, raised by the Jedi, turns to the dark side, drawn there by her connection to Qimir. It’s the kind of romance plot Reylos have been dreaming of for years. “I read an interview that Leslye Headland did where she discussed how past characters talked about being seduced by the Dark Side and how we’d never actually seen that onscreen so she decided to give it to us—and she did!” author Sariah Wilson said over email.<br></p><p>“I still have to kind of pinch myself, like, am I really seeing a <em>Star Wars</em> show where a young woman abandons the institutional ‘We Have All The Answers’ club in favor of something more nuanced and complex, and is celebrated in the narrative for it, and gets to hold hands with the guy she had a connection with and look at the sunset?” Carrie, an early childhood professional, wondered. </p><p>And it’s not just about the broad strokes of a corruption courtship, it’s the manner in which that courtship is portrayed, with the kind of soft, sensual femininity that we almost never see in <em>Star Wars</em>. “It’s so slick, it’s so intentional, it’s so <em>hot</em>, it’s everything <em>Star Wars</em> could have been for the last seven years if the (overblown) reaction (from a loud minority of affirmative fans joined by right wing grifters) to <em>The Last Jedi</em> didn’t spook the higher-ups so badly,” said comic artist Para Caspari.<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-the-acolyte-qimir-osha-ship-sexy-reylo-1851576215&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-the-acolyte-qimir-osha-ship-sexy-reylo-1851576215">In <em>The Acolyte</em> episode 6</a></span>, Jacinto’s Qimir offers a not-so-subtle thesis for the “Oshamir” romance: “Below the surface of consciousness are powerful emotions—anger, fear, loss…desire.” Qimir seduces Osha, showing her that the Jedi way is draconian and severe, and even though she resists him at first, once she realizes the mistakes the Jedi made and how they resulted in the death of her mother, she sees that there’s much more nuance than they’d like her to believe. And so, she chooses Qimir, and the Dark Side.<br></p><p> “On the surface level, they’re obviously both incredibly beautiful people but, as with Reylo, what has really sparked so much investment in them is their dynamic: the push/pull tension, the way they surprise and challenge each other, the roles they’re playing and what they offer for each other’s character development,” explained Kirwan-Ashman. “There was a lot of really fun sexual subtext in <em>TLJ</em>…but it’s such a joy to have it be so explicitly explored in <em>The Acolyte</em>, and for the show to be so clearly interested in how seduction and desire play into the wider themes.”</p><figure id="" data-id="50d3d80f50df7c9c6b4f32b2d0a4d135" data-recommend-id="image://50d3d80f50df7c9c6b4f32b2d0a4d135" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Osha and Qimir look into the distance together.

But right now, Reylos are riding high after the recent finale—dare I say, they’re feeling vindicated—largely because Headland has been so open in discussing her vision for the series, and how Osha and Qimir’s dynamic is at its core.<br></p><p>“Leslye [Headland] wasn’t afraid to take risks in setting up the romantic undertones for these characters, and when asked about it in interviews she confirmed that that was her intent, which is something that was markedly missing from the Reylo era,” explained Markham. Rather than squabbling over subtext, <em>Acolyte </em>fans have concrete proof that this is a series about romance, and about blurring the lines between good and evil—as many pointed out after the season finale, Jedi Master Sol (Lee Jung-jae) maintained a lie for over a decade, insisting that Osha’s sister Mae was the reason why their entire witch coven perished. Qimir, on the other hand, gives Osha all the information she needed to make an informed decision, and space to ponder her future. By the end of the finale, she turns to him, hand outstretched, and chooses to train alongside him. To Reylos, this is a revelation.<br></p><p>“That’s why I think <em>Acolyte</em> is hitting such a chord with so many Reylo shippers: here’s a complex young woman who struggles with her darkness in a very real-feeling way onscreen, who can’t maintain her cognitive dissonance anymore, and who is learning that anger and fear and yes, desire, are all completely fine and normal emotions to feel and to harness in life,” Carrie pointed out.<br></p><p>Caspari takes it a step further, saying <em>The Acolyte</em> is “not just vindication but it specifically feels like a response to the Sequels along the lines of my aforementioned criticisms. It feels like Headland saying, ‘that sucked, here’s how I’d have done it’.” He&nbsp;continued, “Of course, if you’re a Reylo it feels like you’re finally free after being gaslit for a decade…of being told by both antis and affirmative fans alike that we were being weird, reading too much into it, projecting our own immoral fantasies, etc. it means a lot.”<br></p><p> Oshamir is also bittersweet for many Reylos, who wish they would have seen this kind of romance play out on the big screen. “In one way it’s a win because it feels like we’re finally allowing for women to be messy and complex in their characterization,” pointed out Carrie. “But on the other hand there’s definitely some bitterness because if Osha and Qimir holding hands and staring off into the sunset together was fine, why couldn’t we have had anything like that in <em>TROS</em>?”</p><p>“It also feels vindicating in the sense of being a show that includes and represents people who have been historically marginalized, both in terms of on-screen depiction in <em>Star Wars</em> and beyond,” said Kirwan-Ashman. “<em>The Acolyte </em>is created by a lesbian and all the main characters are played by women, non-binary, queer people and people of color.”<br></p><p>And though that may be what caused bad actors to review-bomb it and reactionary <em>Star Wars</em> YouTubers to declare <em>The Acolyte</em> dead in the water, Reylos have a very different outlook. As Kirwin-Ashman pointed out, “it really feels like it’s welcoming a new generation of the fandom as well as those who have loved <em>Star Wars</em> for a long time but have often felt in the past like <em>Star Wars</em> didn’t love them back.”<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<section><p>The Sims 4: Lovestruck is one of the game's most meaningful expansions, elevating relationships and player choice while also offering plenty of humor and spice.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>If you're a part of The Sims community, you know there are dozens of different kinds of "Simmers," as Maxis affectionately calls us. You have the luxury-focused "motherlode" spammers, the architects, the storytellers, the folks who find comfort in watching a simple family live out their simple life, the ladder-deleters, and more. Yet even heartbroken players executing their revenge fantasies are not the most depraved of all Sims players. No no. It's the Wicked Whims community who take that crown.</p><p dir="ltr">Wicked Whims, for the unacquainted, is a popular mod that adds graphic nudity to The Sims 4 as well as just about everything you can <em>do</em> while graphically nude. Like, <em>everything</em>. Not that I would know because <em>obviously</em> I've never installed it. That would be indecent. Obviously.</p><p dir="ltr">But if I <em>had </em>installed it, I would be able to tell you that The Sims 4's upcoming Lovestruck expansion certainly doesn't come close to being as colorful as WW. However, it does add just enough spice to put that "Rated T for Teens'' label to the test and contains some concepts we've seen in Wicked Whims' less-spicy companion: Wonderful Whims. And overall, The Sims 4 experience is made much better for it. On top of adding a healthy dose of lust to the game, Lovestruck adds a whole lot of <em>love </em>to the game. Thanks to Lovestruck, we get some much-needed complexity and clarity to relationships, a better replication of what real-life relationships can look like, and a reminder of what makes Maxis a simulation-game powerhouse.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336827-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer0-22screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4336827" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336827-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer0-22screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4336827"></a><figcaption>Two men embrace one another on a couch, looking smitten.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336827-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer0-22screenshot.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Shortly after attending a hands-off preview event offering <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-4-is-finally-getting-rid-of-one-of-its-most-annoying-features-with-a-free-update/1100-6524986/">an overview of Lovestruck</a>, I was given the chance to test out the expansion. Seeing as the DLC was all about romance, I decided to boot up the game and make my very own rom-com protagonist, complete with a job at a <em>very</em> important magazine, an ambitious personality, and a fear of love. I found there are a lot of fun new additions to Create-A-Sim: cute and inclusive new hair styles, plenty of sexy going-out tops, and plenty of other fun items. However, the greatest changes resided in the Simology panel. New to the game are Romantic Boundaries, Turn Ons and Turn Offs, two new personality traits (Love Bug and Romantically Reserved), two new aspirations (Romantic Explorer and Paragon Partner), and the long-awaited ability to set roommates as partners.</p><p dir="ltr">Romantic Boundaries are easily the most substantial update to the game, making it no surprise that Maxis opted to bring the system over to the base game as well. Essentially, Romantic Boundaries establish what behaviors you are okay with in a relationship. Lovestruck breaks it down with four questions: Does your sim get jealous if a partner flirts with another sim? What about if they get a bit hands-on? What if they WooHoo? And lastly, is your Sim willing to talk through their boundaries if they are broken and negotiate their relationships terms? I decided to go with no, yes, yes, yes to see how everything would play out.</p><p dir="ltr">Selecting her Turn Ons and Turn Offs was also a lot of fun. Rather than simply allow you to choose from the game's pre-established traits, the system lumps them into general ideas. For example, rather than just selecting that you like "Loner" types, you can select that you like "Homebodies," which includes Bookworm, Clumsy, Geek, Lazy, Sedentary, Socially Awkward, <em>and </em>Loner. I made her attracted to Hardworking, Career-Minded, and Wealthy Sims, then threw in a bit of a problematic trait that, in my own little headcanon, had gotten her into trouble before: Already Taken.</p><p dir="ltr">I then moved my sim, the somewhat ham-fistedly named Juliet Hart, into the expansion's new city: the also somewhat ham-fistedly named Ciudad Enamorada. The Mexico City-inspired neighborhood is gorgeous, with colorful buildings, plenty of rooftop terraces, and beautiful stone masonry buildings. I moved her into the cheapest of these lots, across from a motel that cost 40 simoleons a night.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336828-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer2-20screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4336828" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336828-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer2-20screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4336828"></a><figcaption>The neon-lit nearby motel.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336828-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer2-20screenshot.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Despite Juliet's ambitions of being an award-winning columnist, I decided I needed to try the game's newest career path: Romance Consultant. On top of being novel, I figured it also probably offers more job security. Sure, she wasn't a romantic herself, but perhaps her cynicism, which she'd argue was merely realistic, would make her an interesting choice for the position. The second thing I did was sign up for Cupid's Corner, the game's new dating app. While you can't lie about your traits or appearance on the app--sorry, aspiring catfishers--you can only select two traits to showcase on your profile, allowing sims to hide any particularly unappealing characteristics prior to going out on a date.</p><p dir="ltr">After taking a new profile picture and selecting "Ambitious" and "Outgoing" as my traits--conveniently leaving out "Romantically Reserved"--I began swiping, so to speak. In Cupid's Corner, you are presented with seven potential suitors, with the traits that you like and dislike highlighted on their profile; these can then be refreshed every 12 in-game hours. Of the seven matches, you are allowed to "like" three of them, which adds them to the saved part of the app. From there, you can choose to save their number and/or ask them to go on a date with you. The first person Juliet went on a date with was a man named Manuel, whose artsy, Lovebug personality type was a bit different for her.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336830-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer0-34screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4336830" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336830-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer0-34screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4336830"></a><figcaption>The Cupid's Corner interface, in which a woman named Zoey's profile is displayed.

On a random Thursday, Gavin called Juliet from his job and told her she was having an awful day. Juliet then told him she'd bring him lunch and set off to his work with tacos, which made their relationship grow closer. Gavin soon became the situationship she was most invested in, causing her to develop a fear that he might be seeing other sims behind her back--she then was able to have a sit-down with him in which he reassured her he was serious about her, causing the game to grant her "Fear Progress." While I don't know what conquering a fear entails--this was the only time the scenario popped up during my brief playtime--I am excited to explore the concept more.</p><p dir="ltr">A few days later, however, the obscenely wealthy Nancy Landgrab called Juliet with a strange proposition; in fact I am still <em>somewhat</em> unsure of the exact intention behind it. The lonely wife told Juliet that she was looking for some companionship and would pay Juliet a hefty sum to spend time with her at the nearby motel. Naturally I had to say yes, and met the "wealthy weirdo" as the game called her across the street. After two hours, Juliet came back with a bunch of strange objects in her inventory, including several precious stones and a rare black axolotl. Shortly after, Juliet was then invited to star on a reality dating program; the stranger told her they would set cameras all around her home and her mission would be to simply have one week's worth of hot dates. A Herculean task, but she was up for it. She soon developed a number of unique dynamics with other sims: a "Steamy" relationship with Manuel, a "Wholesome" one with Gavin, and a "Strained" one with the married Nancy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336829-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer2-25screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4336829" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336829-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer2-25screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4336829"></a><figcaption>A couple in matching, revealing wrestling outfits sits on a bed playing the new, raunchy adult game WooWho?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336829-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer2-25screenshot.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Lovestruck is full of these weird, sincere, and steamy interactions. On top of being able to perform "Back-to-Back WooHoo" in the newly resurfaced vibrating bed--a callback to The Sims 1--whilst dressed up in a variety of suggestive costumes found in the game's new costume trunk, there are several new dialogue options. You can ask about WooHoo and romantic interests, ask to attend couple's counseling, ask what they're attracted to, ask about romantic boundaries, check in on your relationship status, recap WooHoos, and reveal desires. Romantically Reserved sims are also offered a number of Mr. Darcy-esque options, like asking an "indecent question," praising beauty, and offering a "civilized remark." After several "civilized remarks," conversations about relationship boundaries, and plenty of "Back-to-Back WooHoo," Juliet and Gavin decided to become exclusive and now live together in their newly renovated Ciudad Enamorada home--and I couldn't be happier for the lil' lovebirds.</p><p>In short, Lovestruck adds a bewildering amount of relationship complexity and over-the-top drama, the likes of which I haven't seen since my favorite The Sims entry, The Sims 2. The Sims expansions can be hit or miss; while some feel like they completely change the game's dynamics and are well-worth the $40 EA charges for them, others can feel more surface-level. Suffice to say, Lovestruck is the former, and I can't quite imagine going back to a version of the game without it. While all the options might be a lot for those whose playstyle is more simplistic (though it's worth mentioning you can turn Relationship Boundaries off in the settings menu), I believe Lovestruck is one of the series' most substantial and <em>fun</em> expansions.</p>
