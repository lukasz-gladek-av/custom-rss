		<p>It’s been far too long since Donkey Kong’s last 3D adventure, but Donkey Kong Bananza is about to set that right on Nintendo Switch 2. This is a big, brash, counterpart to Mario Odyssey, a smash-happy 3D platformer where it feels like anything and everything can be destroyed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Bananza – Nintendo Direct | Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mIddsPkdX9U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Playing through the opening stage of the game, we find DK down in the mines with all his simian pals, digging up gold nuggets while hunting for surprisingly tasty jewel-encrusted golden bananas to smash and gobble up. While everyone else is toiling away with pick axes, though, DK can just punch his way through the deformable scenery.</p>


<p>You know exactly what kind of game this is when you’ve got three different face buttons all dedicated to smashing in different ways. One will smash around you, another with punch down, and finally, you can punch upwards. Whether it’s enemies or deformable parts of the world, a lot of the time, things will just hurry up and get out of DK’s way when he punches.</p>
<p>It feels like something inspired by the likes of Red Faction or Deep Rock Galactic as you barrel your way through this opening stage, and there’s an initial thrill to the rambunctious chaos that you create in your surroundings. It doesn’t take too long to start to find the limits of what you can punch your way through, this underground level still having plenty of deformable terrain, but also unbreakable walls and floors boxing you in to keep things a little constrained – this underlying structure will ensure that you can’t get stuck.</p>

<p>Another of DK’s abilities is slapping the ground, both to trigger hidden elements on the floor to raise up – platforms, for example –&nbsp;and do a quick little sonar pulse to reveal nearby secrets hidden away in the dirt.</p>

<p>Jumping ahead to a later level at Ape Cape –&nbsp;after DK finds a huge haul of golden bananas, just in time for the villains to turn up and steal them all away, of course –&nbsp;and we’re out in the open and the bright sun. There’s some enemies you can’t actually smash here, flying Buzzoids that will damage you with their blade-like propeller if you get too close. Luckily you can just rip up big chunks of the ground and throw them at things that have offended you.</p>
<p>That can also include enemies that have encased themselves in rock and other matter, needing you to throw chunks of rock at them, or punch your way through to their skeletal forms inside before you can defeat them. They were featured in a mini battle arena, a little diversion from the main level as you fight multiple enemies against the clock. A longside fossils, buried treasure chest and other secrets,</p>
<p>Sometimes not even throwing ripped up rocks will do the trick – concrete is pretty much impervious to your regular attacks. That’s where the handy, shimmering purple explosive rocks come into play, sprouting from certain parts of the level. These are great for just blasting holes in the level and through heavier enemies, exploding on impact and doing a lot of damage. After going through a section of revolving concrete and finding it thoroughly unpunchable, I doubled back, grabbed some purple and embraced the TNT excavation technique of old.</p>

<p>The one problem with all the dig-punching is that it feels like the camera is a bit too close or not quite framed to DK to capture the world-smashing carnage you’re unleashing. It’s entirely possible to get a little bit lost in all the smashing and get turned around, especially when you’re in the tighter confines of the underground mine level. A neat trick that does work to keep you oriented, is when the camera can clip through the ground as you dig straight down and let you see the rest of the level, so you know where to dig towards to get yourself back out. I hope that longer play gets past this feeling, or that it can be tweaked through the final rounds of polish before release.</p>
<p>The game does look good, though. DK has that newer character style, similar to his appearance in the Super Mario Movie and in Mario Kart World, but still turns up to work in dungarees and a tie. That particular get up changed for the second level, and there’s bound to be plenty of costumes and dress up through the game.</p>
<p>There is quite a chunky feel to the deformation, but it’s good to see that even where you can’t dig through, say, the ape-shaped mountain of the second level, your punching does still often disturb a surface layer and give a little bit of visible, physical feedback.</p>

<p>If your kids are fans of Hulk smashing his way through earlier Avengers movies, then they’ll probably go bananas for Donkey Kong Bananza. As Nintendo and their partners explore platformers in all their forms, there’s some neat ideas built around the frenzy of punching and adding deformable world to the genre. I look forward to seeing how this can be explored in different ways, to hopefully avoid DK becoming a one punch ape.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-2-billion-year-revenue/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While there was some skepticism surrounding the Xbox Game Pass when it launched in 2017, players embraced the subscription model, which has been making solid revenue in the past few years.</p>
<p>As spotted by Timur222 on X, Richie Choudhary, former Head of Product at Xbox, revealed on their <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richie-choudhary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn profile</a> that from 2019 until 2021, Xbox Game Pass stood at $2 billion a year in revenue, which is definitely an impressive figure, despite not being telling in regard to the sustainability of the subscription service, as there's no data on the profits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Old but interesting<br>
Xbox Game Pass used to make $2 billion a year in revenue<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Xbox?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Xbox</a> <a href="https://t.co/N5VEc0EBjH">pic.twitter.com/N5VEc0EBjH</a></p>
<p>— Timur222 (@bogorad222) <a href="https://twitter.com/bogorad222/status/1908089661349576714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While Xbox Game Pass delivers quite a bit of value to players, it definitely causes a considerable drop in sales. <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-games-lose-80-sales/">Earlier this year</a>, it was revealed that any game that is available as part of the subscription service's library can be expected to lose around 80% of its expected premium sales on Xbox, a little less if it is a big mainstream release. Still, certain games benefit from being part of the Game Pass library, such as multiplayer games, as a surge of players on Xbox systems can have a positive impact on sales on PlayStation consoles. The service also makes it easier for some developers to get players to try out their games.</p>
<p>Xbox Game Pass has become a fundamental part of Microsoft's strategy in the gaming space, which aims to get as many players as possible into the Xbox ecosystem, no matter the device. You can learn more about the subscription service on its <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-reportedly-gearing-up-for-marathon-reveal-later-this-month/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie-reportedly-gearing-up-for-marathon-reveal-later-this-month.1155207/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-reportedly-gearing-up-for-marathon-reveal-later-this-month/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A reliable insider has claimed that Marathon might receive some sort of reveal next week.</p>



<p>Bungie recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-news-being-teased-by-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> Marathon on its social media accounts, hinting at a potential reveal in the coming days. Interestingly, Jeff Grubb also spoke about this topic during the latest episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_7BU-Y6wdI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Mess Decides</a> (via <a href="https://thegamepost.com/bungie-to-reveal-more-about-marathon-late-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamePost</a>). Grubb has stated that “late next week”, players will be able to finally learn “a lot more about Marathon”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is not Grubb’s first mention of an April reveal for Marathon. A few months ago, he stated that Marathon wasn’t a part of PlayStation’s State of Play event as it probably has its own thing because that’s how Bungie operates for Destiny, too. Grubb <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-bungies-marathon-wasnt-at-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a>, “I think April [is] when we will probably hear from them about Marathon. And it would be its own thing separate from the State of Play.”</p>



<p>Bungie’s Marathon has been under wraps since its reveal at the PlayStation Showcase event. Since then, the only update we have received was a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-gives-official-update-on-status-of-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dev talk</a> from the game director. However, we only heard about what was in the works in the game, along with some concept art for upcoming heroes. No actual gameplay was shown. If Marathon is revealed late next week, players will hope that the developers show up with a bunch of gameplay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Bungie’s Marathon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-marathon-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order bonuses</a> were recently spotted on Steam. Also, according to claims, the dev’s upcoming ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungies-upcoming-gummy-bears-moba-is-inspired-by-smash-bros-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gummy Bears’ MOBA</a> is inspired by Smash Bros. What are your thoughts on the Marathon being revealed later this month?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/titanfall-3-2026-rumor/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-titanfall-3-in-development-new-rumors-suggest-a-2026-release-date.1155204/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/titanfall-3-2026-rumor/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New rumors have surfaced that Titanfall 3 is in development and could be revealed in later this year with a 2026 release date.</p>



<p>It’s almost tradition at this point that a new Titanfall 3 rumor needs to surface annually, and this time, it suggests that the game is in development and could be revealed at this year’s The Game Awards, with a release date of 2026.</p>



<p>The recent rumours originate from two different Titanfall leakers, who, at face value, have got decent track records when it comes to reporting Apex Legends and Titanfall news.</p>



<p>Leaker,&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/YOROTSUKI_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YOROTSUKI_</a>, was the first to make the claim and that back in December 2024, they teased in some discord servers that Respawn was working on a new game. Another Apex Legends leaker by the name of <a href="https://x.com/Osvaldatore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Osvaldatore</a> then went on to corroborate the rumor with a tweet of a Titanfall 3 logo and had apparently spoken to YOROTSUKI being the scenes to verify that the game is indeed in development.</p>



<p>As for if the rumors are true or not remains to be seen (as always, take with a pinch of salt), but in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@insider_gaming/videos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming podcast</a> (released later today), we discuss the possibilities of the information being real and what we’ve heard. </p>



<p>According to our sources, Titanfall 3 has already been cancelled and shut down at least twice, with one of the reasons being given is because the game was “too similar to Titanfall 2”. That being said, Respawn Entertainment has had several unannounced projects cancelled in the past year, and probably needs another huge title other than Star Wars Jedi as the Apex Legends playerbase continues to dwindle. </p>



<p>As far as we know, at least three unannounced projects have been cancelled at Respawn in the past year, one was a single-player first-person shooter set in the Apex Legends universe, a second was a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-mandalorian-game-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">single-player Mandalorian game</a>, and a third was an unannounced incubation project.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to EA for comment and have contacted sources to see if the rumor has any legs.</p>



<p>Do you think Titanfall 3 is in development? Let me know in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

A tweet from the official Marathon account, below, revealed a typically cryptic image and accompanying garbled signal noise. As fans have noticed, there’s ASCII art of footage from the debut Marathon trailer. Given this is Bungie we’re talking about, a developer known for its mysterious teasers, hidden clues, and Easter eggs, there’s probably much more here to discover, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon/comments/1jr6otv/unencrypted_code/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fans are already working to find out what it all means</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Either way, it very much looks like it’s finally happening for Marathon after what has been a troubled development.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/6NBgIdRVK2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/6NBgIdRVK2</a></p>— Marathon (@MarathonTheGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1907956872046690602?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 4, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-reveals-new-marathon-game-at-playstation-showcase"><u>Marathon was revealed in May 2023</u></a> as a reboot of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/4-ways-marathon-influenced-modern-games"><u>the classic Bungie franchise</u></a>, but with all its themes of "mysteries, eeriness, and psychological creepiness." But Bungie itself has suffered several controversies in recent years, headlined by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio"><u>the laying off of 220 staff members</u></a>, meaning 17% of its workforce, in July 2024: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-industry-criticizes-bungie-management-ceo-pete-parsons-in-wake-of-layoffs-inexcusable"><u>a move even industry peers criticized</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This came <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pete-parsons-tells-employees-bungie-kept-the-right-people-to-work-on-destiny-2"><u>less than a year after 100 other layoffs at Bungie</u></a>, at which point <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-say-atmosphere-is-soul-crushing-amid-layoffs-cuts-and-fear-of-total-sony-takeover"><u>staff told IGN the atmosphere was "soul crushing" at the studio</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Further controversy came when a report released weeks after the 220 job losses alleging <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-director-was-fired-following-misconduct-investigation-at-bungie-report"><u>former Marathon director Chris Barrett was fired after an internal misconduct investigation</u></a> at Bungie. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-bungie-director-chris-barrett-suing-sony-interactive-entertainment-and-bungie-for-more-than-200-million">Barrett subsequently sued Sony Interactive Entertainment and Bungie for more than $200 million</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This all comes as Sony rethinks its focus on live-service games.

"Whether or not the software developer is going to use that as a native resolution or get it to a smaller res and then upscale is something that the software developer can choose. I think it opens up a lot of options for the software developer."</p><p>In the same session, Dohta confirmed that the Switch 2's GPU will support ray tracing, which "provides another option for software developers to use."</p><p>More details about the tech upgrades were revealed in a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nintendo-switch-2-leveled-up-with-nvidia-ai-powered-dlss-and-4k-gaming/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nvidia blog post</a>, which provided a deep dive on the Switch 2's custom Nvidia processor. The console's GPU boasts dedicated RT Cores to power real-time ray tracing, while Tensor Cores are used for AI-powered boosts like DLSS upscaling. The Switch 2's AI processing also comes into play with the console's new video-chat feature, with AI-powered features including face tracking and automatic background removal.</p><p>Overall, Nvidia said the Switch 2 has 10 times the graphical performance of the Nintendo Switch, giving developers more to work with when developing games for the new console. Nintendo also announced during the Switch 2 Direct that the new console will support <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-will-support-hdr-4k-and-120fps/1100-6530547/" data-ref-id="1100-6530547">HDR, 4K, and 120fps</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5/1100-6530537/" data-ref-id="1100-6530537">Nintendo Switch 2 will launch on June 5</a> for $450, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">preorders beginning on April 9</a>.</p>

            <p>Nintendo's upcoming Switch 2 console doesn't actually run the original Switch's games natively, as the two hardwares are incompatible.</p>
<p>One of the first things that we knew for absolute certain about the Switch successor was that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">it would be backwards compatible</a>. "At today's Corporate Management Policy Briefing, we announced that Nintendo Switch software will also be playable on the successor to Nintendo Switch," company president Shuntaro Furukawa said in November.</p>
<p>But, while this means Switch 2 owners will still be able to play most of the games from the original Switch's library, this isn't possible because the two consoles are compatible at a hardware level, which would have been handy. Rather, it's all possible thanks to a workaround Nintendo has managed to implement.</p>

<p>During a recent <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4/">Ask the Developer Q&amp;A</a>, Nintendo's Kouichi Kawamoto said the Switch 2 team always wanted the new system to play the original console's games, but "were told there'd be technical challenges" getting it to work.</p>
<p>"When we first started Switch 2 development, the focus was on enhancing its performance as hardware, namely, expanding its capacity," added Takuhiro Dohta. "So, compatibility was a lower priority."</p>
<p>But, it was still something the team wanted to ensure, and in the end the Switch 2 developers settled on "the challenge of using new technology to run Switch games".</p>
<p>Said Dohta: "If we tried to use technology like software emulators, we'd have to run Switch 2 at full capacity, but that would mean the battery wouldn't last so long, so we did something that’s somewhere in between a software emulator and hardware compatibility."</p>
<p>The team goes through many checks to make sure original Switch games run smoothly on Switch 2, but the developers noted "it might not be that all Switch games run perfectly" in time for the console's launch this summer.</p>
<p>This method of playing older games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-and-other-games-have-compatibility-issues-with-switch-2">explains why a few titles have some compatibility issues</a>, though fixes are in the works. And while only one Switch game is completely unplayable on Switch 2, others will still require the use of original Joy-Con due to specific controls or peripherals.</p>
<p>"But we will continue our efforts so that we can support as many Switch games as possible," Kawamoto said.</p>

			<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake is still scheduled to be revealed and released this month, according to an extremely reliable insider.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, extremely reliable insider NateTheHate replied to a question regarding the remake, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-could-be-mere-days-from-launch-according-to-leaker/">rumored</a> to launch yesterday, confirming that, as things stand, the game will still be released this month. Plans can obviously change, but with the insider's track record, it is safe to say that chances are high that we will soon be able to return to Cyrodiil soon, and experience it like we never did before.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">As things stand, yes.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1907919010387370215?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake has yet to be officially announced, we have known it has been in development in some capacity for <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/">almost two years</a>, when the game's existence was revealed in an FTC investigational hearing held with Xbox's head Phil Spencer. According to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/">rumors,</a> the remake is being developed by Virtuos in <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-unreal-engine-5/">Unreal Engine 5</a> and will feature many new features and improvements over the original, including combat mechanics changes, some of them inspired by modern action games, HUD improvements, and more. If all of these changes will indeed be implemented in the final game, they should make for a far more enjoyable experience.</p>
<p>Those who haven't experienced The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion ahead of the remake still have the chance to do so on PC, as the GOTY edition, including all additional content, is now available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/22330/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>. Console players, unfortunately, have no other option at the moment other than playing the game on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.</p>

<p>Krafton has announced that inZOI has passed 1 million units sold in its first week of launch in early access on Steam.</p>



<p>In a press release, it was also said that “Canvas,”&nbsp;inZOI’s in-game UGC (User-generated Content) sharing platform, showed strong levels of community engagement as it garnered more than 1.2 million players on the day of launch with over 470,000 pieces of uploaded content.</p>



<p>CEO CH Kim stated, “We are grateful and excited to present&nbsp;inZOI&nbsp;to players around the world through Early Access,” adding, “We will continue to actively communicate with players and foster&nbsp;inZOI&nbsp;as KRAFTON’s long-term franchise IP.”</p>



<p>The press release concluded by reiterating that the game’s future updates will introduce new content, including mod support and new cities, with all updates and DLC provided for free until full release.</p>

<p>inZOI’s success hasn’t been without controversy, though. On launch, clips started going viral showing players being able to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-lets-you-run-over-children/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">run over children within the game</a>, an issue that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-developers-say-ability-to-run-over-children-was-a-bug/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Krafton quickly addressed and called a bug</a>.</p>



<p>inZOI currently sits at around 25,000 concurrent players in the past 24 hours, with 87,000 being the peak concurrent player count.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/what-we-played-monster-hunter-wilds-atomfall-and-nintendo-switch-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Oh man, not only is the sun shining, but Nintendo are shining down on us too with the glorious reveal of all the Switch 2 details you could want (apart from pesky things like what chipset it’s rocking or the amount of RAM, but who needs to know that when there’s Mario Kart!). The battle is now on for pre-orders, and ShopTo have already told me I’m not in there first allocation. This has caused panic, but I’m sure that when the Nintendo store invites roll out I’ll be there. Surely, I’ll be there.</p>
<p>So this week, I asked the team what they were playing, and whether they were going to jump right into the Switch 2, hold off, or just play on the consoles they already have!</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> has played Croc for review, saying, “I found it pretty average. I’m currently playing Blue Prince for review and I’ll have more on that next week. Regarding the Switch 2, I won’t be getting one. I have a Switch that was barely used and I just don’t have the time I used to have to be able to keep up with games on multiple consoles anymore. I’m still playing Witcher 3 and I started that back in November!”</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> has returned from Japan, and has dipped his toe into Monster Hunter Wilds in anticipation of Mizutsune (coming soon) and MTG Arena in anticipation of Tarkir (also coming soon). He says, “It’s gonna be a good month for games I like, but boy do I miss Japan already! As for the Switch 2, I’ll get one as soon as I can, but I doubt I’ll be in the preorder list as I haven’t had Switch Online for two years straight (I let it lapse when I have nothing to play online)!”</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has played Balatro, Phasmo, Assassin’s Creed Shadows and Hitman regrettably not in VR. When asked about the Switch 2, he simply said, “Price increases on games sucks.”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> is still very much in his ‘play one game at a time’ mode so he’s been putting a few more hours into Assassin’s Creed Shadows. He told us, “I wasn’t really vibing with the gameplay and open-ended story progression but something seems to have clicked – getting to this point has taken longer than what I would have liked but there’s a lot of fun to be had stalking the cities and castles of feudal Japan as Naoe, then bull-rushing everything as Yasuke.”</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> has been thoroughly enjoying Atomfall, saying, “It’s just a brilliant setting and great characters make it a joy to explore. Combat is perfunctory but the amount of dialogue options and accompanying meaningful choices that have genuine impact on the world more than make up for that. I’ve also just started on Commandos Origins for review. I’m not gonna pre-order a Switch 2, mostly because I’m poor. Though I’m sure I’ll eventually pick one up when Nintendo’s brilliant first-party stuff starts coming through.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing the required Destiny 2, but also Black Myth Wukong which he says, “Is how games should be, nice short intro with stabby bits and not too long to get in to the game, and Indika in which I go against type and play as a nun. It’s very atmospheric.”</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> has also been enjoying Atomfall, whilst persevering with the ridiculous amount of collectables in Lego Skywalker and getting stuck into Metroid Dread. He says, “I’ve got a load of Switch games I’ve yet to play so no plans to pick up a Switch 2 any time soon – especially as many of the things it has to offer can already be done by my Steam Deck.”</p>
<p><strong>Tef</strong> meanwhile, has been out in Paris playing on the Switch 2 in real life! He has lots of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/nintendo-switch-2s-joy-con-mouse-mode-is-a-literal-game-changer/">thoughts</a> and words about it, all of which you can find on TSA over the next few days.</p>
<p>How about you? What have you played? And were you impressed enough by the Switch 2 Direct?</p>

But knowing the “why” of it doesn’t really ease the pain on the wallet. What’s more, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-isnt-the-only-nintendo-switch-2-game-that-costs-80-some-nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-do-as-well"><u>we learned just this morning</u></a> that a number of Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games, including The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Kirby and the Forgotten Land, will also be $80. And with the AAA game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-70-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-games-make-sensebut-the-timing-couldnt-be-worse"><u>price increase from $60 to $70 still firmly within recent memory</u></a>, fans are now worried that more and more games, Nintendo or otherwise, are going to start getting more and more and <em>more</em> expensive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what does the future hold? Are $80 games the new Nintendo normal?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As usual, rather than speculate ourselves, we went and found some expert analysts to tell us what they think is going to happen.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">A New Nintendo Normal</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">NYU Stern professor and author of <a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/p/the-joy-of-six" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>SuperJoost Playlist,</u></a> Joost van Dreunen, believes Nintendo is using Mario Kart World as a “test case for premium pricing,” and will evaluate consumer response before applying this more broadly. Spoilers: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendos-switch-2-treehouse-livestream-is-just-a-flood-of-angry-comments-shouting-drop-the-price"><u>the response hasn’t been great so far</u></a>! But sentiment is not the same as sales, and Nintendo will likely measure success by how well Mario Kart World actually sells.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>“</strong>If the $80 price point succeeds, Nintendo will likely extend it selectively to their most valuable franchises rather than making it standard across their first-party lineup. Franchises that could potentially justify the premium pricing include:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Legend of Zelda - the next mainline entry following Tears of the Kingdom could command $80 given the series' prestige and the expansive scope these games typically offer.</li><li>New 3D Mario adventures - for major releases in the vein of Super Mario Odyssey, Nintendo could position these as premium products.</li><li>Super Smash Bros. - the next installment of this franchise would be a strong candidate for premium pricing due to its extensive roster and competitive staying power.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">“Games that likely wouldn't justify the premium price include smaller-scale entries, remasters, and series with more niche appeal. Nintendo will probably maintain a tiered pricing strategy, with their tent-pole franchises at $80, mid-tier releases at $60-70, and smaller titles at traditional price points.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Game Boxes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rhys Elliott, games analyst at Alinea Analytics, had a similar take, pointing to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>top 10 best-selling Nintendo Switch games</u></a> as a guide for what we might see get an $80 price tag in the future. “I could see Nintendo pricing mainline Pokémon games, mainline Zelda games, and the inevitably imminent 3D Mario and Animal Crossing games at $80 physical (but $70 digital still).”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And James McWhirter, analyst at Omdia, added a suggested hypothetical Splatoon 4 to the list of possibilities, along with another thought on future monetization:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For titles that do not adopt the $80 base price, Nintendo could lean in more heavily in alternative forms of monetisation, including those it has so far refrained from using, such as tying paid early access to higher value editions of its games.”</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Grand Theft, Grand Price?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">That covers Nintendo, but what about other games? Earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-at-100-would-be-a-bridge-too-far-even-for-grand-theft-auto"><u>we covered a flurry of speculation on one specifically: Grand Theft Auto 6</u></a>. At the time, we were responding to rumors and discussion that Take-Two might price the sequel to the over 200 million selling blockbuster at $80, $90, or even $100. Analysts suggested that the high end of this was rather unlikely, but what about now? Will Grand Theft Auto 6 cost $80... or even more?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tiago Reis, market analyst at Newzoo, certainly thinks so. “For sure. Big hits that are highly anticipated (e.g., GTA 6, new CODs) can get away with it due to franchise recognition. Most people are not going to stop buying these games because they are $10 more expensive. If consumers are willing to wait, they can get it at a discount a couple of months after release. But by then, these companies have already extracted max value/price from the people who are less price sensitive.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reis’ colleague Lauren Universe, client services manager at Newzoo, added: “Frankly, I expect base GTA to be at least $80, with multiple options of various increased prices (like Civ 7) that include expansions, DLCs, and ‘early access.’”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dr. Serkan Toto, CEO of Kantan Games, agreed, and even expanded on who might be interested in raising prices beyond just Take-Two. “I do believe there is a chance that companies like Microsoft or Sony could feel encouraged to raise their prices now. Would you be shocked if Take-Two now thought to themselves: ‘If Nintendo can charge $80 for a Mario Kart game, we can do the same for GTA 6 - a title thousands of people have been working on for 12 years?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nuno Domingues Marques, also a market analyst at Newzoo, similarly brought up Sony and Microsoft as possible candidates for price hikes. “I am unsure if Sony/Xbox will wait for their next generation to make the push or if they will adjust post-Switch launch, but certainly, it seems like the way forward. Third-party publishers will jump on it as soon as they feel it is justified, which is likely ASAP. Not all exclusive games will cost $80, in my opinion though. Games like Ratchet &amp; Clank or other smaller niche experiences are likely to keep lower price points.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Elliott pushed back a bit on the idea that Mario Kart World could have opened a higher pricing floodgate. He pointed out that at least in the UK and Europe (U.S. price discrepancies are still unconfirmed), Nintendo is charging more for the physical edition of Mario Kart World than digital in an effort to push more consumers toward the digital edition. But he suspects that because the other two console platforms are far more digitally-oriented than Nintendo (something he discussed in more detail in our other piece on the Switch 2 pricing), this would be a tougher sell for other publishers.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>While I believe Take Two could charge over $70 for GTA 6, I maintain that it is a bad idea.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“While I believe Take Two could charge over $70 for GTA 6, I maintain that it is a bad idea for three reasons. [One,] the real cash cow is GTA Online and its recurring revenues, so limiting the total addressable audience at launch wouldn't be smart. There’s also a cost-of-living crisis happening globally and GTA appeals to everyone – rich and less fortunate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[Two,] Rockstar needs to move players from GTA 5, and a higher floor for the switching cost would limit the GTA 5-to-GTA 6 player acquisition. Players not budging from GTA 5 is probably one of GTA 6's biggest threats, one GTA hasn't really faced before. After all, live services are mostly zero-sum in today's oversaturated attention economy. GTA 6 isn't just competing against competitors' games, it's competing with TikTok, Netflix, and even its predecessor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[Three,] Rockstar can easily charge $100 or more for an edition of GTA 6 with a week of early access, maybe with a shark card thrown in. Players with disposable income will pay for it. This is the best of both worlds for Take-Two. This is pretty much the norm for AAA games these days.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elliott concluded that even with all that in mind, GTA 6 nonetheless stands a better chance than any other game at withstanding a price hike with its consumer base intact. So ultimately, the question of GTA 6’s pricing remains an impossible one to answer up to the point where Take-Two finally announces it.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Living in Interesting Times</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ll end on a hopeful note, though, which I got from both Mat Piscatella, analyst at Circana, and a couple of analysts at Newzoo. These folks told me that while we’re likely to keep seeing games get more expensive (and, as Piscatella points out, have already been for a while via Collector’s Editions and similar), we may also see them get cheaper in certain ways. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Other Nintendo games will certainly follow suit,” said Brett Hunt, market analyst at Newzoo. “It could, however, open the door for Nintendo to have an adjusted discounting strategy for the Switch 2.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marques agreed. “Maybe we will see a bigger window of pricing as well, as seen from the Donkey Kong game.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inzoi">InZoi</a> - the early access life-sim game from Krafton - debuted at the end of March, and has since passed a record breaking sales milestone for the company.</p>
<p>In its first week of release, InZoi crossed the 1m sales mark. This lofty figure marks the fastest sales milestone ever achieved by a Krafton published title.</p>

<p>"We are grateful and excited to present InZoi to players around the world through Early Access," said CEO CH Kim, adding: "We will continue to actively communicate with players and foster InZoi as Krafton’s long-term franchise IP."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://x.com/PlayinZOI/status/1908082411906449478/photo/1">writing on social media</a>, the team said this is a "number that still feels unreal to us and a milestone we could not have reached without each and every one of you".</p>
<p>
"Your excitement, your creations, your feedback, your content, and your support have brought InZoi to life in ways we never could have imagined."</p>

<p>Despite this impressive start, InZoi's launch hasn't been without its issues. Last week, Krafton had to patch out a bug in its early access release, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inzoi-developer-resolves-to-strengthen-internal-review-processes-following-bug-which-allowed-players-to-run-over-and-kill-children">allowed players to run over children in InZoi with a car and kill them</a>.</p>
<p>"This issue was caused by an unintended bug that has been resolved in the latest patch. These depictions are highly inappropriate and do not reflect the intent and values of InZoi," a Krafton spokesperson told Eurogamer. </p>
<p>
"We understand the seriousness of this matter and age-appropriate content and we are strengthening our internal review processes to prevent similar incidents in the future."</p>

<p>Team Cherry has had the world waiting with bated breath for a long time. It seemed like Hollow Knight Silksong didn’t exist at one point, but new developments mean we have a release period—and we might finally get to hear Silksong’s voice.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight Silksong has become somewhat of a myth in recent times. The Metroidvania sequel might be the most sought-after sequel after GTA 6. If you think I’m being hyperbolic, you only need to look at Steam’s wishlist page at any point in the last few months (maybe years) to see it’s been a constant number one.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct event</a> was massive for Nintendo fans, but inadvertently got the Silksong hopefuls up in arms.</p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-release-period">Hollow Knight Silksong Release Period</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Anything more specific? Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>We know Hollow Knight Silksong is set to release at some point in 2025, but there’s no official release date yet.</strong></p>



<p>Honestly, we’ll take it at this point. Six years after the game’s official announcement, a Silksong release date continues to elude us. But at least the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct confirmed it’s arriving this year.</p>



<p>The presentation had a “Partner Sizzle Reel” showing off <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-games-announced-during-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several games coming to Switch 2</a>. Hollow Knight Silksong was thrown in early on with a few seconds of gameplay. But crucially, it showed off the “2025” release period. The sequel is finally starting to look like it’s arriving in 2025.</p>

<p>Insider Gaming will duly (and excitedly) update you once <a href="https://hollowknightsilksong.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hollow Knight Silksong</a> has an official release date.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-hollow-knight-silksong-taking-so-long">Why is Hollow Knight Silksong Taking so Long?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The world is ready. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Team Cherry hasn’t given an official reason as to why Hollow Knight Silksong is taking so long, but it’s more than likely due to the studio wanting to improve and perfect the experience to ensure it’s complete for release.</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, Silksong was supposed to release in 2023. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silksong-delayed-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delay was announced</a> with the developer explaining on <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1656106351184199680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1656106351184199680%7Ctwgr%5E0123a947c87bc1d12a132d80aea81715e67f8dc6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Finsider-gaming.com%2Fsilksong-delayed-2023%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>: “We had planned to release in the 1st half of 2023, but development is still continuing. We’re excited by how the game is shaping up, and it’s gotten quite big, so we want to take the time to make the game as good as we can.”</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-rating-suggests-release-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silksong was officially rated in April 2024</a>, leading everyone to believe a release was imminent. Unfortunately, 2024 came and went with no sign of the game. In January 2025, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-cherry-gives-small-update-on-hollow-knight-silksong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Team Cherry explained</a>: “Yes, the game is real, progressing, and will release.” This addressed concerns that Silksong’s development was troubled or canceled.</p>



<p>Fast forward to April 2025, and we finally have a Silksong release period. After six years, it feels the waiting is nearly done!</p>

            <p>The Marvel Rivals team has admitted it's feeling "pressure" to keep the game exciting as it prepares its second season, which boasts a Hellfire Gala theme.</p>
<p>"Since the launch of season one, we've been deeply contemplating how Marvel Rivals can continuously deliver fun and engaging experiences for you all," Marvel Rivals creative director Guangyun Chen shared in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOuv0tO_aLI">accompanying Dev Vision video</a>. The developer noted that "discussions on social media have certainly added some pressure on us to keep the game as exciting as it has been since December", but the team wants to ensure it fulfills "everyone's fantasies about Marvel Super Heroes".</p>
<p>Hellfire Gala was initially a 12-part X-Men comic book storyline, and is now making its way to the free-to-play shooter. "After the intense Eternal Night saga and defeat of Dracula, Emma Frost has prepared a lavish celebration, inviting everyone to don their best attire and venture to the Mutant haven of the Living Island Krakoa for the annual Hellfire Gala," the Marvel Rivals team teases.</p>

</figure>
<p>Of course, things don't go to plan, and Ultron eventually pops up and crashes the festivities. "Attending heroes must spring into action to protect Krakoa's greatest treasure from his grasp."</p>
<p>Season two kicks off on 11th April. Following this season, players will notice the developer shifting to a "two-month format", and each month a new hero will make their debut.</p>
<p>As for the second season specifically, you may have surmised given that official blurb, when it launches, Emma Frost will join the roster of heroes, in a Vanguard role. She is a telepathy master, and can "adeptly utilise her telepathic and diamond abilities as the situation demands, standing at the forefront to shield her allies and obliterate her foes". Ultron will also be arriving as a playable hero, but later in the season.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as far as maps are concerned for the second season of Marvel Rivals, the first one coming is - understandably - Hellfire Gala: Krakoa. This map will feature the gala itself, which the development team describes as "grand" and full of "dreamy botanical landscapes and beautiful fireworks" (which, honestly, every party should have).</p>
<p>This season will also introduce some adjustments to the Marvel Rivals' Team-Up Abilities, while the developer is "implementing weekly missions alongside the existing daily missions and challenges, which will help active players fully claim all rewards from the Battle Pass by the end of the season".</p>
<p>You can check out the various <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/">patch notes for Marvel Rivals here</a>. Meanwhile, you can watch a teaser for season two below.</p>

<p>Back in February, it was announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">Marvel Rivals had amassed over 40 million players since its launch</a>. Despite this success, NetEase <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">laid off an unspecified number of the Marvel Rivals development team</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>Following this, the Marvel Rivals publisher said the layoffs were a "difficult decision" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-publisher-netease-responds-to-shocking-layoffs-claims-they-were-to-optimise-development-efficiency">made to "optimise development efficiency" for the game</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo has revealed the size of its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">Switch 2 games</a>, so you can calculate how much storage is required.</p>
<p>To reiterate from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">Direct earlier this week</a>, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> comes with 256GB of internal storage - eight times that of the original Switch. But how quickly will you fill that up with games?</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/">Japanese My Nintendo Store</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> will be the largest launch game at 23.4GB - around 10 percent of overall storage capacity.</p>

<p>Nintendo's other major first party game is Donkey Kong Bananza, which comes in at 10GB.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the GameCube Nintendo Classics collection will be 3.5GB, though this only includes three games to begin with: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-gamecube-games-coming-to-switch-2-via-switch-online-along-with-purchasable-gamecube-inspired-controller">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Soul Calibur 2, and F-Zero GX</a>. This suggests each new game added to the collection will likely be just over 1GB each.</p>
<p>Then there are the upgraded Switch games for the new console: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> will total 7.7GB, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> will be 5.7GB.</p>
<p>Nintendo is known for keeping its game sizes relatively low, which at least means it will be a while until an expansion of the internal storage is required.</p>
<p>This will be through <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-best-micro-sd-express-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2">microSD Express cards</a>, as explained in the Direct, which offer high speed data transfer. However, it does mean microSD cards used in the original Switch won't be compatible, so is an extra cost to consider.</p>
<p>What's more, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-switch-2-actually-cheaper-than-the-original-console-cost-in-the-uk-and-whats-the-situation-with-switch-2-pricing-globally">physical games will be more expensive than digital</a>, which feels like a push from Nintendo towards a digital future. Ultimately, that's going to require more storage space.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-has-10x-the-graphics-performance-of-the-nintendo-switch-claims-nvidia">Nvidia has also detailed the tech specs of the new console</a>, claiming it has "10x the graphics performance" of the original Switch. It also supports DLSS for AI-enhanced upscaling - perhaps another reason for the relatively low game sizes.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/nintendo-switch-2s-joy-con-mouse-mode-is-a-literal-game-changer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo love a gimmick. Sometimes it ends up with three prongs on your controller, other times it’s waggle controls that even your nan can have fun with, and sometimes it’s something that you think is going to be a quirky niche idea, but that has the potential to be so much more. That’s the Joy-Con 2’s mouse input mode.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest, this is destined to be one of the many console-specific features that most third parties are going to overlook or pay the most minimal lip service to, but when it is used effectively, it can be, dare I say, game-changing?</p>
<p><iframe title="Drag x Drive – Nintendo Direct | Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hku89o38-hQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s optical sensors in the connection rails of both left and right Joy-Con 2 controllers, making them both equally usable as impromptu computer mice. It’s as simple as tipping or holding the Joy-Con on its side with the sensor to a surface and, combined with the gyroscope and motion sensor, the Switch knows immediately that you’ve got it in mouse mode. You don’t need to have the strap attachment on the Joy-Con to do this, but with the two glides at top and bottom of the rail, they do help give you a smooth motion when using it as a mouse.</p>
<p>Thanks to modern optical sensors, which take tiny pixellated images thousands of times a second for motion tracking, the Joy-Con 2 can be used on many surfaces. Sure, a tabletop with a large mouse mat gives the best experience, but this is adaptable and, just like using a computer mouse in an awkward spot, you can use the Joy-Con 2 on your trouser leg or arm of your sofa.</p>


<p>From the initial batch of games, Drag x Drive is the one that is really built around the mouse controller. It’s not about using it as a pointer here, but rather as a physical motion to simulate pushing left and right wheels on your character’s wheelchair. Just push the mouse along the surface to get yourself up to speed, use only one in order to turn, the triggers to brake, and then motion controls to lift up the basketball and shoot from range –&nbsp;you can, naturally, go in for a sick ramp jump and dunk the ball.</p>
<p>It’s a tiring game from the repetitious, uncommon arm movement, and it takes a while to adjust to manoeuvring yourself like this –&nbsp;speaking as someone who does not use a wheelchair. In that way, I’m reminded somewhat of ARMS, the boxing game from around the launch of the Nintendo Switch. Physical motion and controls, a small-scale sports game, and a testbed to prove the potential.</p>

<p>More likely, mouse mode will be used for smaller spin-off modes and minigames. That’s exactly what you find in Super Mario Party Jamboree’s Switch 2 Edition expansion. We got to try out six of these, with a mixture of shaking and spray painting, air hockey, pulling back to launch windup cars, and one of those precision mazes where you can’t touch the sides. They’re great little games and rather intuitive, but some will be more suited to trouser play than others.</p>
<p>But for me, the most impactful use was actually with Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. If you’re holding individual Joy-Con 2, then at any time you can switch from standard gamepad controls to mouse mode just by tipping the controller on its side. It sounds dumb, but it was an ample reminder of just how much more precise mouse controls are for aiming than gamepads are.</p>
<p>The section that we played was action heavy with plenty of battles against Space Pirates that build up to a boss battle against a Metroid-infested monstrosity. The precision of the mouse mode let me track and aim at enemies just so much better and more intuitively.</p>

<p>However, there’s a few added quirks here. For one thing, there’s still a target lock-on, a bit of a holdover from earlier Metroid Prime titles, and there’s also a free-aim toggle that can be used with motion or mouse mode control. Motion felt floaty and vague here, when trying to hit multiple targets on a door, but mouse mode was absolutely precise.</p>
<p>It got to the point where I thought that I’d switch back to gamepad controls, but found that I basically couldn’t aim anymore. I quickly just tipped my hand over and went back to mouse mode.</p>
<p>And that’s the power of this option. It will only really be applicable as an instant control mode shift when playing with Joy-Con in hand, but if that’s how you play (as opposed to with a Pro Controller or in handheld mode), then this has the potential to be a great option. But that caveat of needing to play with separate Joy-Con is probably what will doom this to being a niche and oft-overlooked feature.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-explains-why-the-switch-2-has-an-lcd-screen-first-info-on-game-download-size-is-promising/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 screen features&nbsp;<span>many advancements compared to the Switch 1. It's larger (7.9 inches versus 6.2) and has a higher resolution (1080p versus 720p). It also supports High Dynamic Range and Variable Refresh Rate (the latter through NVIDIA G-SYNC, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as confirmed yesterday by NVIDIA</a>), with a maximum refresh rate of 120Hz</span>.</p>
<p>However, it is not an OLED screen, which means <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-oled-model-feels-like-more-than-a-toy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch OLED</a> users (who were also blessed with a larger 7-inch screen) may feel like it's a bit of a downgrade when it comes to the lack of infinite contrast and truly inky blacks. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-decided-to-go-from-the-switch-oled-to-an-lcd-screen-for-switch-2-after-a-lot-of-consideration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to IGN</a>,&nbsp;Tetsuya Sasaki, General Manager of the Technology Development Division and Senior Director of the Technology Development Department at Nintendo, explained:</p>
<p><em>Now there's a lot of advancements that have been made in LCD technology during development. We took a look at the technology that was available to us now and after a lot of consideration we decided to stick to LCD.</em></p>
<p>In all honesty, many fans are simply convinced that Nintendo is waiting to release a more expensive OLED model a couple of years down the line. On the upside, at least there's a cheaper LCD model available with this approach.</p>
<p>On another note, as spotted <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/preeliminary-switch-2-game-file-sizes-revealed-mk-world-23-4-gb-donkey-kong-bananza-10-gb.1155054/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on ResetEra</a>, the Japanese My Nintendo Store already includes preliminary information on how much space will be needed to install Nintendo Switch 2 games on the new console.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mario Kart World - 23.4 GB</li>
<li>Donkey Kong Bananza - 10.0 GB</li>
<li>GameCube Nintendo Classics - 3.5 GB</li>
<li>Super Mario Jamboree Switch 2 Edition - 7.7 GB</li>
</ul>
<p>There's definitely an increase when it comes to the required install space compared to the Switch. However, we are nowhere near the size of most PC, PlayStation, and Xbox games, which approach or even surpass 100GB nowadays. On the flip side, those platforms have much larger drives available, whereas the Switch 2 only has 256GB (albeit expandable with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-appears-to-be-using-microsd-express-format/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microSD Express format</a>).</p>

            <p>Bungie have broken a silence surrounding their upcoming extraction shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> to tweet <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1907840558544072722">a short video full of cryptic symbols</a>. It's proven hard for fans to decrypt so far, but the developers have since followed up with a few more teasey posts, including one that certainly reads like a notice to fans that more information on the game will be revealed soon. "The signal is coming. The truth is coming," says a line of plain text in the marketing spritz. "Are you ready?" </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The first post on Xitter to send fans into a flap was that spliced video of various symbols swishing around. Some users think you have to <a href="https://x.com/johnotron604/status/1907862522490769613">cut up the video</a> and piece it back together correctly before attempting to decode the symbols' meanings. But most of the Xitterati just immediately gave up and asked the social media's built-in AI Grok what the video meant. Grok didn't know. It said the post <a href="https://x.com/grok/status/1907844677363011806">was marketing</a>.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the studio's social media account shared more. It posted an animation showing a code being slowly decrypted, while warning of an <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1907931118780788824">"unauthorized transmission"</a>. Alongside this was a link to an ARG website with a Twitch login. Currently the Twitch login just brings you to a page saying "Access Denied". It all basically looks like a fancy and playful way of saying "broadcast incoming", but who knows.  </p>
<p>Finally, the most recent post shows another animated image, depicting <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1907956872046690602">a snake with a written message alongside</a>. "The signal bleeds through their jamming," it reads. "Symbols not random. Not accident. Not noise. But VOICE." It compels the reader to "decrypt decrypt decrypt" and ends with a final hypey warning. "The signal is coming. The truth is coming. Are you ready? RISE RISE RISE."</p>

<p>Bungie have been fond of these ARG marketing tactics since the days of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-2">Halo 2</a>. The last concrete news we got of Marathon was in a brief video from game director Joe Ziegler in which he reassured everyone that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-seek-to-reassure-everyone-that-marathon-is-still-alive-by-saying-almost-nothing-about-it">the game was still alive</a>. That was in October last year. He didn't share much about the actual game itself, however, beyond brief mentions of two playable character classes, one referred to as "stealth" and the other as "thief". </p>
<p>Marathon has had a troubled development so far. The company <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">laid off hundreds of people</a> last year, doubtless impacting the game's production. And director Christopher Barrett was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-replace-marathon-director-amid-reports-of-creative-leadership-shake-up">taken off the project</a> after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-are-the-text-messages-that-allegedly-got-a-former-bungie-executive-fired-according-to-a-court-document-written-by-sony">allegations of "predatory behaviour"</a> towards several women working at the studio. Marathon will be the studio's first release since being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sonys-purchase-of-bungie-is-now-complete">bought by Sony in 2022</a>, and Sony have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-write-off-ill-fated-200-million-shooter-concord-as-a-loss-by-closing-studio-permanently">somewhat ruthless</a> towards the makers of live service games lately. The stakes feel quite high.</p>
<p>As someone who enjoys the feel of Bungie's shooters (and who still counts the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-full-original-marathon-trilogy-is-now-free-on-steam-but-bungie-are-still-quiet-on-the-reboot">original Marathon trilogy</a> as good <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> games) I'm interested to see how this reboot might play with the extraction shooter genre. But I'm also, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-should-redefine-live-service-games-as-the-living-dead">like others</a>, dead tired of live service games. I think I just preferred Bungie when they made Halo. Anyway, we'll keep an eye out for more news on the feeds - both the real ones, and the ones that shout RISE at you a lot. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-will-release-on-pc-in-april-adding-a-grand-hub-mizutsune-and-new-quests">first big title update</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is upon us like a large, iridescent squirrel dragon covered in bubbles, and when I say a large, iridescent squirrel dragon covered in bubbles I am, of course, referring to the Mizutsune – a new Wilds monster last seen in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a>.</p>
<p>It and a new, high rank version of the Zoh Shia are the title update’s headline additions. But it’s not <em>all</em> monster hunting. There’s also a new social area, the Grand Hub, wherein you can hang with your mates, bowl exploding barrels and do some arm-wrestling. With your mates, I assume. The changelog just says "Arm Wrestling Barrel". I assume you won't be arm-wrestling a barrel. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The update requires 6GB of storage space, or 16GB if you’re using the high resolution texture packs. If you’re wondering where to find the Mizutsune, you’ll need to reach Hunter Rank 21 to unlock a mission you can start by speaking to Kanya in the Scarlet Forest Base Camp. Complete that mission, and the bubble-huffing rainbow lizard is yours for the slaying. There’s a Tempered version of the Mizutsune to fight after HR 41. As for the high rank Zoh Shia, you’ll need to be HR 50 to access the relevant story mission. 
</p>
<p>
Naturally, these munsters bring with them new weapon and armour crafting options. We can also expect new skills, status ailments, pop-up camp gear options, limited bounty categories, voice lines and poses. The Grand Hub becomes available after completing a tutorial mission that appears from HR 16.
</p>
<p>
It’s a bountiful rework indeed, with a bunch of balancing adjustments and fixes to wash down the extra critters, gear and quests. As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-easing-up-its-vram-hogging-toughening-up-even-more-monsters">promised</a>, there have been some PC technical improvements as well, though it’s hard to gauge from the fleeting description just how much difference they’ll make: “Improvements were made to VRAM usage, and the DirectStorage version has been upgraded.” 
</p>

            <p>In a recent episode of the <a href="https://youtu.be/f_VP86VvwDk">Quad Damage podcast</a>, Arkane founder Raphaël Colantonio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arkanes-founder-is-open-to-the-idea-of-making-dishonored-3-just-dont-place-any-bets-on-it-actually-happening">spoke about his ideas for a new Dishonored game</a>. He, Harvey Smith, and Dinga Bakaba all had their own ideas for a sequel, he said, although the odds of any of them being developed are low as all three devs now work on different projects.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the podcast, the subject turned to Colantonio's thoughts on AI and the future of immersive sims. In short, he sounds optimistic. "If AI could really remember everything, and take meaningful human decisions like a Dungeons and Dragons Gamemaster, then that would actually be very valuable. Things we could not do. There would not be a team that is big enough to do this kind of thing."</p>
<p>"One of the things about immersive sims is that we are always trying, either to plan for everything that we think the player might do - and that's authoring, that's painful," Colantonio said. "Or, we're doing a lot of failsafes with systems that somehow fall back on their feet if the player does something we did not plan. There's always some stuff the players do that we haven't planned, so that's why you have the net under. But that net's a little janky. Sometimes it works, sometimes not."</p>

<p>"Everybody hates AI ... and for frankly good reasons. But there is space for AI to improve the tools," he continued.  "Not to do our job, but improve the tools. If you look at the way we made games in the nineties, it's pretty similar to how we make games today. The tools have barely evolved. I mean, they have, but it's still the same principles, the same ideas. If you need to make your level a little bigger, you still have to pull the props apart and add the middle prop that's missing there, make sure the textures match. It's an absolute pain."</p>
<p>He thinks that level designers spend a lot of time doing "grunt work", and that this could be improved if "there was an equivalent of a chatbot GPT embedded in some tools. And I'm sure it's going to happen tomorrow. You'll look at your building, and say: make it bigger. Make it wider. Change the style. And then it's done very fast. And then you become the director of that level."</p>
<p>The tools for making games Colantonio began his career with have evolved, he goes on, but not that drastically (as ever, the difficulty with genAI discussions is distinguishing between the current wave of new product announcements and older tools which make less showy use of automation and generation.) Meanwhile, team sizes and budgets <em>have</em> gone up dramatically. "We're throwing people at the problems. Making games with 1000 people doesn't make sense. It was not meant to be. There's nothing admirable about that. It's just a lot of money and a lot of people that are probably not having a fun job. I would rather go back to the way things were when teams were between 20 and 50 people."</p>
<p>WolfEye, Colantonio's current studio, indeed started with around 19 people, and now<a href="https://gamerant.com/wolfeye-studios-new-game-interview/"> sits at "50-60"</a>. They're currently working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wolfeyes-new-first-person-rpg-is-an-evolution-of-prey-and-dishonored-featuring-mechs-magnets-and-a-continuous-world">an unnamed first-person RPG</a> that harkens back to the immersive sims their alumni are famous for. "The ingenuity and gadgetry of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> and Prey with a 'real <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>' experience redolent of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> and modern-day Fallout."</p>
<p>I've obviously made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-some-better-terms-for-genai-output-slop-is-too-benign">my own thoughts about GenAI known</a>, but I've still got some learning to do, and there's evidently a distinction between aiding artists and trying to replace them. And, hey, call me biased, but I'm more inclined to listen to someone like Colantonio than I am some LinkedIn bozo screaming about the future without giving me a reason to care in the present. That said, I'm concerned that he's still speaking mostly speculatively here, about "space for" and "tomorrow". And the sort of people gaining wealth and power in this space between "might" and "does" aren't necessarily the ones that share Colantonio's values. If WolfEye ever decide to make a new protagonist specialise in the ol' six-finger discount, I'm going to live with the rats.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The free Title Update 1 for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> was released yesterday, bringing with it new quests where players compete for the fastest hunt time. However, Capcom has warned of potential cheaters, which will lead to account suspension and invalid completion times.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/topics/arena-quests/">new Arena Quests, Challenge Quests, and Free Challenge Quests</a> allow players to take on monsters with either pre-determined or their choice of equipment, as they compete for the fastest times. Players will be rewarded with a position on the leaderboard and cosmetic pendants.</p>
<p>However, in a statement shared on social media, Capcom warned against cheaters and the use of external tools. "To ensure a fun and fair experience for our players, we will take action against accounts participating in fraudulent ranking activity, such as the use of cheating or external tools," it said.</p>

<p>"Accounts deemed to be in breach of this may be suspended, or have restrictions placed on them, such as being unable to receive rewards from these quests.</p>
<p>"Also, if cheating is confirmed in a multiplayer hunt by any member(s) of a team, the completion time for the quest will be deemed invalid and the right to rewards can be revoked for the whole party.</p>
<p>"Please take caution to avoid playing multiplayer with those who are engaging in prohibited activity, or those you suspect of such."</p>
<p>Capcom also requests any suspected prohibited behaviour is reported, by navigating to their Hunter Profile screen. It also noted these quests can be completed solo, or with Support Hunters, to avoid cheaters.</p>

<p>Potential cheating or use of external tools is most likely to be from PC players, though crossplay is enabled between PC and console players.</p>
<p>In addition to this, Capcom has noted it's aware of a game crash when players talk to Nata and select Sekka to trade items at the Village Intermediary. This can be resolved by waiting for a while or resting at the BBQ Menu.</p>
<p>It's also updated its <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/support/wilds/en/faq/detail/060">list of currently known issues</a>.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds has proven exceptionally popular. Earlier this week, Capcom announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-rises-beyond-another-impressive-milestone-in-first-month">game had surpassed 10m copies since its release</a> on 28th February.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-first-major-content-update-detailed-ahead-of-next-weeks-release">new update is available now</a>, which on top of the new quests adds Mizutsune - first seen in 2015's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-generations">Monster Hunter Generations</a> - as well as other new features and gear.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>As promised, CAPCOM has released the first major Monster Hunter Wilds update today. On Steam, the update is a 6GB download or 16GB if you have high-resolution textures installed. There are a lot of bug fixes, of course, but the main highlights are listed below:</p>

<li>New story, extra, and side missions have been added to Monster Hunter Wilds.</li>
<li>New weapons, armor, and skills have been added.</li>

<li>The Expedition Record Board has been added to the Grand Hub, along with rankings for time attack quests.</li>

<li>Challenge Quests and Free Challenge Quests (Challenge Quests with no equipment restrictions) have been added and will be made available at a later date.</li>
<li>New status ailments have been added.</li>
<li>New voice lines for Alma (the Handler) have been added.</li>
<li>An arena log page has been added to hunter profiles.</li>
<li>The Change Appearance menu in the camp now has an option to change Alma's outfit.</li>
<li>New pop-up camp gear options have been added.</li>
<li>New limited bounty categories have been added.</li>

<p>There's also a limited-time Event Quest where hunters can head to the Ruins of Wyveria and face a Guardian Doshaguma in "Anguish and Atrocity". Successfully completing the quest will see them earn extra Hunter Rank Points. The Event Quest is available until April 8 at 4:59 PM Pacific Time.</p>
<p>By the way, the developer warned players of a known issue where the game crashes when talking to Nata and selecting Sekka to trade items at the Village Intermediary. The current workaround requires waiting a certain amount of time or resting at the BBQ Menu.</p>
<p>CAPCOM has recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-sold-10-million-units-establishing-first-month-sales-record-for-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that Monster Hunter Wilds broke the publisher's all-time records for first-month sales, with over 10 million units sold across all platforms. It is, therefore, well on its way to surpassing its predecessor, Monster Hunter World, which currently leads with 21.30 million units sold; still, the developer's continued support with patches and DLCs will be critical to reaching that objective.</p>
