			<p>Many of us have probably been in the situation where you have forgotten where you parked your car, which leads to pacing up and down the rows in the general vicinity of where you think you parked, while wracking your brain for what level and area you pulled up in. It is a situation that can be panic inducing as thoughts go through your mind, like maybe the car was stolen? Then that panic subsides when you see your car and life goes on. A Dream About Parking Lots takes that situation and turns it into a half hour therapy session.</p>
<p><iframe title="A Dream About Parking Lots — Out Now on Consoles" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sP2EGhbyqwE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A Dream About Parking Lots is a dreamy maze-like experience in which all you have to do is find the right car. You are armed with a key fob which you can keep pressing in the hope of hearing the car’s horn, which sounds simple enough. However, you must navigate mazes of other cars to find the right one, all the while talking to a therapist. The dialogue has multiple choices that steer the conversation based on your decisions. For the majority of the game, it does genuinely feel like you are having a therapy session, trying to figure out why you are dreaming about parking lots and what it signifies in your own life.</p>


<p>Across the 30 minutes of game time, A Dream About Parking Lots will transport you to different parking lot locations, each with cars parked in a generally neat formation, though there are obstacles that will make you look for the correct path. As you move through the dreams each area gets a bit more off putting. Most scenes still look normal, but they can also be a little disconcerting with things that are not quite right, just like dreams. It’s lent a further surreal element by the retro aesthetic, with blocky, simplistic environments .</p>


<p>The conversation between you and the therapist is the main strength of A Dream About Parking Lots. There is no voice dialogue so you have to read and take in what is being said. There are some poignant life lessons peppered through the dialogue with the responses dependant on the dialogue choices. Like I mentioned earlier, this does feel like a therapy session, even if it does not delve as deep as a real one would.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		A Dream About Parking Lots is an interesting little experience that uses a real life situation many of us would have found ourselves in, and uses it to create a therapy session. It is a short and succinct experience that has quite a lot of depth to it, though it isn’t the best looking title.	</p></div>

			<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation is being added this Thursday to the game The First Descendant. Nexon's free-to-play third-person shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-geforce-game-ready-driver-optimizes-the-first-descendant-nvidia-dlss-3-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Ray Reconstruction, DLAA, Reflex, and ray tracing</a>, but with the official launch of Season 3 on August 7, GeForce RTX 50 Series will get even better performance thanks to Multi Frame Generation. On average, DLSS 4 runs the game 4.9x faster than native rendering. The flagship GPU, the RTX 5090, averages 226 frames per second with ray tracing enabled and DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance Mode (with the transformer model). The RTX 5080 registers 192 FPS under the same conditions.</p>



<p>Season 3 'Breakthrough' also sees the addition of Nell, a new playable character who wields arc-like telekinetic abilities, launching energy spheres that inflict debuffs and pull nearby enemies into her attacks. She is ideal for fast-paced, aggressive, run-and-gun players because she can convert all gunfire into weak point hits. Breakthrough will also expand the game world by adding a big new field area called "Axion" and a formidable Colossus boss battle. Lastly, Players can also look forward to a mountable vehicle, which will allow them to travel faster across the regions of The First Descendant.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation is also available (alongside DLSS Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and Reflex) in the single player survival horror puzzle Death Relives. Developed by small and independent Turkish developer Nyctophile Studios, Death Relives takes inspiration from Aztec mythology and real historical events from the 16th century. Players find themselves in a nightmarish world where they must survive against long-forgotten gods, such as Xipe Totec—the Aztec god of death, life, rebirth, agriculture, vegetation, and deadly warfare. </p>



<p>Throughout the game, they will visit historical locations, such as the ship Hernán Cortés traveled on to reach the land of the Aztecs. The dark and eerie atmosphere of Death Relives hides other entities lurking in the shadows that are revealed through the storyline as the protagonist, Adrian, progresses through the game. Death Relives launched around ten days ago <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1987400/Death_Relives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a> and so far, most user reviews (83%) are positive.</p>

                <p>Fleshy architecture has been a popular choice for developers looking to create uncomfortably squishy levels, but the original team behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/system-shock-2/" data-ref-id="5000-278">System Shock 2</a>--Looking Glass--might have taken things a little <em>too </em>far back in the '90s. According to System Shock 2 artist Nate Wells, the structures inhabited by the hostile aliens known as The Many had a surprising origin, as the art assets included photos of another developer's colonoscopy.</p><p>"When we were working on The Many, if you remember, it has this very biological vibe to it," Wells said to Nightdive's Locke Vincent in the studio's Deep Dive podcast (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/system-shock-2s-alien-sphincter-doors-were-made-with-photos-from-a-devs-colonoscopy/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>). It's this fleshy mass that has taken over the Rickenbacker. We did these things called 'sphincter doors,' this sphincter that opens up. I was making the doors and doing the concept. I think I was searching through some gross biological [images], like endoscopy sort of stuff. [Looking Glass producer] Josh Randall approached me and said he had a video of his colonoscopy."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egEqjOg9zfE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/egEqjOg9zfE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Wells said that Randall gave him images from his colonoscopy video, and he used a frozen frame "from somewhere in his large intestine" to create a base texture for the sphincter doors in the game. "If you look at those doors, you're seeing Josh Randall's colon⁠--audio genius Josh Randall's colon," Wells said.</p><p>The rest was history, as System Shock 2 garnered plenty of high praise when it was released in 1999, with most people none the wiser about having explored the inner workings of the human body while fighting a killer worms-like species--years before the Planet Express crew did so in <a href="https://youtu.be/CYKJYOJZUk0" rel="nofollow ">an episode of Futurama</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/system-shock-2/">System Shock 2</a>'s 25th-anniversary remaster recently launched for PC, and after a slight delay, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/system-shock-2-remaster-is-finally-out-on-consoles-next-week/1100-6532869/">it landed on consoles in July</a>. The project proved to be a labor of love for Nightdive Studios <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/system-shock-2-enhanced-edition-announced-and-in-d/1100-6469015/">after it was first announced in 2019</a>, as the studio didn't have access to the game's complete source code and it had to piece everything back together with some "extensive" reverse-engineering.</p>

<p>"When you look for excellence in our legacy, [Bad Company 2] is where you find it," Chubb said. "That game particularly delivered on a level of fidelity and a sort of intimate destructive experience. Blasting out a single wall, bringing down a partial building, or entire buildings. It was comprehensive, and it felt like the identity of that game more than anything else."</p><p>Chubb acknowledged this identity was "kind of missing" from Battlefield 2042. "We really wanted to go back to that" with Battlefield 6, the developer said.</p><p>Before this, the designer of Bad Company 2, David Goldfarb, said leaked footage from the Battlefield 6 alpha test was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-battlefield-6-footage-gives-off-bad-company-2-vibes-dev-says/1100-6531668/" data-ref-id="1100-6531668">giving off "Bad Company 2 vibes."</a> Beyond Bad Company 2, the Battlefield 6 developers have also said they were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-could-be-the-successor-to-battlefield-3-4-the-series-needs/1100-6533646/" data-ref-id="1100-6533646">inspired by Battlefield 3 and 4.</a></p><p>2021's Battlefield 2042 missed the mark for many fans of the series, and the teams at EA said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-reflect-on-battlefield-2042s-poor-launch-and-how-it-shaped-new-game/1100-6533676/" data-ref-id="1100-6533676">they learned a lot from the game's struggles</a>. The sentiment around Battlefield 6 following the big multiplayer reveal recently has been mostly positive, but only time will tell if the game becomes a success. Beyond Battlefield 6's multiplayer and campaign, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">new battle royale experience is in the works as well.</a></p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">Battlefield 6 open beta</a> begins August 7 for a limited group of people before expanding more widely later in August. The full game, meanwhile, launches October 10 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

The plan was for these games to be published by unnamed external partners, spreading out the risks of triple-A development while preserving the team sizes needed for big budget games. The company would be a "stable home" for game developers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That plan has been put to the test over the last 9 years—and the company still hasn't released any games. It shut down two projects </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/developer-probablymonsters-lays-off-battle-barge-staff-after-project-cancellation">in 2024</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-probablymonsters-conducting-more-layoffs-after-pledging-to-build-stable-home-for-developers-">2025</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> despite raising</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/multi-studio-game-company-probablymonsters-nets-200-million-to-continue-expansion">&nbsp;hundreds millions</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in funding over the years.

Ryan spoke to Game Developer on the eve of the company revealing its first projects to hit the market: a co-op side-scrolling roguelike called </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Storm Lancers</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on Nintendo Switch (not the Switch 2—though it will be available there via backwards compatibility) and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ire: Prologue</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a first-person psychological horror game for Steam and the Epic Game Store. Both games will retail at the decidedly not-very-triple-A price of $19.99.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/are-unreasonable-investor-expectations-the-cause-of-poor-video-game-market-conditions-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Are 'unreasonable investor expectations' the cause of poor video game market conditions?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ryan seemed passionate about that price point, drawing a line to how it connects to ProbablyMonsters' new vision for triple-A projects. But passion doesn't account for the fact that to get to this point, he and the leadership team laid off at least 50 workers along the way.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most CEOs we ask about layoffs shy away from the topic, quickly falling back on PR talking points. Ryan took the unusual step of raising the layoffs unprompted early in our conversation. He did so in part </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/op-ed-the-upsides-downsides-and-future-of-aaa-game-development">to lay out what's changed</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> since he shared his vision for triple-A development in a 2020 blog—and why </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/are-unreasonable-investor-expectations-the-cause-of-poor-video-game-market-conditions-">the economic havoc</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftereffects (which were warming up as he wrote that post) upended how he thought the next few years would play out.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He argued ProbablyMonsters is on the path to sustainability—but a different kind than what he envisioned five years ago.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="ProbablyMonsters was founded in an age of robust third-party publishing">ProbablyMonsters was founded in an age of robust third-party publishing</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Initially Ryan attributed the 2024 and 2025 layoffs to the fact that the video game market "moved on and evolved." That phrase echoes what we've heard from other industry leaders describing changing player tastes, competition from user generated content (UGC) platforms, and post-lockdown personal finances.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On follow-up, Ryan clarified he was referring more to the state of games funding. "For many of the games, the primary biggest issue was they were built at a scale where they needed a level of funding to finish the game to take it from vertical slice...the way our teams were set up, &nbsp;it was designed to be funded by a publisher. The business model shift in the industry has been pretty drastic across the board as well."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The CEO was careful to avoid specifying if any publishing deals were canceled, reneged, or ended for other means. "I would say that the viability of the offers from publishers didn't support...going in that same direction," he said. He added later that finding new publishers has been difficult because there are fewer and fewer of them. "Two of what were the top seven publishers in the world aren't independent publishers anymore. Microsoft bought Zenimax and Activision Blizzard."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for whether the games could be reworked to ship without a publisher—he said that wasn't possible. "We couldn't responsibly bring [those games] to market without a triple-A publisher."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But couldn't they? They raised millions in capital after all. "A lot of games, as you launch them, you need to be able to service them and the scale of the market it's shipping into. You need to continue to ensure the delight of your fanbase," said Ryan. "You need to make sure that not only can you get the game built and launch it, but you can also support it." Ryan did not indicate if these games were live service titles or if he was referring to post-launch maintenance of single-player games, only that the plan had been for an external publisher to offer resources and fund such an initiative.</span></p><p>Image via ProbablyMonsters.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That raises the question: what about the people who set up the teams in that format? What accountability did ProbablyMonsters leader face for laying off workers?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ryan spoke carefully in response to that question. "I do feel like there has been accountability. As CEO, I bear the brunt of the accountability across the board. It's not easy to have gone through that cycle when you're looking at a game and it's just not fundable...as they were in a place where they needed a publisher to be a viable game in the marketplace."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He said management "did try" to press on with the canceled games, implying there was research into whether they could take some of the planned live service titles and ship them as standalone retail products.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for whatever consequences management faced—he first prefaced by saying that ProbablyMonsters leadership is "directly engaged." (He said no one on the leadership team is relaxing on a beach, waiting for the checks to come in.) Then he declined to state if anyone had been laid off with the affected workers.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I never want to make public statements about if anyone's ever held accountable to the point where they're released for that reason. I think it hurts their opportunity to learn from it and find another role," he said, noting that for some individuals, the responsibility went all the way back up to the unnamed publishers who stopped funding the games.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What does sustainability look like for ProbablyMonsters?">What does sustainability look like for ProbablyMonsters?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ryan explained that while plenty has changed since his public 2020 declaration on the state of triple-A games, he still feels it's a foundation for sustainability. What's changed since then (besides the market) are the realities of implementing sustainability.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One major lesson from the funding frustrations was the decision to ensure ProbablyMonsters's still-in-development games are prepared to make the kind of pivot that the canceled titles couldn't. "A bunch of the games in development today ares ones where we looked at the existing teams and said 'hey, if we could pivot you to a new game and get a game out in the next 18 months, what would you do?'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile, the production structure that's come into focus for ProbablyMonsters includes "short-term games, midterm games, and long-term games," with the goal of releasing multiple games a year at different shapes and sizes. Long-term games are ones with extensive research &amp; development cycles, and are meant to be made with "future technology." Midterm games are ones made with a "deeper bet" on their narrative or "tool chain," but with less R&amp;D than the previous titles. Finally, short-term games are ones where ProbablyMonsters developers looks at the next holiday season and asks "Where do we think there's consumer appetite? Where do we think there's an idea that we have that we're really excited to build with today's tools and technology?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stormlancers </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ire: Prologue</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are examples of "short-term games," though he said </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ire: Prologue</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is meant to be a standalone game that builds excitement for a future game in the same universe. The "next chapter" of that series has already been greenlit, Ryan said. Other ProbablyMonsters developers are working in other genres—one is working on a co-op "soulslike" (for the unfamiliar, a nascent phrase referring to games inspired by the Dark Souls series), an open-world role-playing game, and an "extraction base-builder."&nbsp;</span></p><p>Image via ProbablyMonsters.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The goal here is to set the teams up in a way that they're sustainably building and launching on a regular basis." That strategy does mirror the "culture of shipping" philosophy we heard about when </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/why-is-it-so-expensive-to-make-games-in-the-united-states-">speaking to developers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> about the high costs of making games in the United States in 2024.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Ryan, ProbablyMonsters no longer believes that triple-A publishers are a "one-size fits all" approach for the company, and it's now racing to ensure it has positive revenue. When asked if ProbablyMonsters' investors were focused on finding a profitable exit, he said that the company's backers are "100 percent aligned" with his goal of building a sustainable studio.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The biggest pressure I take on as the CEO is the livelihoods of the employees in the company." ProbablyMonsters' end goal is to "delight the consumer," but he said the means to do that is to make a "predictable, successful, and respectful place for game developers to work."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The real hard part for everyone in the industry today is the business model. The environment has evolved so much, and the business model has changed so much that it's been hard to maintain the same structure. In those structural changes, there's the hope that everyone can find a meaningful, engaging, respectful job they enjoy and love—that should be the driving impetus for everyone that's a CEO at a company anywhere."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

These rises are more modest than those of last year, but that's to be expected given that the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>DLC&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales" rel="nofollow">landed in that period</a>.</p>

<p>In an accompanying <a href="https://www.bandainamco.co.jp/files/ir/financialstatements/pdf/20250805_Presentation.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">presentation</a> (which is in Japanese, so we're using additional reporting by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/elden-ring-nightreigns-strong-sales-drive-bandai-namcos-game-sector-profits-in-first-quarter/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>), Bandai Namco attributes this quarter's success at least partly to&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, which was revealed last month to have sold <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-nightreign-sales" rel="nofollow">over five million copies</a>.</p>

<p>With regards to the future, meanwhile, Bandai Namco has a number of big releases on the horizon. These include the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blood-of-dawnwalker-ex-witcher-devs" rel="nofollow"><em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em></a>, a major RPG developed by ex-<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>staffers, and&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II</em>, a followup to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/code-vein" rel="nofollow">anime-inflected 2019 Soulslike</a>.</p>

<p>Another big Bandai Namco release coming in the next few months is, of course,&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares III</em>, the third major installment in the&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>series of side-scrolling horror platformers. It's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-nightmares-iii-release-date" rel="nofollow">currently due to land in October</a>.</p>

<p>That's despite <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/supermassive-games-layoffs-directive-8020-delayed" rel="nofollow">layoffs at developer Supermassive Games</a>; when said layoffs were announced, the studio made it clear development on&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares III&nbsp;</em>would be unaffected, although sci-fi adventure&nbsp;<em>Directive 8020&nbsp;</em>has been delayed.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[3 Essential Tips For Getting Started In Broken Arrow]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/broken-arrow-tips-starter-deck-recon-infantry-2000614583</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/3-essential-tips-for-getting-started-in-broken-arrow.1262250/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Though you’re not controlling thousands of individual units, <i>Broken Arrow</i> still requires a basic grasp of combined arms tactics. You’ll soar overhead with attack helicopters, slink through the underbrush with stealthy sniper units, and roam the plains in force with a battalion of armored tanks. Your army is an extension of your will. Knowing how to effectively use each unit, stomp opponents, and take control of sectors is the difference between yet another loss and the coveted win.</p> <h2>Use a starter deck initially</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614585" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614585"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614585">© Screenshot: Steel Balalaika / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I have a long, storied history in the real-time strategy and tactics genre, and yet, in titles such as <i>Warno</i>, <i>Steel Division 2</i>, and now <i>Broken Arrow</i>, I’ve always been terrible at creating decks. I want to bring everything, to wield every toy in the arsenal, and I wind up with choice paralysis. Ultimately, I opt for the strongest or the most aesthetically pleasing units, and that’s my downfall.</p> <p>If you’re a new player, especially to the whole genre, then <i>Broken Arrow</i> may feel overwhelming with all of its mechanics and macro/micro tactics. To enter the scene and delve straight into deck-building can lead to disaster.</p>

 <p>There are two starter decks: US and Russian. They both approach the 10,000 point limit, with the Russian hitting the cap straight off the bat, and both include an array of units from all disciplines, including recon, infantry, helicopter, and air. They’re both well-rounded, with units designed for introductory gameplay.</p> <h2>Utilize your recon strategically</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614586" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614586"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614586">© Screenshot: Steel Balalaika / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I cannot begin to tell you the number of players I’ve met online who chose to outright bumrush opponents instead of wielding all of the tools at their disposal effectively. Namely, recon units. You have access to an array of recon that can hide in dense forests and, so long as they have line of sight, they’ll provide advance notice when enemy units approach.</p> <p><b>Place your recon units strategically.</b> Look at your map, identify chokepoints and ingress points, then note key cover locations for your recon. Get them there quickly.</p>

 <p>Place your recon at the edge of the forest, then hold ‘Alt’ on your keyboard to activate the line of sight tool and ensure your units have a clear field of vision. Second,<b> turn off the ‘Return Fire’ command, which disables auto-fire targeting, allowing them to remain stealthy.</b></p> <h2>Your infantry is an effective tool, but only when used properly</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614587" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614587"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614587">© Screenshot: Steel Balalaika / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Many new players will resort to a “safe” tactic by deploying mass groups of infantry, thinking the overwhelming force will dominate control points. It’s much easier than controlling tanks, helicopters, and infantry simultaneously, right? Yes, but also no. If you bunch up your infantry, a single bombing run from a jet overhead, or a well-placed artillery/mortar shot, will decimate the entire group.</p> <p>Instead, use your infantry as a pseudo-guerrilla force. Send your infantry toward multiple control points, just to make it seem like you’re spread out across the map in a way that will force your opponent to divert forces elsewhere. Then, flank with your most powerful units, like tanks and helicopters, once the enemy’s forces thin out. If your micro game is on point, you can kite enemies with your infantry to keep them out of harm’s way long enough for reinforcements to push forward. The ol’ bait and switch!</p> <hr> <p><i>Broken Arrow</i> is available now exclusively on Windows PCs.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 - Official Multiplayer Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Preloading for the Battlefield 6 beta is available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S as well, along with the EA app, so the Steam numbers represent just a fraction of the total audience.</p><p>The Battlefield 6 open beta begins on August 7 for a select group of people, including those who signed up for Battlefield Labs by July 31, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-is-not-on-game-pass-but-is-coming-to-a-subscription-service/1100-6533658/" data-ref-id="1100-6533658">EA Play Pro members</a>, and those who obtained a code from watching a Twitch streamer playing the game. The beta then opens to anyone August 9-10, and then for a second weekend August 14-17. For more, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">GameSpot's Battlefield 6 open beta breakdown.</a></p><p>The full game, meanwhile, launches on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The release date is about a month before Activision's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> is rumored to launch on November 14.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://eci.ec.europa.eu/045/public/#/screen/home/disabled">Stop Destroying Videogames citizens' initiative</a>, the petition asking EU lawmakers to look into the issue of publishers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-never-owned-the-game-insist-ubisoft-to-the-crew-players-that-are-suing-the-publisher">rendering online games unplayable when official support runs its course</a>, hit its deadline at the end of last month looking like it'd amassed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-eu-petition-hits-a-million-signatures-but-a-significant-number-could-be-fake">more than enough signatures</a>. With that phase over, the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games</a> campaign that's vocally supported efforts like this is left to await the outcomes, whatever they might be.</p>
<p>That's given YouTuber Ross Scott, who's become the loudest voice publicising this worldwide push for action on consumer rights when it comes to these sorts of server shutdowns, a chance to take stock of how things have gone to this point. He's keen to take a break, but will first have to see how things pan out with the multiple irons Stop Killing Games and their adjacent groups have in the fire.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Since the signing period is over, we're entering a phase where things like counter lobbying and political connections are most important," Scott said in a 'wrap up' video posted to his channel Accursed Farms. "Frankly, that is not my department. I know nothing about that, though some political insiders do, and they're advising the official organizers [of the EU petition]. I'm not even aware of all their plans."</p>
<p>So, that means "a whole lot of the campaign now involves waiting", though Scott did still encourage those who're keen to support it to carry on doing things like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/european-parliament-vice-president-throws-his-support-behind-stop-killing-games-campaign">contacting MEPs about the issue</a>, or helping the initiative's organisers get in contact with EU admin staff if they can.</p>
<p>Looking back on the campaign's efforts and general strategy to this point, Scott reckons those behind it have done well in terms of having "maximized our chances to push back against the issue of games being destroyed on almost every front". While he acknowledged that the group's efforts in a number of countries, such as the USA and Brazil, having hit brick walls in some form or another, Scott said he believes the campaign's "done about as well as is humanly possible given the landscape."</p>

<p>"I think France, Germany, Australia, and the EU as a whole are the heavyweights in this," the YouTuber reasoned, with measures in these places all currently waiting action or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/campaign-asking-eu-to-stop-publishers-destroying-online-games-hit-by-anonymous-transparency-complaint">responses from the bodies</a> they're directed at. "As long as we get a major market prohibiting game destruction, I think we'll largely win this globally...I don't see lots of new stuff on the horizon later. I think we either win on at least one of these or if they all fail, then it's over."</p>
<p>With things now at that stage, Scott's aiming to soon take a "standby break" from his volunteering to help promote this cause, only popping up if something happens with the campaign that he thinks would benefit from his intervention.</p>
<p>"I know a lot of people found out about Stop Killing Games just recently, but I've been going at it hard for over a year and a half now, and I wasn't exactly well rested prior to that," the YouTuber said, adding that he ironically hasn't "had time to play a game for close to a couple months now". Here's hoping he is able to take that proper break, while we all wait to see what the outcomes of these bits of action are.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-stop-killing-games-supported-eu-petition-now-closed-the-campaigns-loudest-voice-reckons-its-done-about-as-well-as-is-humanly-possible]]></content:encoded>

              <p>It’s a rule of the universe that if you release a successful indie game, there will almost immediately be crappy mobile knock-offs and a version built in&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em>. That’s as true as ever for&nbsp;<em>Peak</em>, the adorable co-op climbing game about scaling a mountain with your friends (<a href="https://kotaku.com/peak-cannibalism-patch-notes-bug-fixes-steam-1851787299">and sometimes eating them</a>), with a <em>Roblox</em> rip-off called&nbsp;<em>Cliff</em>. And&nbsp;<em>Peak</em> developers Aggro Crab are clearly not impressed.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/peak-steam-reviews-lethal-company-aggro-crab-1851786254"><em>Peak</em></a> came out on June 16, and has quickly gone on to be a summer smash. From the developers of 2024’s&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/another-crabs-treasure-review-1851435745"><em>Another Crab’s Treasure</em></a>, the indie co-op climbing sim has become massive, peaking at almost 115,000 simultaneous players, and still has 20,000 people playing right now. It’s been a splendid and well-deserved success. So of course, there are knock-offs. But my goodness,&nbsp;<em>Cliff</em>‘s is beyond blatant. And Aggro Crab aren’t delighted about the situation.</p> <p>“tbh would rather you pirate our game than play this microtransaction-riddled @Roblox slop ripoff,” says a post from Aggro Crab’s official X account, spotted by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/peak/roblox-ripoff"><em>PCGN</em></a>.</p>

Except of course it instead looks really crap because it’s made in <em>Roblox</em>. To demonstrate this isn’t hyperbole, here are a couple of comparisons. This is <em>Cliff</em> in <em>Roblox</em>:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614672" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614672"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614672">©Roblox</figcaption></figure> <p>And this is <em>Peak</em>:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614673" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614673"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614673">©Aggro Crab</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Cliff</em>:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614674" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614674"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614674">©Roblox</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Peak</em>:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614675" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614675"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614675">©Aggrocrab</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s not exactly subtle. The same goes for how the games play, the floating hands for climbing, the plane crash start with the suitcases on the beach, pretty much everything. Except that in&nbsp;<em>Cliff</em>, everything costs money. From the airport at the start to the suitcases on the beach, the&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> rip-off wants you spending your Robux as often as possible, because of course it does.</p> <p>Of course, Aggro Crab would prefer you just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/">paid for your copy of&nbsp;<em>Peak</em></a>, not least since it’s only $8 in the first place. But seeing their creativity reduced to a cash-in knock-off must be incredibly galling, not least when people could be playing the far superior game for a low up-front fee, and never have to spend another cent.</p> <p>Oh, and really, <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-child-account-safety-settings-danger-1851680045">no one should be going anywhere near&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> in the first place.</a></p>

                <p>Since its debut near the end of March, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grow-a-garden/" data-ref-id="5000-681260">Grow a Garden</a> has been a breakout hit on the Roblox platform. Now, players will be able to cook the vegetables they grow and earn rewards in the game's latest update.    </p><p>The new update revolves around Chris P, a literal pig who has his own kitchen. Chris P's thought balloon reveals what he's craving at any particular moment, from candy to pizza. And if players are able to satisfy Chris P's cravings, then they'll be able to get an assortment of new seeds, new gear, and new in-game pets.</p><p>Some of the new seeds added to the game include onions, jalapenos, crown melon, and tacofern. Grow a Garden has also revamped its trading capabilities. Previously, some players were allowed to essentially rob their trading partners by disconnecting before coming through with their end of the bargain. Now, players need to get a trade ticket from the gear shop in order to complete a transaction.</p><p>Earlier this summer, Grow a Garden reached <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-roblox-game-is-blowing-up-in-popularity/1100-6531728/" data-ref-id="1100-6531728">5 million concurrent players</a>, before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-single-roblox-game-has-toppled-pubgs-all-time-concurrent-player-record/1100-6532006/" data-ref-id="1100-6532006">hitting nearly 12 million concurrent players</a> in July. The game was created by a teenage Roblox user who has yet to come forward publicly. However, production of the game and its updates is currently being handled by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/grow-a-garden-roblox-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a studio called Splitting Point</a>.</p><p>Grow a Garden's success is the best example yet of The Roblox Corporation's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-lays-out-grand-plans-to-transform-the-platform/1100-6526340/" data-ref-id="1100-6526340">grand plans for the platform</a>. As laid out at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox/" data-ref-id="5005-152">Roblox</a> Developers Conference in 2024, the company unveiled a new revenue-sharing plan for developers who create premium experiences using Roblox's game creation tools. So far, Grow a Garden is easily the most popular fan-made experience on Roblox. </p>

At the time of this article’s publication, the beta had 3,805 concurrent users.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So what are people doing with the open beta? Lots of players are getting ahead of the game and setting their options, taking 30 minutes or so to edit user interface colors and weapon Field of View, for example.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others are just using it to share their excitement with friends. “I have 6.4 hours in the beta total so far,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1mhx7pe/a_lot_of_people_just_sitting_in_the_preload_menu/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor gruggers1</a>. “I literally just sat in the lobby and chatted with friends in the in game voice chat.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some are reporting having to spend time getting around EA’s frustrating restrictions on PC launch. It looks like unless you have Secure Boot turned on in your BIOS, the Battlefield 6 open beta won’t run at all, so there may be players trying to sort that out, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So nice to be able to test if the game boot up, set everything up and be prepared for the most exciting moment,” added redditor rafahuel.</p><div id="every-battlefield-game-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Every Battlefield game, ranked.</h3><h3>Every Battlefield game, ranked.</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As many have pointed out, there were nearly as many people sitting on the Battlefield 6 Open Beta’s menu screen as there were people actually playing the last Battlefield game, 2042, on Steam, which is quite something. (9,463 24-hour peak for the Battlefield 6 open beta versus 11,245 24-hour peak for 2042).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what does this mean for Battlefield 6? From EA’s perspective, it suggests there’s significant interest in the game. EA has said it’s all-in on Battlefield 6, so there’s significant pressure on it to perform. It will be interesting to see the concurrent figures on Steam when the open beta goes live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Battlefield 6 producer Jeremy Chubb has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-producer-admits-2042-was-missing-the-excellence-of-predecessor-battlefield-bad-company-2">fan-favorite <u>Battlefield: Bad Company 2</u> was a "huge inspiration" for developing the shooter's upcoming instalment</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>When you get down to it, a lot of people would probably quite like to be a racoon that can ride a BMX bike, but what about being a BMX-riding racoon that’s also in consistent employment? That’s the dream Tanuki Pon’s Summer sells you, giving you control of a furry little chap and his bicycle as he attempts to deliver everyone’s mail, while pulling off a sick trick or two. It’s cute, cuddly and quite silly, and it’s undoubtedly utterly charming too.</p>
<p><iframe title="TANUKI: Pon's Summer — New Demo Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LTBIgHgJpHQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Pon, your tanuki hero, is lazing about on a bench at the start of the game, and it’s only the voice of the narrator – or is it his conscience? – that gets him moving, nabbing his BMX and setting off down the road. You find a bunch of the different elements that you’re going to experience down this country path, from Torii Gates that act as waypoints or finishing lines, obstacles to bunny hop over, and, most excitingly, different places to pull off tricks.</p>


<p>There is, in fact, a handy skate park thrown into your journey back to civilisation, and here you find that your raccoon is a furry little Dave Mirra, chucking out a tail flip or Superman with ease. Just like your favourite gaming extreme sports heroes, you can chain these moves together for higher scores, though you do, of course, have to nail the landing. It’s possible to chuck yourself off your bike, and you’ll have to run over and grab it if that happens. Which it undoubtedly will.</p>


<p>Pon has to spend the summer earning money in order to decorate and repair the local Tanuki Shrine, which sits at the centre of the island, all leading up to the Matsuri Festival which happens every 50 years. Pon doesn’t necessarily seem like the ideal candidate – he’d much rather spend his time sleeping or grinding rails – but he sets to work, nonetheless, becoming the island’s delivery boy, working for the Post Office to raise the cash.</p>
<p>Our hands-on covered Pon’s first week on the job, working his way through the first town, which presumably means that there’s multiple towns that will need your delivery services.</p>
<p>The first step is to pick up the packages. This is a game in itself, as the packages arrive in all sorts of different shapes, and you have to fit them neatly into your bag, packing the Tetris-like shapes together in the most sensible way.</p>
<p>Once you’ve stacked the packages into the basket on your bike, it’s off to work, but this isn’t really the kind of behaviour you’d expect from a FedEx employee. While you have to ride around finding the recipients, there’s a stack of Letter Quests to work your way through, from collecting all the TANUKI letters, to backflipping over the statue in the centre of town. I’d quite like to see our local Amazon delivery guys spicing things up by pulling off BMX tricks, but they’d probably break all the air fryers in the process, so best to leave it to the raccoons.</p>

<p>Tanuki Pon’s Summer is cute. It has an adorable aesthetic, with a colourful Japanese countryside setting, and chunky architecture that really brings the island to life. I love the characters here though, from the podgy Pon, with his cute walk and oversized Post Office hat, to the exceedingly loud Bunta and kind Fumi, the workers at the Post Office, and Tetsuo, the former sumo wrestler who longs for the old days.</p>
<p>Tetsuo convinces you to train in sumo, and that opens up another diversion, becoming the first tanuki to fight in sumo. Here, you stomp to charge up your stamina for the fight, use hand slaps to push the opponent back quickly, dodging at the right time to keep up your momentum, and big belly smashes to force them out of the ring. It’s another great little aside, that keeps you guessing as to where Tanuki Pon’s Summer might take you.</p>
<p>You get an insight into the recipient’s interests and mindset, chatting with them while dropping off their package, or being drawn into an unexpected activity, and it gives Pon’s world a grounding and reality that you probably shouldn’t get from one with a tanuki on a bicycle. It’s all thoroughly charming, and I can see why Microsoft chose to highlight it in their upcoming indie schedule. Breezing about the town, performing tricks while racing between different deliveries just feels like a lot of fun.</p>

<p>At the moment, the only downside is your compass becoming immediately filled with package notifications, and there’s currently no way to pop down a pin or marker on the map to help you stay focused on that particular one.</p>
<p>Tanuki Pon’s Summer is a cute and charming indie adventure, where deliveries, diversions and BMX tricks lie around every corner. We can’t wait to see more when it reaches final release for PC, Switch, and the Xbox family of consoles later this year.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI may break records in the gaming industry not only in terms of profits, but also in terms of price tags, as a known analyst believes the game will cost more than any other title on the market.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/08/03/grand-theft-auto-online-safety-laws/">The Telegraph</a>, Wedbush Securities' Michael Patcher, known for making some bold predictions in the past, said that he expects a high price, $100, for the new entry in the series by Rockstar Games at launch, which would make it the first video game to be sold at such a high price, not counting special or limited editions. Still, no matter the price point, Patcher expects the game to be immensely profitable, likely generating $10 billion in lifetime and $500 million annually from <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-online-age-verification/">GTA Online</a>. Commenting on the game's budget, Patcher's estimates are more in line with what we have heard from other analysts, placing them in the $1.5 billion range, also including marketing costs.</p>



<p>Although predictions may vary, the consensus among analysts is that Grand Theft Auto VI is going to be one of the biggest video game releases of all time, if not the biggest.<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-7-billion-revenue-60-days/"> Last month</a>, Konvoy's Managing Partner Josh Chapman confirmed the firm's prediction that the game will generate $7.6 billion in revenue in the first two months of availability, with Take-Two recouping a potential $2 billion investment within a month from release. Even by other metrics, such as number of copies sold, player count, and viewership, the new entry in the series is expected to be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">record-shattering release. </a></p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto VI launches on <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">May 26, 2026,</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. A PC version has yet to be confirmed, but going from past Rockstar Games titles' launches, we should expect the game to make its debut on the platform sometime in 2027.</p>

<figure><a title="Sonic Timberlands" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4a1224762b865/sonic-timberlands.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>After <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/05/these-sonic-the-hedgehog-crocs-are-kinda-horrific-and-theyre-out-now">collaborating on a pair of Crocs</a> back in 2023, SEGA is continuing its streak of 'Footwear That Would Be Inappropriate For Sonic The Hedgehog' with a new pair of Sonic-inspired Timberland kicks.</p>
<p>Let's manage those expectations right from the jump. It's unlikely that most of us will ever get our hands on a pair of these bad boys. The collab is in celebration of the upcoming grand opening of SEGA's flagship store in Japan, and will <em>only</em> be available at the nearby Shibuya PARCO Timberland store from 9th August.</p>
<p>Now that we know we're never going to see the range in the flesh, let's collectively cry over how cool it all looks. The highlight item is, of course, a pair of Timbs, which takes the classic "yellow" boot design and throws in some sneaky Sonic nods for good measure. There's a small picture of the blue blur himself etched onto the outer material, the Sonic the Hedgehog icon adorns the inner side, and get a look at those laces!</p>

<p>According to the collaboration announcement on the <a href="https://www.timberland.co.jp/news-250805_sega.html">Japanese Timberland website</a>, the boots will set you back ¥38,500 (roughly £196 / $261) and there are <em>apparently</em> only 30 pairs available. Yep, we're sure people will behave totally normally in the queues for these...</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are some other items in the range besides the boots. The collaboration also introduces two long- and short-sleeve t-shirts, available in black or white. Both tops sport the rather snazzy collab icon of Sonic in his Timbs, with the brand logos on the sleeve/chest.</p>

<p>And just to rub it in even more, anyone lucky enough to pick up an item in the range will <em>also</em> land an exclusive postcard and sticker of the boot-wearing hedgehog. Damn, we're suckers for a good sticker...</p>
<p>As we say, it's unlikely that we'll ever see much of the range in person thanks to the ol' Japanese exclusivity, but who knows, perhaps it'll be so popular that it gets a bigger release in the future. We doubt it, but let us dream!</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s open beta kicks off later this week, and EA have now painted a picture of what you can expect maps/modes-wise, as well as in terms of the changes the devs have made based on Battlefield Labs playtest feedback.</p>
<p>Plus, there's a new trailer that features yet more folks in camo running about amid booms. I'm glad to report that no helicopters, at least at a glance, look to have been harmed in the run up to this one.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As detailed in Battlefield 6's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-full-multiplayer-reveal-sees-ea-trying-to-rebottle-the-lightning-of-battlefield-3-and-4">multiplayer reveal last week</a>, the open beta will mainly run across two weekend-ish windows, August 9th-10th and August 14th -17th. Because big video game in 2025, there'll also be open beta early access running from August 7th into the first weekend, limited to folks who've subscribed to EA Play Pro or registered for Battlefield Labs before July 31st.</p>
<p>During <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/everything-you-need-to-know-for-the-open-beta">the first weekend</a>, you'll be able to jump into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-deafening-hours-of-its-multiplayer-battlefield-6-sure-looks-like-a-battlefield-game">three different maps and three different game modes</a>. Siege of Cairo will offer urban battles likely involving much crouch-walking, Liberation Peak takes you to the countryside of Tajikistan's mountains for what sounds like more open action with jet and chopper dogfight potential, and Iberian Offensive takes you back to tight streets, but this time in Gibraltar.</p>

<p>The three modes for that opening weekend are conquest, breakthrough, and closed weapons breakthrough. For weekend two, the Empire State map will be wheeled out so infantryfolks can thoroughly wreck Brooklyn, with rush and squad deathmatch also arriving to make it five modes in total.</p>
<p>Lest you think EA haven't taken anything on board from those who've already dived into the game's Battlefield Labs testing, the publishers have put out a full Tweeter essay outlining how that feedback's shaped changes for the beta and beyond. For this open play specifically, they want you to give a closed weapon conquest playlist a go as part of plans to let folks "choose between closed and open weapon modes", while maps like Siege of Cairo have had several aspects revamped with an eye to ensuring the flow of murder-deathing and balance of battles is closer to the ideal.</p> <div>

<p>The sorts of Time-to-Kill and Time-to-Death debates that'll still be going on around multiplayer shooters in the year 5025 have led EA to balance damage "across the weapon pool". The weapon customisation menus have also been made more clear, and signature weapons have been introduced. The latter means, for example, recon classers will get extra advantages with the sniper rifles that I assume they'll be using to 360 no-scope fools from across the map.</p>
<p>More in-depth changes for all four of the game's main classes - assault, engineer, support, and recon - are already planned and detailed in the essay, but won't be coming in until after this open beta's concluded. That means you'll have to hop into more Labs testing if you want to try something closer to the "final adaptation" of the class system <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-pc-specs-dont-look-too-lofty-despite-all-the-booms-and-steam-players-wont-need-the-pesky-ea-app">ahead of release</a>.</p>
<p>Once the open beta's done, EA'll be putting out "an overview of further changes we’re making on the road towards launch", because the tweakage can never stop.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-maps-and-modes-shared-as-ea-write-an-essay-about-tweaks-based-on-labs-feedback]]></content:encoded>
