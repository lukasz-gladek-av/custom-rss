            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">It might not have the same kind of ambition or bells and whistles as its contemporaries, but Styx holds a special place in my heart as one of very few pure stealth game series we have left. Will you find the incredibly creative scenarios of Hitman or the insane level of polish and replayability of Dishonored? Nope. Instead Styx contents itself with simply being a reliable way for stealth fans to get their fix, and Styx: Blades of Greed is no exception. More often than not, the usual playbook of sneaking around, stealing and assassinating everything in sight, is as fun as it’s ever been, and this sequel makes some important tweaks, like removing weak multiplayer mechanics to refocus on a solo stealth experience and swapping smaller, mission-based maps for absolutely massive regions. But it’s also saddled with quite a few of the same issues it’s always had, finicky movement, performance issues, and an unremarkable story, which are as disappointing as they are completely expected.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like its predecessor from 2017, Blades of Greed puts you in the leather boots of an elderly, grumpy goblin as you sneak into small spaces, stab humans, elves, and monsters in their soft places, and use an arsenal of gadgets and special abilities to overcome the fact that getting spotted will get you killed in two seconds flat. There are some modest additions, like a couple of new gadgets and abilities that let you do things like mind control NPCs from afar or use a grappling hook to close large gaps in a short period of time, but for the most part there’s very little that’s changed about the moment-to-moment gameplay. You’ll still find, for example, the ol’ reliable ability to turn yourself invisible for a short period of time, and will still find yourself hiding inside closets and barrels before popping out to slit the throat of some idiot guard. Good times. As ever, stealth is absolutely the star of the show, and Blades of Greed has the same high quality sneaking around that you’d hope it would.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Styx: Blades of Greed Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The story in Styx has never been very good, and Blades of Greed lives up to those low expectations by having a completely forgettable story in spite of the fact that its protagonist is inherently interesting and unique. After developing a craving for magical abilities granted to you by quartz crystals found throughout the world, you begin a repetitive journey to, well, find more of it, and 90% of the campaign is just going from place-to-place stealing these glowing rocks to power yourself up with little in the way of plot in between those scavenger hunts. You meet some characters along the way, like a gadget-obsessed dwarf and an orc who becomes your spiritual guide, but they don’t get enough screen time to leave much of an impression and what they do get isn’t used effectively, with everyone spouting off explanations of telling you what you need to do next and little else. You’re unlikely to have come to the Styx series looking for an engaging story, but just in case you were hoping to be pleasantly surprised: I wouldn’t count on that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though the vast majority of Styx’s bones remain the same, one major change is that instead of treading (and sometimes retreading) through mission-specific levels, Blades of Greed lets you loose in three extremely large maps filled with both mandatory and optional areas to explore, pilfer, and fall to your death within. It’s a neat idea that allows for significantly more freedom over prior adventures, and it’s quite easy to become distracted and assassinate your way through an entire region before realizing you didn’t even really have any objective behind any of it, except that it’s just hard to see a guard walking by unaware and not take him down. These huge levels also allow you to express creativity in how you navigate the area and solve the problem of getting around when every 10 feet there’s someone who could kill you by breathing on you. When you’re staring at an objective that’s a mountain’s distance above you, you’ll need to just creep around and try things to figure out how to get there – maybe you’ll find a nice spot on the side of a tower to make daring leaps while avoiding the notice of guards along the way, or maybe you’ll find a quieter path via a sewer system that leads you to the same spot, but is infested with giant bugs that will swarm you if you get too close.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">That can be a really interesting stealth challenge to figure out, but comes with some unique drawbacks as well. For one, it can be exhausting to have to cross such a massive area slowly sneaking along all the while, and if you try to just sprint past everything to get to the objective, you should be prepared to reload a whole bunch as you work through the trial and error process of doing so. That travel time feels significantly less focused and curated than the more linear model for level design as well, and oftentimes you’re kinda just half-assedly sneaking through ruins and across rooftops with no real obstacles along the way until you get to the place that the objective marker wants you to be, at which point things start to feel much more focused. In other words, it’s a whole lot of fat before you get to the meat of the main objectives. I actually spent the vast majority of the more than 20 hours it took me to beat Blades of Greed trying to figure out where exactly my next objective was and how to get there, rather than actually pulling off the heist in question.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The good news is that each of these maps is pretty awesome across the board. The Wall is an absurdly cool vertical labyrinth of concrete castles and rickety slums, Turquoise Dawn is a jungle of trees, swamps, and massive, deadly roaches swarming in dark areas, and the Akenash Ruins are a ruined, kingdom where everything floats in the air unnaturally and enemies are extremely weird monsters, like something out of Elden Ring. Each visit to these places throughout the story unlocks new areas to explore, though you’ll also do quite a bit of backtracking through areas you’ve already been, which is a bit of a drag. Still, these are some of the more interesting areas I’ve stalked the halls of in a stealth game and highlights the unique, strange, and magically-infused world that this curmudgeonly goblin calls home.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite Stealth Games</h3><p>If you like to remain unseen, here are the best games for you to see.</p></div><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/Tieguytravis/lists/tieguytravis-favorite-stealth-games" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Though the huge amount of space these maps have can be pretty great to explore, they sometimes feel a bit too big for the much smaller objectives within them. The story’s main objectives are much smaller than a typical stealth mission, usually just requiring you to steal a key and open a locked door, or shut down a machine so you can reach your objective – miniature quests that usually only take a couple minutes to complete, if that. Once you’ve checked it off your list, you’re back to the mostly uneventful traveling stealth as you find a way to the next objective, often requiring you to backtrack through some of the same spots in the process, which is how I have spent the bulk of the adventure so far. On the bright side, this format means you’re basically just locked into a constant stream of pure, unadulterated stealth scenarios for hours on end as you work your way through each set of missions, and since that’s Blades of Greed’s strong suit, you’re getting exactly what the doctor ordered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re familiar with the shortcomings of the previous Styx games, then you’ll probably be less-than-stoked to hear that Blades of Greed doesn’t address most of these. Combat, which is a last resort, but sometimes required, is quite sloppy and overly simplistic, and moving around, especially jumping onto ledges and the like can be finicky at times and caused me to fall to my death or get caught out in the open dozens of times by this point. Worse than those though, are the usual performance issues and technical challenges, like NPCs becoming invisible while talking to them and frames dropping to horrifyingly low levels after extended play sessions. Framerate issues are actually a fair bit worse than I remember them being in previous games, presumably due to the significantly larger maps, and it can get pretty bad for long stretches when there’s a lot happening on screen. Most of these issues are sort of baked into Styx by this point, but it’s still worth shouting out that the bulk of this stuff has mostly gone unaddressed, seemingly.</p></section><p><span><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Styx: Blades of Greed offers strong stealth mechanics and some truly awesome maps to explore decorated by the usual jankiness we’ve come to expect from the series. When you’re sneaking through these vast regions, slitting people’s throats and pulling off badass heists, it’s just as rad as ever, and the additional bag of magical tricks offers some new ways to outsmart your pursuers. Those good times are offset by a whole host of drawbacks, from the weak story, the extra fat added from large areas where objectives are miles apart, and performance issues that can be quite annoying. Blades of Greed still makes for a good time and offers a pure stealth experience that’s harder to find these days – you’ll just have to sneak around its rough parts to enjoy it.</p></div></span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/styx-blades-of-greed-review]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1442461</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen are coming to Nintendo Switch next week to celebrate the series 30th anniversary. And while The Pokémon Company and Nintendo have already <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-thought-it-would-be-fun-nintendo-has-a-whole-faq-on-why-its-selling-pokmon-firered-and-leafgreen-separately-for-20-each">answered a number of questions about the releases</a> that probably shouldn't have been necessary to ask to begin with, there's one question we still don't know the answer to: Will these games be compatible with Pokémon Home?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the non-Pokénerds out there, Pokémon Home is a cloud-based, paid subscription service that allows users to store Pokémon from various games, as well as move them between certain compatible games. The service has been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-home/Pokemon_HOME_3.0_Update">directly compatible with every new Pokémon game on the Nintendo Switch</a>, as well as Pokémon GO, and it also works with Pokémon Bank, a similar program that existed on the 3DS. The explanations and rules are a bit convoluted, but essentially, it's only through Bank and Home that Pokémon from older games such as Red/Blue/Yellow and Gold/Silver/Crystal (in their Virtual Console on Nintendo 3DS incarnations) can be brought forward to modern games.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, with some finagling, Pokémon fans can essentially bring a beloved monster from any mainline Pokémon game they've ever played (except the original Game Boy cartridges for Red/Blue/Yellow and Gold/Silver/Crystal) to Pokemon Home and, if it's compatible, transfer it for use into a modern game and continue their adventures. It's been a cool way for collectors to track their PokéDexes, and for long-time fans to keep beloved monsters from their childhoods by their side as adults.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original FireRed and LeafGreen are compatible with Home in this way too, though the process is, as suggested above, a bit complicated. In order to get Pokemon OUT of FireRed and LeafGreen into Home, you first have to use the Pal Park feature to transfer them to Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum using a Nintendo DS system. Then, you have to use the Poke Transfer Lab (which requires two Nintendo DS systems) to move them from that game to Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, or White 2. From there, you can move them into Pokémon Bank on a Nintendo 3DS, and then from Bank they can be transferred to Home. It's convoluted, but it's possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen on Nintendo Switch are compatible with Home directly, players can skip all that and bring monsters directly from those games into Home without having to own three different DS systems and multiple old game cartridges. However, players are concerned that this may not be the case. Earlier today, when the eShop page went live for FireRed and LeafGreen, it initially included the line, "Support for Pokémon HOME is coming soon. You'll be able to bring the Pokémon you catch and train to the place where all Pokémon gather-support for Pokémon HOME is coming to Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Version!” However, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1r9qa2g/pokemon_home_compatibility_removed_from_firered/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fans noticed that line was almost immediately removed</a>, leaving the compatibility up in the air.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/20/screenshot-2026-02-20-134922-1771616985303.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image source: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1r9qa2g/pokemon_home_compatibility_removed_from_firered/">https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1r9qa2g/pokemon_home_compatibility_removed_from_firered/</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The lack of compatibility would be irritating enough if it was just a matter of convenience, but it's actually possible that Home not being available could cause issues with the gameplay itself. FireRed and LeafGreen are remakes of the original Pokemon games Red and Green. Players are thus able to complete the "Kanto" PokéDex just by playing them and trading a few monsters back and forth with a friend who has the other version of the game. Though <em>online</em> features are apparently not available in these Switch ports (even though they were in the 3DS ports of Red/Blue/Yellow and Gold/Silver/Crystal!), <em>local</em> trading is, so that's not the problem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What <em>is</em> the problem is the National Dex. In FireRed/LeafGreen, the "National Dex" was, at the time, the "full" Pokedex, containing all 151 original Pokemon as well as all new Pokemon added in the second generation (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-gold-silver-crystal-version/List_of_Gen_2_Pokemon_(Johto_Pokedex)">Gold/Silver/Crystal</a>) and third (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-omega-ruby-alpha-sapphire/Pokedex">Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald</a>). The National Dex unlocks in FireRed/LeafGreen's post-game, and with it comes the ability to catch many of these Pokémon in the wild in-game. However, not every Pokémon is available. The Johto and Hoenn starter Pokémon, legendaries like Mew, Celebi, and Jirachi, and dozens of others were only obtainable back in the day by trading from Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Colosseum, or XD. And none of those games are currently available on Nintendo Switch in a way that would be locally compatible for trade with FireRed/LeafGreen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which means that, upon release, FireRed/LeafGreen will not be completeable, at least not in the 100% sense, because the National Dex will be impossible to fill out. While that probably won't bother most casual players, it's a pretty notable oversight, especially given that the releases of other classic games on Virtual Console on 3DS seemed so well thought-out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, it's entirely possible this is a lot of hullabaloo over nothing. Maybe the games<em> are </em>compatible with Home and Nintendo was just cleaning up language on the eShop page a bit. Maybe Home compatibility is coming in a few weeks or months, and Nintendo didn't want to set expectations too early. Maybe we're about to get an announcement of Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald on Nintendo Switch Online next week, and they'll be compatible locally. Maybe Colosseum and XD are coming to Switch Online (Nintendo has already teased them!), though these two games alone wouldn't canvas all the missing Pokemon. Maybe there's some other explanation! But it's weird that given Nintendo's extensive FAQ, they didn't address this glaring issue specifically. IGN reached out to both Nintendo and The Pokémon Company today to try and find out what the deal was. The Pokemon Company declined to comment, and we didn't hear back from Nintendo in time for publication.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if neither company Koffings up an answer soon, we'll know more next week when the games actually launch and as the dust settles from Pokémon Day and all its announcements. Regardless, the rollout of FireRed and LeafGreen on Switch has been <em>real weird</em>, especially in light of past efforts to preserve classic Pokémon games. Only Nintendo and The Pokémon Company knows why they don't just dump all these things on Switch Online and make the people happy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sarah Bond resigned from Xbox amid a restructuring that led to Phil Spencer’s retirement. Bond shared her full memo to her Xbox team on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sarahrbond_sharing-with-gratitude-the-note-i-sent-to-activity-7430753683912531968-YEXj?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAGBVXOMBvz_qCqVv-uRJAvpCCT5UFNbGSog">LinkedIn</a>.</p>



<p>“Hi team,</p>



<p>I know there’s a lot of news to take in today.</p>



<p>I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built together over the past eight-plus years. PC and cloud gaming are growing faster than ever, our next console is well underway, and together we’ve helped lay the foundation for a more open gaming platform that spans devices and reaches players around the world.</p>



<p>When we announced our intention to acquire Activision Blizzard in 2022, I committed to helping lead Xbox through what would be a critical period of change. Over the past four years, we’ve navigated that moment together and positioned the business for what comes next. We took on some of the biggest challenges this organization has ever faced and did it as one team.</p>



<p>With that, I’ve decided this is the right time for me to take my next step, both personally and professionally. We’re living through a transformative technological era that will shape the next generation of our industry, and I’m energized by what’s ahead. This moment also presents a unique opportunity for fresh eyes and new leadership to guide the team into its next chapter. I’ve had the privilege of spending time with Asha over the last few weeks as we’ve planned for this transition, and I’ve seen firsthand her deep commitment to our players, developers, and brand. She brings deep technology and commerce experience, along with a strong track record of building and scaling platforms that the world uses. Xbox deserves this. I’m excited to see her lead this next chapter for our team. I’ll remain on as a Special Advisor to Asha to help ensure a smooth transition and set the organization up for continued success.</p>



<p>I want to thank Phil for his mentorship and friendship over the years. He’s been a consistent champion of this business and the people who make it what it is, and I’ve learned a great deal from the way he leads through both opportunity and challenge. I’m grateful for his trust and support throughout my time on the team. I also want to thank Satya for his sponsorship and support throughout my time at Microsoft.</p>



<p>As I prepare to sign off, I’ve been reflecting on three simple questions I’ve tried to use to guide my days:</p>



<p>Did I bring my best?<br>Did I help someone else succeed?<br>Did I do my best work?</p>



<p>I hope the answer has been yes for many of you. It’s been a privilege to work alongside this team.</p>



<p>Always,<br>Sarah”</p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/microsoft-gaming-chief-phil-spencer-steps-down-after-38-years-with-company/</link>
            <guid>1442437</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Microsoft Executive Vice President for Gaming Phil Spencer announced he will retire after 38 years at Microsoft and 12 years leading the company’s video game efforts. Asha Sharma, an executive currently in charge of Microsoft’s CoreAI division, will take his place.</p>
<p>Xbox President Sarah Bond, who many assumed was being groomed as Spencer’s eventual replacement, is also resigning from the company. Current Xbox Studios Head Matt Booty, meanwhile, is being promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Content Officer and will work closely with Sharma.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2026/02/20/asha-sharma-named-evp-and-ceo-microsoft-gaming/">his departure note</a>, Spencer said he told Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella last fall that he was “thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life.” Spencer will remain at Microsoft “in an advisory role” through the summer to help Sharma during the transition, he wrote.</p>
<p>Spencer, who got his start at Microsoft as an intern in 1988, served as a manager and executive at Microsoft Game Studios in 2003. In 2014, he took over as Head of Xbox, guiding the company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/05/head-of-xbox-says-plans-to-decouple-kinect-from-xbox-one-began-in-april/">through the aftermath</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/11/spencer-microsoft-almost-abandoned-xbox-brand-after-the-xbox-one-launch/">the troubled, Kinect-bundled launch of the Xbox One</a>. More recently, he helped shepherd the company’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/09/microsoft-purchases-bethesda-softworks-in-industry-changing-acquisition/">2020 purchase of Bethesda Softworks</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/01/microsoft-set-to-purchase-activision-blizzard-in-68-7-billion-deal/">its $68.7 billion merger with Activision Blizzard</a>, including the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/06/ftc-xbox-exclusive-starfield-is-powerful-evidence-against-activision-deal/">many</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/10/microsoft-fights-to-save-activision-merger-says-sony-protest-is-self-serving/">regulatory</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/uk-regulators-come-down-hard-against-microsofts-activision-acquisition/">battles</a> that followed that latter announcement.</p>
<h2>Meet the new boss</h2>
<p>Sharma, who joined Microsoft just two years ago after stints at Meta and Instacart, promised in an introductory message to preside over “the return of Xbox,” and a “recommit[ment] to our core fans and players.” That commitment would “start with console which has shaped who we are,” but expand “across PC, mobile, and cloud,” Sharma wrote.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A major shakeup is taking place at the top of Microsoft’s gaming business, as long-time Xbox and Microsoft Gaming boss Phil Spencer is retiring, effective from Monday 23rd February, with current President of Microsoft’s CoreAI, Asha Sharma is set to take over as the new CEO of Microsoft Gaming.</p>
<p>Xbox President Sarah Bond, who was easy to view as Spencer’s eventual successor, has resigned, while Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty is being promoted to Chief Content Officer.</p>


<p>Messages from all (except Bond) have been <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2026/02/20/asha-sharma-named-evp-and-ceo-microsoft-gaming/">published by Microsoft</a>. Spencer said that he had been thinking about retiring for a little while, and that this handover has seen him work with his successor for several months now.</p>
<p>“Last fall, I shared with Satya that I was thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life. From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we’ve built. Xbox has always been more than a business. It’s a vibrant community of players, creators, and teams who care deeply about what we build and how we build it. And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead.</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">“Today marks an exciting new chapter for Microsoft Gaming as Asha Sharma steps into the role of CEO, and I want to be the first to welcome her to this incredible team. Working with her over the past several months has given me tremendous confidence. She brings genuine curiosity, clarity and a deep commitment to understanding players, creators, and the decisions that shape our future. We know this is an important moment for our fans, partners, and team, and we’re committed to getting it right. I’ll remain in an advisory role through the summer to support a smooth handoff.”</p>

<p data-cy="paragraph">Sharma might not have been the most obvious choice from the outside, and coming from an AI background will certainly be a cause for concern to many gamers, where generative AI is viewed very negatively.</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">“My first job is simple: understand what makes this work and protect it. That starts with three commitments. First, great games. Everything begins here. We must have great games beloved by players before we do anything. Unforgettable characters, stories that make us feel, innovative game play, and creative excellence. We will empower our studios, invest in iconic franchises, and back bold new ideas. We will take risks. We will enter new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most. I promoted Matt Booty in honor of this commitment. He understands the craft and the challenges of building great games, has led teams that deliver award-winning work, and has earned the trust of game developers across the industry.</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">“Second, the return of Xbox. We will recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world. We will celebrate our roots with a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console which has shaped who we are. It connects us to the players and fans who invest in Xbox, and to the developers who build ambitious experiences for it.</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">“Gaming now lives across devices, not within the limits of any single piece of hardware. As we expand across PC, mobile, and cloud, Xbox should feel seamless, instant, and worthy of the communities we serve. We will break down barriers so developers can build once and reach players everywhere without compromise.</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">“Third, future of play. We are witnessing the reinvention of play. To meet the moment, we will invent new business models and new ways to play by leaning into what we already have: iconic teams, characters, and worlds that people love. But we will not treat those worlds as static IP to milk and monetize. We will build a shared platform and tools that empower developers and players to create and share their own stories.</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">“As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.”</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">There’s definitely some reassuring sentiments within that, though I would argue that saying your first job is to understand what’s going on makes this sound more of a hurried appointment. We will have to see how much institutional change follows.</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">Phil Spencer had been at the helm of Microsoft’s gaming efforts for over a decade, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/03/31/phil-spencer-fills-the-spot-of-head-of-xbox-at-microsoft/">taking over in 2014</a> and setting about steading the suddenly floundering console gaming business. He moved quickly to cut the price of the Xbox One by removing the Kinect from the bundle, made gamer-positive moves like championing backwards compatibility, and enacted major changes to the Xbox business model by promising day-and-date PC releases for Xbox games (and releasing them on Steam), as well as introducing Xbox Game Pass. He also saw Xbox exclusives start to come to PlayStation, breaking down traditional barriers.</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">However, he’s also been at the helm more recent difficult times for the brand. The Xbox Series X|S launch did not go as successfully as planned, not least with significant game delays for the likes of Halo Infinite, studio acquisitions took a long time to bear fruit, Xbox Game Pass started to see market saturation, and then successive price increases to both consoles and services.</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">With an eye to the future, now might be the best time for him to step aside, but Xbox as a brand feels somewhat nebulous right now. There’s a lot of rumours about what their next console might be like, whether it’s more PC-like than console and with rival storefronts, or traditional. Microsoft will inevitably be very keen to see AI used in some fashion, having demoed AI helpers with Minecraft in recent years (and that was before the current madness). But with a new CEO all of that could change. We’ll have to wait and see.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[That’s It, I’m Calling It, Xbox Is Dead, Time Of Death February 20]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/thats-it-im-calling-it-xbox-is-dead-time-of-death-february-20-2000672114</link>
            <guid>1442422</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you read <em>Kotaku</em> even semi-regularly, you already know that Xbox has been in a weird spot for some time now. And with today’s news that both <a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-goodbye-email-memo-xbox-microsoft-2000672084">Xbox boss Phil Spencer and President Sarah Bond are leaving</a> and the new head of the brand will be <a href="https://kotaku.com/xboxs-new-boss-promises-not-to-flood-it-with-soulless-ai-slop-2000672087">a former Meta exec who previously lead Microsoft’s AI division</a>, I think it’s time to call it. Xbox is dead. Time of death: February 20, 2026.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-earnings-q2-game-pass-hardware-next-gen-pc-2000663911">This death is far from sudden or surprising</a>. If anything, we’ve all seen it coming for a while now. Reading the news about Xbox often felt like checking in on someone battling a terminal disease and whose fight wasn’t going well. Looking at the endless layoffs, impossible demands from leadership, canceled projects, flops, games getting ported to PlayStation, and loads of mismanagement, it seemed clear that in recent years, Xbox wasn’t doing well.</p>

 <h2>The beginning of the end</h2> <p>If I had to pick the moment when things truly got bad, it would be when <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-xbox-merger-timeline-call-of-duty-1850108022">Xbox bought Activision Blizzard</a>. After spending $70 billion and enduring years of legal challenges to its efforts to buy the <em>Call of Duty</em> and <em>Warcraft</em> publisher, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/microsoft-finally-completes-activision-blizzard-deal-1850924662">Xbox finally pulled it off in 2023.</a> But suddenly, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546">Xbox found itself under much more pressure to deliver</a>. Xbox was no longer just a console created by Microsoft as a small side hustle; instead it had morphed into a massive publisher with a huge suite of studios, franchises, and employees to manage. Over the next two years, everything started to change at Xbox.</p> <p>The company began de-emphasizing the idea that you even needed to own an Xbox to play Xbox games. <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/">This is an Xbox, remember?</a> Want to play <em>Halo</em> or <em>Gears of War</em> but don’t own an Xbox? Don’t worry, the games are launching on PC. Don’t want to play on PC? It’s fine, you can stream them via your phone or TV. You don’t even have to buy the games, just pay for this monthly subscription. When a console brand stops trying to sell consoles, you can probably stick a fork in it.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/console-wars-are-over-ps5-xbox-forza-switch-2-sony-1851752956">We here at <em>Kotaku</em> called the end of the console war around this time.</a> But we didn’t call the death of the Xbox just then. That’s because, despite all the signs, there was always that chance that Phil Spencer would right the ship again, as he had done before, and keep Xbox alive.</p>

 <h2>AI and porting <em>Halo</em></h2> <p>And then Microsoft, like all big tech giants these days, began investing even more billions of dollars into AI. And here was Xbox, a pricey side project that never made the company much money, but was costing the company a ton on massive deals to buy Bethesda and Activision. That was cash that could be spent on datacenters and Copilot, damn it!</p> <p>This is around the time that <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-ai-copilot-minecraft-overwatch-insider-microsoft-1851769746">Microsoft began trying to shove AI into Xbox</a> in a very awkward fashion, one that felt removed from Spencer’s stewardship of the brand. In 2025, after already porting some of its smaller games, like <em>Sea of Thieves </em>and <em>Grounded</em>, to PlayStation and Switch, Xbox did the unthinkable. <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911">It announced plans to bring <em>Halo</em> to PlayStation 5</a>, yet one more big sign that it was all over. Spencer would never promote this news on social media.</p>

 <p>That brings us to today. Xbox will no longer be run by a “gamer.” Instead, Asha Sharma, an AI executive who previously worked at Meta and InstaCart and who has no video game industry experience at all, has been put in charge of the brand despite another person, Sarah Bond, being seemingly the perfect successor to Spencer. Sharma’s hiring has generated a lot of speculation, with some theorizing that she’s a temp pick until Microsoft completely devours Xbox and turns it into nothing more than an icon on your desktop that you never click. Others have suggested she’s been put in place to help bring AI to Xbox in a big way, which seems very likely, too.</p> <p>Regardless of why she’s been made the new Xbox boss, it is now very clear: Xbox is dead. The corpse will linger around for a bit longer, but the odds of a new Xbox console hitting shelves are low. I suspect all future hardware will be rebranded PCs, like the ROG Ally X handheld from last year. A slow death for a console that once was huge, but was sunk by tech executives who had no idea what they were doing.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/embark-confirms-arc-raiders-no-aggression-matchmaking/</link>
            <guid>1442419</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you thought you were tricking <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/arc-raiders/" id="790">ARC Raiders</a> into sorting you into PvE-focused lobbies, you’re mistaken. It has been confirmed directly from the source at Embark Studios that the popular extraction adventure game <strong>does not do that</strong>. It’s just a coincidence that you’re being filed in with players who want a more peaceful time of things.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/embark-studios/" id="1161">Embark Studios’</a> design director, Virgil Watkins, confirmed that Aggression-Based Matchmaking (or ABMM, to keep it simple) is <strong>not a thing </strong>in ARC Raiders. It’s not binary, and you don’t get <strong>either </strong>friendly or violent lobbies when you explore the world outside Speranza.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-doesn-t-have-friendly-lobbies">ARC Raiders Doesn’t Have Friendly Lobbies</h2>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-full-interview-nobody-whatsoever-thought-wed-have-this-many-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer interview</a> with Embark Studios, it was <strong>confirmed </strong>in clear terms that ARC Raiders <strong>does not </strong>use Aggression-Based Matchmaking to funnel players into their matches.</p>



<p>This was confirmed by Virgil Watkins, the outspoken Embark developer who has been a fountain of knowledge of late:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We didn’t coin the term aggression-based matchmaking.</p>



<p>It’s not nearly as binary as people think. There’s no such thing as a friendly lobby or an aggressive lobby; the system is still mixing everybody, and everything’s down to human motivation. Just because you’re tending toward the more peaceful end doesn’t remove the autonomy from other people making a choice about wanting your stuff.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In Watkins’ terms, it might <em>feel </em>binary, but it’s not. You can’t shoot raiders and magically be put into a more PvP-focused lobby in the next round. He stressed it’s more <strong>nuanced</strong> than that, and what’s more, it’s constantly being evolved as the game matures. The team <strong>has </strong>noticed that players ‘have more fun’ in safer lobbies, but they’re not forcing it either way.</p>



<p>Later, Watkins stressed that it’s always up to the player how violent their lobbies are. It was pointed out that nobody is forcing you to shoot other players; that’s entirely up to you. He explained how certain groups of players will always feel more motivated to engage other players, but that’s their prerogative.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think we just have to primarily make sure that the PvP side of the game is as fair as we can make it.</p>



<p>We still have the mantra—and this is even regardless of the formation of this PvE-heavy audience—that the game never asks you to fight other players. That’s entirely your own decision. So you’re always going to have people who have the motivation to fight, because there are people who just like PvP. </p>



<p>I think we need to keep making sure we’re providing them with the tools and means to do that in an engaging way.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was also made very clear that the end-of-round surveys that players are prompted to resolve do <strong>not </strong>have a bearing on matchmaking. If you were killed in a brutal bout of PvP and say that you hated the combat in that round, you won’t then be placed in a quieter, safer lobby the next go-around.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Those are just to help us gauge how players felt about the round. They have no mechanical change on what happens to you. It is solely based on your actions in the round. Those just go to our data team and help us pair up like things that occurred in the server.</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Do you feel like Embark Studios is being as up front as possible about ABMM in ARC Raiders, or do you still suspect it plays a major role in matchmaking? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

      <p>You may not have noticed, but we’re pretty fed up with the cash-ravenous marketing scheme otherwise known as generative AI around these parts. We – like so many others – are sick of being exploited and tired of the computer getting more expensive. On the latest <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours/" rel="noreferrer">Aftermath Hours</a>, we rant about that for <em>even more</em> than an hour.&nbsp;</p><p>This time around, we find ourselves tangled in a rat king of interrelated AI stories: leftists apparently hate technology because they’re rejecting AI (and <a href="https://aftermath.site/anthropic-claude-ai-leftist-technology/"><u>the mass exploitation that comes with it</u></a>), the computer – a theoretically magical device hijacked by tech industry perverts – has <a href="https://aftermath.site/ram-prices-hdd-prices-ai-bubble-computer-expensive/"><u>become massively more expensive</u></a> as a result of AI, and a former indie games luminary has <a href="https://x.com/jasonrohrer/status/2022738409119461680?ref=aftermath.site"><u>dived into the deep end of AI psychosis</u></a> and given agents free rein to blow nearly $10,000 on the stock market.&nbsp;</p><p>Keeping in mind that AI is nothing but stringing together sentences by predicting words at mass scale, we maintain a theme by moving along to <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-game-awards-2025-polymarket-kalshi-gambling/"><u>prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi</u></a>, which also had a big week with the former <a href="https://www.avclub.com/substack-polymarket-expanded-partnership?ref=aftermath.site"><u>announcing Substack integration</u></a>.

<p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Every part of the computer [is being affected by AI], and it’s just a bar full of guys that are doing this – that are ruining the computer. I love the computer. I love the computer so much. I love the computer with all my heart. I love technology. Somebody described me as a technologist the other day, and I had never thought of calling myself that, but it is true: I love technology.&nbsp;</p><p>The thing that makes me saddest about this is that we are constantly made to hate the thing that many of us love, which is the computer. Because it either does evil things – which, fair, it’s technology; technology is often morally neutral to evil sometimes – but also because now we can’t even have it. The end of the personal computer, they want this now all in the cloud. They want you to rent their server space. It’s the enclosure of the commons.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>This also all raises the larger philosophical question that’s kind of answered by the powers that be that are propagating AI, which is: Who wants to surrender control to the cloud or AI agents or whatever? That’s not a thing that humans typically do well or that we enjoy. But then the question becomes: <em>Who </em>wants you to surrender control and why? AI is part of a larger push, under fascism, to make us more willing to just go along with whatever. It’s like “Oh, there’s always gonna be a degree of unpredictability or variability in AI agents handling stuff for us; look at how convenient it is.”&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, people in charge basically say “There’s always gonna be a degree of friction or strain under Dear Leader, but that’s fine; it’s the price of whatever good thing we’re collectively getting.” All of these are interrelated ideas that complement each other and, again, lead to the erosion of freedom and control in your own life – and being OK with that, at least philosophically.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>But even within that framework, it doesn’t make sense. I think that gives them too much credit, because even phones aren’t going to be affordable. How are you gonna talk to their chatbots? The thing you need to talk to the chatbot needs RAM. They are now hoarding the RAM.&nbsp;</p><p>This sucks for everybody, but it also sucks for me personally. It makes me mad, because none of them want to talk about the fact that the computer’s fucking expensive now. … It’s all just five guys being annoying, like “Isn’t this great? Isn’t this fucking great?” No! Leave me alone, you fucking freak. I don’t care! But I have to care because that’s my job. I have to care because it’s something I love. I have to care because the computer means more to me than it ever will to these fucking people – any of them! They do not love the computer. They do not have love of the computer in their heart. They love the shape of the computer, they love selling the computer. They don’t fucking like being on the computer. They don’t like getting a computer to do things. They don’t like enjoying struggling with the computer and then having it pay off.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a thing I feel in my heart. It makes me so fucking mad, and I hate these people so much for insisting that I should be fucking excited for this. Because they have ruined a thing I like; they have made a thing I love hard to get, and I cannot stand that. None of them want to talk about that. None of them want to face that because they are either too stupid, too sold on this, or they’re looking at their Vanguard portfolio. And honestly I cannot stand that. Go away. Leave me alone. I want everything you do to crash.&nbsp; </p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/anthropic-claude-ai-leftist-technology/"><div><p>The Left Doesn’t Hate Technology, We Hate Being Exploited</p><p>Techno-cynics are all just wounded techno-optimists.</p><p><span>Gita Jackson</span></p></div></a></figure><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/ram-prices-hdd-prices-ai-bubble-computer-expensive/"><div><p>I’m Tired Of These Useless Jackasses Making The Computer Expensive</p><p>RAM, flash memory, and HDDs are unaffordable because of a bunch of greedy idiots that do not love the computer.</p><p><span>Aftermath</span><span>Chris Person</span></p></div></a></figure>

<p>Following Phil Spencer’s&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-retires-from-xbox-sarah-bond-resigns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">retirement announcement</a>, Matt Booty has been named EVP and Chief Content Officer of Microsoft Gaming. Below is his full <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2026/02/20/asha-sharma-named-evp-and-ceo-microsoft-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">internal memo.</a></p>



<p>“I read Phil’s note with much gratitude. He has been a steady champion for game creators and our studio teams, and I’ve learned so much from his leadership over the years. All our games have benefited from his foundational support. I’m also grateful to Satya for his ongoing commitment to gaming and holding a vision of how it can connect back to the larger company.</p>



<p>Looking forward, I’m excited to partner with Asha as our next CEO. Our first conversations centered on her commitment to making great games and the role that plays in our overall success. She asks questions, pushes for clarity, and wants our choices grounded in player and developer needs. That mindset matters as the industry around us is changing quickly: how players engage, how games are made, and how business models and platforms evolve.</p>



<p>We have good reasons to believe in what’s ahead. This organization and its franchises have navigated change for decades, and our strength comes from teams who know how to adapt and keep delivering. That confidence is grounded in a strong pipeline of established franchises, new bets we believe in, and clear player demand for what we are building.</p>



<p>My focus is on supporting the teams and leaders we have in place and creating the conditions for them to do their best work. To be clear, there are no organizational changes underway for our studios.</p>



<p>Thanks for everything you do for players and for each other.</p>



<p>Matt”</p>



<p><span>Booty also confirmed that the executive restructuring doesn’t </span>mean game studio-related restructuring at&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-says-no-layoffs-coming-after-executive-shakeup/" id="178362">this link.</a></p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/metas-flagship-metaverse-service-leaves-vr-behind/</link>
            <guid>1442389</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>Some of the changes—like the removal of individual worlds from the VR store—are presented by the company as efforts to make the store a better discovery platform for third-party developers.</p>
<p>In general, Meta frames many of its recent moves as a pivot away from first-party development of VR experiences to a focus on a third-party developer ecosystem, with stats like “86% of the effective time people spend in their VR headsets is with third-party apps.”</p>
<p>“We’ll continue to support the third-party community through strategic partnerships and targeted investments—as we have since the beginning,” writes Meta Reality Labs VP of Content Samantha Ryan.</p>
<p>Meta launched a Horizon Worlds mobile app last year and found it attracted an influx of new users interested in the service’s social gaming aspects, except for the VR element. It seems that the mobile launch was successful enough to merit focusing the entire service on that platform and audience, rather than shutting it down amid the other closures of internal content projects.</p>
<p>As far as we know, Meta plans to continue to design, make, and sell VR hardware and maintain the storefronts that third-party developers sell on for those platforms. It won’t make much content in-house, and you don’t see much talk about the promise of an all-encompassing, transformational metaverse anymore.</p>
<p>Instead, Meta’s speculative investment appears focused <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/metas-799-ray-ban-display-is-the-companys-first-big-step-from-vr-to-ar/">on smart glasses</a>, as well as AI models, technologies, and applications.</p>

<p>10,000,000.0000000 (and counting)</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">NieR:Automata</a> continues to be a big sales success for Square Enix, and in a celebratory video for the game's 9th anniversary, we now know the game — a sequel to 2010's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/nier">NieR</a> — has sold over 10 million units. Plus we have a tease for the series' future</p>
<p>Last we heard, the 2017 action RPG, which came to Switch in 2022 via an excellent port, had sold 9 million units <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/nierautomata-surpasses-another-sales-milestone-plans-for-2025-teased">back in December 2024</a>. Another million copies sold in just over a year for a near-decade-old game isn't bad at all.</p>
<p>But the big news is the teaser at the end of the trailer. As the screen fades to black, text appears to be typed onto the screen: NieR:Automata to be continued...</p>
<p>So, what does this mean? Are we getting a direct sequel? A brand new NieR game? A port of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/nier_replicant_ver_1_22474487139">NieR Replicant</a>, the remake of the original NieR, from 2021?</p>
<figure data-uuid="efcf5c8c1ac8a"><a title="NieR:Automata to be continued..." href="https://images.nintendolife.com/efcf5c8c1ac8a/nierautomata-to-be-continued.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Well, if you're a long-time fan, though you might be inclined to get excited, you also know this could mean literally anything <em>but</em> a new game. NieR:Automata has spawned stage plays, novels, manga, anime, merchandise, cross-overs, collaborations, and more.</p>
<p>The last time we got a new game was <strong>Nier Reincarnation</strong>, a mobile gacha game in 2021 that has since ended global service. Of course, something fans want is a console version of that game akin to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a> (re: <strong>Champions of the Continent</strong>), but that could be a pipe dream.</p>
<p>Oh, and this also isn't the first time Square Enix has teased the future of the series and delivered very little either. But Square Enix did single out the series late last year, stating that the company was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/square-enix-teases-more-for-dragon-quest-nier-and-final-fantasy-in-2026">"preparing 'just a little something'"</a>. So who knows.</p>

<p>Following Phil Spencer’s&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-retires-from-xbox-sarah-bond-resigns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">retirement announcement</a>, Asha Sharma has been named EVP and CEO of Microsoft Gaming. Below is her full <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2026/02/20/asha-sharma-named-evp-and-ceo-microsoft-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">internal memo.</a></p>



<p>“Dear team,</p>



<p>Today I begin my role as CEO of Microsoft Gaming.</p>



<p>I feel two things at once: humility and urgency.</p>



<p>Humility because this team has built something extraordinary over decades. Urgency because gaming is in a period of rapid change, and we need to move with clarity and conviction.</p>



<p>I am stepping into work shaped by generations of artists, engineers, designers, writers, musicians, operators and more who create worlds that have brought joy and deep personal meaning to hundreds of millions of players. The level of craft here is exceptional, and it is amplified by Xbox, which was founded in the belief that the power of games connects people and pushes the industry forward.</p>



<p>Thank you to Phil for his leadership, and to every studio, platform, and operations team that built this foundation. We are stewards of some of the most loved stories and characters in entertainment and bring players and creators together around the fun and community of gaming in entirely new ways.</p>



<p>My first job is simple: understand what makes this work and protect it.</p>



<p>That starts with three commitments.</p>



<p>First, great games.</p>



<p>Everything begins here. We must have great games beloved by players before we do anything. Unforgettable characters, stories that make us feel, innovative game play, and creative excellence. We will empower our studios, invest in iconic franchises, and back bold new ideas. We will take risks. We will enter new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most.</p>



<p>I promoted Matt Booty in honor of this commitment. He understands the craft and the challenges of building great games, has led teams that deliver award-winning work, and has earned the trust of game developers across the industry.</p>



<p>Second, the return of Xbox.</p>



<p>We will recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world.</p>



<p>We will celebrate our roots with a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console which has shaped who we are. It connects us to the players and fans who invest in Xbox, and to the developers who build ambitious experiences for it.</p>



<p>Gaming now lives across devices, not within the limits of any single piece of hardware. As we expand across PC, mobile, and cloud, Xbox should feel seamless, instant, and worthy of the communities we serve. We will break down barriers so developers can build once and reach players everywhere without compromise.</p>



<p>Third, future of play.</p>



<p>We are witnessing the reinvention of play.</p>



<p>To meet the moment, we will invent new business models and new ways to play by leaning into what we already have: iconic teams, characters, and worlds that people love. But we will not treat those worlds as static IP to milk and monetize. We will build a shared platform and tools that empower developers and players to create and share their own stories.</p>



<p>As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.</p>



<p>The next 25 years belong to the teams who dare to build something surprising, something no one else is willing to try, and have the patience to see it through. We have done this before, and I am here to help us do it again. I want to return to the renegade spirit that built Xbox in the first place. It will require us to relentlessly question everything, revisit processes, protect what works, and be brave enough to change what does not.</p>



<p>Thank you for welcoming me into this journey.</p>



<p>Asha”</p>

            <guid>1442353</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>After <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-game-pass-unsustainable/"><u>a disastrous series of events</u></a> dating back to the launch of the Xbox One and <a href="https://aftermath.site/embracer-layoffs-executive-saudi/"><u>repeated</u></a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-phil-spencer/"><u>entreaties</u></a> from us to lay off a few high-paid executives instead of thousands of workers, somebody has finally taken the hint: Phil Spencer. The Xbox boss is retiring from his job at Microsoft, a wannabe AI company whose various chunks are precariously held together by increasingly enshittified vestigial tentacles, and being replaced by… the current president of Microsoft’s CoreAI product. It’s unlikely that things will get better from here on out, but it’s not like we’re sad to see Spencer go.&nbsp;</p><p>“Last fall, I shared with Satya [Nadella] that I was thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life,” Spencer wrote in a memo to staff <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-retiring-sarah-bond-out-matt-booty-promoted-as-microsoft-ai-exec-asha-sharma-named-new-xbox-boss-exclusive?ref=aftermath.site"><u>published today by IGN</u></a>. “From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we’ve built. Xbox has always been more than a business. It’s a vibrant community of players, creators, and teams who care deeply about what we build and how we build it. And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead. … I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built together over the last 25 years, and I have complete confidence in all of you and in the opportunities ahead. I’ll be cheering you on in this next chapter as Xbox’s proudest fan and player.”&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of staying on and assuming Spencer’s role, as many assumed she eventually would, Xbox president Sarah Bond is resigning, which sure is conspicuous! Asha Sharma, who spent years at Instacart and Meta before taking up the aforementioned AI job at Microsoft, promises her appointment somehow won’t lead to more AI slop from a company that seems <a href="https://aftermath.site/please-seek-help-immediately/"><u>determined to foist AI</u></a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-xbox-muse-ai-phil-spencer-dipshit/"><u>on every sector imaginable</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>“As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us,” Sharma wrote in her own memo to staff, adding that Microsoft plans to “recommit” to Xbox fans and players, but also that Xbox, conceptually, is still kinda, you know, whatever. “Gaming now lives across devices, not within the limits of any single piece of hardware. As we expand across PC, mobile, and cloud, Xbox should feel seamless, instant, and worthy of the communities we serve. We will break down barriers so developers can build once and reach players everywhere without compromise.”&nbsp;</p><p>In his wake Spencer leaves a smouldering swathe of games industry destruction which is not solely his burden to bear – Microsoft employs other execs as well, after all, and also has a board and bloodsucking shareholders to satisfy – but for which he should have suffered significantly more consequences than he did. During Spencer’s tenure, Xbox made a series of ruinously bad bets on everything from <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/consoles/xbox-series-x?ref=aftermath.site"><u>console naming schemes</u></a> to <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-price-increase/"><u>Game Pass uprooting the traditional model of how games are purchased</u></a> and becoming a bonafide Netflix competitor. </p><p>In service of this, the tech behemoth unhinged its rotten maw and swallowed up dozens of video game studios, including all of Activision Blizzard, which cost Microsoft an eye-wateringly gargantuan $68.7 billion. Many studios have <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-closure-microsoft-arkane/"><u>since been closed</u></a> or fallen victim to <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs-survival-report/"><u>one</u></a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-people/"><u>of</u></a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july/"><u>multiple</u></a> rounds of mass layoffs that ultimately impacted thousands of workers.&nbsp;Resulting <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-veterans/" rel="noreferrer">brain drain</a> has been immense, and thanks to the actions of Spencer and others at the highest echelons of power at Microsoft and other major companies, the video game industry <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-recruitment-job-applications-ai-layoffs/" rel="noreferrer">may never fully recover</a>. <a href="https://aftermath.site/blizzard-qa-workers-newly-ratified-union-contract-locks-in-pay-increases-better-benefits/" rel="noreferrer">Unions</a>, a silver lining of the current Xbox regime, are <a href="https://aftermath.site/diablo-union-activision-blizzard-microsoft-cwa-layoffs/" rel="noreferrer">doing their best</a>, but have frequently <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-unions-microsoft-layoffs-mmo-elder-scrolls/" rel="noreferrer">found themselves in damage control</a> mode so far.</p><p>It might be hard to remember now, but once upon a time, not all that long ago, press and fans ate up Spencer’s smirking “just another average gamer” act, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/comments/ozclw1/can_we_chat_about_how_how_much_phil_spencer/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>lauding him</u></a> for putting hundreds of hours into Xbox releases large and small. If nothing else, he was determined to portray himself as a man of the people, proudly announcing that he’d spent the equivalent of <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-phil-spencer-xbox-game-pass-1851095933?ref=aftermath.site"><u>23 work weeks playing games</u></a> in 2023 alone before <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2024/12/phil-spencer-shares-his-xbox-year-in-review-and-hes-been-very-busy-in-2024?ref=aftermath.site"><u>dropping to a paltry 17</u></a> in 2024.

			<p>It's been nearly nine years since the launch of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nier-automata-genre-bending-every-turn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NieR: Automata</a></strong>, the highly acclaimed action RPG developed by <strong>PlatinumGames</strong> and published by <strong>Square Enix</strong>. Fans have long been waiting for news of a sequel. Today, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyn1b_5bw-M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as part of a celebration for the game's latest sales milestone</a> (<strong>it has now sold 10 million units</strong> across all platforms), they at least got a teaser.</p>

<p>It sounds like the gears are finally moving. But why did it take so long? Well, it seems like Game Director <strong>Yoko Taro</strong> and Square Enix found it hard to reach an agreement. The outspoken creative first <a href="http://wccftech.com/nier-automata-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said that a NieR: Automata sequel would be something nobody would have thought about</a>; a few months later, in March 2018, Taro <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoko-taro-thinks-hell-make-failures-next/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared the belief that his next projects would not be as successful</a>, so <strong>his goal was to make as much money as he could</strong>.</p>



<p>In April 2018,  he <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/taro-if-square-enix-gives-me-money-i-will-create-anything/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doubled down on his previous statement</a>, <strong>calling on Square Enix to give him money if they wanted a NieR: Automata sequel</strong>: </p>



<p><em>If Square-Enix gives me money, I will create anything. So I think let Square-Enix know and I think if Square-Enix wants it, I'll do it.</em></p>



<p>However, nothing really came of it. Sure, Yoko Taro worked on the now-defunct gacha mobile <strong>Nier Reincarnation</strong> and the small-scale RPG <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/voice-of-cards-the-isle-dragon-roars-ps4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars</a></strong>, but beyond that, he was pretty quiet these last few years. A few months ago, he finally broke the silence to <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoko-taro-has-been-working-on-multiple-projects-they-just-kept-getting-cancelled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal</a> that he had actually worked on several projects, but <strong>most of them never even got released</strong>. He was fine with it since he got paid, though. Perhaps now Square Enix and Yoko Taro have finally reached a financial agreement, though fans remain skeptical and wonder if the publisher is truly referring to the long-awaited NieR: Automata sequel.</p>



<p>By the way, the publisher also announced today that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nier-replicant-ver-1-22474487139-whats-the-square-root-of-1-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139</strong></a> has sold <strong>over 2 million units to date</strong>.</p>

            <p>Ah, it's a Friday night, time to rela-</p>
<p>Wait a minute, long-time Microsoft gaming CEO Phil Spencer's retiring, his assumed replacement and Xbox president Sarah Bond has resigned, and the suit now being tapped to take over Spenny's gig currently has the following job title: president of Microsoft’s CoreAI product. Right, guess I'm writing a news.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This shakeup was first reported by the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-retiring-sarah-bond-out-matt-booty-promoted-as-microsoft-ai-exec-asha-sharma-named-new-xbox-boss-exclusive">Ian Games Network</a>. There are big, long corporate email memos and everything.</p>
<p>According to the reports, big Phillip will step down as Microsoft Gaming CEO on Monday, February 23rd. Though, he'll be staying around in "an advisory role through the summer" to help the leadership switch go smoothly. Taking his place will be Asha Sharma, the aforementioned current president of Microsoft’s CoreAI product. With Spencer gone and Bond resigned, the third member of Microsoft's main gaming leadership trio over the past few years, Matt Booty, is getting a promotion to chief content officer and will work alongside Sharma.</p><p>"Together, Asha and Matt have the right combination of consumer product leadership and gaming depth to push our platform innovation and content pipeline forward," Microsoft big boss Satya Nadella wrote in one of those big, long corporate email memos. "Last year, Phil Spencer made the decision to retire from the company, and since then we’ve been talking about succession planning. I want to thank Phil for his extraordinary leadership and partnership. Over 38 years at Microsoft, including 12 years leading Gaming, Phil helped transform what we do and how we do it."</p>
<p>"As part of this transition, Sarah Bond has decided to leave Microsoft to begin a new chapter," Spencer added in his own email. "Sarah has been instrumental during a defining period for Xbox, shaping our platform strategy, expanding Game Pass and cloud gaming, supporting new hardware launches, and guiding some of the most significant moments in our history. I’m grateful for her partnership and the impact she’s had, and I wish her the very best in what comes next...to everyone in Microsoft Gaming, I want to say 'thank you'. I’ve learned so much from this team and community, grown alongside you, and been continually inspired by the creativity, courage, and care you bring to players, creators, and to one another every day."</p>
<p>New boss Sharma's penned an email too (told you there were many), with the former chief operating officer of grocery delivery firm Instacart and vice president at Mark Zuckerberg-helmed tech/metaverse bollocks company Meta using part of it to lay out her three-pronged vision for the future. "We must have great games beloved by players before we do anything," she wrote. "Unforgettable characters, stories that make us feel, innovative game play, and creative excellence. We will empower our studios, invest in iconic franchises, and back bold new ideas. We will take risks. We will enter new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most."</p>
<p>Her second goal is to bring about a multiplatform "return of Xbox". Her third point makes for the most intriguing read out of the trio. "To meet the moment, we will invent new business models and new ways to play by leaning into what we already have: iconic teams, characters, and worlds that people love," she wrote. "But we will not treat those worlds as static IP to milk and monetise. We will build a shared platform and tools that empower developers and players to create and share their own stories.</p><p>"As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us."</p>
<p>Now, all of that's fine to say in an overly long corporate email, but actually doing it's another thing. As it's a Friday night, I don't have any advanced throughts on this corporate shakeup beyond mourning the fact I may soon never again have an excuse to whip out this image I slapped together while at VG247, dubbed 'the three faces of Philly', and found far too funny.</p>

              <p><span>After over 20 years at Xbox, Phil Spencer, the face of the brand for more than a decade, has announced </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement-microsoft-2000672059"><span>he’s retiring from the company</span></a><span>. Sarah Bond, the president at Xbox, is also out and Asha Sharma, the president of Microsoft’s CoreAI product, is taking over as CEO of Microsoft Gaming.</span></p> <p><span>It sounds bleak for Microsoft’s long-struggling gaming brand, though Sharma said in her initial email to employees that her goal was not to flood the Xbox ecosystem with “soulless AI slop.” Is that the truth or just something you say to placate your workers? Only time will tell, but Microsoft has been notoriously pushing for AI integration in its workflow, so do with that information what you will.</span></p>

 <p><span>Now that Spencer is out, however, the internet is looking back on his tenure at the company, speculating about whether or not he and Bond were forced out of their leadership positions, and wondering what all this means for the future of Xbox. The forecast is not great.</span></p>     <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:5rqrieckrxohygpkhnsar5nf/app.bsky.feed.post/3mfcycdzan22d" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiggsxageu3ctmjfpdyumw76h7klcvwfw7lyloqtnf2zlxyykeetbi"> <p lang="en">The fact that the only ms/Xbox letter mentioning Sarah Bond is Phil’s, along with the fact that she didn’t release a statement, suggests that this was all actually messy as hell, and the story is going to get out faster than leadership could plan for.

<p>"We’re looking forward to talking more about 'Rayman' soon"</p>
</section><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="07c5092ab7dbc"><a title="Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/07c5092ab7dbc/rayman-30th-anniversary-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Last week's PlayStation State of Play brought us the welcome news that Rayman is <em>back</em>, thanks to the Digital Eclipse-developed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rayman_30th_anniversary_edition">Rayman: 30th Anniversary Edition</a>. And for the once-iconic platforming legends, it seems this is just the beginning.</p>
<p>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has told <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/">Variety</a> that Rayman, who debuted back in 1995, "is a landmark franchise for Ubisoft and holds a special place in my heart".</p>
<p>The recent Anniversary Edition is apparently just "the first step in the brand’s comeback". And Guillemot says that, with this rerelease, it's "inspiring to see players continue to embrace Rayman’s unique charm and enduring appeal".</p><div><figure data-videoid="8i2vvu-qeBQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt8i2vvu-qeBQ" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4c3af8gjpykq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>The future seems bright for the character, then, as Guillemot states that "we're always exploring how our iconic franchises can evolve and reinvent themselves" and, with Rayman in particular, "We can’t share details today, but we’re looking forward to talking more about Rayman soon."</p>
<p>So, expect <em>some</em> kind of news in the future. What that will be, we have no idea, but we're glad to see the icon return, especially after going so quiet after the numerous ports of the outstanding <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rayman_legends_definitive_edition">Rayman: Legends</a> and his appearance in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mario_plus_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_dlc_3_rayman_in_the_phantom_show">Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope DLC</a>.</p>
<p>As for the now, Rayman: 30th Anniversary Edition is centre stage, and this digital museum includes playable versions of the PlayStation, Atari Jaguar, MS-DOS, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance releases of the original, extra levels from Rayman Designer, Rayman 60 Levels, and Rayman By His Fans, and a playable prototype of the cancelled SNES release.</p>

<p>Some early impressions haven't been too kind to the game, with reports of bugs and a "reimagined" soundtrack that fans say is inferior to the PS original. Apparently Ubisoft is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/ubisoft-reportedly-aware-of-rayman-30th-anniversary-edition-ost-requests">looking into a way of allowing players to swap between the old and new music</a>, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>The full Variety interview (linked up top and below) also covers some of the recent controversies surrounding the French video game publisher and developer, including the cancellation of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-6-games-in-major-organisation-restructure">six major projects</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/ubisoft-staff-push-back-against-company-restructure-with-three-day-strike">strike action across the company</a> in the wake of mass company layoffs and restructuring.</p>
<p>While the Assassin's Creed franchise <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/assassins-creed-has-overperformed-this-quarter-says-ubisoft">apparently "overperformed" last quarter</a>, Ubisoft is very much under the microscope in the industry after a tumultuous few years. Whether Rayman can weather the storm remains to be seen.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Valve is “Clearly Not” Cooperating Fairly, Says CEO Leading £656M Lawsuit Against Steam’s 30% Cut of Game Sales]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/valve-is-clearly-not-cooperating-fairly-says-ceo-leading-656m-lawsuit-against-steams-30-cut-of-game-sales/</link>
            <guid>1442314</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last month, a <strong>UK judge</strong> ruled that <strong>Valve </strong>would have to face its day in court over a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-operator-valve-faces-a-656m-class-action-lawsuit-over-its-excessive-30-cut-of-all-steam-sales/">£656 million class-action lawsuit</a></strong> being led by <strong>Parent Zone</strong> chief executive officer, <strong>Vicki Shotbolt</strong>, over the <strong>30% cut</strong> that the company takes from all transactions on <strong>Steam</strong>.</p>



<p>It's not a dissimilar case to what <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/epic-v-apple/"><strong>Epic Games</strong> brought against <strong>Apple</strong></a>, as Shotbolt has called Valve's 30% cut "<em>excessive</em>" and that the company "<em></em><em>is rigging the market and taking advantage of UK gamers</em>." In a new report from <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/it-needs-to-cooperate-fairly-and-its-clearly-not-why-valve-is-facing-a-656m-day-in-the-uk-courts">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, Shotbolt further explained her case against Valve and Steam, adding that Valve is "<em>clearly not</em>" cooperating fairly in the video games market.</p>



<p>"<em>It's about how you use digital in positive ways, and how you unlock, enjoy, and embrace opportunity</em>," said Shotbolt. "<em>Games are such a vital part of that ecosystem. It's an important industry. It's important for young people who enjoy it and play in it. It's important for the adults who have spent an enormous amount of time socialising, playing games, and so on.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Games is a really important sector, and therefore it needs to operate fairly and not overcharge, fundamentally. Steam is a big and important platform for a big and important ecosystem – <strong>it needs to cooperate fairly, and it's clearly not.</strong></em>"</p>



<p>While Shotbolt hopes that a win will provide a more balanced industry for developers and players across the world, she also admits that elements like developers lowering their prices because Steam is no longer taking as big of a cut is not guaranteed. "<em>That is out of my control</em>," Shotbolt adds. "<em>You can put a stake in the ground and say developers should not be being charged that 30% - that it is too high and not a reasonable amount of money. What you'd hope would happen is that some developers will bring their prices down, and they'll pass that on to the consumer. I believe it will happen, because that's how markets look. But it can only happen if that price parity obligation also goes away."</em></p>



<p>"<em>Of course, it's possible that developers would get together and make greater profits from their games. But one would hope a market would respond by saying it's in my interest to cut my price now and pass that on to the customer</em>."</p>



<p>We can hope that prices will go down, but Shotbolt has to win her case first. And decreasing prices aren't the only outcome Shotbolt hopes for if she wins. The ultimate goal, it would seem, is to see Valve not dominate the market and to see developers have more than one viable option for where to sell their games.</p>



<p>"<em>If you want to develop a PC game, you want it on Steam. It's not like developers have ten options</em>," Shotbolt said. "<em>That's what makes the case, I think, so important, because Steam has had market dominance for a long, long time, and it shouldn't be exploiting that.</em>"</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Major Shake-Up at Xbox: Phil Spencer Reitres, Sarah Bond Resigns, and Asha Sharma to Become the new CEO of Microsoft Gaming]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/microsoft-phil-spencer-retires-sarah-bond-resigns-asha-sharma-takes-over-xbox/</link>
            <guid>1442311</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-retiring-sarah-bond-out-matt-booty-promoted-as-microsoft-ai-exec-asha-sharma-named-new-xbox-boss-exclusive">IGN</a> reveals that <strong>Microsoft's</strong> gaming division and <strong>Xbox</strong> are going through a <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2026/02/20/asha-sharma-named-evp-and-ceo-microsoft-gaming/">major leadership shake-up</a>. <strong>Phil Spencer</strong> <strong>will retire this coming Monday, February 23, 2026</strong>, after first joining Microsoft all the way back in 1988 as an intern. He's not the only one departing: <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-president-says-game-exclusives-are-antiquated/">Sarah Bond</a></strong>, current president of Xbox at Microsoft, is now the <strong>former president</strong> of Xbox at Microsoft, as she will <strong>resign</strong> from her role. Lastly, Microsoft's current president of its CoreAI division, <strong>Asha Sharma</strong>, will take Spencer's place as the new chief executive officer of Microsoft Gaming.</p>



<p>Back in July 2025, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-retire-following-next-gen-xbox-launch/">reported on a rumour that Phil Spencer would retire</a> with the arrival of the next-generation Xbox console. That rumour was denied by Microsoft at the time, claiming that Spencer was not going to retire <strong>"<em>anytime soon</em>."</strong> At the same time, we still pointed out that Spencer was 57 at the time of the report, and that he had been with Microsoft for nearly 40 years. To say Spencer was due to retire soon was not the most prescient call to make at the time, and it seems that was indeed the case. </p>



<p>"<em>I want to thank Phil for his extraordinary leadership and partnership,</em>" said Microsoft's chief executive officer, <strong>Satya Nadella</strong>. "<em>Over 38 years at Microsoft, including 12 years leading Gaming, Phil helped transform what we do and how we do it.</em>"</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s rare in life to know when a chapter is closing, but after 38&nbsp;years at Microsoft, that moment has arrived for me. I’ve made the decision to retire and begin the next chapter of my life. It’s a milestone that’s given me a chance to reflect on the incredible journey I’ve been…</p>— Phil Spencer (@XboxP3) <a href="https://twitter.com/XboxP3/status/2024951211129254314?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Spencer, for his part, added that, "<em>Last fall, I shared with Satya that I was thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life. From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we've built. Xbox has always been more than a business. It's a vibrant community of players, creators, and teams who care deeply about what we build and how we build it. And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Today marks an exciting new chapter for Microsoft Gaming as Asha Sharma steps into the role of CEO, and I want to be the first to welcome her to this incredible team. Working with her over the past several months has given me tremendous confidence. She brings genuine curiosity, clarity and a deep commitment to understanding players, creators, and the decisions that shape our future. We know this is an important moment for our fans, partners, and team, and we're committed to getting it right. I'll remain in an advisory role through the summer to support a smooth handoff.</em>"</p>



<p>Also part of this shake-up is <strong>Matt Booty</strong>, who will take over from Asha Sharma as the new chief executive officer of CoreAI at Microsoft. "<em>Looking forward, I'm excited to partner with Asha as our next CEO,</em>" said Booty. "<em>Our first conversations centred on her commitment to making great games and the role that plays in our overall success</em>."</p>



<p>Sharma, for her part, began her address to Microsoft's gaming staff by saying she feels "<em>two things at once: humility and urgency</em>." </p>



<p>"<em>Humility because this team has built something extraordinary over decades. Urgency because gaming is in a period of rapid change, and we need to move with clarity and conviction. I am stepping into work shaped by generations of artists, engineers, designers, writers, musicians, operators and more who create worlds that have brought joy and deep personal meaning to hundreds of millions of players. The level of craft here is exceptional, and it is amplified by Xbox, which was founded in the belief that the power of games connect people and push the industry forward. Thank you to Phil for his leadership, and to every studio, platform, and operations team that built this foundation. We are stewards of some of the most loved stories and characters in entertainment and bring players and creators together around the fun and community of gaming in entirely new ways.</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Sharma added that her first job is to "<em>understand what makes this work and protect it</em>," which doesn't exactly inspire a whole lot of confidence, and speaks to her lack of experience within the video game industry. Before she joined Microsoft in 2024, she was a vice president of product and engineering at <strong>Meta</strong>.</p>



<p>That said, her next statement was that her understanding begins with three commitments, the first of which is: "<em><strong>great games</strong></em><strong>."</strong></p>



<p>"<em>Everything begins here,</em>" she adds. "<em><strong>We must have great games beloved by players before we do anything.</strong></em><strong>"</strong> It's exactly what players want to hear, and is exactly the opposite of what players once heard from Spencer in a now-infamous quote.</p>



<p>Sharma continues to say her second commitment is "<em>the return of Xbox</em>," and that the company will "<em>recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those players who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world</em>."</p>



<p>This may sound like Xbox could pivot away from its current trajectory of centring its services over its hardware, <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-will-reportedly-be-best-of-both-worlds-between-pc-and-console/">but with how far along that plan is, </a>it feels unlikely for the next Xbox console to usher in the platform's return to households. </p>



<p>Lastly, her third commitment is "<em>future of play</em>," which, unsurprisingly, is where Sharma mentions how <strong>AI</strong> and monetization are continuing to evolve, but she does claim that "<em>we will not chase <strong>short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop</strong></em><strong>."</strong> Strong words that players will be sure to remember, and remind Sharma of, if we ever see something from Microsoft stray from that commitment.</p>



<p>Ultimately, this is the end of an era for Xbox. There's a lot that players will remember Spencer and Bond for, not all of it positive, and we're entering a new chapter for the Xbox platform and Microsoft's time in the video game industry.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the only one we haven't heard from yet is Sarah Bond, who does not have a statement included in the report, nor has she made a statement on her social media accounts.</p>

              <p>The longest-serving head of Xbox <a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement-microsoft-2000672059">is retiring ahead of the brand’s 25th anniversary</a>. Phil Spencer joined Microsoft as an intern and rose to be the CEO of one of its most popular divisions. Maybe its <em>only</em> popular division.</p> <p>Announcing his retirement the same year <em>Halo</em> is set to make its <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911">debut on PlayStation</a> as part of Microsoft’s new multiplatform publishing strategy, Spencer briefly reflected on his time at the company, what comes next for Xbox, and his gratitude for those who helped it get to where it currently is. Here’s the <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/2024944789872050298">memo he sent to staff today</a> amid an executive shuffle that will have huge repercussions for the biggest gaming publisher in the country:</p> <blockquote><p>When I walked through Microsoft’s doors as an intern in June of 1988, I could never have imagined the products I’d help build, the players and customers we’d serve, or the extraordinary teams I’d be lucky enough to join. It’s been an epic ride and truly the privilege of a lifetime.</p> <p>Last fall, I shared with Satya that I was thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life. From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we’ve built. Xbox has always been more than a business. It’s a vibrant community of players, creators, and teams who care deeply about what we build and how we build it. And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead.</p> <p>Today marks an exciting new chapter for Microsoft Gaming as Asha Sharma steps into the role of CEO, and I want to be the first to welcome her to this incredible team. Working with her over the past several months has given me tremendous confidence. She brings genuine curiosity, clarity and a deep commitment to understanding players, creators, and the decisions that shape our future. We know this is an important moment for our fans, partners, and team, and we’re committed to getting it right. I’ll remain in an advisory role through the summer to support a smooth handoff.</p> <p>I’m also grateful for the strength of our studios organization. Matt Booty and our studios teams continue to build an incredible portfolio, and I have full confidence in the leadership and creative momentum across our global studios. I want to congratulate Matt on his promotion to EVP and Chief Content Officer.</p> <p>As part of this transition, Sarah Bond has decided to leave Microsoft to begin a new chapter. Sarah has been instrumental during a defining period for Xbox, shaping our platform strategy, expanding Game Pass and cloud gaming, supporting new hardware launches, and guiding some of the most significant moments in our history. I’m grateful for her partnership and the impact she’s had, and I wish her the very best in what comes next.</p> <p>Most of all, to everyone in Microsoft Gaming, I want to say “thank you”. I’ve learned so much from this team and community, grown alongside you, and been continually inspired by the creativity, courage, and care you bring to players, creators, and to one another every day.</p> <p>I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built together over the last 25 years, and I have complete confidence in all of you and in the opportunities ahead. I’ll be cheering you on in this next chapter as Xbox’s proudest fan and player.</p> <p>Phil</p> <p>XBL: P3</p> </blockquote> <p>Spencer worked tirelessly to salvage Xbox’s reputation after a disastrous launch rollout for the Xbox One. The strategy included trying to nab big exclusives and eventually going on the biggest studio acquisition spree the industry has ever seen. The result was an Xbox Series X/S platform that had great features and, eventually, great games, but which struggled to keep pace with rival console platforms. The end of Spencer’s tenure saw the Xbox division acquire Activision Blizzard and continue to grow Game Pass into a defining service for the ecosystem and beyond it on PC.</p>

 <p>What happens to Xbox next is anyone’s guess. Spencer’s legacy as the longest steward of the brand will take time to settle into place. Many considered him the last bulwark against Microsoft’s AI-fueled upending of the brand. Things were never going to stay the same, but they might start changing even faster than anyone dared expect.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/882241/microsoft-phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement">just announced he’s leaving the company</a> after 12 years leading Xbox and nearly 40 at Microsoft in total. His replacement: Asha Sharma, formerly <a href="https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/speakers/5e943e22-f2b6-4443-b8b0-55749176a169">head of development for Microsoft’s AI enterprise teams</a>. Before that, she was COO of Instacart for three years, and spent four at Meta in charge of the company’s messaging apps.</p></div><p>What will Sharma do with Xbox? Read for yourself in her first internal memo, which we’ve printed in full below.</p><p>Sharma says she is committed to “the return of Xbox,” games in “new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most,” and that games will “always will be art, crafted by humans” while promising not to “flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop.”</p><p>However, she also says that “monetization and AI will evolve and influence this future,” and it sounds like Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24073286/xbox-console-exclusivity-hardware-update-game-pass">will still pursue Xbox Everywhere</a> — she isn’t returning to the definition of Xbox as a physical box alone. While she does promise “a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console,” she writes that Xbox will “expand across PC, mobile, and cloud” as well.</p><div><blockquote><p>Dear team,</p><p>Today I begin my role as CEO of Microsoft Gaming.</p><p>I feel two things at once: humility and urgency.</p><p>Humility because this team has built something extraordinary over decades. Urgency because gaming is in a period of rapid change, and we need to move with clarity and conviction.</p><p>I am stepping into work shaped by generations of artists, engineers, designers, writers, musicians, operators and more who create worlds that have brought joy and deep personal meaning to hundreds of millions of players. The level of craft here is exceptional, and it is amplified by Xbox, which was founded in the belief that the power of games connect people and push the industry forward.</p><p>Thank you to Phil for his leadership, and to every studio, platform, and operations team that built this foundation. We are stewards of some of the most loved stories and characters in entertainment and bring players and creators together around the fun and community of gaming in entirely new ways.<br>My first job is simple: understand what makes this work and protect it.</p><p>That starts with three commitments.</p><p>First, great games.</p><p>Everything begins here. We must have great games beloved by players before we do anything. Unforgettable characters, stories that make us feel, innovative game play, and creative excellence. We will empower our studios, invest in iconic franchises, and back bold new ideas. We will take risks. We will enter new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most.<br>I promoted Matt Booty in honor of this commitment. He understands the craft and the challenges of building great games, has led teams that deliver award-winning work, and has earned the trust of game developers across the industry.</p><p>Second, the return of Xbox.</p><p>We will recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world.</p><p>We will celebrate our roots with a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console which has shaped who we are. It connects us to the players and fans who invest in Xbox, and to the developers who build ambitious experiences for it.</p><p>Gaming now lives across devices, not within the limits of any single piece of hardware. As we expand across PC, mobile, and cloud, Xbox should feel seamless, instant, and worthy of the communities we serve. We will break down barriers so developers can build once and reach players everywhere without compromise.</p><p>Third, future of play.</p><p>We are witnessing the reinvention of play.</p><p>To meet the moment, we will invent new business models and new ways to play by leaning into what we already have: iconic teams, characters, and worlds that people love. But we will not treat those worlds as static IP to milk and monetize. We will build a shared platform and tools that empower developers and players to create and share their own stories.</p><p>As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.</p><p>The next 25 years belong to the teams who dare to build something surprising, something no one else is willing to try, and have the patience to see it through. We have done this before, and I am here to help us do it again. I want to return to the renegade spirit that built Xbox in the first place. It will require us to relentlessly question everything, revisit processes, protect what works, and be brave enough to change what does not.</p><p>Thank you for welcoming me into this journey.</p><p>Asha</p></blockquote></div><p>And here’s the full memo from Matt Booty, who is now Microsoft’s chief content officer and EVP of Microsoft Gaming:</p><div><blockquote><p>I read Phil’s note with much gratitude. He has been a steady champion for game creators and our studio teams, and I’ve learned so much from his leadership over the years. All our games have benefited from his foundational support. I’m also grateful to Satya for his ongoing commitment to gaming and holding a vision of how it can connect back to the larger company.</p><p>Looking forward, I’m excited to partner with Asha as our next CEO. Our first conversations centered on her commitment to making great games and the role that plays in our overall success. She asks questions, pushes for clarity, and wants our choices grounded in player and developer needs. That mindset matters as the industry around us is changing quickly: how players engage, how games are made, and how business models and platforms evolve.</p><p>We have good reasons to believe in what’s ahead. This organization and its franchises have navigated change for decades, and our strength comes from teams who know how to adapt and keep delivering. That confidence is grounded in a strong pipeline of established franchises, new bets we believe in, and clear player demand for what we are building.</p><p>My focus is on supporting the teams and leaders we have in place and creating the conditions for them to do their best work. To be clear, there are no organizational changes underway for our studios.</p><p>Thanks for everything you do for players and for each other.</p><p>-Matt</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/882326/read-microsoft-gaming-ceo-asha-sharma-first-memo]]></content:encoded>
