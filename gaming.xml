            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Koei Tecmo has announced two major&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors&nbsp;</em>projects as part of the celebrations for the series' 25th anniversary, and if you're a fan of old-school entries in the series, it looks like you're in luck.</p>

<p>First up, as revealed on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2384580/view/527601954987180354" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>, a "large-scale" DLC expansion is in development for&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>. Koei Tecmo is remaining relatively tight-lipped about what that DLC pack might entail, but it's a "major" expansion, according to an accompanying trailer.</p>

<p>Not only is the DLC coming, but a remastered version of one of the series' past entries is also in the works. Again, we don't know which game is up for the remaster treatment, but given that titles like&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>5&nbsp;</em>are fan favorites, it's likely one of these is the subject of Koei Tecmo's nostalgic attentions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dynasty-warriors-origins-dlc-remaster-battlefield.jpg?itok=wuy-U073 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dynasty-warriors-origins-dlc-remaster-battlefield.jpg?itok=LyZitU7B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins&nbsp;</em>is getting new DLC soon.</figcaption></figure><p>News of&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>' upcoming DLC comes a few months after Koei Tecmo revealed that the latest game in the large-scale hack-and-slash franchise has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dynasty-warriors-origins-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">hit a million sales worldwide</a>. Since that announcement was back in February, it's likely the game has picked up even more sales for itself in the interim.</p>

<p><em>Origins&nbsp;</em>revolves around a "nameless hero in the Three Kingdoms", who will experience the "magnificent and alluring" story of this historical period (albeit through the lens of&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors</em>' characteristic over-the-top action) as he hacks and slashes his way through legions of enemies.</p>

<p>The game offers a new spin on the usual blend of action and strategy that characterizes&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors</em>, as well as a fresh take on the narrative that the series has revolved around since its inception in 2000.</p>

<p>You can check out the <i>Dynasty Warriors&nbsp;</i>25th-anniversary trailer right here. It's pretty short, but it should spark a few memories if you've been with the series since the start.</p>




<p><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2384580/DYNASTY_WARRIORS_ORIGINS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dynasty-warriors-origins/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dynasty-warriors-origins/9p5hjqnx53xj" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>I was munching crisps while watching a showcase of upcoming games from THQ Nordic last week, letting the likes of a new Spongebob Squarepants game and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gothic-remake">Gothic Remake</a> wash over me like barely flavoured fizzy water, when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fatekeeper">Fatekeeper</a> showed up. I straightened up, just a little. It is a fancy looking first-person RPG made with all the hyper detail and vivid lighting you might expect of a game developed in Unreal Engine 5. It is also conjuring a game worth conjuring: the heavy hitting fantasy brawlabout <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic">Dark Messiah Of Might And Magic</a>. As I watched the below trailer, I became more and more cautiously hopeful. Looks slick, but where's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-dark-messiah-might-magic">the kick</a>?</p>
<!--more--> <figure>

<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</figure>
<p>It's being made by Paraglacial, a small THQ-owned studio made up of a few former Spellforce developers. And it isn't the first game to try capture the magical bootfoolery of Dark Messiah. A fantasy sword swinger called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hellraid">Hellraid</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hellraid-development-on-hold">cancelled by Techland</a> some years ago, and it was while discussing that piteous loss that the studio began to plot their own take on first-person sword-slamming.</p>
<p>"We thought that this is a type of game that you don't see that often," said creative director Raphael Lubke during the showcase. "You have these huge awesome open world titles like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>, but you barely ever see like dedicated, more linear story-driven games with this nice focus on the combat mechanics of melee in a first-person game."</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>THQ Nordic</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That combat does look weighty from what we were shown during a demo. Your two-handed sword is wielded with hefty swings, sometimes donking crankily off enemy shields, sometimes piercing their necks and entering a bottled animation that ends in a swift decapitation. You can take dashing sidesteps and swig health vials. It reminds me of the movement in Chivalry II, if your opponents were snarling singleplayer orc-a-likes in opulent armour, rather than screeching multiplayer knights. </p>
<p>We also get some hints as to other more magical powers you'll use, aside from the windy push powers and object-hurling telekinesis you can see in the above trailer. "You might be able to freeze a lake, lure enemies onto it, and then melt the ice with the fireball, for example," said Lubke. </p>
<p>But for now the focus seems to be on getting some chunky hits in with that massive claymore. At one point in the playthrough, the player coated a sword with poison and we watched as the heavy bruiser he was fighting slowly succumbed to the toxins, eventually keeling over. I will admit, even without that pivotal bootheel, there were some very entertaining ragdoll physics, not to mention some lovely vanishing screams as sharp-toothed foes tumbled into the pits below.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>THQ Nordic</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And these were some sheer drops. Paraglacial, the studio, is located in the German Alps, and it's a locale that has partly inspired the high-altitude terrain of the game's fantasy landscape (if not the ornate temple architecture). </p>
<p>"I always said this dream of founding is team in an area where you normally don't see game development teams, like remote rural areas like we are in the Alps," said Lubke. "And we also wanted to transport our love for this environment into the game and create a game world where the landscape, the environment is a part of the story itself. It's one of the main actors of the game.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>THQ Nordic</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"It's not an open world game, the maps are designed in a not extremely open way, but they allow for a lot of different trajectories. [It's] not a straight line where you feel like you're playing on rails. Linear, for us, means control over the narrative and the density of the experience, but it doesn't mean forcing the player down a shallow path."</p>
<p>We get a few other glances of the bruiser's innards. An item screen that looks like a mash-up of the inventory management of Witcher 3 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>, for example. And an easy-to-solve puzzle tomb that the developer says won't be quite so simple in the full game. But otherwise it's a short but enticing glimpse of some promising battering. Still, I want to see that conspicuously absent kick. After loving the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deathloop-chose-to-boot-its-melee-system-in-favor-of-that-excellent-kick">strong booting</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deathloop">Deathloop</a> enough to record <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3gvwJ1xcjs">an entire video conversation about it</a> with Colm (RPS in peace), I am yearning for another equally powerful pair of shoes.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fatekeeper-looks-like-a-spiritual-successor-to-dark-messiah-but-wheres-the-kick]]></content:encoded>

              <p>In one of GameStop’s many scrambles to stay alive beyond its memestock status, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-gme-pokemon-card-trade-ins-psa-charizard-1851470574">the stores began buying graded <em>Pokémon TCG</em> cards last year</a>. Now the company has found a way to sell them back to you, but in a wildly bad mystery box deal.</p> <p>GameStop’s attempt to behave like your local TCG store could only ever have been a bizarre corporate pastiche of the concept. When you go to your local independent card shop and trade in your pulls, they’ll usually give you a fair price that still leaves decent room for the store to resell them at a profit. When GameStop started doing it, it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-trade-in-gamestop-youtube-leonhart-1851489326">without providing the staff with the necessary training and expertise</a>, and naturally saw them paying woefully low prices, and of course without any of the individual stores having any independence over how it was carried out. The result of all that is now far more clear: for the last three months, GameStop has been selling graded cards back to customers in the form of mystery boxes, with the second phases of this initiative just launched. And wow, they’re not worth it.</p> <p>Three months ago, the incredibly popular Pokémon YouTuber PokeRev <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqGiE5hz7zI">opened the first wave of these mystery boxes</a>, called GameStop Power Packs. At that point, these $60 boxes contained three “random” booster packs plus one PSA-graded card, at a grade of 8 or higher. The boxes showed an image of a Lost Origin Giratina V alt-art in a grade 10, which <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/pokemon-lost-origin/giratina-v-186?q=giratina+v+186">today would cost you over $1,600</a>. That’d sure be nice to find. But just like the infamously terrible Walmart equivalent MJ Holding mystery boxes which do the same daft trick of putting extraordinarily rare packs on their boxes, that’s not what you’re likely to discover inside.</p>

 <p>To be fair to GameStop, their presentation is at least a little nicer–Walmart’s mystery boxes are flimsy cardboard with the various items rattling loose inside. GameStop’s go the other way, with so much of the cost clearly going into the sturdy box, folding lid, and bespoke foam inset. But yeah, the chances of finding $60-worth of goodies inside seems incredibly slim.</p> <p>This second wave of Power Packs has maintained the $60 price, but now only have two booster packs instead of three! Those packs, as revealed in PokeRev’s latest video on the boxes, seem to be two of Surging Sparks, 151, or Journey Together. That’s about $10 to $15 worth. The graded cards then seem to come in around $15 to $30, meaning most boxes will get you contents worth from half to two-thirds of what you paid. Which…sucks! $60 for $30 of cards.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Gamestop's New Power Packs are Kinda Weird" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/irST4sbj3Yg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>There is, of course, the chance that the packs could contain a valuable card, but it’s not high, and no better than just buying the packs themselves for their actual price. The one positive I can find is that at least the PSA-graded cards aren’t just bulk. From watching plenty of those MJ Holding boxes getting opened that contain graded cards, those will very often feature a grade 7 generic card from a recent set, worth far, far less than it would have cost to grade it in the first place. Instead, what’s shown for GameStop’s seem to be at least some classic cards from the early 00s, both Japanese and English, even if they themselves aren’t worth more than small change.</p> <p>We don’t know if these PSA cards are solely sourced from what’s been sold to GameStop stores over the last year, or if the company is buying them in bulk from other suppliers, but a combination of the two would make most sense. Either way, given the stores will have paid far less than they’re worth when they’re traded in, and are then being sold back in boxes that the majority of the time charge twice as much as the contents are worth, it’s clearly a very profitable venture for the company. But it’s definitely not one worth spending your money on. You’re far better off visiting your local independent store, or buying graded cards from trusted online marketplaces, so you can be sure you’re spending your money on the card you really want.</p>

<figure><a title="Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157837/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>To return to <strong>Ninja Gaiden</strong>’s 2D roots in 2025 is a wonderful thing. Dotemu, upon acquiring the license for a series reboot, approached Spanish indie developer The Game Kitchen to get the job done. Known for their remarkable <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a> titles, the project was overseen by Team Ninja, who have held the series mantle from 2004 to present. And, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> is not strictly the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/ninja_gaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a> one recalls from its NES days, the task here has been carried off with all the panache modern technology can afford, resulting in a blisteringly gorgeous action-platformer.</p>
<p>For those old enough, Ninja Gaiden was once a formidable 8-Bit challenge that either destroyed a child’s willpower or forged them eternal gaming mastery. It was, and still is, brutally hard. While Ragebound echoes this, in that it gets seriously challenging after its first third, its format is far less aggressive. You don’t have lives, you have checkpoints, and respawns come in an infinite flavour. You don’t have entirely linear progression, but a world map where you can return to any substage to earn higher ranks, complete mini challenges, or recover Golden Scarabs. If you're not well equipped and your reflexes suck, however, the Pirate Stage boss will have you spitting teeth.</p>
<figure><a title="Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157838/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ragebound’s plotting is heavy compared to the games of old, with regular cutscenes and dialogue exchanges between an incredibly broad cast of characters. It takes place in parallel to 1988's Ninja Gaiden, with an opening prologue where you play Jō Hayabusa - Ryu Hayabusa’s father - who is defeated in battle by its end. Ryu, forced to cut the training of a young Kenji Mozu short, heads to America to avenge his father’s death, concurrent with the events of the original NES game. Kenji, the new protagonist, is left behind to defend the village from a demonic invasion, and a new adventure is on.</p>
<p>Visually, Ragebound is stunning. The locations are varied; not content with idling in the mountains of Japan, it moves with its plot, expanding into cities, subways and multi-tiered construction sites. The colour casting is exceptional, the detail incredible, and the animations fluid and sharp. Your demon adversaries, punched through in bursts of blood and an occasional decapitation, lie dispatched on the ground while severed limbs of the opposing clan spin through the air. While most sprites are relatively small, they come imbued with bags of visual personality and an undying coolness.</p>
<figure><a title="Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157842/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The aesthetic is cartoonier than Sega’s forthcoming Shinobi: Art of Vengeance, but well suits the series canon. Fire rages, waterfalls cascade, rain patters, and sunsets set. The entire thing, from end to end, is a feast for the eyes, roaming across glades, through pitfall-filled caverns, ominous bio-factories, and decorated corporate headquarters. Complimenting the visuals is a terrific score, its rock-cinematic soundtrack oft recalling historical Ninja Gaiden motifs.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it plays fantastically, too, thanks to limber mechanics and finely crafted stage designs. The combat doesn’t feel overburdened, even when your options extend during the game. Combining simplicity with depth, you have a straightforward slash and a “Guillotine Slash”, which is performed in the air by tapping the jump button a second time, encircling Kenji. The Guillotine Slash not only kills or damages an enemy, but allows you to spring off of them, effectively a double jump. You can ping off of almost anything that can hurt you, chaining hops across Shuriken, fireballs, and thick enemy skulls; and the added height will boost you toward overhead platform apparatus. Depending on your prowess, you can make Ragebound look incredibly good, snapping about the scenery and dispatching enemies with a variety of imaginative mixups.</p>
<figure><a title="Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157839/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Kenji can power-up at will by using a moderate portion of health, affording him a hyper strike that cuts through armoured enemies. Alternatively, this same single-use power-up is carried by certain demons, denoted by a glowing aura, who are almost always paired on-screen with larger, shielded foes. This creates a nice cadence where you bounce and strike for the aura, power-up, and then violently cut through the bigger foe like butter. Additionally, Kenji can slide-strike from a dash by using the shoulder button in tandem, and, crucially, roll safely through incoming dangers.</p>
<p>Checkpoints litter the fairly large stages, which are split down into substages, and act as respawn points for dishonourable defeat. During your travels you collect Golden Scarabs that can be traded at the shop for Talismans, granting you new abilities. Only two can be equipped at a time, adding a strategic but flexible dimension to the gameplay; and with useful properties like replenishing your health whenever you pass a checkpoint, or increasing your attack power when close to death, they’re indispensable.</p>
<p>Bosses are brilliantly done; often giant, monstrous things that not only look superb, but deploy proper, sequenced attack patterns. Here, your skills - rolling, guillotine slashing, and powering up - are exercised in clever ways, and it feels rewarding to flex Kenji's skill catalogue. Slaying twin serpents over a river of blood is a wonderfully intense skirmish, and requires absolute pattern memorisation and all of your attributes to best.</p>
<figure><a title="Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157836/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound is anywhere between three to six hours in length depending on your ability, but it’s not until around the hour mark that things fundamentally shift, switching characters from Kenji to Kumori, a Black Spider Clan Kunoichi. A ranged character, she throws blades in four directions and is incredibly fun to play. Neater still, she ends up not just siding with Kenji, making for interestingly hostile banter, but combines with his body. For the remainder of the game you are graced with both character’s properties, long and short range powers combined. This adds several new quirks, requiring you to use each character's abilities to tag specific colour-coded, aura-wielding enemies, and a new Rage Meter that can destroy every on-screen adversary or bat chunks from a boss’s health bar.</p>
<p>From this point, things get really inventive. There are junctures where Kenji must give over control to Kumori, who in spirit form has a brief window to execute a series of movements, skipping and teleporting, to reach a hidden item, switch, or trigger to allow you to continue through the stage. Her energy meter ticks down rapidly, meaning she can make scant few errors in completing the task. Failure doesn’t result in death, but a return to Kenji’s body to start over. It’s not an entirely novel device, but does add new definition to an already well-thought-out game; and, along with arcade-like motorbike chases down subway tunnels, infiltrating Pirate Caves, and hitching rides on helicopters, it’s impressive how much variety The Game Kitchen have crammed into the adventure.</p>

<p>So where's the rub? Sadly, the frame rate just isn’t holding 30fps on the Switch 1, even when docked, with judders when there are as few as three on-screen enemies. It’s a shame, since the Switch can ably handle this. It's no dealbreaker, but it's irritating, and hopefully it will be rectified in a future update.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound is the kind of game that makes you want improve. Chaining death with balletic grace feels so liberating that you don’t want to be interrupted in your flow. The way it implements all of its mechanics, along with increasingly interesting, beautiful, and ever-taut stage design, is a treat, and a truly linear arcade-style DLC would be a blessing should one ever transpire. While some Talismans can be purchased to actually make the game harder, the base challenge will certainly test you. It's a real shame about that frame-rate judder, but in terms of seductive 2D Ninja action, it lands squarely on catlike feet. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance</a>, you have been challenged to a duel.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>WWE&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Earth Defense Force&nbsp;</em>developer Yuke's has acquired Japanese visual novel-focused studio Aquaplus, best known for games like&nbsp;<em>To Heart</em>,&nbsp;<em>Utawarerumono</em>, and&nbsp;<em>White Album</em>.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/toheart-developer-aquaplus-to-be-acquired-by-wwf-smack-down-and-edf-developer-yukes/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>, Yuke's announced the acquisition via its official Japanese website earlier today. The deal, which cost Yuke's around 784 million yen (around $5.3 million), also includes F.I.X. Records, a music label under Aquaplus' stewardship.</p>

<p>Naturally, as is customary in the corporate world, Yuke's is looking to leverage Aquaplus' expertise in the visual novel area in order to reach a new audience, and it'll be putting some of its own development heft behind the studio's ongoing projects.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/yukes-aquaplus-acquisition-white-album.jpg?itok=fuRG2VEn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/yukes-aquaplus-acquisition-white-album.jpg?itok=X8Z7oajZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Aquaplus is best known for visual novels like&nbsp;<em>White Album</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with Aquaplus, it's a Japanese visual novel-centric studio that's also responsible for the Leaf label, under which the company has published games like 1998's&nbsp;<em>White Album&nbsp;</em>and 1997's&nbsp;<em>To Heart</em>.</p>

<p>The aforementioned&nbsp;<em>White Album&nbsp;</em>was unavailable outside of Japan between its original 1998 release and 2023, when it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legendary-visual-novel-white-album-finally-coming-to-steam-with-official-english" rel="nofollow">released for PC via Steam in the West</a>, complete with an all-new official localization.</p>

<p><em>ToHeart</em>, meanwhile, was remade earlier this year for PC and Switch, and the new version boasts all-new 3D scenes, improved visuals and gameplay, and a new set of voiceovers, although you can also choose to switch to the original cast if you prefer.</p>

<p>As for Yuke's, you probably know the studio's name best from the&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K&nbsp;</em>series, for which it was responsible between its inception in 2000 through to 2018, at which point 2K subsidiary Visual Concepts took over the series (with what can best be described as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wwe-2k20-ps4-refunds-being-issued-to-unhappy-customers" rel="nofollow">mixed results to start with</a>).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wwe-2k18-yukes-aquaplus.jpg?itok=TTV6fN4N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wwe-2k18-yukes-aquaplus.jpg?itok=7_Y1SvRD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yuke's stewarded the&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K&nbsp;</em>franchise until 2018.</figcaption></figure><p>Following the&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K&nbsp;</em>franchise switching to Visual Concepts, Yuke's worked on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/aew-game-reveals-2-new-wrestlers-officially-named-aew-fight-forever" rel="nofollow">the official AEW tie-in game&nbsp;<em>AEW: Fight Forever</em></a>, and the studio is also responsible for this year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/double-dragon-revive-announcement" rel="nofollow">upcoming beat-'em-up&nbsp;<em>Double Dragon Revive</em></a>.</p>

<p>You may also know Yuke's from its work on the&nbsp;<em>Earth Defense Force&nbsp;</em>franchise; the developer worked on spinoffs like the&nbsp;<em>World Brothers&nbsp;</em>sub-series and 2019's&nbsp;<em>Iron Rain</em>.</p>

<p>Whether or not the acquisition of Aquaplus by Yuke's results in a change in either studio's operations remains to be seen, but I'd imagine it'll be business as usual. Stay tuned for more.</p>

              <p>Nintendo <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-hike-nintendo-inflation-tariffs-2000614220">quietly raised the price</a> of almost every piece of gaming hardware and accessory it sells over the weekend, with the Switch 2 itself being one of the few exceptions. <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1951281524642386119">Some experts</a> believe it’s only a matter of time before the <em>Mario Kart World</em> machine gets more expensive too, thanks to <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-preorder-tariff-price-trump-nintendo-1851775491">ongoing tariffs</a>, but for now here’s the full list of all of Nintendo’s latest price hikes on 8-year-old consoles and more that went into effect starting August 3.</p> <h2>Consoles</h2> <ul> <li>Switch Lite: $230 (was $200)</li> <li>Switch Standard: $340 (was $300)</li> <li>Switch OLED: $400 (was $350)</li> </ul> <h2>Controllers</h2> <ul> <li>NES Switch Online: $70 (was $60)</li> <li>SNES Switch Online: $30 (was $35</li> <li>Genesis Switch Online: $55 (was $50)</li> <li>N64 Switch Online: $55 (was $50)</li> <li>GameCube Switch Online: $70 (was $65)</li> <li>Switch 1 Joy-Con: $90 (was $80)</li> <li>Switch 1 Pro: $80 (was $70)</li> <li>Switch 2 Joy-Con: $95 (was $90)</li> <li>Switch 2 Pro: $90 (was $85)</li> </ul> <h2>Other accessories</h2> <ul> <li>Amiibo: $20 (was $16)</li> <li>Switch 2 Dock: $125 (was $120)</li> </ul> <p>The Switch 2 has escaped the latest round of price increases for now and still sits at $450. If anything, the latest move should help spur more people to upgrade now that the older consoles are closer in price and the Switch 2 is only likely to go up in price rather than down as was common in previous console generations. The impact of <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-trump-tariffs-china-nintendo-sony-1851704901">President Trump’s trade war tariffs</a> on accessories, however, is particularly rough. Controllers tend to break more quickly than the consoles themselves (especially if you have small kids). This is already the second price hike the Switch 2 Joy-Con and controller have received this year. Both are now more expensive than even the Switch 2’s priciest games. I’ll be taking extra special care of mine.</p>

			<p>Out of all the promising indie horror games both in the works and recently released, Heartworm stands out due to taking influence from Fatal Frame alongside the more usual Silent Hill and Resident Evil inspirations. This stems in part from the use of a camera as your main weapon, but also from the sense of unease and spectral enemies. Having enjoyed the demo last year, the full game is another stellar indie horror to add to the growing pantheon.</p>
<p><iframe title="Heartworm | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t-ckqEK89Ws?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Unlike the usual viral incident or plague of horrors, Heartworm features a far more individual and internalised narrative. Sam, mourning the loss of her grandfather, is thrust into a static-filled TV in a classic ‘isekai’ story and finds herself confronting traumatic memories and environments constructed from her worst fears and insecurities. This all adds up to a horror that is concerned with trauma and grief rather than conspiracies and secretive institutions – another way in which Heartworm is far closer to Silent Hill than Resident Evil.</p>


<p>The aesthetic of Heartworm is clearly inspired by the crunchy polygons of the original PlayStation and that graphical style is absolutely perfectly suited to both the survival horror genre and the nostalgic tone of this game in particular. There is an option to activate a graphical smoother, but this feels like a betrayal of the developer’s visual intention to my eyes. Backgrounds are often atmospherically indistinct, but there is a good variety of locations from abandoned schools and hospitals to a disorientating hedge maze.</p>


<p>Sam is far from the usual survival horror protagonist. Neither a highly trained special forces operative nor a depressed divorced dad, instead she is a smart and witty character who takes incredible events in her stride but is clearly working through some difficult memories. Her hipster appearance makes her ideally suited to a game that is in and of itself a meta study of nostalgia and the toxic way in which unresolved traumas can fester and become dangerously all-consuming.</p>
<p>Your camera is the only weapon at your disposal and is used to fend off enemies, but fighting is mostly a last resort outside of boss encounters and certain foes that trap you in a ring of rocks. Instead you’ll mostly find that running from monsters is the most effective and efficient approach – theres are the traditional limitations on ammo and resources here. There is a burst mod accessory you can attach to your camera, though it feels as if more should have been included to vary your offence. When using your camera, the perspective switches to an over-the-shoulder one which makes aiming more accurate and contrasts nicely with the traditional fixed camera perspective of the rest of the game.</p>

<p>The fixed camera perspective works in setting the mood and tone whilst traditional tank controls work perfectly – although modern options are available for those with an aversion to them. My only real complaint with the camera is that the view is a little too zoomed out and it can be difficult to make out what is happening at times. This was exacerbated when playing on Steam Deck; it works fin, but I found navigation easier on the larger screen, especially in some of the darker environments.</p>
<p>Exploring the various areas in the game involves the usual mixture of puzzles, locked doors, and riddles to solve. Whilst many of these are very traditional they are all well judged and offer the right amount of challenge and difficulty. Making sure that you collect all notes is essential as clues are hidden throughout them, from keywords to number combinations and even, in one memorable case, a sequence of keys to play on a piano. Navigating each zone is helped by an easily read map, which also features a welcome visual cue as to whether a room is completed, but I did find the wilderness level with its similar looking routes more difficult to navigate than the more contained urban environments.</p>

<p>The most memorable moments in Heartworm are some thrilling boss battles against horrific foes ranging from giant spiders (thankfully there is an arachnophobia toggle) and mutated deer to a nightmarish being made entirely of unspooled VHS tapes. These battles will test your reactions and movement as well as involving some puzzle elements. As resources are limited you’ll find it useful to hoard some healing items for these encounters in particular. Whilst there is a limited inventory I never found this to be an issue as items are usually picked up and used relatively close together. The exceptions here are some items that I never found a use for, which may well be linked to a secret ending.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Heartworm is another top notch indie horror to add to the collection and one that perhaps feels the closest to the games that clearly influence it. The mixture of Fatal Frame combat and Silent Hill gameplay is perfectly judged and the end result is a game that not only pays homage to the classics but deserves to be considered amongst them.	</p></div>

			<p>A new Stellar Blade patch is now available on PC, introducing Photo Mode improvements as well as gameplay, cutscenes, and AMD FSR fixes and changes.</p>



<p>The 1.3.0 patch, which has gone live today, focuses on further polishing the PC version of the game released in June, and thus doesn't introduce any significant new features. Among the changes introduced by the patch is a Photo Mode improvement which displays a logo control indicator when selecting a logo, fixes for a variety of issues, including an issue that prevented players from exiting the shop after purchasing the Polarized Sunglasses from Clyde's shop, an issues where Eve's hair would not appear during the final Elder Naytibe cutscene when wearing the Fluffy Bear or Pink Bear outfits, Korean voice acting issues in a specific conversation with Clyde in the Great Desert and more. The new patch also changes AMD FSR so that players now need to restart the game to enable frame generation, and improves the save timestamp system so that the time since the last save is accurately displayed based on successful saves and not attempted saves. You can head over <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3489700/view/535482242423588652?l=english">here</a> to check out the full patch notes.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade made its debut on PC one year after its launch on PlayStation 5 and it was, by all accounts, a rather successful launch, thanks to a solid port that runs well on many different system configurations. Though the port didn't need any major fixes, Shift Up supported the PC version wellafter launch with a few patches, including patch <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-1-20-patch-hard-mode-improves-vram/">1.2.0</a>, which introduced plenty of improvements and unlocked Hard Mode without completing the game first.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the solid action RPG developed by Shift Up by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">review.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bioshock-remake-reportedly-canceled-as-bioshock-4-struggles.1261425/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to a new report, a&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>remake that was in development at publisher 2K has been canceled, and the long-awaited&nbsp;<em>BioShock 4&nbsp;</em>is currently struggling due to problems with its story.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, a remake of the original&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>was being developed at 2K Games, although which development subsidiary was to handle the project is unclear. That's moot now, though, of course, since the project has been shut down.</p>

<p>Not only that, but <i>BioShock 4</i>, which was announced all the way back in late 2019 (and which has been rumored to take place in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-4-rumored-to-be-set-in-1960s-antarctica" rel="nofollow">Antarctica in the 1960s</a>), has run into its own spot of bother, with senior 2K executives reportedly unhappy with the direction of the game's story.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bioshock-remake-canceled-big-daddy.jpg?itok=gPy7-qSH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bioshock-remake-canceled-big-daddy.jpg?itok=_5EMe5sX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>An in-development&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>remake has apparently been canceled.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Schreier's report, a recent internal review concerning&nbsp;<em>BioShock 4&nbsp;</em>at 2K resulted in executives expressing dismay with the narrative chosen by developer Cloud Chamber, although it's not clear exactly what they were displeased with.</p>

<p>As a result of that review, however, Kelley Gilmore was ousted from her role at the top of Cloud Chamber, and Hogarth de la Plante, who was previously serving as&nbsp;<em>BioShock 4</em>'s creative director, will now serve in what Schreier calls "a publishing role".</p>

<p>Additionally, Cloud Chamber staffers were reportedly told by 2K that their studio needs to become "more agile and efficient" (that's Bloomberg's wording), which sounds like prime corporate speak for impending staff cuts.</p>

<p>2K told Bloomberg that while the current iteration of&nbsp;<em>BioShock 4&nbsp;</em>is "good", the publisher is "committed to delivering a great [game]", and that it's currently "working closely with [Cloud Chamber] leadership" to achieve this goal.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bioshock-remake-canceled-infinite.jpg?itok=v2_teEk0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bioshock-remake-canceled-infinite.jpg?itok=oTFgO7BY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>BioShock Infinite&nbsp;</em>remains the last mainline entry in the&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>series for now.</figcaption></figure><p>Since&nbsp;<em>BioShock 4&nbsp;</em>is struggling and the&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>remake has been canned, it looks like&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>fans' next great hope is&nbsp;<em>Judas</em>, Ken Levine and Ghost Story Games' upcoming narrative FPS.</p>

<p>Sadly, that game doesn't have a release date yet, so for now, it seems as though you'll have to content yourself with replaying the existing&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>games. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>August 2025 now has as many <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a> developer diaries as there are modern <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> reimaginings: two, which in both cases remains a weirdly high number.

<p>Perhaps most emblematic of this approach is the (re?)addition of Sutch, a city near Cyrodiil’s western coast that Bethesda planned for OG Oblivion before cutting it – save for the tiny ruin of Fort Sutch, which you can visit in both the original and the remaster – late in development. Skyblivion recreates it as a far bigger, if still largely wrecked, castle town that’s been occupied by bandit bastards, and which you’ll be able to explore in full.</p>
<p>A short walk south, the more familiar city of Anvil looks to have grown considerably, its central harbour now sitting in a much wider basin with added docks and market areas. Daedric hellscape The Deadlands, meanwhile, is getting split into two biomes: one that matches the original’s lava lakes and another, stormier region inspired by the Deadlands of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online">The Elder Scrolls Online</a>.</p>
<p>Skyblivion obviously isn’t averse to making cosmetic upgrades as well. The diary also reveals new designs for several of Oblivion’s unique weapons, many of which will throw in some special animations for your trouble. I desperately hope these keep the charmingly stiff bone-janking of Skyrim, as the default animations appear to. But the video is generally eager to emphasise the more practical differences between the mod and the original, which by extension, are also differences between the mod and the remaster.</p>
<p>Personally, my interest in Skyblivion has remained intact, even with Oblivion Remastered having been announced and released in the time since this dev diary’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwUibq6wBn4">last entry</a>. This is partly because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-best-settings-pc-performance">performance headaches</a>, and that one quest where you get talked into watching someone do farm chores for six hours, made my time with the remaster unexpectedly shortlived. That said, I do like the idea of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-mod-delivers-tamrielic-teardown-by-letting-you-blow-buildings-to-bits-with-plans-for-full-blown-house-fighting">exploding houses by pointing at them</a>. I’d ask the Skyblivion team to implement something similar, but given the entire point of this diary, they probably wouldn’t be very happy about it.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/another-skyblivion-dev-diary-shows-off-the-new-dungeons-and-expanded-cities-oblivion-remastered-never-bothered-with]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We enter week one of RPS Post-Graham. The office Slack echoes like the Great Hall of Durin after a Balrog teaparty. Horace coils about the foot of the Treehouse like a sullen Viking serpent. The Maw seems peevish and incontinent, spurning any news we offer it. The wifi network keeps changing its name to "Execute Order 66".</p>
<p>It is time to smash the emergency glass and bust out a few favourites from my personal collection of morale-boosting videogame intros. Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qtb4uow940c">Red Alert</a>, to put some spring in your step; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLMLXfwUJrk">Okami</a> to let the light in; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fd_6SYW2xwA">Colony Wars</a> for the WRAAAOW noise at the end. And here are this week's most interesting new PC games.</p><!--more-->

<p>As for what RPS staff are up to this week - I started late and missed the morning all-hands meeting, so I have no choice but to make it all up. James is trying to invent new buzzwords for graphics cards, each buzzier and wordier than the last. He's got as far as "polymorphotovoltaic processing" and shows no sign of showing down. Ollie has embarked on his magnum opus, a guide to Life. Jeremy has been reading too much Goldilocks and Proust and is lost in a series of flashbacks, each defined by the temperature of a particular bowl of porridge. Mark is engaged in an epic war against his neighbours, the Ice Giants, who have been trimming the hedge on his side again.</p></div>

                <p>Chances are that, if you’re new to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox-game-client/" data-ref-id="5000-451936">Roblox</a>, you won’t know your Obby from your elbow. That’s okay, though, as everyone has to start somewhere, and a beginner’s guide such as this one is exactly what you need.</p><p>Here, you’ll find everything you need to get started in the world of Roblox, from how to set up an account, how to customize your avatar, what Robux are and how to use them, and a list of some of the genres of experiences you’ll find on this platform (including the aforementioned Obby-style games).</p><p>Once you’re familiar with the basics, we have a list of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-roblox-games/2900-6830/" data-ref-id="2900-6830">best Roblox games</a>, which is constantly updated with fresh and immensely popular experiences. As Roblox is geared primarily towards children, we also have an explainer detailing whether<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-roblox-safe/1100-6533600/" data-ref-id="1100-6533600"> Roblox is safe</a> for your little ones to play and how to safeguard them against potential threats.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4541326-roblox-beginners-guide-sign-up.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4541326" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4541326-roblox-beginners-guide-sign-up.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4541326"></a><figcaption>This is how the Roblox website looks when you visit it on your PC for the first time.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4541326-roblox-beginners-guide-sign-up.jpg"></figure><h2 id="How_to_set_up_a_Roblox_account">How to set up a Roblox account</h2><p>To begin your Roblox journey, visit the <a href="https://www.roblox.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official Roblox website</a> or download the app from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Make sure it’s the correct one if you’re downloading it on your mobile device, with Roblox Corporation as the company name below it. Those with existing accounts can log in via the button at the top right of the screen on the website accessed via a PC or the Sign In button at the bottom of the app screen. For new users on the app, tap 'Create Account' to get started.</p><p>Creating an account is as simple as entering your birthday, a username that doesn’t include your real name or anything rude, and a password. You can also enter your gender, but this is optional. When deciding on a password, it’s important to create one that’s robust. After all, you don’t want someone else accessing your account! Roblox requires that your password be eight characters long, but you may want to throw in some numbers in place of letters. For example, if you want the password to be “PlayObbyGames”, you can replace some of the letters with numbers and symbols: something like “P1@y0bbyG@m35” where the As are @ symbols, and O’s, L’s, E’s, and S’s are zeroes, ones, threes, and fives.</p><p>When you first load up the app, you’ll be greeted with a list of the most popular games on the platform. You’ll find that, on subsequent visits, you’ll also see a list of games you’ve already started playing with the option to continue playing. On the mobile app, you can enter any experience you want and play immediately, but on the PC, you need to download the Roblox client. To start an experience on your PC, press the play icon on a game’s page, and you’ll find detailed instructions to install the Roblox app. Log in to your account and try starting the game from here to begin playing!</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4541327-roblox-beginners-guide-navigating-app.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4541327" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4541327-roblox-beginners-guide-navigating-app.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4541327"></a><figcaption>Once you've signed up and logged in, you are greeted with a screen full of games to play.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4541327-roblox-beginners-guide-navigating-app.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Navigating_the_Roblox_app">Navigating the Roblox app</h2><p>You’re probably eager to start a game, and who wouldn’t be? However, there are several tabs and buttons you should at least check out first. The first is the Charts tab, where you can find the best experiences to play right now. Most of them are free to play, but also include either microtransactions that require Robux, or the use of in-game currency or time to play to their fullest. Incidentally, whenever you see a recommendation from us, it’ll include what kind of in-game purchases are present and whether or not you need to pay to play them to the fullest.</p><p>We’ll go over the Create and Robux tabs in the next section, but for now, let’s focus on the rest of the options available. Aside from the rather self-explanatory messages and friends sections, the inventory tab allows you to view all the items bought or redeemed via the Marketplace. Avatar allows you to change your Roblox character’s appearance, including a handy viewing tool to see your design in 3D. If there are any free or gift items available in the Marketplace, the Blog tab is the best place to find them. You can also view any public forums or get notifications of in-game events for games you play via the Communities tab.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4541328-roblox-beginners-guide-robux.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4541328" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4541328-roblox-beginners-guide-robux.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4541328"></a><figcaption>Every currency worth its salt must have a distinctive icon, and Robux is no exception.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4541328-roblox-beginners-guide-robux.jpg"></figure><h2 id="What_are_Robux_">What are Robux?</h2><p>Robux is Roblox’s internal currency. It’s used to buy cosmetic outfit pieces from the Marketplace or to get items exclusive to specific games. You’ll likely see many experiences with dedicated hubs in a game’s world, asking for either a one-off payment or a subscription to get shortcuts or unique items to get the most out of it.</p><p>Robux is highly valued across the platform’s developers as a source of real-world income. Every game in Roblox is made via the Create tab and comes with a free-to-use app called Roblox Studio. From there, you can use the app to make whatever you want. In turn, this has led to some developers of the most popular experiences making a living from their in-game experiences via the Developer Exchange (DevEx) program via Game Passes, Developer Products, and in-game ads/sponsorships.</p><p>You can purchase Robux in many different ways. The simplest is to use the Robux tab and buy directly using your profile. You can also sign up for Roblox Premium for a subscription fee, which gives you 1,000 Robux each month. Alternatively, the Official Store tab links to the Roblox page on Amazon, where buying Robux also gives you free and exclusive avatar items, as well as books for learning how to develop in Roblox Studio and plenty of Roblox-themed PC gaming accessories. Finally, the Gift Cards page allows anyone to pass on Robux to a friend.</p><p>A word of warning, though. The very nature of Robux means that there is the potential for financial scams. No matter what someone offers, always remember the mantra: if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4541330-roblox-beginners-guide-controls.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4541330" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4541330-roblox-beginners-guide-controls.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4541330"></a><figcaption>Games like Tower of Hell will test your skills to the limit when it comes to mastering the Roblox controls.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4541330-roblox-beginners-guide-controls.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Roblox_controls">Roblox controls</h2><p>If you’re playing on a PC, the default keys are WASD for movement (that’s up, left, right, and down, respectively), as well as the space bar to jump. Finally, holding down the right mouse button while moving the mouse rotates the camera.</p><p>Those on mobile devices will probably have a slightly easier time working out the controls for themselves, but you’ll see a virtual stick that you can drag to move around the screen, and a separate jump button. Dragging anywhere else on the screen will rotate the camera.</p><p>Climbing ladders is usually as simple as walking up them, but some experiences may ask you to press a button to climb or descend. If any game has an interactable element to it, you can do so by left-clicking on it with your mouse or tapping it on your phone.</p><p>To exit any experience, press the Esc key on your keyboard and click the Leave Game button. In the app, you need to tap the Roblox icon at the top left of the screen and tap Leave.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4541331-roblox-beginners-guide-genres.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4541331" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4541331-roblox-beginners-guide-genres.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4541331"></a><figcaption>This skateboarding game is an example of what an Obby is: carefully crafted obstacle courses to test your abilities.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4541331-roblox-beginners-guide-genres.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Types_of_Roblox_games">Types of Roblox games</h2><p>Many Roblox games fall into similar categories to those of other video games on the market. However, some lesser-known genres show up more often in Roblox, and even a couple of exclusive ones you won’t find anywhere else.</p><p>Here are all the less common Roblox game genres:</p><ul><li><strong>Battlegrounds</strong> - these are fighting games where players are dumped into an arena and brawl until one is left. The main difference between this and a Battle Royale game, such as Fortnite, is that there’s no circle slowly closing in, shrinking the play area.</li><li><strong>Dress Up</strong> - any experience that has you either buy or use in-game accessories to dress up your avatar.</li><li><strong>Escape Room</strong> - involves solving cryptic puzzles to get out of a single room.</li><li><strong>Idle</strong> - usually requires minimal or zero player input to unlock stuff, merely requiring your in-game time.</li><li><strong>Incremental Simulator</strong> - typically, these games have you perform a menial task, such as running races, lifting weights, or tapping a counter to unlock progress.</li><li><strong>Obby</strong> - these are platform games where the aim is to complete an ever-increasingly difficult set of obstacle courses.</li><li><strong>RPs</strong> - not to be confused with RPGs, the idea of this genre is to inhabit a persona and live that character as if they were you. This includes going to the shops, driving around in cars, and hanging out with friends.</li><li><strong>Scavenger Hunt</strong> - a variant on adventure games where you need to find and collect specific objects.</li><li><strong>Shopping</strong> - experiences where you can buy items. This can include digital or real-life goods, and sometimes the stores are for real-life brands such as Ikea or Nike. Can also have items that your avatar can use.</li><li><strong>Showcase Hubs</strong> - experiences designed to show off an environment, or as a portal to games made by the creator. These will physically teleport you to different experiences when interacting with said portals, rather than loading the game page.</li><li><strong>Story</strong> - these are narrative experiences which convey a series of events the creator wishes to tell. They usually feature very little gameplay.</li><li><strong>Tower Defense</strong> - these exist outside of Roblox, but are extremely popular here. The idea is to prevent waves of enemies from destroying your base by building and upgrading defensive units.</li><li><strong>Tycoon</strong> - manage your shop, farm, or other business to get items to “sell” to droppers and make money to unlock more features. These are a bit rare these days, but games like Grow A Garden are a potential sign of a comeback.</li></ul>

                <p>A new survey by Nintendo has gone live, as the company wants to know what its users think of physical and digital game ownership. While there are a few general questions mixed into it, the survey primarily focuses on which format consumers prefer when purchasing games for the Switch 2.</p><p><a href="https://nintendoofamerica.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_e54yuThgl5J1nnM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">There are various questions asked in this survey</a> on this topic specifically, asking which factors determine if a digital game will be purchased instead of a physical one, while users can respond with multiple replies like "physical games provide a stronger sense of ownership" or "I like collecting physical games" when pressed for answers.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4542594-switch-2-survey.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542594" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4542594-switch-2-survey.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542594"></a><figcaption>One of the questions asked in the Nintendo survey.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4542594-switch-2-survey.jpg"></figure><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/certain-nintendo-switch-2-physical-games-are-game-key-cards-for-downloads/1100-6530576/">Game-Key Cards</a> have been controversial since they were introduced, as the vast majority of Switch 2 games have adopted this new medium for physical releases. In essence, they're key-authentication cartridges that still require you to download the full game to your Switch 2 system, and once completed, the cartridge must remain inside the console if you want to continue to play the game in question. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-wont-be-tied-to-your-account/1100-6530654/">The good news is that these cartridges aren't tied to your console</a>, so you can resell them if you want.</p><p>On the other hand, this has opened up the floor to criticism, as users have pointed out that ownership of these games is entirely reliant on Nintendo keeping its servers running. Considering that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-3ds-and-wii-u-eshop-stores-will-shut-down-march-2023/1100-6500734/">Nintendo users can no longer download Wii U or 3DS games</a> from their respective storefronts, there is legitimate cause for concern here. In case you're wondering, these <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/these-nintendo-switch-2-titles-have-the-full-game-on-the-game-card/2900-6508/">are the Switch 2 titles that have the full games on their cartridges</a>.</p><p>In response to this move from Nintendo, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/publisher-promises-its-switch-2-game-carts-will-have-full-games-on-them/1100-6531469/">Limited Run Games said that nearly all of its games</a> will be "true" physical releases and will contain the full game on the cartridge, but there will be some exceptions to this pledge.</p>

            <p>
There's great news if you've been looking forward to smacking Captain America in the face. Guilty Gear developer Arc System Works has announced PlayStation 5 closed beta dates for its upcoming superhero tag team fighter Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls.
</p>
<p>
Announced back in June, Marvel Tōkon is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-is-a-superhero-tag-team-fighter-launching-next-year">bringing 4v4 superhero battling to PS5 and PC</a>, with players able to fight as "reimagined" versions of classic characters including Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Doctor Doom, Storm, Ms. Marvel, Star-Lord, and Ghost Rider. Each has a bespoke set of attacks inspired by their comic book abilities and powers, and there's also talk of varied stages, "intuitive" gameplay mechanics, and more.
</p>
<p>
And it turns out PlayStation 5 owners don't have too long to wait before they can put Marvel Tōkon through its paces. Arc System Works has confirmed the fighter's console-only closed beta runs from 5th-7th September, and registration is open now.

<p>
According to <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls/#closed-beta/">PlayStation's sign-up page</a>, players who're selected to participate in Marvel Tōkon's upcoming closed beta will have access to six playable fighters - specifically Captain America, Iron Man, Ms. Marvel, Star-Lord, Storm, and Doctor Doom - and will be able to battle across three areas of the Marvel's New York City stage. Also included is a chibi-inspired 64-player lobby, a Spectator Mode, and a tutorial mode.
</p>
<p>
Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls doesn't yet have a release date but it's due to arrive on PlayStation 5 and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store) sometime next year. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-is-heading-to-evo-with-first-playable-build-and-gameplay-deep-dive">recently showed up at EVO 2025</a> and first impressions have been positive.

<figure><a title="Nintendo Music" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/91fb6f12f0df5/nintendo-music.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has rolled out its latest update for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> mobile app, and the biggest change seems to be the arrival of "some features" for anyone who let their Nintendo Switch Online membership expire.</p>
<p>That "some features" all sounds pretty mysterious, doesn't it? Well, that's exactly how the Big N phrases it in the ver. 1.3.0 patch notes, only detailing the ability for expired subs to "delete their personal playlists". It's likely that there are more additions for those without a membership anymore (this is "feature<em>s</em>", plural, after all), but we're still looking for them.</p>
<p>An active Nintendo Switch Online membership is still required to get started on the app and to actually listen to the music, but at least you'll be able to prune your playlists if you let your membership expire and you're yet to renew.</p>
<p>There are a couple of other tweaks besides this in the latest update, with the new version improving app functionality for particularly beefy playlists, and cleaning up the overall user experience. You'll find the full patch notes (via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nintendo-music/id6466376604">Apple App Store</a>) below:</p>
<h2>Nintendo Music Ver. 1.3.0 (4th August 2025)</h2>
<p>・ We have improved functionality when large numbers of tracks are added to favorites or playlists.</p>
<p>・ Some functions, such as playlist deletion, will continue to be available to Nintendo Music users who cancel their Nintendo Switch Online memberships.</p>
<p>・ We have addressed some issues in order to provide you with a better user experience.</p>

              <p>Nintendo has been contacting some customers with a survey link, asking questions that are primarily focused on people’s thoughts about physical versus digital games, and especially the Switch 2’s game carts that <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-key-card-game-cart-physical-list-confirmed-1851777742">don’t actually contain the game</a>. The <a href="https://nintendoofamerica.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_e54yuThgl5J1nnM">link for the survey</a> is being <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1mgrkzm/here_is_nintendos_survey_about_physical_and/">widely shared</a>, and while it’s not clear if Nintendo will properly log responses from those who weren’t deliberately contacted, the company is sure to notice the sheer volume of attention it’s receiving.</p> <p>“Imagine you are purchasing a new Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2 game for yourself,” the survey asks at one point before describing different ways publisher distributes games. These include, “Physical, requiring digital download,” which is described as, “The physical cartridge allows the download of a full digital game to the console. The cartridge must be inserted into the console to play the game. The cartridge can be shared and resold.” People can then respond to this notion with options ranging from “Definitely would buy” to “Definitely would not buy.” Whichever you choose, it’ll ask you why you made that decision, with a box to type your answer into. It then asks the same of buying games for others as gifts. “Because I don’t want to buy someone the idea of a game,” a person might type.</p> <p>The Switch 2’s “game key cards” have proven extremely controversial since the notion was announced. Last week’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-key-cards-persona-3-octopath-1851787455">desultory Nintendo Direct re-ignited this frustration</a>, with a series of previously revealed games that people struggled to find enthusiasm for, made worse by the knowledge that so many would be game key cards–in other words, fake carts that simply contain an instruction for the console to download the game from the eStore.</p>

 <p>It’s tempting to view the game key cards as a step up from digital purchases, given you now have at least a physical object that can be resold or shared, and to some extent that’s true. However, it remains a hugely bad deal for customers, given that the cart will only work for as long as Nintendo maintains the servers it connects to. And given all of gaming history, that’s inevitably nowhere near as long as anyone would hope. As such, unlike your Game Boy cartridges from 1989 that will still work just as well today, all of these gameless key cards will be useless pieces of plastic in maybe twenty years’ time.</p> <p>As a result, people are leaping on this survey to express their views about this. Clearly Nintendo is aware it’s an issue, given that the survey is dominated by this topic. However, it’s unclear whether unsolicited responses will be counted by the company when survey company Qualtrics hands over the results. Even though the URL can be stripped of all its identifying details, there’s a chance it will still look for an ID that isn’t there and not count the response. But, and it’s a crucial but, given the attention this survey is now getting, and the press coverage responding to that, it’s impossible that Nintendo won’t at the very least notice the level of reaction. Heck, it’s all we’ve got. It seems worth a try.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Nintendo is running a survey to find out how its community feels about physical and digital games.</p>
<p>The survey itself begins by asking participants which consoles they have in their homes, with the likes of Xbox and PlayStation also featured, before moving on to Nintendo specific questions.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>These questions include how many Nintendo Switch games have been purchased for others, as well as for the participants themselves. The survey also inquires how many Switch games the user has sold on, before getting to perhaps the most topical questions regarding Nintendo games right now:</p>
<p><strong>In general, when it comes to games for a Nintendo Switch system, do you prefer purchasing games in physical format or in digital format?</strong></p>
<p>And:</p>
<p><strong>For which of the following reasons would you consider purchasing physical versions of Nintendo Switch games?</strong></p>
<p>Users can reply with answers such as "I like collecting physical games", or "it's easier to gift physical games to others". There is also an option here that reads: "Physical games provide a stronger sense of ownership."</p>
<p>Many have voiced their opinions on social media about Nintendo's move to having predominantly game-key cards for their third-party <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> releases. These game-key cards look incredibly similar to Switch cartridges, however, rather than storing the game data itself, these require users to download a digital version of the game. Once the download is finished, <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68415/kw/switch%202">the same card must remain inserted in the console to then launch the game</a>.</p>
<p>This was meant to act like a halfway house between a purely digital 'code in a box' download, and a fully physical game release, as there is still something tangible about the key-card.</p>
<p>However, this pivot to key-cards has raised concerns about game preservation and ownership, as they are dependent on Nintendo's servers and support from Nintendo itself. In April of this year, CEO of remaster specialists Nightdive Studios Stephen Kick called Nintendo's move to key-cards "a little disheartening" to witness.</p>
<p>"You would hope that a company that big, that has such a storied history, would take preservation a little more seriously," <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/seeing-nintendo-do-this-is-a-little-disheartening-switch-2-and-the-state-of-game-preservation-in-2025">Kick said to Eurogamer's sister site GamesIndustry.biz</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, following last week's Nintendo Direct, a partner showcase, many dubbed it the 'Key-Card Direct' or <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1950954931621630231">'Nintendo Game-Key Card Partner Showcase'</a>, <a href="https://x.com/orbalology/status/1950942967344304586">lamenting the lack of <em>physical </em>physical media</a>. Now, though, the Nintendo community has the chance to share its thoughts with the Switch 2 maker in a more official way, thanks to the survey. <a href="https://nintendoofamerica.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_e54yuThgl5J1nnM?key=f2ff4cc19b9b3818&amp;cid=BAPSurveys&amp;eid=BAPSurvey0730_0127&amp;crmid=095575FC-0293-4888-8F7A-DD6D22045DA4">You can find a link to Nintendo's survey, and make your voice heard, here</a>.</p>

<p>And it's still releasing this year, according to Nintendo!</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>We are all pretty excited for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a>'s arrival at this stage, we think you'll agree. In fact, apart from the ever-elusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a>, we can't think of another game that's got us biting on our furniture as we wait for further information about when we can actually play the bleddy thing again, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-metroid-prime-4-beyond-on-switch-2-is-staggering">we loved it so much first time around</a>. Deep breaths.</p>
<p>Now though, Nintendo has just gone and casually announced that lucky gamers who happen to be attending <a href="https://fanexpohq.com/fanexpocanada/buy-tickets/#multi-day-tier-2">Fan Expo Canada</a> at the end August, will be able to get a hands-on and play the game. They've also, just casually mind, reconfirmed that Samus' latest outing will see a release in the year of our lord 2025. Which is the same year that we are currently in. Hooray for that!</p>
<p>Yes, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/whatsnew/fan-expo-canada-attendees-will-have-access-to-play-the-latest-and-upcoming-titles-on-nintendo-switch-2/?srsltid=AfmBOooPAAaf2Y9seC-9Ow9iIqy8VogVNAAEYA4UWFML6gxabbcr3B07">over on their official website</a>, (cheers, <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/08/04/nintendo-confirms-metroid-prime-4-to-be-playable-at-fan-expo-canada-and-still-due-2025/">MyNintendoNews</a>), Nintendo has had the following exciting statement to make regarding the event:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nintendo of Canada is inviting you to visit the Fan Expo Canada in Toronto, Ontario, to check out the latest—and upcoming—games for the Nintendo Switch™ 2 system.</p>
<p>Bring your friends and family to experience games like <strong>Mario Kart™ World</strong>, and the newly released <strong>Donkey Kong™ Bananza</strong>. Fan Expo attendees will be able to play upcoming games like Metroid Prime™ 4: Beyond (available later in 2025). Guests will also be able to play Nintendo’s partner titles such as <strong>Street Fighter™ 6 Years 1-2 Fighters Edition</strong>, and upcoming games Hades II, <strong>Borderlands 4</strong>and ELDEN RING Tarnished Edition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a hell of a line-up, and between some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii">Hades 2</a> action, this writer is considering booking some tickets to Toronto for the 21st of August.</p>

			<p>Nioh 3 is getting a slew of gameplay, balance, and performance improvements based on the alpha demo that was made available on PlayStation 5 for a limited time only this past June.</p>



<p>Today, Team NINJA and Koei Tecmo published an Alpha Demo Feedback Report on the game's <a href="https://teamninja-studio.com/nioh3/uk/feedback.html">official website</a>, showing the results of the survey players were asked to complete after playing the demo, and confirming some of the improvements coming to the final game based on feedback. These include control improvements to make them more responsive and adding customization options, adjusting the balance of enemies considered too difficult, improving the quality of the environment, improving visibility and balance of stages, and the open field to make exploration elements easier to understand and more well-balanced. </p>



<p>Going into more detail on some of these planned improvements, Team NINJA also plans to improve Global Illumination behavior in stages, reduce the fog in some areas, adjust elements that look as if they have a matte texture, and better optimize the game for a more stable framerate. Considering how the Japanese developer's games <a href="https://wccftech.com/rise-of-the-ronin-is-yet-another-disappointing-pc-port-from-koei-tecmo/">often leave something to be desired in terms of performance even on PC,</a> gathering feedback from PC players as well would have been beneficial, but it's sadly unlikely an alpha demo will launch on the platform.</p>



<p>Nioh 3 was announced during the now traditional <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-announced-with-action-packed-trailer-launches-in-early-2026-on-playstation-5/">PlayStation State of Play June presentation</a>. While the game may not look too different from its predecessors at a glance, the third entry in the series will set itself apart by adding a new Ninja fighting style that can be switched on the flay, and a revamped level design. Even with its issues, the alpha demo showed that the series has taken a very interesting direction that is likely to improve the already engaging formula of the franchise, combining Soulslike stamina-based combat with an intricate loot system and mechanics more akin to pure action games.</p>



<p>Nioh 3 launches in early 2026 on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Skyblivion project lead Rebelzize <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MH-BqXk2WA&amp;pp=ygUKc2t5Ymxpdmlvbg%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a> the sixth development diary for the full conversion mod project. The video is aptly titled 'The Final Stretch Toward Release', and Rebelzize assured fans that the goal is still to launch Skyblivion in 2025, as promised nearly two years ago.</p>



<p>That said, the team still needs volunteers to complete the project. Currently, they are seeking modders with expertise in scripting, quests, record editing, perks, NPC creation, level design, and 3D artists skilled in creating clothing and plant models.</p>



<p>Following this plea, the developer diary shows off the Gold Coast region, a vibrant zone located on the Western edge of Cyrodiil. The city of Anvil has been restructured around a central harbor basin, with expanded commercial, residential, and guild districts. The footage also shows Sutch, a town cut from the original Oblivion game before its release. Skyblivion restores this city to a state that balances decay and bandit occupation with expanded content, including adding a patron divine at a derelict chapel dedicated to Kynareth. Both the expansion of Anvil and the restoration of Sutch exemplify how this project differs greatly from the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, which focused on a big visual overhaul and other tweaks, without, however, touching any original content.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the total conversion mod project reconstructs the entire game with new areas, gameplay enhancements, and environmental redesigns, making it feel like a fresh experience even for long-time players of the fourth mainline Elder Scrolls installment.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>This philosophy extends to the whole game, including the titular Oblivion realms, which have been expanded and diversified. For example, the Deadlands now include two biomes: The Burn is the one seen in the original game, while The Sever is brand new and was inspired by the zone's rendition in The Elder Scrolls Online and introduces novel environmental hazards and enemy types to enhance gameplay challenge and variety. Lastly, there are now eleven randomly selectable worlds, up from seven, again in an effort to improve variety.</p>



<p>The next Skyblivion developer diary will focus on the Imperial City, the capital of Cyrodiil and the Empire as a whole.</p>

              <p>2006 action-RPG <em>Titan Quest</em> has never really gone away, thanks to a combination of DLC, re-releases, a mobile version from DotEmu, belated console ports, and expansions released as recently as 2021. It remains incredibly playable today, a game I personally return to every few years, a friendly, approachable <em>Diablo</em>-like. It turns out, however, that there’s now a sequel?! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY6yb8OoFvw">Announced a year ago</a>, but barely ever talked about,&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest II</em> entered early access Friday 1 August.</p> <p>Released almost 20 years ago in 2006,&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest</em> was the first and last project made by Iron Lore Entertainment–a studio set up by <em>Age of Empires</em>‘ co-designer Brian Sullivan–an action-RPG set within Greek and Egyptian mythology. And crucially, it was an action-RPG released midway through the enormous, aching twelve-year gap between <em>Diablo II</em> and&nbsp;<em>Diablo III</em>. It perfectly delivered a lower-intensity, more easily accessible loot-hoovering click-fest, and I dearly loved it. <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-action-rpg-blizzard-torchlight-path-of-exile-1850506636/3#content">Still love it, in fact</a>. So much so that just a few nights ago–entirely unaware that <em>Titan Quest II</em> even existed–I suggested that my 10-year-old give the original a go on his Android tablet, given the game and its many DLCs are all free on Play Pass. He’s been playing it obsessively ever since, fueled by his love of Greek mythology, his innate understanding of game systems…and his love for hitting stuff with sticks.</p> <p>It was only because of him that I even learned <em>Titan Quest II</em> existed, let alone had released into early access. He got me to start the original game over on my own tablet, and was then boasting that he was a higher level than me. Can’t have that. So I re-installed the game on my PC to see what saves I had. Sadly, everything from the original preceded even Steam, let alone cloud saves, but fortunately I at least had a low-level character still higher than his own on the <em>Tenth Anniversary Edition</em>. And in the process of putting him in his place, I noticed “<em>Titan Quest II</em>” coming up as a search result. I assumed it was some sort of wishful thinking, checked it out, and, er, it’s a thing!</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Titan Quest II | Early Access Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ikmiyR8rutw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>It’s honestly just weird not to have heard this game was coming. Even though I have a few massive gaps in my perception, as a games critic I tend to have a decent idea what’s in development–but the fact I was unaware of a sequel to one of my all-time favorite games remains just weird. Then again, a similar sentiment was shared on Reddit’s r/ARPG earlier this year, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ARPG/comments/1ja4xm5/how_in_the_hell_is_no_one_in_here_talking_about/">with a post titled</a> “How in the hell is no one here talking about <em>Titan Quest 2</em> Playtest?” No one there continued to talk about it.</p> <p>It perhaps doesn’t help that it’s nothing to do with the original game. While 2006’s&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest</em> was published by THQ, that company ceased to properly exist in 2013 when it went spectacularly bankrupt, auctioning off all its licenses. Eventually the trademark was bought by Nordic Games, the company that would go on to be called Embracer Group, and THQ Nordic remains a publishing arm that handles a lot of former THQ properties. Also, developer Iron Lore is long gone, unable to secure funding for a second game in 2008, with a bunch of the developers going on to form Crate Entertainment, creators of the wildly successful <em>Grim Dawn</em>. Instead <em>Titan Quest II</em> is developed by Grimlore Games, a studio created by Nordic Games in 2013, but that has since only released a barely noticed remake of <em>Spellforce III</em>. It’s all so strange!</p> <p>I’ve just started playing, and honestly, after barely 15 minutes, I’m delighted! This looks and feels like&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest</em>, but updated in a bunch of useful ways. I will continue on and report back in much more detail soon.</p>
