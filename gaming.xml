		<p>The SteamWorld series is a little bit like the sprawling menagerie of Pixar films. While these games share a particular steampunk style and aesthetic, developer Image &amp; Form has consistently surprised and delighted as they explore different genres and game styles with each and every game. Almost. Just like Pixar being lured back for Toy Story, Cars and Monsters Inc. sequels, SteamWorld is also returning to one of its most popular stomping grounds with SteamWorld Heist 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="SteamWorld Heist II | Extended Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-JArPke5KNk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The original SteamWorld Heist arrived in 2015, tipping the turn-based strategy XCOM-like format on its side, quite literally. Instead of having a birds eye view of proceedings, moving characters on an isometric world grid, the game switched to a side-scrolling 2D view, putting a lot more emphasis on layers and elevation, as well as player skill as opposed to percentage hit chances.</p>


<p>Truth be told, as much as I loved its core concept – enough to buy the game three or four times in various deep discount sales –&nbsp;I never actually played SteamWorld Heist for more than a few hours. I might have to try and right this wrong, after settling in for the opening of SteamWorld Heist 2.</p>
<p>Thankfully, while they share a gameplay core, SteamWorld Heist 2 tells a completely new story. Set in a fragment of a planet that’s covered in water and small islands, Steambots are being subjugated by the Royal Navy and their fleet of Dieselbots, the fresh water that they need to survive is becoming ever more scarce, with the salty sea water corroding and destroying any that resort to it.</p>


<p>Enter the hero of the piece, Captain Leeway. Well, actually he’s the one-armed son of the legendary Captain “Krakenbane” Leeway, and has struggled all his life to live up to the expectations of greatness that are heaped upon him. Also his submarine just got commandeered by the Royal Navy, and it’s halfway been stripped for parts.</p>
<p>The game’s opening sees you get to grips with the game’s take on turn-based strategy with some of Leeway’s crew –&nbsp;it was his gun-shootin’ arm that got blasted off, so he doesn’t actually do any fighting for himself. Daisy Clutch and Wesley Hotchkiss charge through the Navy’s rank and file, taking cover, ricocheting bullets, chucking grenades and more on their way to securing the sub.</p>
<p>It’s a fun opener that very quickly introduces the game’s core mechanics –&nbsp;characters have two action points, Daisy’s sniper rifle has an aim line that sways and you time your shots while Wesley’s SMG does not, and you’ll want to master bullet ricochet, spot explosive barrels and more. It also builds up to a neat crescendo of a boss encounter against Commander Batterfaux and his big shark-themed mech suit, with big AOE missile strikes that keep you moving while you chip away at it, shattering the windscreen, blasting off the fuel tank, and the like.</p>

<p>From there, missions come in several varieties, from simple ship clearing jobs to races against time as loot threatens to decay, defensive missions to survive a dozen turns, tasks to take out a particular enemy character, and more.</p>
<p>Who you take into a mission is pretty simple to decide early on – you’ve just got Daisy and Wesley until you can recruit some more –&nbsp;but as missions get bigger and your crew grows, you’ll have to choose between characters in different jobs. Brawler, Boomer, Engineer, Sniper, Reaper, and Flanker each come with their specific main weapon and skill tree to work through, but as with many RPG job systems, you’ll eventually be able to switch characters to a different job and mix and match skills and abilities. I’m looking forward to exploring this aspect more as I get deeper into the game.</p>
<p>With SteamWorld Heist 2 diving into the wet stuff, the between mission action is now a fun little sailing game as you pilot the submarine between missions, safe havens where you can rest up and grab upgrades, and battling with smaller Navy ships.</p>

<p>Cap’n Leeway’s sub has been stripped of all its good stuff by the Navy, so you (in)conveniently have to start from scratch, scavenging your first weapon and trying to get air tanks to allow you to submerge again. This ship combat is a neat little diversion with three weapon slots that automatically fire from the front, sides and top of the sub. The initial machine guns I go could blast away to either side, each salvo then needing a little cooldown before it fires again. With how manoeuvrable the submarine is –&nbsp;it practically drifts when turning – I quickly mastered a good little spin trick to fire with one side and then the other to deal with these initial Royal Navy ships in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>The sailing overworld is lovely and bright, as you peel back the clouds shrouding the gorgeously azure waters and tropical islands on the opening region – I also love the smooth jazz of the soundtrack in this area. That’s immediately contrasted with the dank and moody interiors of the submarine, ports and enemy ships you raid, though there’s plenty of nice touches to the backdrops. It’s neat to see how Image &amp; Form’s art style has evolved, retaining their long-standing aesthetic, but now seemingly using 3D models as opposed to layered digital art.</p>
<p>I’m still only bobbing on the surface of SteamWorld Heist 2 and the overarching story of Captain Leeway’s redemption arc, the Royal Navy’s incursion and other narrative threads, but there’s also all the depths of the jobs and combat to explore, and I’m keen to dive, dive, dive back in for our review.</p>

		<p>In April this year the developer Poncle announced that Vampire Survivors will be released on PS5 and PS4 in the summer and it’s now officially summer as I have my aircon on, so where is Vampire Survivors?</p>
<p>Well it seems Sony’s submission process, the mechanism that all publishers need to follow to get their games on PlayStation, is causing Poncle a few headaches. It doesn’t seem like there’s anything particularly massive holding things up, just that it’s the first time they have had to do it.</p>


<p>“A<span>s it’s now summer we’ve had a lot of people asking when the PlayStation release will be happening </span><span>&nbsp;we want to keep you all updated, as we still don’t have a release date to share, but wanted to let you know why,” <a href="https://x.com/poncle_vampire/status/1805231013280256451">tweeted Poncle</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>“This is the first time we’re going through submission processes on PlayStation so it’s taking a little longer than usual we’re also doing some trial and error on Trophies to ensure we get them right BUT we’ll let you know ASAP when we have a solid date.”</p>

<p>Poncle&nbsp; recently released the Operation Guns DLC, which based on the Contra franchise.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vampire Survivors: Operation Guns DLC feat.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-update-easier<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco and From Software have released an&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>update, and if you've been struggling with the DLC's difficulty, this one's for you.</p>
<p>The update is a small one; it doesn't have extensive <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-1-12-2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch notes</a>, nor does it make any adjustments to things like boss movesets, so if your woes are related to some of&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>'s more hair-raising boss moments, you won't find what you're looking for here.</p>
<p>However, this update does make some changes to the Shadow Realm Blessings you can obtain to boost your damage and negate incoming pain.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-update-boss.jpg?itok=ke-DprJf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-update-boss.jpg?itok=AugMkwOd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If this guy's giving you trouble, help may be available.</figcaption></figure><p>In short, this&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>DLC update increases attack damage and incoming damage negation for "the first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements". The second half will represent a more gradual increase.</p>
<p>Additionally, the final level of Blessings will now grant slightly more attack power and damage negation, so if you're using Scadutree Fragments and Revered Spirit Ash, you should notice a difference.</p>
<p>If you're experiencing an unstable frame rate on&nbsp;the PC version of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, this update recommends that you check the Ray Tracing setting, which may have defaulted to being switched on if you've loaded your save from previous versions of the game.</p>
<p>Future balance adjustments and bug fixes are coming soon as well, so if these fixes don't smooth out your&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>experience, don't worry; more changes are on the way.</p>

<p>A few days ago, Bandai Namco <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1804630213562962043" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wryly addressed the controversy on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, suggesting that players utilize their Scadutree Blessings. It feels like the latest update makes that advice even more essential.</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/elden-ring/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/9PMPZZLKQM43" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>. It's a DLC expansion for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million">massively popular</a> open-world action RPG&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, adding new bosses, locations, and more.

			<p>Nexon and Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/26/the-first-descendant-launches-on-ps5-and-ps4-july-2-new-character-gameplay-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have revealed</a> The First Descendant PS5 graphical features available on Sony's console ahead of the game's launch next week.</p>
<p>The third-person looter shooter from Nexon releases globally across PC and consoles next week on July 2, and ahead of this release, we now know some more about the graphical modes on Sony's console. Although not yet specified, it's likely that these features will also be available on the Xbox Series X.</p>
<p>Not yet available in the game's beta, The First Descendant has a new Balanced Mode on PS5. In total, PS5 players will have access to three graphical modes - balanced, performance, and fidelity with the latter focusing on resolution, and the performance mode focusing on higher frame-rates. As you might guess, the Balanced Mode will fit in between these two modes.</p>
<p>On PS5, The First Descendant will also support Ray Tracing as well as AMD Frame Generation and Virtual Shadow Map (VSM), enhancing the game's overall visual quality.</p>
<p>Aside from providing these additional graphical features on PS5, Nexon has also released character gameplay trailers, which we've included below:</p>

<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5.2, The First Descendant launches next week on July 2nd for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5. On PC, the game will<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-qa-on-the-game-ue5-implementation-and-future-dlss-3-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> support HDR10+</a> Gaming and<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-gets-crossplay-beta-with-dlss-3-support-in-late-september/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> NVIDIA DLSS 3</a>. Earlier today we talked about our impressions from the game following a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-summer-game-fest-impressions-let-the-loot-rain-fall-on-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gameplay session</a> earlier this month. Here's what we wrote about the looter shooter:</p>
<p><em>"For the second portion of my gameplay session, I picked one of the playable regions at random and delved into the arctic region, thinking it to be a good change of pace from the boss arenas although my bunny girl was quite underdressed for the occasion. I had just enough time to eke out a zone recon mission and jump into a few shootouts for loot and glory before my session came to an end. One thing that I'll have to give Nexon praise for is continuing the trend of implementing Korean vocal tracks into your open world exploration. It's a thing I thoroughly enjoyed in Stellar Blade, and I earnestly want the trend to continue."</em></p>

<p id="BW5awf">So, when IDW Publishing and Mattel announced they were partnering for a set of American Girl graphic novels for the kids of the 2020s, I got <em>really</em> excited. Polygon got the chance to read the first, <em>Julie and the Blue Guitar</em>, written by Casey Gilly and drawn by Felia Hanakata, before it was released to readers this week. <em>Blue Guitar</em> continues the American Girl tradition of telling fascinating historic stories through a hopeful lens, but it also brings forth a failure inherent in the dolls themselves: their singularity.</p>
<p id="SH4UoM">Gilly and Hanakata are not new to transforming iconic franchises into comic books — between them, they’ve worked on well-received tales in the canon of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, <em>The Dragon Prince</em>, My Little Pony, and Dungeons &amp; Dragons, to name a few — so it’s no surprise that <em>Julie and the Blue Guitar </em>is compelling and inventive. </p>
<p id="KgBIPH">The creators build on the history of Julie Albright, a ’70s-era doll introduced in 2007, bringing her story into the 21st century via her diary, which is discovered by the book’s present-day lead, Emma Dhillon, while moving into her new home in San Francisco. This kicks off two parallel tales — one in which Emma makes a documentary about her journey to figure out who Julie is, and Julie and her friends try to solve the mystery of a stolen blue guitar in 1977.</p>

<p id="7cU8TG">To keep the stories straight, Hanakata borders Emma’s sequences in blue and Julie’s in yellow, but I’ll admit I was confused by the premise at first. A panel of Emma and Julie shouting simultaneously while facing each other had me thinking we were time traveling for a moment — but once I settled into the parallel narratives (and the color coding), I didn’t put the book down until I finished it.</p>
<p id="ZrWoEA">It wasn’t just the American Girl nostalgia that kept me turning the page. In fact, it’s almost the opposite. Hanakata’s thick-lined, brightly pigmented representation of Julie is refreshingly modern compared to the photorealistic imagery of her <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.americangirl.com%2Fpages%2Fjulie-albright&amp;referrer=polygon.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2F24185954%2Famerican-girl-julie-blue-guitar-comic-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___pl__p_23949995__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516586\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://www.americangirl.com/pages/julie-albright\u0026referrer=polygon.com\u0026sref=https://www.polygon.com/24185954/american-girl-julie-blue-guitar-comic-review&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:50,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;xcust&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;xcust&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23949995__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;66960X1516586&quot;,&quot;xs&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.americangirl.com/pages/julie-albright&quot;,&quot;referrer&quot;:&quot;polygon.com&quot;,&quot;sref&quot;:&quot;https://www.polygon.com/24185954/american-girl-julie-blue-guitar-comic-review&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">on the American Girl website</a>. The pages designed to look like the inside of Julie’s journal make me excited for kids who get to create imaginary worlds for their Julie dolls based on what they learn about her in this book.</p>
<p id="CeVbdo">Julie’s story also centers on her motivation to raise money to benefit the San Francisco Bay oil spill cleanup, which is based on the real-life spill that happened in 1971. In true American Girl form, the last few pages of the book contain information about several real-life historical events that inspired elements of the story.</p>

<p id="HJW0Ax">It’s not only accurate in the historic sense. Gilly and Hanakata aren’t shy about incorporating modern technology and vernacular, which feels like a great way to keep young readers interested. Emma films her documentary on her smartphone, illustrated to look like the UI of a real phone, down to the puppy filter that pops up on Emma’s face in a few scenes. Gilly strikes a nice balance of modernity, sending Emma’s character to the library to look through local yearbooks that don’t exist in digital form, just like Julie’s diary. </p>
<p id="SS6OXm">However, this book throws one of my biggest reservations about American Girl as a now-adult feminist into stark relief. Hanakata’s Emma is short with dark hair that fades to pink at the ends, framing her round face and complementing her relatively chubby build. Julie is consistent with other American Girl artwork of the doll: She’s thin and willowy, with long, blonde hair. </p>

<p id="Z0qNQl">But though you can buy a Julie doll, you can’t buy an Emma doll. I tried to create a custom Emma doll on the American Girl website, but I couldn’t find a hairstyle or color to match, nor could I customize her shorter height and thicker body shape. No matter what, every American Girl doll is predestined to be 18 inches tall with a soft, flat belly and legs that don’t touch. </p>
<p id="j4VwDo">It isn’t that the dolls are particularly harmful in their representation — compared to the wide world of big-brand dolls, they’re not overly skinny, and you can select from a range of skin colors and hair types. But their homogeneity in body type means that, in media like this comic, the dolls are all represented similarly, too. </p>
<p id="LAbMC6">In short: There hasn’t been a fat American Girl doll yet, and it’s past due. For one reason or another, Gilly and Hanakata chose to represent <em>Julie and the Blue Guitar</em>’s main character as having a body dissimilar from Julie’s, and that begs the question: If American Girl’s new graphic novel line can build compelling stories with body diversity, when will American Girl reflect that in its main business?</p>
<p id="XfecaS">The book cashes in on body diversity in a good way — I’m glad young readers will see a smart, intriguing character that might look more like them in American Girl media — but Mattel fails to back it with dolls that purport that value, too. It’s a shame that kids would have to get creative with their dolls to create narratives that match the body diversity in <em>Julie and the Blue Guitar</em>, because the choice to make Emma different makes for a better graphic novel. Why can’t those varying shapes and sizes exist for the dolls, too? </p>

There are over 750 accurately modeled cars from dozens of real-world car manufacturers, each of which will have had to be individually licensed to appear in the game, and during development the end of the contracts they had in place likely seemed impossibly far away to worry about. <em>FH3</em> had only come out two years earlier in 2016, and it’s fair to say the Australian edition of the open-world series—despite being fantastic—didn’t have quite the same impact and longevity. So seven years likely felt more than enough.</p><p>Of course, these new events demonstrate that nothing but in-perpetuity can ever be enough.</p><figure id="" data-id="e0315e075e575a944d333ce3a93ab09b" data-recommend-id="image://e0315e075e575a944d333ce3a93ab09b" data-format="jpg" data-width="2690" data-height="1394" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A red car at the start of a snowy race." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A red car at the start of a snowy race." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Playground Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e0315e075e575a944d333ce3a93ab09b" data-recommend-id="image://e0315e075e575a944d333ce3a93ab09b" data-format="jpg" data-width="2690" data-height="1394" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A red car at the start of a snowy race." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Playground and Microsoft are doing everything right, <em>right now</em>, when it comes to <em>Forza Horizon 4</em>.

The companies are encouraging people to ensure they own full copies (rather than accessing it via Game Pass), and have promised that it will remain available to download, and indeed still be playable both offline and online, with multiplayer features maintained. Well, for the short-term, at least.<br></p><p>Playground has also said that those who bought DLC for <em>FH4</em> while playing the Game Pass version will soon—if they have an active, full-price (as in, not discounted) Game Pass subscription right now—receive a “game token,” good through July 2026, to ensure you don’t need to buy it again. It’ll be gone from Game Pass come December 15.<br></p><p>But of course this leaves the enormous question: what about <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>? What about last year’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/forza-motorsport-8-horizon-xbox-game-pass-review-120fps-1850900323&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/forza-motorsport-8-horizon-xbox-game-pass-review-120fps-1850900323">extraordinary <em>Forza Motorsport</em></a></span>? Will we be saying goodbye forever to these in 2028, 2030? (Again, we’ve asked.)</p><p>It’s worth noting that the release schedules for the <em>Forza</em> games has changed, as the games haven gotten bigger and more involved. For the 2010s, there was an alternating new <em>Horizon</em> or <em>Motorsport</em> every year. They were, in some sense, more “disposable.” But since 2018, we’ve only had two more games. It’s now been three years since there was a new <em>Horizon—</em>the longest gap since the series began in 2012—and there’s not been a mention of <em>FH6</em> during all of the summer reveals. Losing <em>Forza Horizon 4</em> this year is far more impactful as a result.</p><figure id="" data-id="d1c100ab16553c04e57a84eadc6d901e" data-recommend-id="image://d1c100ab16553c04e57a84eadc6d901e" data-format="jpg" data-width="2744" data-height="1350" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The results of licensing, as a car skids on its side along the grass." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The results of licensing, as a car skids on its side along the grass." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Playground Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d1c100ab16553c04e57a84eadc6d901e" data-recommend-id="image://d1c100ab16553c04e57a84eadc6d901e" data-format="jpg" data-width="2744" data-height="1350" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The results of licensing, as a car skids on its side along the grass." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The answer surely has to be to make contingencies around licensing? Yes, I presume it’s actually <em>far</em> easier (while still enormously difficult) to accurately model 750 real cars, than to imagine up 750 entirely original models that don’t conflict with anything that already exists. But also, you know, we don’t actually <em>need</em> 750 cars. 100 would be lots! But at the very least, a suite of cars in the game that <em>are</em> entirely original, store-brand models that represent each of the most enjoyable archetypes, that can be left in the game until the heat-death of the universe. Warn players that everything else has a seven-year (or whatever) shelf-life, and then still have a playable—and more importantly—sellable game at the end of those contracts.<br></p><p> This would absolutely affect those who play these games for the realism, the precise portrayal of cars that offers the all-important simulation aspect. However, it would still allow the gearheads the same length of time with the game as before, but also provide a means to keep selling the product later. Sure, it would lose a lot of its identity, and it’s not a perfect solution. In-perpetuity contracts are the perfect solution. But maybe it’s better than the game never being sold again? </p><p>And this, of course, isn’t aimed exclusively at <em>Forza</em>. This is a common sense approach we desperately need every studio to be implementing when it builds games around licensed properties. It’s miserable that we’re losing so much art down this corporate well, and it’s now, today, impossibly short-sighted to walk into such a situation. (Let alone that these studios are being absolutely screwed over by the licensors, given a game like <em>Forza</em> is the most extraordinary advertising for car manufacturers.)</p><p>Licensing makes all sorts of sense for having a game look or sound flashy, absolutely. But unless in-perpetuity contracts can become the norm, contingencies <em>must</em> be built in from the ground up.</p><p>And hell, there’s no movie you now can’t watch because the lead character drove an Audi. (Indeed, Audi likely paid an enormous wad of cash to have their car appear in the film.) There’s no book that’s unpublishable because the protagonist drank a Coke. We can’t let games keep vanishing from existence for the sake of these short-term deals.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Twenty-year-old New Jersey resident Eric Kang is facing an attempted murder charge after allegedly flying hundreds of miles to attack a fellow <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/archeage/">ArcheAge</a> player with a hammer in the wake of an online dispute the two had while playing the game.</p><p dir="ltr">According to police (via <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/new-jersey-florida-online-video-game-attack/story?id=111380632" rel="nofollow ">ABC News</a>), Kang told his family he was visiting a friend, then boarded a flight to Florida to confront the victim. Wearing black clothes, gloves, and a mask, Kang allegedly entered the victim's home via an unlocked door. Kang waited for the victim--who was gaming at the time--to get up to use the restroom, then attacked him with a hammer.</p><p dir="ltr">The victim--who police say is close in age to his assailant--managed to pin Kang to the ground during the altercation. The victim's stepfather was asleep at the time, but woke up when he heard his stepson calling for help. Together, the two men reportedly subdued Kang until authorities arrived.</p><p dir="ltr">"Upon arrival, [the responding officers] discovered a significant amount of blood in the entryway of the home and the victim's bedroom," Nassau Counter sheriff Bill Leeper said during a recent press conference.</p><p dir="ltr">The victim sustained severe head wounds during the attack, but has been released from the hospital.</p><p dir="ltr">When asked about a motive, Kang reportedly told the sheriff's deputies that the victim is "a bad person online." Leeper stated during the press conference that Kang's charges may be upgraded pending further investigation.</p><p dir="ltr">"I would say, Mr. Kang, it will be a long time before you play video games," Leeper said during the press conference.</p><p dir="ltr">Interestingly, ArcheAge--the Korean MMORPG where Kang met his victim--is shutting down its US servers on Thursday, June 27. This has nothing to do with the assault, and the announcement was made back in April, with a declining active player count cited as the reason for the shutdown.</p><p dir="ltr">"This incident serves as a stark reminder of the potential real-world consequences of online interaction," Leeper said of the assault.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forza-horizon-4-delisting-announcement-prompts-huge-player-surge.911796/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forza-horizon-4-delisting-player-surge<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Playground Games and Microsoft have announced that&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 4&nbsp;</em>will be delisted from digital storefronts later this year, prompting a massive player surge for the game on PC.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-4-delisting" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Forza&nbsp;</em>website, Playground says that "due to licensing and agreements with our partners",&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 4&nbsp;</em>will be taken off digital stores on December 15th, which means you won't be able to buy it digitally anymore.</p>
<p>Microsoft and Playground have confirmed that this delisting doesn't mean you can't play the game if you've already bought it; you'll still be able to download and play&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 4&nbsp;</em>if you own it digitally, and you'll be able to access its online features as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/forza-horizon-4-delisting-race.jpg?itok=UP3e-UGt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/forza-horizon-4-delisting-race.jpg?itok=6AffHvW0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Forza Horizon 4&nbsp;</em>will no longer be available to buy digitally later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>As of yesterday, you can no longer buy&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 4&nbsp;</em>DLC from the store either. You can still buy the Standard, Deluxe, or Ultimate editions of the game until December 14th, however.</p>
<p>Things get a little strange when it comes to Game Pass. Bear with me here, because there are a lot of stipulations.</p>
<p>If you have an "active, full-paid" Game Pass subscription as of June 25th, and you've played&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 4&nbsp;</em>through that sub and also&nbsp;bought<em>&nbsp;</em>DLC for it, you should be eligible to get a copy of the game via your Xbox messages.</p>
<p>Sadly, if you've got a discounted Game Pass subscription, you won't be eligible for a code. If you do get one, make sure you use it before June 2026, as codes will start to expire from the 25th of that month.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/forza-horizon-4-delisting-english-road.jpg?itok=lL8T9XdP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/forza-horizon-4-delisting-english-road.jpg?itok=0vQ4Xuif 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The idyllic British roads of&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 4&nbsp;</em>will soon be closed off.</figcaption></figure><p>This news has prompted a huge player surge for&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 4&nbsp;</em>on Steam, with the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1293830/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">player count</a> at 47,741 and climbing at time of writing. Given that the game was peaking at around 7,500 players per day before the announcement, that's no mean feat.</p>
<p>Of course, the fact that&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 4&nbsp;</em>is currently available at a massive 80% discount on Steam is likely to be a contributing factor as well. Microsoft and Playground say more sales like this are in the offing, too, so watch out for those.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 4&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1293830/Forza_Horizon_4/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/forza-horizon-4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.

<p id="xP2s55">What would you do if you were told, with absolute certainty, that you were going to hell, and there was nothing you could do to stop it? Moreover, what would you do if <em>everyone</em> around knew this, and a bunch of big burly smoke demons were going to beat you to death before burning your corpse? Well, that’s the situation the characters in <em>Hellbound</em> find themselves in.</p>
<p id="xKbiop">Adapted from his horror-thriller webtoon, <em>Train to Busan</em> director Yeon Sang-ho’s series takes place in a modern-day South Korea that has been plunged into hysteria following a wave of mysterious murders perpetrated by supernatural beings thought to be “angels.” Believing that their victims have been condemned to hell, society has dissolved into a religious panic, with an insidious cult organization known as the New Truth Society holding sway over all forms of government and culture. </p>
<p id="UpdVd8">The series escalates from a dark fantasy police procedural about an investigator attempting to apprehend the extremist founder of the nascent New Truth Society into a nail-biting thriller about a father and mother attempting to protect their child from the machinations of the cult. <em>Hellbound</em> is a brilliantly constructed drama about the ways humans are susceptible to fanaticism and superstition, and how deliberate cooperation and compassion can stem the tide of our darkest impulses. <em>—Toussaint Egan</em></p>

<p id="QuxLcX">Bad things are coming to 1929 Berlin. <em>We</em> know this, of course — with the vantage point of history, the Weimar Republic era was marked by economic insecurity and the beginning of the Nazi Party. But the ’20s in the world of <em>Babylon Berlin</em> exist just before that horror, when the degeneracy from all that economic downturn could give way to roaring ’20s clubs just as easily as unending darkness.</p>
<p id="GTgIBz">That tension is captured in <em>Babylon Berlin</em> by two protagonists: Gereon Rath (a soft and strong Volker Bruch), a vice inspector on a secret mission to take down an extortion ring, and Charlotte Ritter (Liv Lisa Fries, all vinegar and chutzpah), the new police clerk who moonlights as a sex worker. Together they provide two very distinct vantage points on the Weimar Republic’s waning days, exposing the rot of what’s to come at the same time they find hope in what could’ve been. </p>
<p id="4lnlgZ"><em>Babylon Berlin</em>’s trick is by not getting ahead of itself. The show is perhaps one of the slower boils on this list; the thrills of the mystery, such as they are, come from meticulous pacing. Answers don’t come easy, and a whole country’s politics don’t change overnight. <em>Babylon Berlin </em>is a web of history and conspiracy, and by taking those elements equally seriously and methodically, you get a twisty, hardboiled detective story for the ages. —<em>Zosha Millman</em></p>

<p id="VAu3QC">Solving a murder is hard enough, but how do you go about apprehending a culprit whose crime literally transcends space and time?</p>
<p id="oyeN3n"><em>Bodies</em> is a terrific cerebral whodunit with an excellent ensemble cast whose stories weave into one another effortlessly as the series builds and the mystery deepens. Created by Paul Tomalin (<em>Torchwood</em>) and based on Si Spencer’s 2014 comic, this sci-fi crime thriller follows four detectives living in different time periods of London who find themselves investigating a strange murder. What’s so strange about it? Well, the victim’s body appears — and reappears — in each time period in the exact same location. What’s even stranger is that the victim was last seen alive in 2053, despite being seen dead both in that year <em>and</em> as early as 1890.</p>
<p id="saPrdS">A engrossing drama that feels like a mashup between <em>Class of ’09</em>, <em>Dark</em>, and Alex Garland’s <em>Devs</em>, <em>Bodies</em> is one of Netflix’s most compelling releases this year and wholly deserves to be added to your watchlist. —<em>TE</em></p>

<p id="y5amzx">One of Netflix’s biggest hits from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/24002689/best-netflix-original-movies-tv-shows-series-2023">its 2023 slate of shows</a> added a different (but well-trodden) sort of thriller to this list — the political thriller — following in the footsteps of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/30/16575426/house-of-cards-ending">streaming platform’s first-ever hit original show</a>.</p>
<p id="YLDwjU">A throwback to the kind of plot-heavy political thriller that used to run television (and the screwball comedies of days gone by), <em>The Diplomat</em> is a delightful star vehicle for Keri Russell. She is Kate Wyler, a whip-smart career diplomat whose plans are thrown into disarray when her upcoming assignment in Afghanistan is changed to what seems to be a cushy post as the new U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom. For Kate, who loves her work and is very good at it, this is a clear downgrade, but the more power-focused people in her life (including her conniving husband Hal, played by Rufus Sewell) are delighted by the new role. What follows is a whirlwind of intrigue and mystery, with snappy dialogue, strong chemistry between the leads, and plenty of twists and turns.</p>
<p id="MrLAyQ">After courting many viewers for its first season, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23706819/diplomat-netflix-season-2-news-cast-release-date-renewal-keri-russell"><em>The Diplomat </em>will return for a second</a>. We can’t wait, especially after the first season’s cliffhanger ending. —<em>Pete Volk</em></p>

<p id="fE6b8f">French action cinema is having a bit of a renaissance, and one of the leading figures is director Julien Leclercq. He made the very good Olga Kurylenko thriller <em>Sentinelle</em>, the Jean-Claude Van Damme-led <em>The Bouncer</em>, and my favorite movie of his, the tense crime thriller <em>Braqueurs </em>(also known as <em>The Crew</em>).</p>
<p id="vpdsQy">Six years later, Leclercq took his talents to television with the Netflix series <em>Ganglands </em>(also known as <em>Braqueurs</em>). It shares the same name, lead (the excellent Sami Bouajila), and general vibe, but is not technically a sequel or a remake. In <em>Ganglands</em>, a crew of expert armed robbers are drawn into a gang war: They’re so dang good at crimes, everyone wants to hire them, even the people they rob.</p>
<p id="luNyjZ">Leclercq and writer Hamid Hlioua have created a muscular little thriller anchored by strong leading performances and the director’s tension-filled style of building action and conflict. The second season was recently released on Netflix, and both seasons are very much worth your time. —<em>Pete Volk</em></p>

<p id="297QMk">The thrill of the heist — there’s just nothing like it. Ask Assane Diop (Omar Sy). He’s been working as a con artist and thief for years, drawing his inspiration (and moniker) from an obsession with the literary gentleman thief Arsène Lupin. His thrills are hard-won, but they’re also smoothly meticulous. For Assane, the art of the heist — even with a priceless diamond necklace worn by Marie Antoinette — is a given. </p>
<p id="4O5mtC">What comes less naturally is revenge. <em>Lupin</em>’s first season follows his quest to seek vengeance on the rich family that wronged his father, and the show is full of twists and turns as his mission starts to bleed from his gentleman thief persona back into his real life. </p>
<p id="cCOyCq">The French series was a breakout hit when it premiered on Netflix, thanks in large part to Sy’s performance. He is magnetic as he makes con artistry look easy, with the sort of natural charm that makes you believe he can fake his way into any vault or safe in France (and that’s all before we get into his thieving skills and connections). With a heist, the end is, typically, self-assured. Sy’s performance ensures <em>Lupin</em> has the same confidence, and makes every step of the ride along the way its own thrill. —<em>ZM</em></p>

<p id="IG0rL5">David Fincher’s exacting vision is applied to the television format in one of the best shows Netflix has ever produced. Over two seasons, odd-couple FBI agents Holden Ford (Jonathan Groff) and Bill Tench (the terrific Holt McCallany) interview serial killers in the burgeoning field of criminal psychology. </p>
<p id="13Tf2y">In a nice twist on conventional character tropes, it is the young agent who is often cold and emotionally removed, and the older one who worries about the consequences of their actions. Their chemistry, as well as <em>Mindhunter</em>’s deep study of our culture around serial killers and the approach to stopping them, makes the show excellent, and it never veers into the exploitation of its peers in the genre.</p>
<p id="kSo1mJ">How exacting is Fincher’s vision? Take a look at this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Di4Byf1EzRE">mind-blowing VFX reel</a> from the show, which literally changed how I watch modern cinema. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="tbEPzX">If you’re a fan of the 1960s crime drama series <em>The Fugitive</em>, you’ll likely love the 2004 anime adaptation of Naoki Urasawa’s psychological thriller manga. After all, the series was inspired by it! Set in Germany before and after the fall of the Berlin Wall, <em>Monster</em> centers on the story of Kenzo Tenma, a Japanese brain surgeon living in Düsseldorf. After being implicated in the murders of his superiors, Kenzo must go on the run to clear his name by tracking down the real culprit: a young man he once treated. </p>
<p id="y4D2Ys">Spanning 74 episodes, <em>Monster</em> is a labyrinthine drama filled with a rich cast of characters and enough harrowing twists and revelations to fill a Matryoshka doll.<em> —TE</em></p>

<p id="voPyds">Sometimes, you want a “light brain” thriller — something not too deep that might be perfect for a bucket of popcorn or for background viewing while you fold some laundry. <em>The Night Agent </em>is Netflix’s quintessential plot-heavy popcorn thriller, elevated to solid fare thanks to the surprising chemistry between its two leads.</p>
<p id="VWXo0y">Adapted by <em>The Shield </em>creator Shawn Ryan from the novel, <em>The Night Agent </em>stars Gabriel Basso as an FBI agent who has been relegated to watching a phone that never rings in the basement in the White House. When that phone does ring one night, he and the person on the other end (Luciane Buchanan) are brought into a vast conspiracy that threatens to unravel everything he knows. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="juyg80">Luckily, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23591818/you-season-4-part-1-netflix-review"><em>You</em> is very aware</a> of this, taking the initial premise of the first season — boy meets girl, boy stalks girl, boy manipulates her whole life to a dangerous degree — and continues flipping it over, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23601157/netflix-you-season-4-part-1-2-penn-badgley">putting Joe through his paces</a>, letting him scramble to cover his ass as he gets in deeper and deeper. Each <em>You</em> season is a flavor unto itself, switching locales and ladies and letting Joe make the worst kind of case for himself. </p>
<p id="you1MP"><em>You</em> is not a show for the faint of heart, but it’s also not a thriller that rests easily on its underlying darkness. Joe may be an absolute piece of shit (<a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/12/27/you-season-2-finale-penn-badgley/#:~:text=He%E2%80%99s%20a%20murderer!%20He%E2%80%99s%20a%20sociopath.%20He%E2%80%99s%20abusive.%20He%E2%80%99s%20delusional.%20And%20he%E2%80%99s%20self%2Dobsessed.">even Badgley thinks so</a>, and would <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3bvqx/penn-badgley-says-the-psychopath-he-plays-in-you-potentially-exists-in-all-of-us">really like it if you did too</a>), but the show knows how to keep him engaging as it turns the screws on him. Each of the four seasons challenges him in new ways, and it makes for a snaky and startlingly good time. With <em>You</em> there’s only one thing you can always expect: for Joe to go to extreme and violent lengths to prove he’s not the bad guy. Also a plexiglass vault. —<em>ZM </em></p>

So ensuring you have the right mods could make all the difference between earning a victory royale and getting sent back to the lobby. This guide will detail everything you need to know about equipping the best mods on your car to help you win your next game.</p><h2 id="h104768"><a id=""></a>What <em>Fortnite</em> cars can I mod?</h2><p>Currently, there are only two different cars you can modify. The first is the Sports Car, which only seats two people, so if you’re playing with a third or fourth, this may not be the ideal car for you. The other car you can mod is the SUV. Unlike the Sports Car, it can seat up to four people and has more health. But it isn’t as fast as the Sports Car, and can be a bit more unwieldy to handle.<br></p><h2 id="h104769"><a id=""></a>Best car mods to use in <em>Fortnite </em>Chapter 5, Season 3</h2><p>The first thing you’ll want to be on the lookout for is Bulletproof Tires. These are vital to have because with all the gunshots flying around, a handful of them are bound to hit your tires, and this is the only way to ensure they don’t pop mid-fight and make it nearly impossible to control your vehicle.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="dc893894852b9d410969d364a24beffc" data-recommend-id="image://dc893894852b9d410969d364a24beffc" data-format="jpg" data-width="2290" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A car in Fortnite sporting bulletproof tires." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A car in Fortnite sporting bulletproof tires." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dc893894852b9d410969d364a24beffc" data-recommend-id="image://dc893894852b9d410969d364a24beffc" data-format="jpg" data-width="2290" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A car in Fortnite sporting bulletproof tires." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now that you have the Bulletproof Tires on, you’ll then want to be on the lookout for the Spiked Bumper. This is especially important because if you run over a player or crash into their car with this, it’ll inflict even more damage than it usually would.<br></p><p>Last, you’ll want to equip the Machine Gun Turret. This immediately damages cars or players the second it hits its target, unlike the Grenade Launcher Turret, which takes a few seconds to explode after shooting. What also makes the Machine Gun Turret great is that you shoot directly at other drivers or passengers in enemy cars, which could potentially down them mid-fight, rather than having to arc your shot to factor in the grenades’ trajectory.</p><h2 id="h104770"><a id=""></a><em>Fortnite </em>car tips</h2><p>It’s important to ensure your car is properly equipped during any game. But it’s also important to carry at least one repair torch in your inventory whenever you get behind the wheel. A fully charged-up Repair Torch can repair your car at least twice before it’s drained.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="152b10cbfbd959daa90bc5f2438ada5b" data-recommend-id="image://152b10cbfbd959daa90bc5f2438ada5b" data-format="jpg" data-width="2298" data-height="1284" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Fortnite car sporting a spiked bumper.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This is especially helpful when you find yourself in the final circles of any game, where there’s often not a lot of repair stations for your car. This will ensure it won’t explode when you find yourself in the endgame.<br></p><p>If you’re playing with more than two people, a great strategy is to have whoever’s not on the turret be on repair duties. That way you won’t have to worry about having your car explode mid-fight, and the two players up front can focus on downing enemies.</p><hr><p>That’s really all you need to know about <em>Fortnite</em>’s cars and how to make the most of them! Good luck out there. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The last couple of years have seen several remakes of Resident Evil games, but for anyone looking to experience the franchise in its original low-polygon glory, the classic games are making a comeback as part of a joint effort between Capcom and GOG. Now accessible through GOG, the first Resident Evil is available to purchase and will be followed by Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis soon.</p><p>Like other GOG releases, these are all DRM-free versions of the survival-horror games, and they've been upgraded with quality-of-life improvements and enhanced compatibility for modern PCs. GOG says this version of Resident Evil is the uncut edition and contains even more blood, graphic violence, and gory scenes than the PlayStation original.</p><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fresident_evil&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fclassic-resident-evil-games-are-back-from-the-dead-on-pc%2F1100-6524515%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Resident Evil</a> -- $10</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fresident_evil_2&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fclassic-resident-evil-games-are-back-from-the-dead-on-pc%2F1100-6524515%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Resident Evil 2</a></li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fresident_evil_3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fclassic-resident-evil-games-are-back-from-the-dead-on-pc%2F1100-6524515%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</a></li></ul><p>Speaking to <a href="https://youtu.be/o38wFuD3Wag" rel="nofollow ">Suzi "SphereHunter" Hunterr</a>, GOG detailed some of the challenges in resurrecting the classic Resident Evil games. Technical issues and bugs had to be addressed so that Capcom's high standards could be met, and by the time the QA process had been completed, GOG had submitted dozens of builds for approval. Some of the enhancements for the games include improved DirectX rendering, new rendering options, and full support for modern controllers.</p><p>Other changes are focused on improved timing in cutscenes, better save-game managers, and the option to switch between different localizations of the games. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-resident-evil-pc-re-release-spotted-could-be-out-very-soon/1100-6524343/" data-ref-id="1100-6524343">Reports of a Resident Evil re-release</a> picked up steam last week when an age rating for the game was spotted online, making this GOG version the first time Resident Evil has been available on PC digitally.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-zero-and-code-veronica-are-the-next-remakes-for-the-franchise-report/1100-6523753/" data-ref-id="1100-6523753">Resident Evil Zero is reportedly one of two more remakes</a> in development, and rumors about the still-unannounced Resident Evil 9 claim that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-9-could-be-an-open-world-game-report/1100-6522123/" data-ref-id="1100-6522123">could be an open-world game</a>.</p>

                <p>Joe Tung, a video game industry veteran who formerly worked on the Halo and Destiny franchises, has commented on the state of video games and specifically the live-service approach. Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/battle-royale/former-halo-and-destiny-producer-says-live-service-model-is-much-better-for-developers-and-players-than-the-dollar60-boxed-product-model/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, Tung said he believes live-service is "so much better" for both players and developers than the more-traditional-boxed product model.</p><p>Tung, who also worked at Riot Games on League of Legends and is now CEO of Supervive studio Theorycraft Games, said, "I always felt like in the $60 boxed product model that I was having to make decisions that were not in the best interest of players."</p>

<p>Instead, he said he felt that model was meant primarily to help sell as many copies as possible in the first two days. For live-service games, Tung said a strength of this model is that developers that think long-term. "You can think long-term in terms of what is best for the player, and how does that overlap with what is best for the company? I think it allows you to make much, much, much better decisions overall."</p><p>Asked about decisions made that are not necessarily in the best interests of players, Tung said back in the E3 days, some of the demos shown during press conferences may not have been representative of a final product. "It's like, let's jam as much bullshit vaporware into the build as we can in the next three months because we have to have a huge showing at E3 because it's our one opportunity to talk to our audience before we launch the game," he said.</p><p>Supervive aims to be a title that players can enjoy for 10,000 hours over the course of multiple years, Tung said. The game, which was formerly known as Project Loki, blends elements of the hero shooter, action game, and battle royale genres. Alpha testing on PC is happening now, with an open beta to follow this fall.</p>

If its first trailer,&nbsp; which was revealed by <em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cattle-country-aims-to-mix-stardew-valley-with-a-dash-of-red-dead-redemption">IGN</a> </em>today, is any indication, farming/townbuilding sim fans will want to keep an eye on the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The reveal trailer gives us a great look at what to expect, which includes ranching, treasure hunting, mining, farming, and, of course, romancing. The game is coming to PC sometime in the future, but there's no release date or window in sight. Cattle Country's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2818150/Cattle_Country/?curator_clanid=40214109">Steam listing</a> simply says the release date is "to be announced."&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you might be able to hear, the Cattle Country reveal trailer is narrated by Red Dead Redemption 2's Arthur Morgan, or rather, Arthur Morgan's voice actor, Roger Clark.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Cattle Country straddles the saddle of cozy wholesome gaming and action-adventure," the game's Steam listing reads. "Serving up hours of the slice-of-life you'd expect on the frontier – including mining, fishing, crafting, and farming – along with deep-rooted Wild West quests delivering stories of romance, cattle drives, bandits, and robberies."</p>

<p><strong>Here are some Cattle Country screenshots:&nbsp;</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/steamworld-heist-ii-preview-time-to-plunder<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>SteamWorld</em> is host to a myriad of titles spanning across multiple genres. You have the base-building sim <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/steamworld-build"><em>SteamWorld Build</em></a>, or even the turn-based RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/steamworld-quest"><em>SteamWorld Quest</em></a>. As a tactics fan, my personal favorite of the ever-expanding series is <em>SteamWorld</em> <em>Heist</em>, and to see that it's getting an upcoming sequel? I'm all in.</p>
<p>We got a chance to check out <em>SteamWorld Heist II </em>during Summer Game Fest, as well as some extra hands-on time after the show. The early portion of <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em> should serve as a great sequel for fans of the first game, but also a fantastic starting point for anyone that likes tactics or pirates.</p>

<h2>A Pirates Life for <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em></h2>
<p><em>SteamWorld Heist II</em> trades the science fiction, space pirate theme from the first game in for a high seas adventure. Rather than boarding space vessels and seizing loot, you have your very own submarine, the method by which you'll attack ships, plunder booty, and infiltrate strongholds and pirate dens.</p>
<p>The setting is a somewhat jarring departure from the first game, though the core gameplay loop should still be familiar for fans of the first game. <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em> is a tactical strategy game at its core, and maneuvering units and planning ahead is all part of the fun.</p>
<p>Missions usually task players with achieving a certain objective, like seizing all the loot at an outpost. To do so, you'll add members of your crew to missions and go forth. In <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>, units have their own class, weapon types, and more. Those can later be mixed and matched to make optimal builds, so there's already some depth to the mechanics outside of combat.</p>

<p>One of the ways in which this particular series has set itself apart is with the aiming system -- you're primarily using weapons to dispatch naval robots. The bullet ricochet system is back again, so you can defy physics by having bullets bounce in wild ways to hit enemies that <em>might</em> appear out of reach, but in fact are vulnerable to your guns.</p>
<p>It's been nearly 8 years since I played the original, but combat feels relatively unchanged. That's a good thing, since the core gameplay was very addicting and simple to get the hang of. Of course, pulling off insane shots with the ricochets never grew dull, and you'll find that's the case in <em>SteamWorld Heist II </em>as well.</p>

<h2>Pilot Your Own Ship</h2>
<p>Outside of combat, the most immediate difference between this and the original is the submarine. Players commandeer their own ship and use it to explore a rather vast open world. The world, comprising mostly water and islands scattered throughout, are infested with outposts and enemy vessels you can loot.</p>
<p>It's a simple vehicle to control, but very addicting to use. The submarine is equipped with various weapons like turrets and torpedoes. These weapons fire automatically in fixed directions, but you need to position your ship often when an armament needs to be reloaded.</p>

<p>You're able to collect any loot from these ships and use it to buy upgrades for a wide variety of things. There's also a system in place where players accrue bounty points based on what they achieve in a day. Those bounties can be exchanged for rewards at the end of the day, so you're constantly getting rewarded.</p>
<p>The whole overworld is seamless, and as I mentioned, the combat retains its old charm. <em>SteamWorld</em>'s been a hallmark for quality indie games for over a decade now, and it's encouraging to see that <em>SteamWorld Heist II </em>is upholding that legacy thus far.</p>
<hr><p><strong>Steam<em>World Heist II </em></strong><em>was previewed after about 30 minutes of gameplay at Summer Game Fest, and 4 hours with a key provided by the publisher - all screenshots were taken during the preview process.</em></p>

Scadutree Blessings (which affect attack and defense stars) are found at Miquella’s crosses, while Revered Spirit Ash Blessings (which bolster your Spirit summons) are placed on Miquella statues. Both are required to level up these stats at Sites of Grace, and much of the DLC is scaled to Blessings. As such, FromSoftware is bumping up the stat increases for the first half of the maximum amount in order to give players an edge in the opening hours. They will then level out as you go, so if you’re already deep into the DLC, it’s unlikely you’ll notice any tan3gible difference.</p><p>The patch notes also mention a bug on the PC version that automatically enabled raytracing if you load saved data from previous versions of the game from old patches, with instructions on how to fix it in-game. The full patch notes read as follows:</p><h2 id="h105285"><a id=""></a>Calibration Update 1.12.2 change list</h2><p>Attack and damage negation curve scaling of the <strong>Shadow Realm Blessings</strong> has been revised.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>The attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of <strong>Blessing enhancements</strong>, and the second half will now be more gradual.</li><li>The attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased.</li></ul><p>The calibration update can be applied by logging into the multiplayer server.</p><p>If the Calibration Ver. listed at the bottom right of the title menu is not “1.12.2", then select LOGIN and apply the latest regulations before enjoying the game.</p><h2 id="h105286"><a id=""></a>About graphics settings (PC version only)</h2><p>We have confirmed a bug where the raytracing settings are automatically enabled if you have previously loaded saved data from previous game versions.</p><p>If your framerate is unstable, please check in the ‘SYSTEM’ &gt; ‘Graphics Settings’ &gt; ‘Raytracing Quality’ settings from the title menu or in-game menu to check if it has been unintentionally set to ‘ON’. Once set to ‘OFF’, Ray Tracing will no longer be automatically enabled.</p><p>Other balance adjustments as well as bug fixes are also planned for a future patch.</p><p>Hopefully that will help folks who have having trouble with the opening hours of <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>.

            <title><![CDATA[AAA Games Are Bombing in iOS Port Sales, Estimates Claim]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ios-games-sales-bombing/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>When the iPhone 15 (and the higher-tier models) was revealed last year, it was promised that a slew of AAA games would wind up on the super-capable device and the topmost iPad models. To that end, Death Stranding, Resident Evil Village, and – most recently – Assassin’s Creed Mirage all landed on the iOS App Store, but recent estimations have suggested that they’re simply not selling and might not be worth the developers’ investment.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-too-niche">Too Niche</h2>



<p>It’s worth stressing that these AAA games can only be played on the most expensive, high-spec iPhones and iPads on the market, but even so, the estimated sales figures are woeful. In a report published by Appfigures (and <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/those-assassins-creed-resident-evil-and-death-stranding-ports-have-bombed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared by MobileGamer</a>), it was suggested that fewer than 3,000 people have paid to unlock the full version of Assassin’s Creed Mirage since it was released a few weeks ago. </p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Mirage offers users a brief free trial to test out the game on their iPhone or iPad device, but after that, there’s a $49.99 paywall blocking off the rest of the game. That’s where most users are getting to before ultimately giving up, because it has been downloaded approximately 123,000 times, according to Appfigures. That has led Ubisoft to net just $138,000 in revenue, which hardly makes the venture worthwhile.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, it was estimated that while Resident Evil 4 has been downloaded around 350,000 times, only 7,000 consumers have converted to the fully-priced, premium product. The data also shows rapid drop-offs in interest post-launch. </p>



<p>Many have theorised that the leading cause of this lack of interest can be attributed to none of the games being made-for-mobile – and then there’s the fact that they boast premium price tags. In a world dominated by free-to-play games, who wants to pay $49.99 to play a game on a mobile device?</p>

In it, you'll engage in close-quarters combat, explore realistic medieval locations, learn alchemy, and more. Check out the fantastic announcement trailer above and the first screenshots in the gallery below.</p><p>Alkahest is set in the kingdom of Kadanor, where you're the youngest son of a petty lord.

Meaning, you'll build combos with both your attacks and the environment. One example Play On gives: "Drop a tree on [an enemy's] head, kick them off a cliff, set them on fire." That fire part comes from Alkahest's alchemy system, which augments the up-close melee combat in lieu of a magic system. You'll follow recipes or concoct your own throwables, drinkables, weapon oils, and enemy traps. Stealth and brute-force melee combat are both supported and encouraged.</p><p>Alkahest is in development for PC and we'll have more on it as development progresses.</p><p><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-first-impressions-of-the-remixed-classics<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The 1989 movie The Wizard had a profound effect on me as a kid. In it, young Fred Savage’s character makes his way to the Nintendo World Championships in, heck, I don’t even remember what city, but it was somewhere far away, in order to put his video game skills to the test. Anyway, once he gets there, a big twist in the event is that he competes in the then-unreleased Super Mario Bros. 3. And boy oh boy did that product placement work to perfection – I <em>had </em>to have Super Mario Bros. 3 the moment it came out after that, and God bless my mom, she bought it for me. Her taking it out of that white plastic K-Mart grocery bag and just handing it to me – it wasn’t even my birthday or anything! – is a core memory for me.</p><p>That is what I think of when I think about the Nintendo World Championships, but for others, the real-life competition was far more about just that: a real-life competition. Now, Nintendo is putting a creative twist on the nostalgia for its own history in a way that only they seem to be really good at: by turning into a local and online multiplayer game for the Nintendo Switch that’s played in increments ranging from under two seconds (this is not a joke) to about a minute at most. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition - June 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition includes 13 games: Super Mario Bros. 1-3, Super Mario Bros. 2: The Lost Levels, Zelda 1 and 2, Metroid, Kid Icarus, Donkey Kong, Ballon Fight, Excitebike, Ice Climber, and Kirby’s Adventure. I ended up dabbling in each of them during a 90-minute hands-on session across both solo modes and the local Party Mode. I certainly knew what I was walking into – a collection of classic NES games from my childhood turned into competitive challenges – but I didn’t expect the format to be so much <em>fun</em>.</p><p>Of these games, Kirby’s Adventure was the only one I’d flat-out never played as a kid, and sure enough it was the Kirby challenges that tripped me up the most. But outside of that, I had an absolute blast trying to earn S rankings on the myriad challenges on offer for each game. They get progressively more difficult as you go, naturally, and you have to unlock the tougher ones with coins you earn by getting good rankings on the challenges you do have access to. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>As an example, the first challenge from The Legend of Zelda is so simple it probably sounds stupid: you start from the beginning of the game and have to walk into the cave that’s on the very first screen and acquire the sword. And yet, I found myself replaying it multiple times to try and shave tenths of a second off of my time and get that pride-inflating S ranking. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The first challenge from The Legend of Zelda is so simple it probably sounds stupid. And yet, I found myself replaying it multiple times to try and shave tenths of a second off of my time and get that pride-inflating S ranking.&nbsp;</p></div><p>Party Mode is where it really got fun, though. IGN’s Rebekah Valentine and I competed in a series of challenges in Party Mode against Nintendo reps. We sped through World 1-1 of Super Mario Bros. 3. We got the first energy ball in Metroid. We climbed to the top of the first stage in Donkey Kong, we took a lap around the track in Excitebike, and more. Is it the perfect re-creation of an in-person competition with hundreds if not thousands of people cheering you on? Certainly not. But it is a delightfully simple party game that truly anyone can pick up and play. Will it help if you already have a nostalgic connection to these games? No doubt. But is that experience required? Absolutely not; in 2024, any of these 1980’s classics can be picked up and played by anyone pretty easily, as there are only two buttons to worry about.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Although speaking of buttons, my one genuine complaint about Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition involves them. See, when four of you are competing, all four of you have to press the A button to ready up before an event starts. The problem is, <em>so many </em>of the games use the B button as a turbo or run button that you naturally want to be holding it as soon as the countdown timer hits zero. But if any one of the four of you hasn’t readied up yet and anyone else starts laying on the B button in anticipation of the start of the event, it backs everyone out to the previous menu. This happened over and over during my 90-minute hands-on session, and I wasn’t the only one accidentally doing this. It seems like a UI design flaw that there must be a solution for.</p><p>I have one other nitpick, though this one is far less serious: the slowdown in Kirby’s Adventure (and perhaps in parts of other games that I didn’t see enough of to rule out). The versions of the 13 games included here are the original iterations, but during a couple of the Kirby challenges, the slowdown kicked in and felt disruptive to the action – as framerate hitches do in any game, modern or classic. I can see the argument for preserving each of the games as-is, but for the sake of the competition that’s at the heart of the gameplay in Nintendo World Championships, I’d prefer that it have been smoothed out. You may disagree, and that’s OK!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Meanwhile, I didn’t play the Online World Championships mode since, of course, the game isn’t out yet and there’s no one online to play with. But expect weekly rankings there, with the ability to watch the replays of the top players – a handy tool for improving your own skills and strategies. </p><p>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition feels priced right to be at $30 for the digital version, and again I was surprised at how engaged I was with the seemingly simple challenges it puts forth (at least in the early rounds). I hope this does well, because the name of this implies that we might get a SNES Edition, Nintendo 64 Edition, and dare I say even a GameCube Edition if this one is a hit. </p><p><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

<p>The studio estimates that the new update, catchily named 1.2.0.25, is around 30% bigger than its 1.1 patch, and it brings big balance updates, improvements to locations and the UI, and much, much more.</p>
<p>There's arguably no one big centerpiece for this update; rather, it revolves around a litany of smaller tweaks and improvements that should all add up to create a patchwork that significantly boosts your&nbsp;<em>Rogue Trader&nbsp;</em>play experience.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to a bevy of quality-of-life changes like quests appearing on star systems, improved tooltips, and a better level-up screen, as well as an improved combat log.</p>
<p>The update adds "various improvements for locations across the game", too, including improved NPC variety and better pathing, and several companions have had new dialogue introduced so you can get to know them better.</p>
<p>Rumor zones are now highlighted on&nbsp;<em>Rogue Trader</em>'s map, and co-operative play has been improved too, so if you're investigating those rumors alongside a friend, your experience should be a lot smoother.</p>

Pretty sure that’s how it works. Probably.</p>
<p id="U7OHCG">Even if just a few of those games pique your interest, it’s still a great value, and we <strong>—</strong> that is, the royal, collective Polygon hivemind — have at least a dozen favorites among the list, chief among them <em>Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo</em>.</p>
<p id="nOg9yG">The Capcom Fighting Bundle deal runs until July 4 on the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0102-CUSA31205_00-CFCBUNDLE0000001">PlayStation store</a> and July 8 on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/capcom-fighting-bundle-switch/">Nintendo store</a>.

<p>PlayStation has filed for a new patent for a new controller concept. The standout feature of this controller is its use of electric ink, allowing players to craft a custom layout that suits their unique play style. This patent could revolutionize the way we interact with games. Dive into the details of PlayStation’s patent for a “user customized flat computer simulation controller field below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://exputer.com/news/playstation/sony-controller-customize-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Exputer</a>, PlayStation’s latest patent talks about a controller that gives players a new level of freedom towards customization. This concept will work on a flat surface, and the user will have to personally draw the layout for the computer simulation buttons that fit their needs perfectly. Players would need a regular first, however, to link the hand-drawn controls to the actual buttons on the standard controller.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, there will be an “anti-fatigue” key, a feature designed to enhance button functionality. In some instances, players will press buttons a single time, repeatedly, or keep them pressed. This anti-fatigue key will ensure that players can enjoy a higher level of customization for their button presses, providing a smoother and more enjoyable gaming experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PlayStation’s newest controller patent can be seen as a highly advanced version of the accessibility controller. This new concept provides players with an even higher range of options, particularly in terms of customization. The patent aims to create a personalized layout that best suits their needs by allowing players to draw custom buttons. </p>



<p>However, it’s important to note that this technology is currently just a patent, and its future is uncertain. Nevertheless, the research and development of this technology could potentially open up more options for future accessibility controllers, further enhancing the gaming experience for all players.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The highly anticipated Shadow of the Erdtree expansion for FromSoftware’s critically acclaimed open-world action RPG has finally arrived. As players embark on their new journey into the Realm of Shadows, they’ve encountered some challenges. </p>



<p>The battles, in particular, have proven to be more demanding than expected, leading to some player frustration. However, the developers have just released a Shadow of the Erdtree balancing patch in response to player feedback, a move that should reassure players that their concerns are being heard and addressed.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Elden Ring <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-calibration-update-1122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Calibration Updat</a>e 1.12.2 is now live, bringing balancing changes and adjustments to PC graphics settings. Regarding balancing, the devs have revised the attack and damage negation curve scaling of the Scadutree Blessing. Now, the attack and damage negation will be “increased for the first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements”, and the second half has been made more gradual. Moreover, there is also a slight increase towards “attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements“.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers noticed a bug in the graphics settings. The ray tracing settings were automatically enabled due to previously loaded save data, which caused unexpected changes in the game’s visual quality and performance. </p>



<p>Players can now check the Ray Tracing Quality settings through the Settings and Graphics Settings options in the title or in-game menu. From this menu, players can set Automatic Ray Tracing Off or On. Lastly, FromSoftware will introduce more balancing updates and bug fixes through upcoming patches.&nbsp;</p>
