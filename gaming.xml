One year. Seven lucky gods. Twenty-two endings.</p><p><em>Rainbow Sea</em> is a multi-ending pixel-art <a title="Genres > Visual Novel [457 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/visual-novel">visual novel</a> based on the Japanese myth of the Seven Lucky Gods. It depicts a year in the life of a Human who was chosen as a candidate to become a god, living among the Seven Lucky Gods, who do not seem to open up much to her. You—as the Human—can explore the treasure ship and make choices to change the storyline. All twenty-two endings are true endings, and only you, the player, will be able to find what the real story hidden behind all of them is.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>You wake up in an unfamiliar storeroom where you can hear nothing but the sound of waves. As you are trying to figure out why you are here, your reflection in a mirror speaks to you. The reflection tells you to lie, then disappears.</p><p>When you leave the storeroom, you meet people who call themselves the Seven Lucky Gods. According to one of them, Daikoku, you are a Human who was chosen to become a god. Most of them do not seem to welcome your sudden arrival.</p><p>Once the treasure ship returns to the human world in a year, will you become a god and join the others on the ship? Will you return to your original world as a human? Or will you…?</p><p>Your bittersweet year with the Seven Lucky Gods begins.</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p>Move around the treasure ship, setting off trigers by talking to the gods and examining objects on the ship. Events are triggered when certain conditions are met, such as the level of affection from the gods, the weather, and the time of day. In the events, you can make choices to change the story.</p><p>Every real-life second counts as a minute in game, where you can be active from 6:00 AM to midnight. Note that if you are not eating or sleeping enough, you will fall asleep sooner than that.</p><p>After one year, on New Year’s Day, you will reach an ending, chosen depending on the events you have seen and your choices.</p><p>It takes roughly two hours to complete a playthrough.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Official Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="【Rainbow Sea】 promotion video" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1fKcZG5lZgU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="和風ドット絵アドベンチャー【虹の降る海】　紹介動画" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tktuvYoF7vo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That wasn’t necessarily true on YouTube. </p><p>But I don’t want you to take my word for it. I want you to download the lossless PNG screenshots I just captured, so you can peep pixels with me and decide for yourself!</p><p><strong>Important note: </strong><em>Do not right-click</em> to download the images you see below, do not even left-click them — they’re just visual aids so you know which image you’ll get. <strong>Left-click the link in each caption<em> </em></strong>to load the pictures, then download them; each should have a filesize well over 4MB. Optimally, you should then display them on a big 4K screen, like the one you might use with the PlayStation.</p><p>The above examples are the PS5 Pro compared to the original PS5’s faster-framerate “performance” mode, and they’re designed to show how you don’t have to sacrifice graphics for smooth 60fps speeds. But if you’re willing to tolerate the lower framerates of “Fidelity” mode, the advantage isn’t as clear-cut:</p><p>Sony didn’t offer comparo images for every title, but here are pictures from other games it used to represent the PS5 Pro’s graphics, too: </p><p>If you’re <em>really</em> dedicated, I suppose you could even try to find the same moment in the same game on your own PS5, grab your own screenshot, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22784404/nvidia-icat-dlss-spatial-temporal-upscaling-graphics">use Nvidia’s ICAT tool</a> to peep pixels like a pro.</p><p>Is it ridiculous that we’ve come to this? Maybe! But I don’t want you to think there’s no difference between PS5 and PS5 Pro graphics at 60fps: </p><p>There’s absolutely a difference — just perhaps not one that’s worth $700 to you. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, Ellison eventually pulled out of negotiations, at which point <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/annapurna-president-nathan-gary-exits-1235993653/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gary resigned</a>. Almost 30 other individuals, including division co-heads Deborah Mars and Nathan Vella, as well as the entire remaining staff of Annapurna Interactive, joined him.</p><p>“All 25 members of the Annapurna Interactive team collectively resigned,’’ Gary and the resigned staff said in a joint statement to Bloomberg. “This was one of the hardest decisions we have ever had to make and we did not take this action lightly.”</p><p>While negotiations were still ongoing, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/patrick-chu-upped-to-head-film-tv-annapurna-1235980517/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Annapurna Interactive re-hired former Epic Games executive Hector Sanchez</a> as its president of interactive and new media, and Paul Doyle as its head of strategy. IGN understands that Sanchez was expected to head up Annapurna's gaming efforts in Gary's absence once his part of the company was spun-off. With Gary now having resigned, Sanchez has taken the lead.</p><p>As Bloomberg reports and IGN has also heard, Sanchez has spoken with partner developers this week to reassure them that Annapurna will continue its existing contracts and replace departed staff. A spokesperson for Annapurna confirmed to IGN that this plan would include both backfilling certain roles, while also partnering with third-parties to fill gaps as needed.</p><p>"Our top priority is continuing to support our developer and publishing partners during this transition,” Ellison told Bloomberg. “We’re committed to not only our existing slate of games but also expanding our presence in the interactive space as we continue to look for opportunities to take a more integrated approach to linear and interactive storytelling across film and TV, gaming, and theater."</p><p>Annapurna Interactive, a division of Annapurna Pictures, has become known for its publishing catalogue of boutique, critically-acclaimed indies. In recent years, the label has seen success and awards for games like Cocoon, Stray, Neon White, The Artful Escape, Sayonara Wild Hearts, and more. Just last month, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/control-and-alan-wake-tv-and-movies-on-the-way-thanks-to-new-annapurna-partnership">Annapurna Pictures partnered with Alan Wake 2 developer Remedy Entertainment</a> to fund its ongoing development efforts as well as make TV and film versions of its IP. However, Annapurna Interactive has also been the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDPzZkx0cPs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">subject of an investigative report</a> by People Make Games alleging it supported multiple company founders known to be creating toxic work environments at partner studios.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

A. Salvatore, Han Solo’s faithful Wookiee partner, Rebel Alliance fixture, and big walking carpet Chewie bought the moisture farm. Not surprisingly, he died a hero, saving thousands of lives.</p><p>It was a pretty big deal, even for those Star Wars fans (like me) who didn’t read the Expanded Universe books and comics at the time. Vector Prime got a big promotional push, including a commercial featuring Mark Hamill doing voiceover as Luke Skywalker, and the book even made it to the New York Times Best Sellers list for four weeks.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/12/tarkin-1726177001848.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Steps along the way to the recreation of Peter Cushing as Tarkin in Rogue One. Image Credit: Lucasfilm</figcaption></figure></output><p>But that was then and this is now, where the EU is known as Star Wars Legends and “doesn’t count” anymore, and a character like Chewie seems unlikely to ever die in the modern Star Wars canon. No, a popular figure such as Chewbacca, who can be endlessly recast on the cheap – and who can continue to juice merchandising sales for untold generations to come – is probably doomed to live like some kind of outer space Renfield, beholden to do his master’s pop-culture bloodsucking forever. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A popular figure like Chewbacca, who can be endlessly recast – and who can continue to juice merchandising sales – is probably doomed to live forever.</p></div><p>It’s not just our favorite Wookiee who is consigned to this dire fate, of course. C-3PO and R2-D2 are, and will continue to be, similarly afflicted, but even characters that have died in the canon like Yoda and Jabba will continue to rise from the grave time and again to satisfy the Sarlacc-like Easter egg maw of the latest show or game (most recently for Yoda on The Acolyte and for Jabba in Star Wars Outlaws). And those are just the most obvious examples. Everyone from Nien Nunb to Baby Yoda to the guy who got his arm cut off in the cantina in A New Hope is up for grabs. (Ponda Baba. His name is Ponda Baba.)</p><p>I’m thinking about this today not just because of the news that Disney is embroiled in a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lucasfilm-sued-for-recreating-grand-moff-tarkin-actor-peter-cushings-image-in-rogue-one-a-star-wars-story"><u>lawsuit over the use of the late Peter Cushing’s likeness</u></a> as Grand Moff <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/14/the-best-and-worst-of-the-uncanny-valley-and-cg-movie-characters">Tarkin in Rogue One</a>, but also because of the passing of James Earl Jones on Monday. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/james-earl-jones-voice-acting-darth-vader-mufasa"><u>Jones of course was the voice of Darth Vader</u></a>, one of the most iconic characters not just in Star Wars but in all of cinema. The fact that the actor had <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/james-earl-jones-signs-off-on-ai-recreations-of-his-darth-vader-voice-as-he-looks-to-leave-the-legendary-role"><u>signed off on AI recreations</u></a> of his Vader voice reminds us that while he may be gone now, the Sith Lord can and almost certainly will continue to pop up in future Star Wars films and TV shows.</p><p>But Vader, or Anakin Skywalker if you will, actually died all the way back in 1983’s Return of the Jedi. And while, sure, prequels like Rogue One, flashbacks like in the Obi-Wan Kenobi show, and Force dream sequences (or whatever that was) in Ahsoka can bring a character back, we have to ask whether or not they <em>should</em> be bringing a classic figure like Vader back time and again. </p><p>Take the prequel trilogy, where Anakin’s origin story was told and he was portrayed first by Jake Lloyd and then Hayden Christensen. I would argue that whether or not you think those movies ultimately work as original stories, they at least were trying to do something new with Anakin, uncovering the events that led to his downfall over the span of three whole movies. Can the same be said for Rogue One or Obi-Wan Kenobi, where Vader was more of a “how cool is it that we brought him back” play than anything else?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/12/threepio-r2-1726178051004.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>"I say, R2, did you know we will never be allowed to feel the sweet embrace of eternal rest?"</figcaption></figure></output><p>Of course, the threat of living forever in an ever-diminishing series of Star Wars vehicles has now extended beyond the masked and non-human characters. The debate over the use of Cushing in Rogue One some 22 years after he died isn’t a new one; ditto Mark Hamill’s cut-scene-like returns as a younger Luke Skywalker in The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett. Even our three main heroes from the original trilogy — Luke, Leia, and Han — are all dead now in the canon, but they’ve each come back in some form or another too. Plus, in the case of the late Carrie Fisher, digital trickery was also employed to (unconvincingly) insert old footage of her into The Rise of Skywalker.</p><p>Indeed, the notion of the dead returning to the land of the living goes back to the very first Star Wars movie when Obi-Wan’s ghost whispered, “Run, Luke, run!” But that was an unexpected and cool extension of Luke’s story, not a gimmick used to sell more tickets or Alec Guinness plushies.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Ranking the Star Wars Disney+ Live-Action TV Shows</h3></div></output><p>Andor, which is the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-tv-series-live-action"><u>best of the live-action Star Wars shows</u></a>, also features the return of a dead character via prequel story, but the compelling tale of how an ordinary man becomes a rebel during the age of the Empire works because of the show’s excellent writing and performances, not to mention the avoidance of cute cameos for the sake of them. Alas, that is the exception rather than the rule in the Star Wars universe now. </p><p>So pour one out not just for the EU version of Chewie, who died saving thousands rather than continuing on forever as a shambling echo of his former greatness, but also for Threepio, R2, Vader, Yoda, and all the rest who will never be allowed to truly move on. They will persist so that the Star Wars franchise can continue to, sort of, live.</p><p><em>Talk to Scott Collura on Twitter at </em><a href="https://twitter.com/ScottCollura" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>@ScottCollura</strong></em></a><em>, or listen to his </em><a href="https://www.spreaker.com/show/transporter-room-3-the-star-trek-podcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Star Trek podcast, Transporter Room 3</strong></em></a><em>.

<p>Bandai Namco has finally confirmed the news that all Budokai Tenkaichi fans have been waiting for, as Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s latest trailer unveils characters from the GT series.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many fans were worried that GT characters might get skipped for Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, even though they were available in the previous Budokai Tenkaichi games, as GT is considered non-canon. However, the latest trailer features action-packed scenes with some of the fan-favourite characters from this series.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO – GT Character Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xrzk0T91yd8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrzk0T91yd8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a> starts with Kid Goku (GT) showcasing his attacks and Super Saiyan 1 and 3 transformations during his battle against Baby Vegeta. Pan is also introduced during this section. As the fight continues, Baby Vegeta showcases his transformations, including Super Baby 1 and Super Baby 2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Further in this battle, players see Uub (GT) in action, showcasing his diverse moveset and the Majuub transformation. Then came the most popular characters from the GT arc, such as Goku Super Saiyan 4 and Vegeta Super Saiyan 4. Super Baby 2 also displayed the ability to transform into a Great Ape Baby during the battle, and Goku uses his famous x10 Kamehameha to defeat him.</p>



<p>The trailer’s last segment reveals the GT series’ final villain, Syn Shenron and his transformation, Omega Shenron. The final character shown in the trailer is the iconic fusion of Super Saiyan 4 Goku and Vegeta, Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta. Those are all the GT characters showcased in the latest Dragon Ball Sparking Zero trailer; the next could feature characters from the Super arc.&nbsp;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">When it comes to PC gaming, most of the attention is understandably given to the desktop tower itself, but the components <em>outside</em> your computer require just as much consideration as those on the inside--and selecting the best PC gaming monitor is arguably the most important of these external devices. After all, what good is that high-end graphics card or processor if you don't have a monitor that can properly display the visuals they're rendering.</p><p dir="ltr">Like other computer hardware, picking the right PC gaming monitor can be difficult. There's a bevy of display options, including different sizes, display resolutions, aspect ratios, refresh rates, and more. There's even the question of whether you want a flat or curved screen. So, to help you find the right screen for you, we've rounded up our picks for the best PC gaming monitors in 2024. You'll find models from a wide range of categories below, including 4K, 1440p, and 1080p monitors, ultrawide models, and options for various refresh rates. We've even got a few picks for portable players and consoles.

Some swear by curved displays, while others can't stand them. And then there's the fact that your gaming rig significantly impacts monitor performance. You can't take advantage of high refresh rates, 4K resolutions, and other performance-related traits without the proper hardware.</p><p>With that said, our recommendation for the best gaming monitor sits at the sweet spot of price and performance, making it a great all-around pick for most players.</p><p>The Asus ROG Strix XG32AQ is a 32-inch flat gaming monitor that punches above its $395 list price--and it's often on sale for less. Its picture quality hits levels normally found on models that cost hundreds of dollars more.

In fact, the 27-inch display's numbers look excellent on paper--it has a 1440p resolution, is capable of up to 180Hz refresh rate with 1ms input response time via DisplayPort (or 120Hz via HDMI), and supports multiple VRR technologies. It also uses mini-LED backlighting--something you don't typically find on lower-priced models like this.</p><p dir="ltr">So, where does the "budget" part come in? Well, it's mostly in the actual viewing experience and a small handful of missing features compared to other models. Many reviews note a visible flicker when using G-Sync or FreeSync, as well as diminished contrast and smeary blacks in well-lit rooms. It also uses HDMI 2.0 rather than the latest 2.1 standard. While that is less of an issue on a 1440p monitor, it does lock you out of HDMI 2.1-specific features like eARC that will likely become more common in the future. Luckily, it supports DisplayPort 1.4, which enables its 180Hz refresh rate.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Processor-DisplayHDR-FreeSync-LS49CG954SNXZA/dp/B0C48D7Q22?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/SAMSUNG-Processor-DisplayHDR-FreeSync-LS49CG954SNXZA\/dp\/B0C48D7Q22?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Processor-DisplayHDR-FreeSync-LS49CG954SNXZA/dp/B0C48D7Q22?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20">Best Premium 49-Inch Gaming Monitor</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Processor-DisplayHDR-FreeSync-LS49CG954SNXZA/dp/B0C48D7Q22?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/SAMSUNG-Processor-DisplayHDR-FreeSync-LS49CG954SNXZA\/dp\/B0C48D7Q22?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Processor-DisplayHDR-FreeSync-LS49CG954SNXZA/dp/B0C48D7Q22?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20">Samsung Odyssey G9 G95SC</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Size</strong>: 49 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Panel type: </strong>Quantum Dot OLED</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Style:</strong> Curved Super-Ultrawide 1000R</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Resolution:</strong> 5120 x 1440</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Refresh rate:</strong> 240Hz</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Response Time:</strong> 1ms</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>VRR:</strong> Nvidia G-Sync, AMD FreeSync Premium Pro</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Connectivity:</strong> DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI 2.1, USB, 3.5mm headphone jack</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Speakers:</strong> No</li></ul><p dir="ltr">There are multiple models in Samsung's Odyssey G9 line and all of them are excellent high-end monitors, but the G95SC is our pick for the best among the bunch.

Even better, it can reach 240Hz refresh rate via DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.1, and it supports multiple VRR formats including Nvidia G-Sync, AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, and the built-in VRR capabilities of HDMI 2.1.

Those that want something above 60Hz refresh rate will want to look else where, but for those that prioritize resolution and affordability above all else, the Asus TUF Gaming VG289Q1A is a perfect choice.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Gaming-Monitor-Dimming/dp/B0B3SHR8TF?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Sony-INZONE-Gaming-Monitor-Dimming\/dp\/B0B3SHR8TF?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Gaming-Monitor-Dimming/dp/B0B3SHR8TF?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20">Best Gaming Monitor For PS5</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Gaming-Monitor-Dimming/dp/B0B3SHR8TF?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Sony-INZONE-Gaming-Monitor-Dimming\/dp\/B0B3SHR8TF?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Gaming-Monitor-Dimming/dp/B0B3SHR8TF?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20">Sony Inzone M9</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Size</strong>: 27 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Panel type:</strong> IPS</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Style:</strong> Flat panel</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Resolution:</strong> 3840 x 2160</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Refresh rate:</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Response Time: </strong>1ms</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>VRR:</strong> Nivida G-Sync, VESA Adaptive-Sync</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Connectivity:</strong> HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 1.4, USB-C, USB, 3.5mm headphone jack</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Speakers:</strong> Yes</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Sony's Inzone M9, like all Inzone monitors and headphones, was designed for PC gaming. However, Sony made sure to include full support for the PlayStation 5's range of visual and audio features. The M9 is pricey, but it is a high-end monitor with impressive specs and performance. It's also arguably the most stylish monitor on this list, and the black and white color scheme perfectly matches the PS5.</p><p dir="ltr">At 27 inches, its size is roughly in step with many of the other picks on this list, and its 4K UHD resolution, VESA HDR400 certification, and 144Hz refresh rate with VRR support via HDMI 2.1 and Nvidia G-Sync can take full advantage of the PS5's video output modes (and the Xbox Series X|S, for that matter). While the M9 contrast ratio won't outclass an OLED screen, its local dimming backlighting allows for deeper black levels than other IPS panels.</p><p dir="ltr">While these features are great for all consoles and PC, the Sony Inzone M9 also features PS5-specific features like Auto HDR Tone Mapping and Auto Genre Picture Mode. If you use the M9 on PC, you'll have access to the Inzone Hub, a proprietary app that lets you create custom sound profiles for each game.</p><p dir="ltr">For a cheaper alternative, you can grab the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Gaming-Monitor-NVIDIA/dp/B0B6KHVR3K?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inzone M3</a> instead, which is largely identical to the M9 except for a lower 1080p resolution but an even higher 240Hz refresh rate.

It's rare for 1440p monitors to break the 240Hz range (and even less likely for 4K models), but the ROG Swift PG27AQN is one of the few to offer a super-high 360Hz refresh rate. To help you get the most out of the 27-inch monitor's high refresh rate, it offers a DisplayPort 1.4 connection and supports Nvidia G-Sync for VRR, as well as Nvidia's Reflex Latency Analyzer, which can point out performance obstacles (there's also an HDMI 2.0 connection, though that caps at "just" 240Hz).</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, those features will only work with Nvidia cards, but even those without the right hardware can still enjoy the monitor's smooth picture and low response time.

The higher refresh rate is complemented by Nividia's G-Sync, Reflex Latency Analyzer, and ULMB, all of which help reduce screen tearing and blurring. The monitor's IPS screen also allows for low 0.5ms input latency--add that all up, and you have one of the best display for highly accurate gameplay performance and super-smooth visuals.

While it's lacking come features you'd find on other, larger monitors, its portable nature and surprisingly high resolution make some of those a moot point. The tiny 15.6-inch OLED screen offers a 4K resolution, which makes for a a highly concentrated pixel density nearing that of a flagship smartphone. Unsurprisingly, it only has a 60Hz refresh rate, but 4K @ 60 is excellent output for a screen this small, and it has a super-low response time for virtually imperceptible input latency. For connectivity, it offer a mini HDMI 2.0 port, USB-C connect, and a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stanley-kubrick-the-shining-compendium-stephen-king-adaptation-preorder-guide/1100-6526309/">The Shining Compendium Box Set Is A Staggeringly Ambitious Examination Of Kubrick's Horror Classic</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/walmart-exclusive-lego-batman-bundle-comes-with-three-sets-for-only-50/1100-6526223/">Walmart-Exclusive Lego Batman Bundle Comes With Three Sets For Only $50</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-popular-pokemon-labyrinth-board-game-is-getting-a-glow-in-the-dark-edition/1100-6526286/">The Popular Pokemon Labyrinth Board Game Is Getting A Glow-In-The-Dark Edition</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cult-of-the-lamb-the-first-verse-graphic-novel-is-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6526253/">Cult Of The Lamb: The First Verse Graphic Novel Is Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trigun-manga-preorders-amazon/1100-6523338/">Save Big On Trigun Deluxe Edition Manga Ahead Of Next Week's Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-nightmare-before-christmas-manga-is-returning-to-haunt-the-winter-holidays/1100-6526230/">The Nightmare Before Christmas Manga Is Returning To Haunt The Winter Holidays</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sixth-sense-and-signs-are-finally-releasing-on-4k-blu-ray/1100-6526328/">The Sixth Sense And Signs Are Finally Releasing On 4K Blu-Ray</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/berserk-the-complete-1997-tv-series-is-only-37-at-amazon-best-price-yet/1100-6524954/">Berserk: The Complete 1997 TV Series Is Only $37 At Amazon, Best Price Yet</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/entire-annapurna-interactive-team-resigns/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has just been revealed that the entire staff at Annapurna Interactive has quit, with 25 employees collectively resigning in solidarity. It was recorded as ‘one of the hardest decisions’ the team ever had to make, and it comes following a failure to ‘spin off’ the video game branch of Annapurna into a separate entity.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-did-not-take-this-action-lately">‘We Did Not Take This Action Lately’</h2>



<p>In a report published by Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, it was confirmed that the leadership team at Annapurna Interactive, a game publishing unit, led an exodus that saw 25 employees resign. Per the report, it was explained that negotiations to break Annapurna Interactive away from the parent company fell flat, after which Nathan Gary, the firm’s president, stepped down.</p>



<p>As the timeline goes, Nathan Gary exited the company on September 6, and in the days that followed, the other employees – including executives – followed.</p>



<p>In a statement, Megan Ellison, the founder of Annapurna Pictures and the daughter of Larry Ellison, a prolific billionaire, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our top priority is continuing to support our developer and publishing partners during this transition. We’re committed to not only our existing slate of games but also expanding our presence in the interactive space as we continue to look for opportunities to take a more integrated approach to linear and interactive storytelling across film and TV, gaming, and theater.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Understandably, this move has left partners deeply concerned about the future of their projects, which are set to be published under the Annapurna Interactive label. Historically, the brand has offered its publishing expertise to games like Stray, Outer Wilds, Neon White, Open Roads, and What Remains of Edith Finch.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-12/annapurna-video-game-team-resigns-leaving-partners-scrambling?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In Bloomberg’s report</a>, it was written that all existing games will stay under Annapurna Interactive and continue as normal.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-top-5-features-of-marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics.979845/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-top-5-features-of-marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">It’s more than just a new coat of paint.</h2></div><section><p>If you grew up as an arcade lover in the ’90s, chances are you logged countless hours playing Capcom’s Marvel games. They were a staple of arcades around the world and helped define the fighting game genre. And now, a selection of those classic games have been brought back as part of one package, Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics.</p><p>It brings these games to modern consoles (which is particularly notable for one of the games) and adds lots of new features, some of which make them more accessible to new players than ever before. Here are what we think are the top 5 features of this collection:</p><h2><strong>A Journey Across Time</strong></h2><p>The collection consists of seven games from throughout the ’90s and early 2000s: The Punisher (1993), X-Men: Children of the Atom (1994), Marvel Super Heroes (1995), X-Men vs. Street Fighter (1996), Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter (1997), Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes (1998), and Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes (2000).</p><p>Six of these are classic fighting games that show the evolution of gameplay over time, from the classic 1v1 battles of Children of the Atom to the 3v3 tag-team matches of New Age of Heroes. Plus, with each installment, you get access to a different roster of characters. There are dozens of characters in all — superheroes like Captain America and Wolverine, Street Fighter mainstays like Ryu and Chun-Li, and iconic characters from other Capcom franchises like Jill Valentine and Mega Man.</p><h2><strong>The Punisher on Console</strong></h2><p>You might have noticed that we said there are seven games in the compilation and six of them are fighting games. The seventh is The Punisher, a side-scrolling beat ’em up that is particularly notable because it was the first game in the partnership between Capcom and Marvel and this is the first time in 30 years that it’s been made available on home consoles.</p><p>It puts you in the shoes of the titular Punisher, with Nick Fury as the second character if you play co-op. Your goal is to take down Kingpin and his organization, and in classic beat ’em up style, you need to take down all the henchmen in a level before having a showdown with that level’s boss.</p><h2><strong>Online Functionality</strong></h2><p>The experience of playing in the arcade was always more fun with more people, and now you can emulate that experience at home with online play. In The Punisher, that means you can team up with someone online for co-op with the ability to drop in and out whenever you want. You can also spectate in other players’ games and take part in High Score Challenges, where you compete under set rules for the top spot on the leaderboard.</p><p>For the six fighting games, you can battle fellow players online. Casual matches are low stakes, custom matches let you set unique rules, and ranked matches will see you trying to climb the leaderboard as you amass League Points. And rollback netcode provides a smooth online experience across the board.</p><h2><strong>Quality of Life Updates</strong></h2><p>The compilation adds several features aimed at letting you experience gameplay how you want. If you’re a veteran player who’s feeling nostalgic about the original arcade experience, you can alter the display settings to fit your preference. You can adjust the display’s size to re-create the dimensions of an arcade screen and use filters to make your display look more like the original graphics.</p><p>For newer players, there are difficulty options for single-player content that can help you get the hang of combat. Plus, one-button specials allow you to pull off flashy moves without needing to input complicated button combos (one-button specials are not allowed in ranked online matches). In single-player content, you can pause and unpause, create quick save files, and quickly retry difficult boss fights.</p><h2><strong>New Content</strong></h2><p>There are lots of fun new pieces of content. There’s a music menu that allows you to pick any game from the compilation and listen to its original soundtrack. An image gallery gives you access to development docs and art that has never been made available to the public before. Plus, all the fighting games now have Training Mode, with options for opponent behavior, input displays, hit boxes, and damage numbers.</p><p>Whether you’re a veteran looking for some nostalgia or a newcomer who wants to see what the fuss is about, this is the best opportunity to play seven classic titles. Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics is digitally available now on PS4, Switch, and PC, and the physical version will launch November 22. An Xbox One version will be coming in 2025.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-exclusive-first-hands-on-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It’s been ten long years since Dragon Age: Inquisition and the expectations for the next game in the series, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, seem impossible. A full decade, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-past-and-present-of-dragon-age-4-1833913351" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a bevy of behind-the-scenes changes</u></a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-eliminates-50-jobs-to-match-studios-changing-needs"><u>cuts at BioWare</u></a>, and a somewhat divisive start when its <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/first-dragon-age-the-veilguard-trailer-revealed-alongside-familiar-faces-xbox-showcase-2024"><u>unveiling began in earnest in June</u></a> made me a little worried for my most highly anticipated game of the year. But one of my biggest concerns was my impression, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-the-first-preview"><u>based on early previews</u></a>, that it was headed in the direction of being a linear action game rather than its more open-world predecessor. While Dragon Age is known for changing its style with each installment, I hoped dearly that it wouldn’t lose too much of the DA DNA I fell in love with.</p><p>After hours of hands-on time spread across two days, I’m pleased to say I walked away with excitement and curiosity, but mostly, <em>relief</em> to wave many of my concerns goodbye<em>.</em> My time with The Veilguard covered a wide smattering of things: the incredibly expansive character creator (more on that later), the introductory quests, a faction mission, and a companion quest a little deeper into the game. But I was mostly pleased with my ability to just explore Northern Thedas in all its gorgeously designed glory, experiencing a setting in Dragon Age lore that we’ve really only heard about. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>To be clear, The Veilguard isn’t the open-world playground that Inquisition was – as game director Corinne Busche has previously stated, it’s more “mission-based.” But what impressed me after the first few hours was how much exploration can still be done in the various regions, as well as the impact the player character, Rook, can have on those regions. Consider it something of a mix of Dragon Age 2 and Inquisition – the more streamlined approach of the former with the rich, geographically and sociopolitically diverse world of the latter.</p><p>Of course, some of the bigger artstyle, combat, and gameplay changes will be subject to personal taste. But after my time with Dragon Age: The Veilguard, I left feeling like these ten long years just might’ve been worth the wait.</p><h2><strong>Getting Acquainted</strong></h2><p>As fans have already seen from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-releases-first-ever-gameplay-footage-ahead-of-tuesdays-reveal"><u>the first gameplay trailer</u></a>, players are dropped right into the city of Minrathous in the middle of the action as Solas prepares a ritual that will devastate Thedas. Luckily, our old friend Varric has recruited you to help, and it barely takes a couple of minutes for the game to put the focus on Rook. After a surprisingly effective and succinct story recap from Varric, there are a number of aspects The Veilguard starts easing you into.</p><p>For one: the combat. Gone are the days of Dragon Age: Origins’ more CRPG-inspired tactical system, offering a style that’s a mix of quick action and a mechanic where you can pause and pull up your radial menu. While this absolutely does take some getting used to, and it’ll be a gradual process to create what could be a highly customized build while learning all your companions’ different abilities, it didn’t take me long to actually start having fun with it. </p><p>I largely played mage and rogue builds during my hands-on time, and also quickly started to lean on certain companions’ abilities. For one, the mage healing ability was essential – for one particularly difficult Revenant, I basically established a pattern where I was only using Bellara’s mana to heal me, dodging and playing it safe when it got too risky. Neve’s ability to slow time was also one I kept returning to, offering a bit more control on the battlefield when the situation got fast-paced. As for glass cannon builds, you’ll want to have a warrior around to taunt your enemies out of your way. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Different companions have different combo options together, and there are certainly opportunities to build team synergy. </p></div><p>Like a <em>whole</em> lot in The Veilguard, combat revolves around your companions, even though you can’t fully take control of them like in previous Dragon Age games. Different companions have different combo options together, and there are certainly opportunities to build team synergy. Oh, and you’ll want to listen to your companions in combat too, as they’ll occasionally drop some useful hints.</p><p>But combat aside, your dialogue choices, your Rook’s background (tied to one of six factions you can choose), and the consistent decisions you make are immediately important, which shouldn’t be too surprising for fans of BioWare games. The dialogue wheel is back, of course, as is the approval/disapproval system, but I was surprised to see that The Veilguard actually explains the consequences of some of your dialogue choices in very clear terms. It’s a variation of the “so and so will remember that” system, but more specific.</p><p>Take, for example, my first confrontation with Solas, aka Fen'harel aka the Dread Wolf. I chose a more sarcastic, humorous approach with him, and at the end of our confrontation, text on the side of the screen informed me that I have “traded verbal jabs with Solas.” It was far from the only occurrence of this sort of text, and it leaves me curious as to how your relationships with various characters will build and branch out over time based on your attitude.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard - 15 Exclusive Screenshots Taken Using Photo Mode</h3></div></output><p>Speaking of consequences, it quickly became clear to me that there would consistently be <em>tons</em> of choices in The Veilguard that’ll have lasting results. It probably seems like I’m stating the obvious here, but I got the sense that even more of these kinds of choices might be peppered throughout than the usual BioWare game. Right at the beginning, for instance, I made a decision that led to Harding getting injured, and she remained bruised-up for the remainder of the next couple of hours. I felt like a real jerk about it, and that was probably the point; Dragon Age: The Veilguard seemed to be telling me, right from the start, that I’m going to feel like a jerk <em>a lot</em>. Without spoiling too much, you’ll be able to see some of your progression and choices in the environment around you as well. </p><p>But, once introductions were out of the way, it was time to explore the wide world of Thedas and see its past and present collide. </p><h2><strong>(Veil)Jumping Into the World</strong></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, one of my biggest worries was that The Veilguard could end up being more linear in its approach, trading branching gameplay for a straight line. And sure, the opening hours – essentially, the tutorial zone – are a little railroad-y, save for a couple of key decisions you have to make. But once you’re past that and more established within Act 1, you’re much more free to tackle quests as you please as you unlock more and more regions.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>You do this via The Crossroads. For those who aren’t brushed up on their Dragon Age lore, that’s a nexus between the waking world of Thedas and the metaphysical realm of The Fade through which the ancient elves would travel through magical mirrors called Eluvians. You now use the Eluvians for that same purpose, and to unlock new regions, you have to fight through certain areas of The Crossroads before you can start fast-traveling to them.</p><p>Unlocking said regions opens up a vast network of areas and, not unlike past Dragon Age games, they’re dramatically different from one another. Take, for example, the Arlathan Forest, a gorgeous, colorful region whose aesthetics mix greenery with elven magic. You can see nugs burrow into the grass, magical artifacts abound, and there’s a vast array of nature to simply just admire. You’re hit with a massive tone shift, however, when you head to Hossberg; currently under siege by the Blight, here is where you’ll see some of the more horror-inspired aesthetics and, frankly, just some of the grosser aspects of the Blight. While The Veilguard’s tone certainly leans more high fantasy in places like The Crossroads, don’t worry; those who miss the gore and dark fantasy of Origins will find that too in places where the Blight has spread.</p><p>But I couldn’t help but spend a lot of my time just running about in Treviso, the bustling city that’s home to the Antivan Crows faction. For one thing, a lively city feels like a novelty in Dragon Age. But there was simply so much to explore that I kept getting sidetracked – a merchant with unique items here, a new quest to pick up over there, a random combat encounter here. And that’s just when I wasn’t looking around for a cat or dog to pet (because yes, you can pet the cats and dogs). </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Those who miss the gore and dark fantasy of Origins will find that in places where the Blight has spread.</p></div><p>Outside of the cats and dogs, there are some unique ways to interact with the environment too. Each companion has an environmental ability, some of which came in quite handy for me. In my time in the Arlathan Forest, I frequently called upon Bellara, whose environmental ability allows her to tinker with magical artifacts. In a nice quality-of-life addition, your companions don’t even need to be in your party in order for you to use these abilities. (As an aside, another one of my favorite quality of life additions is the fact that party banter pauses and picks up again later if you trigger combat, a cutscene, or anything else that would interrupt their dialogue. That’s right – no more awkward standing around in order to hear the complete conversation).</p><p>If you’re feeling overwhelmed, the difficulty and accessibility options do allow for about just as much or as little hand-holding as you need. For example, with one Antivan Crows quest I was doing, I could turn the navigation on and simply follow the game’s guidance, or turn it off and look for clues in the environment to follow – in this case, The Crows’ purple symbol, painted on certain walls. I also just happened to be playing an Antivan Crow Rook while completing this quest, which led to some fun dialogue options.</p><p>Once I was in the thick of things, I could clearly see the “okay okay, we heard the complaints” features in The Veilguard. Specifically, addressing the infamous<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/open-world-rpgs-and-the-hinterlands-problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> Hinterlands Problem</u></a>, a reference to the first open-world area players visit in Inquisition. The zone was packed with more than 50 sidequests, many of which boiled down to mere fetch quests, and left many players drowning in a bevy of checklists that felt inconsequential to the story. The Veilguard has boiled this down quite a lot – you’re still free to explore, but the scope isn’t nearly as dizzying, and the quests point back to the main story, a region or faction, or a companion. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard - Preview Gallery</h3></div></output><p>Another clear reaction to criticisms of Inquisition are our villains in The Veilguard, Elgar'nan and Ghilan'nain. The two elven gods feel much more present throughout the events of the early game than Corypheus, the frankly lackluster baddie of Inquisition. </p><p>While there’s a whole lot more Thedas to see and talk about, I’d be remiss if I didn’t bring it back home to The Lighthouse.</p><h2><strong>The Base of Operations</strong></h2><p>The Lighthouse will likely be the most important location of The Veilguard, serving as the hub for you and your companions. Each one of your companions has their own room, and conveniently, a light shines outside of their door when they have a cutscene available. Once you get further into Act 1, it certainly starts to feel more lived-in, and you can discover some pretty charming character quirks. For example, I found that Manfred, Emmrich’s skeletal assistant, enjoys spending time on the balcony, and I even got a few games of Rock, Paper, Scissors in with him. </p><p>It’s also, obviously, where you’re able to do some housekeeping, especially when it comes to The Caretaker. This wildly helpful spirit is always standing by to help you enchant and upgrade armor for you and your companions.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A lot’s changed in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, but there was so much I was relieved to see stay.</p></div><p>But I found The Lighthouse somewhat symbolic of one of the biggest challenges this game is facing: bringing in new players while honoring the now incredibly vast lore that Dragon Age has built across the games, comic books, short stories, and more. Basically, if you were worried that the name change from Dragon Age: Dreadwolf would mean less Solas, think again – his history, along with the history of the Evanuris, are baked into The Lighthouse, and you learn more and more about the threat you face as you unlock Solas’ murals with various wolf statues. You even get to see some of his memories firsthand.</p><p>As a lore nerd, I very much appreciated this, as well as the various other callbacks to series history. The Origins fans will likely love the Grey Warden-heavy quests, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-will-allow-you-to-import-your-choices-from-previous-games-through-the-character-creator"><u>we already know the Inquisitor</u></a> (the protagonist from Dragon Age: Inquisition) will be involved in some way, as you can recreate them and select your world states in the character creator. But I do wonder if it’ll overwhelm new players, which BioWare seems to be courting with its action-heavy combat system.</p><p>That’s why it helps, at least, to have something of an outsider like Rook to take the helm of The Veilguard. Plus, the scrappiness of Rook reminded me a bit of playing as Hawke in Dragon Age 2, rather than the more “chosen one”-esque protagonists of the Warden in Origins and the Inquisitor in Inquisition.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In short, <em>a lot</em>’s changed in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, but there was so much I was relieved to see stay: the focus on companions and romance, the rich lore, and a gorgeous world to explore. Needless to say, there’s still a ton of The Veilguard that I haven’t seen, especially if it’s as big as Origins and Inquisition (and it certainly seems like it). But after finishing my preview, I found myself even more eager to dive into it – and much more hopeful that this could be the hit BioWare needs. </p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

Today--on the same day the game launched on mobile devices--developer LocalThunk has seemingly confirmed a feature that looks like a glitch, but is instead working as intended.</p><p>This exploit, which was brought to light in a YouTube video by BelenosBear, involves the Misprint joker card, and more specifically, it centers around the seemingly random text that flashes in the Misprint’s ability text.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pQznnrzeBk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2pQznnrzeBk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Basically, if you pause during a Balatro run, go to your collection of cards in the pause menu, and then go to Misprint, once in a while random numbers, letters, and symbols will flash in the ability text. As it turns out, those sequences aren't random, and they actually tell you the top card of your deck through the numbers and letters that appear; in BelenosBear’s video, for example, a sequence that ends in “4S” produces the four of spades on the next draw, while “9H” produces the nine of hearts.</p><p>BelenosBear posted their video to X, and the official Balatro account acknowledged not only that the exploit exists, but also that it’s been a part of the game since launch. The account first posted a GIF of the game’s mascot Joker smiling, before following that up with the post below:</p><p>Balatro is available now on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC. The mobile versions on both iOS and Android--along with a special Balatro+ version for Apple Arcade subscribers--launched earlier today.</p>

			<p>The entire staff of Annapurna Interactive, the publisher of multiple celebrated titles, including the well-known cat game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stray-blade-review-unepic-journey/">Stray</a>, reportedly resigned this month after a dispute with its owner.</p>
<p>According to a new&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-12/annapurna-video-game-team-resigns-leaving-partners-scrambling?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcyNjE3NzQyOSwiZXhwIjoxNzI2NzgyMjI5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTSlBZWklUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.BpoA_wBJDrNbDbgj_LjnVUJQg6SM_vsIzWUEM6v85xE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg report</a>, the publisher's president, Nathan Gary, and his team had been negotiating with Annapurna's owner, Megan Ellison, to spin off the video game division as an independent entity. The negotiations ended when Ellison pulled out, prompting Gary and the other executive to resign. The rest of the staff followed shortly after</span>.</p>
<p>In a statement provided to Bloomberg, Ellison confirmed that Annapurna's priority is to continue supporting its developer and publishing partners during this transition. The company is also committed to expanding its presence in the interactive space by continuing to look for new opportunities.</p>
<p>Development teams partnered with Annapurna Interactive are obviously scrambling to understand what this all means for future projects. New president Hector Sanchez, one of the publisher's co-founders who was brought back last month, reportedly told developers that all contracts will be honored and staff will be replaced.</p>
<p>Annapurna Interactive provides various services to partners, including funding, quality assurance, localization, and marketing, so it's understandable the confusion among developers whose projects may never see the light of day if the publisher folds. Among the successful games published by the company are the aforementioned Stray, Cocoon, Outer Wilds, What Remains of Edith Finch, and many others.</p>

According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-12/annapurna-video-game-team-resigns-leaving-partners-scrambling?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcyNjE3NzQyOSwiZXhwIjoxNzI2NzgyMjI5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTSlBZWklUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.BpoA_wBJDrNbDbgj_LjnVUJQg6SM_vsIzWUEM6v85xE">Bloomberg</a>, Annapurna Interactive President Nathan Gary and his team had been in the midst of a negotiation to spin the division off into its own independent entity. When Ellison pulled back from said negotiations, Gary and other top staff decided to resign and were followed by around two dozen other staff members.</p>
<p>"Our top priority is continuing to support our developer and publishing partners during this transition,” Ellison told Bloomberg when asked for comment. She also noted the company's commitment to their existing games, as well as expanding their presence in the interactive space across film, TV, and gaming.</p>
<p>This development has led to a bit of a mess as developers partnered with Annapurna rush to figure out what this means for in-progress projects. Annapurna had been tasked with funding games, handling quality assurance, localization and marketing. Game makers working with Annapurna have been scrambling over the last few days to try and figure out if the company still plans to honor those agreements.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the company did tell Bloomberg that all existing games and projects will remain under Annapurna, as well as replace staff who left.</p>
<p>Annapurna is well known for their publishing chops including the critically acclaimed <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="253e212b-e5d4-4268-ba6a-be3eec1408ca" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stray-review">Stray</a> </em>and <em>Outer Wilds</em>. Last month the company announced plans to partner with Remedy to bring <em>Alan Wake</em> and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9e85d597-36e4-4a59-b420-c18f463b0f42" href="https://techraptor.net/games/control"><em>Control</em></a> to TV productions.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a> - the video game publisher behind the acclaimed likes of Outer Wilds, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/what-remains-of-edith-finch">What Remains of Edith Finch</a>, and Cocoon - has reportedly seen a complete exodus of staff following a dispute with the company's owner, causing "chaos" among developer partners.
</p>
<p>
According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-12/annapurna-video-game-team-resigns-leaving-partners-scrambling">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, around two dozen employees - including Annapurna Interactive president Nathan Gary and other executives - resigned after negotiations with Annapurna owner Megan Ellison broke down. Gary and his time had reportedly been negotiating to spin off Annapurna Interactive - Annapurna's video-game publishing wing - as an independent entity, but ultimately failed to reach an agreement with Ellison.
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg claims the departures have caused "chaos" among Annapurna Interactive's game developer partners - who've all signed deals with the publisher to secure the likes of funding, QA, and marketing - as they've sought reassurances about their projects' future. However, an Annapurna spokesperson confirmed to Bloomberg that all existing games and projects will remain with the company, while new president Hector Sanchez is said to have told developers all contracts will be honoured and that all Annapurna Interactive staff will be replaced.

<p>
"Our top priority is continuing to support our developer and publishing partners during this transition," Ellison said in a statement provided to Bloomberg. "We're committed to not only our existing slate of games but also expanding our presence in the interactive space as we continue to look for opportunities to take a more integrated approach to linear and interactive storytelling across film and TV, gaming, and theatre."
</p>
<p>
Annapurna has already announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blade-runner-2033-and-everything-else-from-annapurnas-latest-showcase">broad slate of new titles</a> set to launch over the next few years, including developer No Code's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a>, Matt Newell's Lushfoil Photography Sim, Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur's Mixtape, Messhof's Ghost Bike, and Annapurna's first internally developed game, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a> 2033: Labyrinth.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/bully-rockstar-pc-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/category/back-to-school" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As part of our Back to School week</a>, I <em>had </em>planned on playing through Rockstar's <em>Bully </em>and comparing Jimmy's experience at a strict boarding school with my own.</p><p>I didn't <em>attend </em>a boarding school, but after graduating high school I worked in one for a year in the UK (if you know what a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_year" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> gap year</a> is, this was mine). I mostly did odd jobs wherever my skillset could best be employed: some sports coaching here, some history and art tutoring there, alongside some general supervision of kids in the boarding house common spaces after school hours. Which all sounds very adult, but I was actually just <em>17 years old </em>when I started the job. Now that I type that out, it seems kinda fucked up. Maybe I shouldn't have been allowed to do that, especially since I was sometimes legally responsible for the welfare of senior students who were 19. One Italian kid I remember had a <em>beard</em>.</p><p>Despite the school I worked at being in England and <em>Bully</em>'s Bullworth Academy being set in <em>New</em> England, I figured there were enough similarities between the two--the uniforms, the strict regime, the weird emphasis on violence and sex so many of the cooped-up kids seemed obsessed with--to write a piece on.</p><p>But then I actually installed and tried to play the PC's <em>Scholarship Edition</em> of <em>Bully</em>, a game I remember from almost 20 years ago as being pretty good, and Jesus Christ. It's bad.&nbsp;</p><p>First up, while the game nominally supported 4K, actually opting for that resolution broke its display, and I had to go into the game's executable options to fix it. Not a great start. It's not the only area we’ve come a long way from since 2006. <em>Bully</em>'s camera movement and player movement aren't tracked at the same speed, so moving the camera around behind the player while also moving the character causes you to run in weird directions, unable to move in a straight line for more than a few seconds at a time. It has text prompts that look like they were lifted from Windows 3.1, and the combat--probably the most important aspect of the game other than Jimmy's ability to cover long distances on foot--is dreary.</p><p>And man, I don't remember the 2000s being this overtly <em>mean</em>. The entire vibe of the game is just bleak, from the design of the school itself to the way every single character is just hugely draining to listen to and be around. I get that it's a product of its time, and a specific idea within that time, but boy, from 2024 it's a borderline repulsive place.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Bully Trailer" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/88KNf0MtU14?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I am a man in my 40s who normally has no trouble playing and enjoying games from different eras, but there was something about this game's <em>specific </em>rough edges and narrative focus that brought a hard "no" from me almost instantly. It's not that <em>Bully </em>is old. It's just that it's...bad. Bad in so many ways that I decided to look up its original reviews from the time and had my mind blow. Here's<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/10/16/bully-collectors-edition-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> IGN</a>:</p><blockquote><p>As has become the standard for Rockstar titles, the characterization and humor in this game is top notch. Bully is easily one of the funniest PlayStation 2 titles we've ever seen and is one of the few pieces of software out there than can legitimately be called a "comedy."</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>It's wild how low our collective bars were back then for this specific type of experience. So many games and genres can stand the test of time, but <em>Bully</em>, once lauded as a success, now looks and plays like dogshit. And I was playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bully_(video_game)#Scholarship_Edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a remastered version of the game</a>!</p><p>So sorry everyone, I am <em>not </em>going to be comprehensively comparing my own boarding school experiences with those found in <em>Bully</em>, because I am not going to be playing all the way through this game when I could be doing literally anything else. Maybe that'll change if Rockstar ever get around to properly remastering--or even remaking--it, but given the fact you can already buy it on PC, warts or not, I'm not going to be holding my breath.</p><p>Just so you don't think I'm entirely ducking out from my original pitch, though, what I will say about my boarding school experience from what little I played/remember of <em>Bully </em>is that while there were <em>some </em>similarities between the kids at my school and Bullworth Academy--namely, an extreme obsession with sex and violence (as separate concepts, not both at the same time), the kids I was living with were still...kids? Sure, they'd get in fights a lot, but they were still identifiably kid fights, not the 80's college movie x nature documentary shit that <em>Bully</em> is so obsessed with.</p><p>And when you hung out with them or asked them about their future plans or what they'd done on the weekend, they were, once again, just kids. As opposed to everyone in <em>Bully</em>, who exists somewhere on a spectrum between "exhausted stereotype" and "overwrought villain" in the way so many other Rockstar characters did until we were <em>well </em>into the 2010s.</p><p>Looking back at <em>Bully</em>, it's hard to recommend almost any of it. If you want to play a 2000's Rockstar experience (I know this was developed by Rockstar Vancouver, not the North team, but it's still got the star on the box), <em>Vice City </em>remains the pinnacle. And if you want to play a game set in a boarding school, where there's loads of fighting and romantic options and lessons to attend and a world to explore outside the classroom, then just...go play <em>Persona 3</em> instead.&nbsp;</p><p><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aftermath.site/category/back-to-school" target="_blank">Back to School&nbsp;</a>is a week of stories about changes, nostalgia, and learning new things.

		<p>Valve has launched their broad overhaul to the family game sharing in Steam with the new Steam Families system. This replaces both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/promotion/familysharing?snr=1_2108_9__2107"><span data-tooltip-text="store.steampowered.com">Steam Family Sharing</span></a> and <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6B1A-66BE-E911-3D98"><span data-tooltip-text="help.steampowered.com">Steam Family View</span></a>, and will require you to set up your family group anew, but gives renewed flexibility for a lot of multi-user gaming situations.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing Steam Families" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b248W74jcFc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A family group gives members access to Family Sharing, Parental Controls and the new Child Purchase Requests.</p>
<p>The biggest change for Steam Family Sharing is that, instead of sharing a single person’s library, it now brings together up to six people and all of their combined games. All of their owned games are still individually owned and purchased, but are pooled together in a game library which can be played on a game-by-game and license-by-license basis – so if two people own the same game, then any two family members can play that game at the same time. Additionally, someone can play a family member’s game, even if another game is being played.</p>


<p>The biggest thing to be aware of, if you join a family group, is that if you leave a group, you cannot join another family for one year – you can go back to the last family group, though, without waiting.</p>
<p>There are also limits to the game library, with developers and publishers able to exclude their games from Family Sharing, just as they could with the old system. Most are included, though. You can view <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?category2=62">all games tagged with ‘Family Sharing’ here</a>, which shows the very latest games like Space Marine 2 and Black Myth: Wukong included. You can also filter your existing library to see what’s available to share.</p>
<p>Further to game sharing are parental controls, with adults able to manage and control child account access through restricting access to Steam features, setting age gates, playtime limits (with reporting, and the ability to approve or deny requests for temporary access. New Child Purchase Requests let kids ask for a game or DLC purchase via Steam, which is then approved and paid for by the adult, but added to the child’s account.</p>
<p>For more details <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/054C-3167-DD7F-49D4">see Valve’s detailed FAQ</a></p>

Once a game was downloaded a certain number of times and had made a specific amount of money, Unity would start charging developers a Runtime Fee every single time someone installed any game developed using Unity, like <em>Pokémon GO </em>or <em>Cuphead</em>. Many smaller devs and creators criticized the decision and claimed it would lead to developers abandoning the engine to avoid paying thousands of dollars in install fees. This could have led to game delays and there was even fear that some devs might remove older games from sale, preventing players from re-installing them in order to avoid the Runtime Fees.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/unity-runtime-fee-news-twitter-developers-godot-unreal-1850848538&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/unity-runtime-fee-news-twitter-developers-godot-unreal-1850848538">All of this was a giant mess</a></span> that eventually led to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/unity-engine-runtime-fees-install-changes-devs-1850865615&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/unity-engine-runtime-fees-install-changes-devs-1850865615">Unity partially walking back some of these decisions a week later</a></span>.

And now, after <em>all that</em>, the company is fully ditching the install fees completely.</p><p>On Thursday, in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://unity.com/blog/unity-is-canceling-the-runtime-fee&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://unity.com/blog/unity-is-canceling-the-runtime-fee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post on Unity’s website</a></span>, CEO Matthew Bromberg announced the news that “effective immediately” the company was removing all Runtime Fees from the engine.</p><p>“I’ve been able to connect with many of you over the last three months, and I’ve heard time and time again that you want a strong Unity, and understand that price increases are a necessary part of what enables us to invest in moving gaming forward. But those increases needn’t come in a novel and controversial new form,” said Bromberg.</p><h2 id="h61906"><a id=""></a>Unity reveals price increases for some plans</h2><p>So Runtime Fees are gone and Unity will return to a subscription model. Bromberg confirmed that Unity Personal licenses will remain free until a game brings in over $200,00 in revenue or funding. Meanwhile, starting in January 2025, Unity Pro subscriptions will increase by 8% and cost $2,200 a year. Unity Enterprise will also see a price increase of 25%.</p><p>Unity Personal will remain free, with the revenue and funding ceiling increased from $100,000 to $200,000, giving developers more flexibility before being subjected to Unity’s fees. The Made with Unity splash screen will be optional for games developed with Unity 6, set to launch later this year.</p><p>Starting January 1, 2025, Unity Pro will see an 8% price increase, raising the annual subscription fee to $2,200 per seat. Unity Enterprise will experience a 25% increase, with new minimum subscription requirements for customers generating over $25 million in annual revenue. These changes will apply to all new and existing subscriptions from that date. (Because these licenses involve major companies, the prices can vary based on different packages.)</p><p>Bromberg stressed in his blog post that Unity will continue to increase prices as it needs to, but will only do so annually via subscription fees going up. It won’t try to squeeze pennies out of every developer using the engine based on how many times people install your game.</p><p>“Canceling the Runtime Fee for games and instituting these pricing changes will allow us to continue investing to improve game development for everyone while also being better partners,” said Bromberg.</p><p>“Thank you all for your trust and continued support. We look forward to many more years of making great games together.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The latest batch is particularly noteworthy, however, offering something some denied would ever happen: <em>Dragon Ball GT</em> characters in the base game.<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-z-super-hero-ranking-where-to-stream-1849423603?_gl=1*trtb6q*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNjE3NDQ4MC4xMjYuMS4xNzI2MTc0NTkxLjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-z-super-hero-ranking-where-to-stream-1849423603?_gl=1*trtb6q*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNjE3NDQ4MC4xMjYuMS4xNzI2MTc0NTkxLjYwLjAuMA..">The much maligned spin-off</a></span>, which saw Goku returned to his childhood form, nevertheless featured a few characters and fights that are as beloved as anything in the main series. Today, publisher Bandai Namco confirmed they will be playable in the starting 164-fighter roster. Well, most of them anyway. There’s Super Saiyan 4 Goku, part red ape, part <em>Rebel Without A Cause </em>bad-ass, and his and Vegeta’s fusion version. </p><p>Baby, the alien parasite created by Truffle civilization before it was brutally snuffed out by the Saiyans long ago, is also here, as well as the form where he infects Vegeta. And of course there’s Pan (Goku’s grand daughter), Uub, the human reincarnation of Kid Buu, and Syn Shenron, the evil humanoid form of the wish-granting dragon. There are 15 fighters total from the spin-off. </p><p>There has been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/tenkaichi4/comments/1ff14s8/im_just_gonna_leave_this_here_gt_related/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tenkaichi4/comments/1ff14s8/im_just_gonna_leave_this_here_gt_related/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">debate for months</a></span> among fans about whether the <em>Dragon Ball GT </em>rejects would actually make it into the base game. Some love them and others hate them, viewing the spin-off largely as a cringe cash-grab with little involvement from series creator Akira Toriyama. Plus, the popularity of <em>Dragon Ball Super</em>, which continued the original storyline and pretended like <em>GT</em> was a bad dream, suggested the misfits might not get top-billing anymore despite being mainstays of the previous <em>Budokai Tenkaichi</em> games. Why waste a slot on Great Ape Baby? Save them for optional DLC and let the sickos goes wild.</p><p>But nope. The motley crew of alternate-future <em>Dragon Ball</em> hunters will be playable from the jump. The <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero </em>subreddit was full of blown minds today. “Chat is this real????

But not everyone’s onboard. <em>GT </em>haters just see another string of slots that won’t go to characters they actually like, and there’s no shortage of <em>Dragon Ball</em> icons who<em>&nbsp;</em>deserve to get the call-up. <br></p><p>There are only 10 slots left unrevealed now, with less than a month to go before launch. The biggest roster ever was still never going to satisfy everyone. Even <em>GT</em> stans aren’t completely satiated. Super 17, a buff, grown-up form of the android after he’s wished back to life in the spin-off, wasn’t among today’s roster additions. Fortunately, <em>Sparking Zero </em>will also be on PC, and fans can mod in whoever they want to their hearts’ content. </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<div><p>A beloved board game from 2002 is getting a brand new edition. Recently, Awaken Realms and Ravensburger launched a crowdfunding campaign for <em>Puerto Rico Special Edition</em>: a modern streamlined remake of the original.

<p>The Communications Workers of America (CWA) has issued a statement on Microsoft’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-650-people-lay-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest round of layoffs</a> that sees another 650 people let go from the company. </p>



<p>The CWA, which admittedly doesn’t represent anyone laid off in the latest layoffs, still represents workers within Microsoft, such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/world-of-warcraft-developers-have-formed-a-union/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developers on World of Warcraft</a> within Blizzard. They say they are disappointed to see more layoffs from “one of the world’s largest and most profitable corporations”.</p>



<p>“Every worker deserves a voice on the job and a say over the impact of job cuts,” Samuel Cooper, Senior Producer at World of Warcraft and member of WoWGG-CWA, said via the statement. “While we would hope that a company like Microsoft with $88 billion in profits last year could achieve ‘long term success’ without destroying the livelihoods of 650 of our colleagues, heartless layoffs like these have become all too common. </p>



<p>“We stand in solidarity with everyone who lost their job&nbsp;today&nbsp;and encourage all video game workers to join with us and form unions so we can protect each other.”</p>



<p>While unions can’t fully prevent layoffs, the CWA says that they do help employees when it comes to how the layoffs are handled in general.</p>



<p>The CWA added that it remains “committed to supporting workers at Microsoft and throughout the tech and video game industry who seek to form a union and improve their workplace.”</p>



<p>What do you think of the layoffs at Microsoft and the CWA’s statement? &nbsp;Let us know in the comments or join the discussion in our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new community forum</a>!</p>
