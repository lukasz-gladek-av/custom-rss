            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/12/niantic-sells-gaming-division-and-pokemon-go-to-saudi-owned-scopely-for-3-5-billion/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Niantic has announced the sale of its gaming business to Saudi-owned mobile gaming specialists Scopely in a deal worth $3.5 billion. This brings <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pikmin-bloom">Pikmin Bloom</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-now">Monster Hunter Now</a> and more into Scopely’s portfolio, which also includes the likes of Monopoly Go!, Star Trek Fleet Command and Marvel Strike Force.</p>
<p>The deal will keep all the current developer teams together to continue working on the AR gaming hits, while Niantic is transitioning to being “<span>a geospatial AI company”, seemingly looking to use all their experience with augmented reality technologies (including something called Gaussian splatting) for more general purposes.</span></p>


<p>Announcing the change on the Pokémon Go website, Ed Wu, head of Pokémon Go said, It’s been an incredible joy to serve hundreds of millions of Trainers in our real-world community for the past 10 years, and I truly believe the best is yet to come. Our mission remains clear: to inspire people to discover Pokémon in the real world together. With Scopely’s full commitment, experience, and resources, we’re going to make Pokémon Go the very best it can be – from incredible battles for thousands of Trainers at a time at our live events to new ways to connect to your friends and community. Most importantly, we’ll remain focused on the excitement and experience of discovering Pokémon in the real world.”</p>
<p>Scopely was founded in 2011 and has its headquarters in Culver City, California. it had its initial success with its series of … With Buddies games in 2012, before pushing into licensed IP for games like The Walking Dead: Road to Survive, Star Treck Fleet Command and Scrabble Go. In April 2023, Saudi PIF group Savvy Games Group bought Scopely for $4.9 billion, adding to its portfolio of owned companies and investments across the games industry.</p>
<p>We’ll have to wait and see what influence Scopely has on Niantic’s games, with the outgoing company often having a fractious relationship with its fanbase. After its breakout success in 2016, Niantic regularly sought to tweak and adjust how in-game items were used and available, often to the chagrin of the player base as this affected their ability to play – most notable, perhaps, was how Niantic made changes in 2020 to enable more distant playing through lockdowns, and then rolled them back at still contentious moments.</p>

<p>Pokémon Go was a huge success for the company, and remains the best example of its augmented reality game style, while they’ve struggled to adapt it to other IP. A Harry Potter game came and went, while Pikmin Bloom and Monster Hunter now haven’t hit the same heights. They’ve also created companion pieces like Campfire to add a new social avenue for playing their games, instead of seeing people resort to other platforms.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/niantic-games-gets-acquired-by-scopely-for-3-5-billion/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Just over two weeks ago, Bloomberg <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-go-creator-niantic-rumored-to-sell-video-games-unit-for-3-5-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Niantic wanted to sell its games division. Today, the deal has been made official, and just as was mentioned in that report, the buyer is Scopely (for $3.5 billion, though Niantic is contributing an extra $350 million of cash for the benefit of stakeholders).</p>
<p>The Californian company is already the second biggest mobile publisher per revenue in 2024 (albeit at a great distance from leader Tencent) thanks to popular titles like MONOPOLY GO!, Marvel Strike Force, Star Trek Fleet Command, and more. Now, it will add the rights to <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-go-1-billion-player-spending-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokémon GO</a>, Pikmin Bloom, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/niantics-monster-hunter-now-brings-the-hunt-to-the-real-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monster Hunter Now</a>, as well as the companion apps Campfire and Wayfarer. Pokémon GO remains the proverbial golden goose, as it still engaged over a hundred million unique users last year. Overall, Scopely now boasts that its portfolio, combined with that of Niantic Games, has reached over half a billion gamers in 2024, making it one of the biggest gaming communities.</p>
<p>Tim O’Brien, Chief Revenue Officer and Board Member of Scopely, provided the following statement to explain the motives behind this acquisition:</p>
<p><em>Scopely has always been focused on cultivating meaningful communities through a shared love of play, and the Niantic games organization is one of the best in the world at this endeavor. We are extremely inspired by what the team has built over the last decade, delivering innovative experiences that captivate a vast, enduring global audience and get people out in the real world. We look forward to further accelerating the team’s creativity through our partnership. Few games in the world have delivered the scale and longevity of ‘Pokémon GO’, which reached over 100 million players just last year. The experience also stands apart for its unique ability to foster in-person connections, with Pokémon GO live events attracting millions of attendees. After spending time with the Niantic team, it quickly became clear that this organization shares our inclination to create industry-leading outcomes and exceptional player experiences. We look forward to a bright future ahead.</em></p>
<p>John Hanke, founder and CEO of Niantic, added:</p>
<p><em>Niantic games have always been a bridge to connect people and inspire exploration, and I am confident they will continue to do both as part of Scopely. Scopely shares our focus on building and operating incredible live services, has exceptional experience working with the world's biggest and most beloved intellectual properties, and cares deeply about its player communities and game-making teams. I firmly believe this partnership is great for our players and is the best way to ensure that our games have the long-term support and investment needed to be 'forever games' that will endure for future generations.</em></p>
<p>By the way, Niantic is simultaneously spinning off its technology platform into a new company called <a href="https://www.nianticspatial.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Niantic Spatial</a>, which was described as a 'geospatial AI company powered by a next-generation map'. This company will continue to operate Ingress Prime and Peridot.</p>
<p>For all the Pokémon GO players, Senior Vice President Ed Wu also had a prepared statement:</p>
<p><em>It’s been an incredible joy to serve hundreds of millions of Trainers in our real-world community for the past 10 years, and I truly believe the best is yet to come. Our mission remains clear: to inspire people to discover Pokémon in the real world together. With Scopely’s full commitment, experience, and resources, we're going to make Pokémon GO the very best it can be - from incredible battles for thousands of Trainers at a time at our live events to new ways to connect to your friends and community. Most importantly, we’ll remain focused on the excitement and experience of discovering Pokémon in the real world.</em></p>
<p>There's also a dedicated letter <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/moving-to-a-new-home-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published on the game's website</a> for those interested in more details.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-crossplay-update-officially-slated-for-late-march.1132341/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-crossplay-update-late-march<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pocketpair has announced that the&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>crossplay update is coming later this month, so you'll soon be able to play with your friends across different platforms.</p>

<p>Per a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/541100079887417458" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, the crossplay update will bring not only the ability to play with other&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>players across PC and console, but also the ability to move Pals between worlds, which should make your Pal management a little bit easier.</p>

<p>Pocketpair says that if you want more information about the crossplay update, you should check the patch notes, which will be revealed "on the day of the update", although the studio doesn't reveal what the day of the update actually is.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-crossplay-update-release-window-world.jpg?itok=wzoJ01Ty 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-crossplay-update-release-window-world.jpg?itok=KpO_T49E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>crossplay update is coming later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>As you'd expect, crossplay will be supported between all of the platforms on which&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is currently available, including the PS5, for which the game was released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-ps5-release" rel="nofollow">back in September</a>.</p>

<p>It's not clear whether the crossplay update will extend to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton" rel="nofollow">mobile version</a> of&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>when it's eventually released, but given that the mobile version sounds as though it'll be a completely separate game, that's unlikely.</p>

<p>Crossplay and world transfers for Pals are just two of the features promised on the&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-roadmap-january-2025" rel="nofollow">roadmap</a> that was revealed back in January. Others include an "ending scenario" for the game, as well as more ways to improve your Pals, new Pals and technologies, and more game collaborations, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-terraria-crossover-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Terraria&nbsp;</em>crossover</a>&nbsp;announced back in November.</p>

<p>Pocketpair hasn't specified whether any of those features will be included in the crossover update, but it's likely we'll have to wait a little while for those.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, it's a creature-collecting survival game that tasks you with building a base and surviving in a world filled with&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>-esque creatures known as Pals.</p>

<p>The similarities between&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>are often disputed, but Nintendo thought they were similar enough to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-lawsuit-patents-demands-nintendo" rel="nofollow">bring a lawsuit against Pocketpair</a>, which hasn't yet been settled at time of writing.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/palworld/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9NKV34XDW014" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and you can also play it as part of Xbox Game Pass.</p>

Titled “Stamp,” the project aimed to be a 2D action platformer for the PlayStation Portable where PlayStation button symbols (square, triangle, circle, X) were used to navigate obstacles and create new structures in the environment. </p><p> Triangle would hurt enemies, circle would create bouncy objects, square would create platforms, and X would act as the delete button for objects. The story, meanwhile, revolved around a hero called Stampie rescuing his bug friends and family from the nasty oil bugs that had captured them.

It presumably never got past certain internal review gates needed to greenlight the entire product. While it’s impossible to tell why that was from the prototype materials, the pitch deck shows the types of concerns that go into making that type of decision, at least for a small, first-party portable game back in 2010.</p><p>A production schedule estimates the time and costs to complete the game and localize it (roughly 12 months and $3 million). A business case section projects break-even points for unit sales and the expected return on investment at various levels of marketing spend. It also points to other “Kawaii taste” games on the market and their respective sales numbers to give a ballpark, including <em>Pokémon Heart Gold </em>and <em>Soul Silver</em> at 2.8 million copies and<em> LittleBigPlanet</em> at 2.5 million copies. </p><p>Much of the pitch deck is just charts showing how many copies the game would need to sell at various price points and marketing budgets in order to break even or exceed certain levels of return on investment. Apparently, the people making the call didn’t think the math panned out. The game itself seemed like a neat idea, though maybe too small stakes for where Sony’s first-party ambitions were going. </p><p>Japan Studio was ultimately shut down in 2021 and its remaining teams spun off into other divisions, including Team Asobi which produced last year’s  imaginative hit <em>Astro Bot</em>. Still, Stamp is exactly the type of smaller whimsical experiment we don’t see as often from Sony these days, in part because it no longer has a gaming handheld to sell them on. Maybe that will change if the company ships the new <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-portable-sony-playstation-handheld-switch-2-1851707119&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-portable-sony-playstation-handheld-switch-2-1851707119">portable gaming device</a></span> it’s reportedly working on. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>MLB The Show 25 is San Diego Studio’s latest effort. It aims to deliver a main event spectacle worthy of anybody’s money, and if you’re prepared to spend the pennies, Early Access might not be a dream.</p>



<p>“The Show” line of baseball games began in 2006. It’s become the most celebrated and accomplished sports title for delivering an authentic baseball experience for those who can only dream of yeeting a 90mph rocket. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mlb-the-show-25-cover-athletes-and-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MLB The Show 25</a> is the newest iteration of the franchise, and with little competition around it, The Show 25 is still a major league player for baseball.</p>



<p>The Major League Baseball season has a start date, but if you can’t wait for the season’s opener, let’s see if I can pitch you Early Access information.</p>

<p><strong>San Diego Studio is 100% offering Early Access for MLB The Show 25 if you’re keen enough.</strong></p>



<p>Most sports titles seem to offer some form of Early Access now. EA FC includes it with special editions, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-pga-tour-2k25-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a> has followed suit this year. <a href="https://theshow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MLB The Show 25</a> doesn’t see why it has to miss out on the party, and its invite is red hot.</p>

<p><strong>You get four-day Early Access for MLB The Show 25 by pre-ordering the Digital Deluxe Edition.</strong></p>



<p>If you intend to buy a physical copy, you can say goodbye to Early Access. But if you’re only willing to commit to the Standard Edition, you too will miss out on a vital headstart.</p>

                <p>After launching the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amd-radeon-9070-gpus-have-arrived-but-retailers-are-selling-out-fast/1100-6529943/" data-ref-id="1100-6529943">Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT GPUs</a> last week, AMD has now officially launched the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D processors. Early reviews are praising the components as some of the most powerful CPUs on the market--so if you’re piecing together a premium gaming rig, they’re likely a good fit for your needs. However, they’re bound to be a hot commodity, so if you find one in stock, it’s a good idea to pick it up while you can. The 9950X3D costs $699, while the 9900X3D costs $599.</p><h3>AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D/9900X3D Restock Tracker</h3><p>These two CPUs are the successors to the popular <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AMD-9800X3D-16-Thread-Desktop-Processor/dp/B0DKFMSMYK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ryzen 7 9800X3D</a>, which launched last November and quickly became the must-have processor for gaming and high-end development applications. The 9950X3D and 9900X3D aim to offer an even more well-rounded experience. The 9800X3D has been hard to find in stock, but if you want to save some cash, you can get the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/pc/229189?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">current No. 1 best-selling CPU</a> for $480 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AMD-9800X3D-16-Thread-Desktop-Processor/dp/B0DKFMSMYK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a>.</p><p>The 9950X3D is the more premium of the two, offering up to 5.7GHz, 16 cores, and 32 threads. It also gets you 64MB of 3D V-Cache to enhance its performance when running demanding gaming. The 9900X3D, meanwhile, features 12 cores, 24 threads, and speeds up to 5.5GHz.

			<p>Today, inZOI Studio (a subsidiary of KRAFTON) unveiled the detailed system requirements and optimal settings for the highly anticipated life simulation game for PC. While the minimum requirements are more or less in line with what we've come to expect nowadays (they even require less RAM than <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomfall-will-require-rtx-2060-gpu-and-16gb-ram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atomfall's</a>), to play at higher graphics presets, you will need a very powerful computer. The High preset even recommends AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which launched just a few months ago to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-3d-v-cache-cpu-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent reviews</a>, establishing itself as the best CPU gamers can buy when it comes to the quality/price ratio and its efficiency.</p>

<p>inZOI is powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 5 and delivers not only high quality graphics but also high-fidelity simulations, the developer said in an attempt to explain the high requirements.</p>
<p>The studio has prepared eight different preset options to allow players to easily find the best visuals and performance for their system. These presets also confirm the inclusion of NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3, Intel XeSS, and ray tracing. There's no mention of Frame Generation, though.</p>

<p>The Better Graphics mode will focus on delivering the best image quality while playing inZOI at the expense of possible frame drops and longer loading. Better Performance, as you can easily guess, reduces visual quality and optimized simulation speed to increase frame rates.</p>

<p>It's worth reminding that inZOI <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-competitor-inzoi-set-to-enter-early-access-in-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will launch on March 28</a> in early access. In the future, the developers will add an automatic system to adjust in-game settings according to the PC specs. Of course, they also plan to further optimize the game for a variety of configurations.</p>
<p>The game will also offer other interesting features, such as official mods (<a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-partners-with-overwolf-to-bring-official-mods-into-life-simulation-game-inzoi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thanks to a partnership with Overwolf</a>) and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-to-power-dynamic-ai-characters-companions-and-bosses-in-pubg-naraka-bladepoint-inzoi-and-mir5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI companions named Smart ZOI</a>, who will be powered by NVIDIA ACE.</p>

Talk to some guys on the overworld map, get into a battle, fight all the soldiers and capture all the bases, rinse and repeat until the game is done. Even the postgame lays a clear path forward for those who want to see and do everything the game offers. With that said, you can imagine my surprise once I realized that, with over 100 hours put into the game, I found some pretty huge secrets that I <em>totally </em>missed as I played.</p><p>It’s a shame, as some of these hidden scenes and battles are pretty awesome! So whether you’re aiming for total completion yourself, or you just want to pick the game up again, here are five secrets that you don’t want to miss.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="85431102d5f363e9dfa173dfbc30dc23" data-recommend-id="image://85431102d5f363e9dfa173dfbc30dc23" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

However, even after her semi-romantic date with Ziluan and her dramatic capture by Dong Zhuo, she almost completely disappears from the main story after Chapter 3. What happened with her and Lu Bu? Where did she go?</p><p>Don’t worry, these questions have answers! <strong>To uncover Diaochan’s fate and unlock her final Bond event, you must attain complete peace in the Sili Province</strong>. You’ll naturally bolster the peace gauge if you aim to unlock every story path in the game, but you’ll almost certainly need to grind skirmishes to max out the peace in this region completely. Once you achieve total peace, a letter will appear in the inn as long as you’ve progressed far enough in the story. This will lead you to one final conversation with Diaochan, uniting her and Ziluan as they discuss what the future will look like for them.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d382e72894616303d601d87dfcb2189e" data-recommend-id="image://d382e72894616303d601d87dfcb2189e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

Fortunately, it seems Koei Tecmo and Omega Force agree, as <strong>you can unlock an entire string of Bond events with Zhang Jiao by replaying Chapter One in New Game Plus.</strong></p><p>Maxing out this Bond can be a bit tricky, as you need to complete several missions that you can’t skip by visiting Shui Jing Retreat. However, once you see the first two Bond event cutscenes, you can skip to Chapter 2 to unlock the final scene.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="37be1337b9cc242d3f4b26a7e2940820" data-recommend-id="image://37be1337b9cc242d3f4b26a7e2940820" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from a cinematic in Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

You can save Dian Wei in Chapter 4, save Guo Jia in Chapter 5, and completely change the final Battle of Chibi by bringing Guo Jia with you and foiling Zhuge Liang’s surprise fire attack. With all these alternate outcomes, it’s <em>incredibly </em>easy to miss one <em>technically </em>unique cutscene that <em>only </em>triggers if you <em>don’t </em>save Dian Wei but <em>do </em>save Guo Jia. I <em>hope </em>my <em>use </em>of <em>italics </em>drives <em>home</em> how much <em>fun</em> I had <em>figuring </em>this <em>out</em>.</p><p>This scene genuinely adds functionally nothing to your experience, but it is a requirement if you want 100 percent story completion.

However, voice actors may choose not to sign new contracts in solidarity with striking union members, or in the absence of a SAG Interim Agreement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Emeri Chase — who portrays Soldier 11 — said they were "replaced as Soldier 11 because I am unwilling to perform work not covered by a SAG Interim Agreement during a strike for AI protection, the outcome of which will determine the future of our industry." Nicholas Thurkettle, who played Lycaon, has been similarly replaced, although Thurkettle is not a union member.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'd like to clarify that there's a difference between being 'struck' and not being on an Interim Agreement," Chase explained in a thread on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:eun6fzj2cssacea3u2ukfewb/post/3lk5orkz76s2y" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bluesky</u></a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-zenless-zone-zero-actors-lose-jobs-over-ai-dispute-without-notice-finding-out-alongside-players" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Eurogamer</u></a>). "Union projects that began work prior to the strike and non-union projects are not 'struck.' But they also do not offer the Union-enforced AI rights we are fighting for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Many actors are choosing to voluntarily withhold work on these categories of projects because we feel it is the best way to support the union's fight for the protections that are critical to our continued ability to create the art we love."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chase added that they knew "that by withholding work it was possible" they'd be replaced, but had "hoped [developer HoYoVerse] would choose to leave her silent until I was able to return."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I found out the role was recast today alongside all of you," Chase said, while Thurkettle stated: "I'm learning about this as you are, and I share your shock. Neither HoYoverse nor Sound Cadence has communicated with me since October. I've been fully available and recorded multiple voice jobs in that time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm not SAG but what game companies want to do with AI is an existential threat. I took a personal stand to ask for protection, and had to be willing to give up the best thing that's ever happened in my professional life. I stand by my choice."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked HoYoVerse for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a similar case from December, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-character-recast-after-players-expressed-concern-about-new-voices">Activision confirmed it had recast some members of the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 cast</a> after fans noticed much-loved Zombies characters with new voices in-game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The company issued a statement to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/black-ops-6-zombies-characters-recast-after-original-actors-withdrew-during-strike" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game Developer</a> admitting characters in Black Ops 6’s Zombies mode were recast amid the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zombies characters William Peck (Zeke Alton) and Samantha Maxis (Julie Nathanson) are currently voiced by new, unknown actors. Alton told Game Developer that he took no issue with Activision’s actions with Peck, but expressed concern “for my brand as a performer.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Fans of the game have reached out to me because the lack of crediting [of the replacement actor] implies that it may still be me which unfairly represents my abilities as a performer," Alton said at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on how the strike has, and will continue to, affect the games you play, check out our feature from last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-the-sag-aftra-video-game-actors-strike-means-for-gamers"><u>What the SAG-AFTRA Video Game Actors Strike Means for Gamers</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.

Despite this, however, Sirland acknowledged that the new drag and revive feature is a key part of the "revive loop," adding: "I am expecting to see some interesting use in the next test on labs."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With this feature, there's more of that fun interaction with more pieces to the puzzle," he <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1899203918351196567" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>teased</u></a>.

                <p>Ubisoft is "horribly mismanaged" and has failed to inform the public about supposed conversations with Microsoft and EA regarding possible acquisition deals. That's according to the Ubisoft minority shareholder AJ Investments, which said in a memo that it might organize a protest at Ubisoft's office in Paris to help elevate its concerns and get attention.</p><p>AJ Investments CEO Juraj Krupa said in a statement <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shareholder-plots-protest-outside-paris-hq-accuses-company-of-failing-to-reveal-discussions-with-microsoft-ea-and-others-allegedly-interested-in-acquiring-ips" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">seen by IGN</a> that Ubisoft is "horribly mismanaged by current management." The investment group, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-shareholder-urges-company-to-make-drastic-change-amid-sinking-stock/1100-6526392/" data-ref-id="1100-6526392">previously urged Ubisoft management to make drastic changes</a>, said Ubisoft needs to disclose a "clear roadmap for recovery" amid "declining shareholder value, lackluster operational execution, and failure to adapt effectively to market trends."</p><p>Krupa went on to say that the private financial market platform MergerMarket carried a story that claims Ubisoft was talking to Microsoft, EA, and other companies about potentially acquiring unspecified franchises from Ubisoft. Krupa said Ubisoft management failed to disclose these discussions publicly.</p><p>A spokesperson for Ubisoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-refuses-to-comment-on-tencent-rumors-but-says-its-exploring-options-to-maximize-value/1100-6528718/" data-ref-id="1100-6528718">reiterated what it said months ago</a>, which is that Ubisoft is in the process of conducting a strategic review of "transformation strategic and capitalistic options," but that the company does not plan to make public announcements until a possible deal materializes.</p><p>In addition to possibly Microsoft and EA, Ubisoft is reported to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-refuses-to-comment-on-tencent-rumors-but-says-its-exploring-options-to-maximize-value/1100-6528718/" data-ref-id="1100-6528718">possibly be in discussions with Tencent about some kind of financing deal.</a> It remains to be seen how this might all materialize, but one possibility that's rumored is Ubisoft selling off individual franchises.</p><p>Krupa added that the latest delay for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/" data-ref-id="1100-6523576">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> to March 20 caused Ubisoft's stock to decline in value, but mainly retail investors were harmed by this--not institutional investors like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Because Ubisoft did not act "appropriately," as AJ Investments sees it, the company is asking frustrated investors to join a protest planned for May.</p><p>Krupa said AJ Investments will call of its protest if Ubisoft's strategic review leads to an end result that increases shareholder value. It also hasn't ruled out suing Ubisoft.</p><p>"Ubisoft has continued to underperform compared to its industry peers, and it is time for the company to listen to its shareholders. This demonstration will be a powerful statement from investors who believe in the company's potential but demand urgent change," Krupa said.</p><p>As mentioned, Ubisoft's next big release is Assassin's Creed Shadows on March 20. It's been a tumultuous past year for Ubisoft, as the company's cost-cutting efforts have included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-closes-studio-eliminating-185-jobs-in-latest-round-of-cuts/1100-6529036/" data-ref-id="1100-6529036">mass layoffs and studio closures</a>, as well as the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-shuts-down-in-june-2025-ubisoft-closes-two-offices/1100-6528210/" data-ref-id="1100-6528210"> shutdown of XDefiant.</a></p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Romance has become increasingly common in role-playing games in recent years, having had central roles in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, to name a recent few. But it was conspicuously absent from Obsidian's latest RPG, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a>, and I am not the only person to wonder why.</p>
<p>I had a chance to ask game director Carrie Patel why this was the case during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/from-serious-skyrim-to-cheerful-fantasy-obsidian-on-the-evolution-of-avowed-and-grappling-with-the-expectations-that-come-from-your-own-history">a post-release interview about Avowed</a>, and it turns out Patel had a lot on the matter to say. "Doing romance and doing romance well are two very different propositions," she said.</p>
<p>For starters, it's important that non-player characters don't lose their sense of self in a game just because you've shown romantic interest in them. "Part of doing romance well means not only a compelling romance path but also one that is faithful to the character being romanced," she said.</p>
<p>"It's always a bit of a letdown when you see a character who has a clear personality, and goals and interests, and suddenly, in the service of this romance that the player has embarked on with them, they now become the player's yes-person; they're happy with whatever you want and lose their sense of personhood."</p>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=equGBZBUjVg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>Number two: romance shouldn't be the only way you can get closer to, and deeper with, someone. A relationship should not only depend on - or be gatekept by - romantic interest.  "You need an equally compelling platonic path," Patel said, "because it's a shame if romance is the only right way to really get to that full level of depth with a character."</p>
<p>Finally - and Patel said she sees this a lot as developer and a player - if romance is used as a mechanic then it will be treated as one, potentially detracting from why it was there in the first place. "The more you introduce romance as a mechanic, and the more that you build systems around it, and metrics, and ways for players to bolster and measure their affinity and affection level with other characters, the more it becomes something people engage with as a system rather than as a relationship," she said.</p>
<p>Avowed, contrary to popular belief, does have a kind of companion relationship in it, but this isn't telegraphed at all through the game, or teased, or incentivised. You'll come across it if you speak regularly with the companion in question - I don't want to spoil who it is - but the intention was it should come up organically rather than be something you aim for.</p>
<p>"There's nothing that says 'hey this is a thing that can happen' - there's no system that's going to track your status with them - but if you're doing the kinds of things that you would do if you were interested in this character, you'll probably come across the option by the end of the game," Patel said. "And it should feel natural, organic, and surprising."</p>

</figure>
<p>This reminds her of a character from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> - Obsidian's sci-fi RPG, a sequel for which it's working on right now - called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outer-worlds-parvati-holcomb-is-a-rare-but-shining-example-of-asexual-representation">Parvati Holcomb, who we praised on Eurogamer in an article about asexual representation in games</a>.</p>
<p>"What works so well about the Parvati bar scene in The Outer Worlds is it just feels believable and relatable, because who hasn't gotten a drink with a friend and talked them through their romantic predicaments?" Patel said. "And by the same token, finding a relationship - an affection that blooms between you and someone you're spending a lot of time with - that's something that should feel organic and surprising, and not like this meter that you're tracking in the background to see how close you are to reaching the top."</p>
<p>Avowed was released in February to favourable reviews. I called it "one of this year's most pleasant surprises" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">Eurogamer's Avowed review</a>, relishing the game's sense of adventure and carefree attitude towards fun. It's very refreshing.</p>
<p>The game seems to have been a success for Obsidian and Xbox, too, leading to the question of what's next for it and the associated Pillars of Eternity series. Will there be a PlayStation 5 version, or an expansion, or a sequel? I put these questions to Patel in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/from-serious-skyrim-to-cheerful-fantasy-obsidian-on-the-evolution-of-avowed-and-grappling-with-the-expectations-that-come-from-your-own-history">my Avowed interview</a> and more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/niantic-to-sell-gaming-division-to-saudi-funded-scopely-for-3-5b.1132251/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/niantic-scopely-sale-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Niantic has announced that it's sold off its gaming wing to the Saudi-funded mobile firm Scopely for the princely sum (no pun intended) of $3.5 billion.</p>

<p>The deal, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-go-niantic-saudi-rumor" rel="nofollow">rumored to be happening last month</a>, was confirmed today in a news <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/news/niantic-next-chapter?hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> entitled "Niantic's Next Chapter". Niantic says that Scopely will acquire its games, including <i>Pokemon Go</i>,&nbsp;<em>Pikmin Bloom</em>, and <i>Monster Hunter Now</i>, for the aforementioned sum "with an additional $350 million of cash from Niantic being distributed as part of the deal".</p>

<p>It sounds as though the development structure of Niantic's gaming teams won't be changing much; in its own <a href="https://www.scopely.com/en/news/scopely-to-acquire-niantic-games-business-which-includes-pokemon-go-one-of-the-most-successful-mobile-games-of-all-time" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, Scopely says "all members of the Niantic gamemaking team" will join Scopely's staff and "continue to develop and operate their beloved experiences".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-now-niantic-sale-scopely.jpg?itok=qd4Db4zo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-now-niantic-sale-scopely.jpg?itok=YmkI-rFh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Niantic's sale of its gaming business includes games like&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Now</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>SVP Ed Wu says his team plans to use Scopely's "full commitment, experience, and resources" to make the game "the very best it can be".&nbsp;</p>

<p>For his part, Niantic head John Hanke says he's "confident" that Niantic games will remain a "bridge to connect people and inspire exploration" under Scopely, praising the new owners' "incredible live services" and "exceptional experience working with the world's biggest and most beloved intellectual properties".</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, Scopely is the company responsible for mobile games like&nbsp;<em>Star Trek Fleet Command</em>,&nbsp;<em>Yahtzee with Buddies</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Monopoly Go</em>, which was the biggest mobile game launch of its year, <a href="https://www.scopely.com/en/news/monopoly-go-makes-history-as-the-biggest-mobile-game-launch-of-2023" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">raking in over $1 billion</a>&nbsp;in 2023 alone.</p>

<p>The company is owned by the Savvy Gaming Group, a gaming investment company backed by the country's Public Investment Fund. Said fund also has shares in the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-pif-becomes-nintendos-largest-outside-shareholder" rel="nofollow">Nintendo</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-pif-buys-1-billion-stake-in-embracer-group" rel="nofollow">Embracer Group</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-arabia-pif-adds-stakes-in-capcom-nexon" rel="nofollow">Capcom</a>, among others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/niantic-scopely-sale-pikmin-bloom.jpg?itok=fWNBuplL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/niantic-scopely-sale-pikmin-bloom.jpg?itok=WHJXjGGo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pikmin Bloom&nbsp;</em>is another of Niantic's (now Scopely's) games.</figcaption></figure><p>As for Niantic's geospatial AI business, that will be spun off into its own entity, which Hanke will continue to lead. Appropriately, the new company will be called Niantic Spatial Inc., and its goal is "building spatial intelligence that helps people better understand, navigate, and engage with the physical world".</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Scopely's impact on Niantic's gaming properties will be, but it sounds as though the two studios don't intend to change much in the short term. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>There are three Atomfall editions to consider. But remember that <strong>only two of them have Early Access</strong>: The Deluxe and Quarantine Edition. The Standard Edition is an option, but only comes with pre-order bonuses and the game.</p>



<p>Furthermore, <strong>Atomfall Quarantine Edition is a PC-only version</strong> exclusively available in the <a href="https://shop.rebellion.com/products/atomfall-quarantine-edition?utm_source=LinkTree&amp;utm_medium=Atomfall&amp;utm_campaign=Quarantine+Edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rebellion Store</a>. </p>



<p>I wholeheartedly recommend you weigh up the pros and cons of getting Atomfall Early Access first. Then you can move onto the decision of choosing between the Deluxe and Quarantine Edition—unless you’re a console player, in which case the choice is easy!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-atomfall-early-access-start">When Does Atomfall Early Access Start?</h2>



<p><strong>Atomfall Early Access gets underway on March 24.</strong></p>



<p>This is three days before the official March 27 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfalls-release-date-has-been-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a>. Depending on how excited you are and eager to get started, 72 hours is a lot. The extra price of admission is worth it for players desperate to see the aftereffects of the Windscale nuclear disaster.</p>



<p>You get more benefits in addition to Early Access, such as a Story Expansion Pack and in-game weapons and goodies. I’ve provided you with the information you need, so my job is done.</p>

<p>Palworld players can finally play with friends across platforms, as a new crossplay update is planned for late March.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Palworld’s Crossplay update will allow players to access multiplayer across all platforms and transfer Pals between worlds. Crossplay will be available on all the platforms the game released on, including Steam, Xbox, PlayStation 5, and Mac. More details about the update will be revealed on the day it is released.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PocketPair wishes to celebrate the new feature’s arrival in the community by offering a flat <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1899808005153251468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">25% discount</a> on Palworld on the PlayStation Store and Steam. The offer ends on March 27 on the PlayStation Store, and players are speculating that’s when this update will arrive. Currently, the developers haven’t provided a release date for crossplay in Palworld.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Palworld is following its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-reveals-new-roadmap-for-one-year-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first-anniversary roadmap</a>, which was released early this year. Co-op crossplay and world transfer for pals have arrived, and now we are waiting on new collaborations and content partnerships. The developers are also continuing to work on introducing new Pals and features for players to try out in the game.</p>



<p>In other news, Palworld and Nintendo’s court battles continue as the latter has received <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-anti-palworld-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new patent</a> to help their case against PocketPair. Also, the game has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-32-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassed 32 million players</a> within the first year. What are your thoughts on Palworld receiving crossplay later this month?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

This year, Game Developer sat down with the finalists&nbsp;for the IGF’s Nuovo and Grand Prize nominees ahead of GDC to explore the themes, design decisions, and tools behind each entry. Game Developer and GDC are sibling organizations under Informa.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> turns your personal living area into a spacecraft, filling it with strange machinery and alien plant forms. Whether you want to get to know your plants and their varied personalities or fly to entire worlds from your living room, this VR game offers striking places to visit and some interesting plants to care for.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer spoke with Doug North Cook, creative director of the Nuovo Award nominated game, to learn more about how they came upon the idea to make use of the player’s living space within a mixed-reality world, the design decisions that went into carefully making use of the player’s living space, and what appealed to them about having players care for plants when they’re soaring through the cosmos.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Who are you, and what was your role in developing </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I am Doug North Cook, the CEO and creative director of Creature, the studio behind </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. I can’t emphasize enough how much of a group effort this project was with our art director Ashley Pinnick and engineering director Mark Schram co-leading development with a much larger team. Their leadership, passion, creativity, and brilliance are what helped our team ship something that, at the start, felt impossible to build.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What's your background in making games?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most of my background is actually in academia. I was a design professor focused on immersive technology leading a department at Chatham University in Pittsburgh until my friend Callum Underwood convinced me to leave to run VR at Robot Teddy (where we helped release </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Last Clockwinder</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Among Us VR</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>No More Rainbows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and several others). I left Robot Teddy to focus on building </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and to build an XR-focused game label which also released the Meta Quest Game of the Year, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Maestro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and the Apple Vision Pro Game of the Year, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>THRASHER</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you come up with the concept for </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The original concept for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was one of those magical moments where an idea lands nearly fully formed in your mind. I spent an entire day furiously filling a notebook to capture what I saw. The core concept revolved around this idea that if we were making a game in mixed reality and we couldn’t control the context that the user played the game in, then we needed to embrace the context and make it a core part of the game. We turned whatever room you played in into a starship and then we launched that room into outer space. Your room comes with you on an adventure, and in that way, it is a character in the story and the game feels different depending on where you play it. There is some deep magic in that.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A few days after having the original idea my wife helped me translate that initial vision into a pitch deck that I quickly shared around with the people who became the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> team—the idea being to pull together people who had made some of the most important contributions to novel interaction, narrative, and technical design for immersive projects to date and get them all to collaborate on one project.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What development tools were used to build your game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We built the game in Unity exclusively for the Meta Quest 3 series. This allowed us to do some techno-magic—integrating platform specific features to build a type of experience that is only just now possible to build.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> turns your home into a spacefaring craft. What appealed to you about taking the player's living space and adding fantastic elements to it? Why mix their reality with your creative alien technology and beings?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We often talked during development about the idea of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as an “assisted daydream” and that by grounding the player in their environment and slowing building up a shared illusion we can tap into the player’s imagination to fill in the gaps. We go really deep on the interactivity and responsiveness of the objects we put into your space so that you feel like they belong alongside the physical products in your space. We often see users move a chair to position themselves as the captain of the ship, move books from a shelf to make space for one of our plants—it is a type of imaginative play that demands a childlike approach. We wanted to instill in users a sense of wonder, delight, and awe.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What challenges came from creating elements that would connect with the player's real world living space? What thoughts went into designing the various ship parts, technologies, and plants in such a way that they could connect with the player's world when living spaces are so varied in shape and structure?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This was one of our biggest hurdles—making a contextless game that feels meaningful in any environment. Early on, we built consensus in the team around a few core design concepts that Ashley Pinnick, our art director, solidified into concept drawings and design language that dictated much of what the game became.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These included surface awareness—the idea that every object should meaningfully interact with the floor, tables, shelves, and any surface we can define at the platform level. A great example is the plant pots. If a user moves a pot towards a surface, the pot has legs that reach out from the bottom of the pot that land the pot on the surface and we cast a shadow on that surface—but if the player lets the pot go in mid-air the pot will turn on small jets that hover it in place. We try to ensure that players can interact with objects in a variety of ways and that they can discover through the natural course of play—learning alien technology as they go.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Early on, we had ideas to augment the player’s space in more ways and have more visual overlays, but in the end what we found to be the most compelling with the current state of the technology was to have fewer objects that have a higher level of detail and richness. The plants are also aware of the space, the player, and each other in ways that can be surprising—one of the plants has a long tentacle arm that, if in reach of the helm, it will occasionally reach out and hit buttons on helm to turn on and off our holographic star map. Some of those plants are real rascals.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What ideas went into creating the various machines and ship devices so that they felt alien and creative, yet conveyed their usage in their design? How did you make a starship's controls feel intuitive?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Early on, Ashley nailed down our organic, drippy, goopy shape language that serves as the basis for everything. We wanted the ship to feel soft, alive, and familiar all at once. We borrow some items from classic sci-fi like levers, buttons, and holographic projectors, but other items like our fertilizer creatures, and the contraption you use to access the dreams of alien plants, required multiple rounds of iteration to find something that was novel while still remaining accessible. We tried to focus on interactions that were simple yet surprising.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What appealed to you about focusing on caring for various plants in the game? About giving the plants various personalities for the player to uncover?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We were excited with the idea of making a game that encourages players to be caretakers and plant lovers—to find joy in nurturing. These are things we want to see more of in the world. With a mixed reality game, users are trusting us to build an experience in their home. We take this unspoken intimate contract really seriously and wanted to work to ensure that we created positive, magical memories for places. I think that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> imbues a little bit of magic into every space it is played in.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The personalities of the plants are a big part of this—they respond to your touch, they each have different needs, and they respond to care in different ways. Every player has a favorite (which ends up being placed in a place of prominence). They are somewhere in between plants and pets—a space we’d love to explore even more in the future.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you design the plants in order to convey their unique personalities? How do you create something that looks like a plant from another planet? How do you then show the player that plant's personality through its behavior and visual design?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When approaching the design of each plant, we tried to think holistically about the end-to-end experience of the player. The planet they find the plant on, the dream of the plant you enter into, the music in that dream, the interactions with the player—all of this comes together to paint a full picture of a complex entity. We tried to only occasionally borrow shapes and concepts for plants from Earth (like the flower on the eyeball plant), but for many of them we tried to focus on an interaction-first approach—you feed this plant, this plant wants to poke things, this plant plays tones when touched—and then we designed the plant to encourage and foster those interactions.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Finally, what thoughts went into the different worlds players could explore with their lander? Into creating whole worlds to amaze the player, and the ways in which they could interact with those worlds? When you were not bound by the limits of the player's living space, how did that alter your designs? &nbsp;</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We went through several radically different concepts for the lander. We knew we wanted to keep the player in their room at all times but that we wanted to allow them to explore these worlds. We settled on the lander feed concept as something that would allow players to collect some lore, catch the vibe of the planet, and get a sense of the plant’s home world all while still keeping them grounded in their home environment.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To do this, we close all the exterior windows of the ship, dim the passthrough, and focus the player's view on the feed. We wanted players to enjoy these scenes as interactive vistas. This, like many of the interactions in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, are meant to invite the player to embody the narrative of the world where they are a researcher, explorer, and caretaker. We hope that players engage with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> less as a classic game and more as an adventure that they allow themselves to imagine going on. If you are willing to play </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starship Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that way, the journey is worth the trip.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
