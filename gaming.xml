            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new update has been released for remastered platformer <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em>, and it's bringing enhancements for the Switch 2, the ability to play as Dixie Kong, and more.</p><p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/2013781050707558700" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">social media post</a> by Nintendo, the update allows you to play as Dixie Kong instead of Diddy Kong in either single-player mode or co-op play, so if you prefer swinging through the air with your helicopter hair, this is the update for you.</p><p>Not only that, but there's a brand new mode available by the name of Turbo Attack, and, as the name suggests, it'll allow you to run through speedier versions of <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em>'s existing levels for an extra layer of challenge.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>You can now play as Dixie Kong in <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em>, should you wish to.</figcaption>

<p>If you happen to be playing the game on Switch 2, then this update will also introduce "enhanced resolution, higher-definition graphics, and quicker load times", and what's more, you're getting all of that for free, which is more than you can say for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-free-update" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d3f0290f-c6b5-44ad-83e5-8a42cbb6e299" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">some</a> Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-sales" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="91a21696-562a-4257-aaec-a7380b13a7fc" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">upgrades</a>.</p><p>In case you're unfamiliar with <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em>, it is, as the name implies, an "HD" remaster of Wii platformer <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns</em>, although it'd perhaps be more accurate to call it a remaster of the 3DS version.</p><p>The game packs in all of the levels from the original release, plus the extra content the 3DS version offered, including the extra difficulty modifiers and items offered by New Mode to make things just a little less tricky.</p><p>You can check out a trailer that shows off the new content in this <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD </em>update right here.</p>

            <guid>1411747</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>JBL Tune 770NC Headphones are wireless over-the-ear headphones featuring adaptive noise cancellation, smart ambient features, and a lightweight foldable design ideal for watching video, making phone calls, and listening to music. They provide an over-the-ear fit that encloses your ears, Bluetooth 5.3 for a steady wireless connection, and JBL Pure Bass sound that delivers much more bass to your music. Plus, with up to 70 hours of battery life, you can listen to music all day (or longer) without needing to find a power source.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6803/">Go to Amazon to purchase the JBL Tune 770NC Headphones for only $80, down from their retail price of $150. That’s a savings of $70 or 47% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6803/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Headphones that add a new dimension to your favorite music</h2>
<p>The JBL Tune 770NC Headphones feature an Adaptive Noise-Cancelling system that helps eliminate background noise and distractions in crowded areas, so your music or podcast is always at the forefront. The Smart Ambient system on the headphones lets you bring outside sounds back into the headphones without removing either ear cup, and the Ambient Aware and Talk Thru systems let you quickly receive information such as traffic updates and airport announcements, or engage in brief conversations. Both modes can be changed using the JBL Headphones App, and volume, skipping songs, etc., can be controlled with buttons on each ear cup.</p>
<p>When it comes to sound, the JBL Tune 770NC Headphones deliver JBL Pure Bass Sound with solid low-end response while maintaining clarity in both vocals and instruments. Bluetooth 5.3 with LE Audio enables seamless, consistent wireless audio streaming to any compatible device. Using the JBL Headphones App, you can select the Audio Mode to get richer music or Video Mode for better lip sync, and you can also choose one of several pre-set EQ options or create your own custom curve if you prefer to customize the sound.</p>



<p>A major benefit of the JBL Tune 770NC Headphones is their battery performance. They offer up to 70 hours of playtime per charge. In addition, a 5-minute charge via USB-C can add approximately 3 hours of listening time if you need to recharge quickly. Additionally, a full recharge typically takes approximately 2 hours. That combination of long battery life and rapid charging makes the JBL Tune 770NC Headphones reliable for extended listening.</p>
<p>The JBL Tune 770NC Headphones feature a lightweight, over-the-ear band-style design that fits securely and comfortably on your head. The headphones fold to minimize their size when not in use and can be easily stored in a drawer or backpack. The headphones also support multi-point Bluetooth pairing so that you can connect to two devices simultaneously, and the VoiceAware feature lets you adjust how much of your own voice you hear during phone calls. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6803/">The combination of comfort, foldability, and flexible connections makes the JBL Tune 770NC a good value for a pair of over-the-ear headphones, especially since they can be purchased today for $80</a>, $70 less than their typical retail price of $150.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/8-best-games-to-play-if-you-like-hytale/</link>
            <guid>1411744</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hytale has recently launched in Early Access, and it’s fair to say it’s been a hit amongst fans and critics alike. Insider Gaming gave it a stellar <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-first-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first impressions review</a>, and updates are already rolling out thick and fast.</p>



<p>However, as is the case with most Early Access titles, there’s only so much of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-to-find-thorium-ore-in-hytale-thorium-ingots-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale</a> to enjoy at the moment, with plenty of content gated behind ‘Work In Progress’ barriers. It’s no fault of the game itself, but if you’ve enjoyed your time in Hytale so far and are looking for something with a bit more meat on its bones, then you’re in luck. </p>







<p>Here are eight games that you should play if you like Hytale. </p>



<h2 id="h-minecraft">Minecraft</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Build awesome structures. Image by Mojang.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Let’s start with the obvious—Minecraft. It’s no secret that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/8-things-hytale-does-better-than-minecraft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale was heavily influenced by Minecraft</a>; in fact, the creators began their development journey making mini-games and servers for it!</p>



<p>With that in mind, if you’ve somehow played Hytale and not Minecraft, you should definitely give it a go. Aside from the obvious blocky nature, it has an incredible amount of similarities. From a dangerous night time to vast biomes to explore, Minecraft is the sandbox that started it all. </p>



<h2 id="h-terraria">Terraria</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A minor dimensional shift. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p>From looking at the image above, you might look at Terraria’s 2D art-style and wonder how it is at all similar to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-repair-in-hytale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale</a>? Well, despite their dimensional differences, the core gameplay loops actually have a lot of similarities. </p>



<p>Terraria is filled to the brim with various monsters and bosses to fight, and the constant cycle of mining and getting better gear from rarer resources never gets dull. The game’s progression is as deep as its caves, and if you haven’t played Terraria before, they’re very deep indeed. </p>



<h2 id="h-vintage-story">Vintage Story</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A more realistic take on survival. Image by Humble Store.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Vintage Story is an incredibly underrated survival game that also shares a blocky aesthetic, but don’t let the similarities to Minecraft or Hytale fool you. It is a much more brutal take on the survival formula, so if you felt Hytale was too bright and charming, Vintage Story might be the one for you. </p>



<h2 id="h-stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</h2>



<figure><figcaption>There’s a lot more to it than just tending crops. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you look at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-stardew-valley-1-7-update-includes-new-farm-type-lots-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stardew Valley</a> for the first time, you might mistakenly take it for a simple farming simulator, but it’s so much more than that. Of course, the farming aspect does play a central role in the game, but there’s caving, fishing, romancing—it has it all!</p>



<p>There are hundreds of hours worth of content in Stardew Valley, so if you enjoyed the cosiness of Hytale but want something more long-term, then it might be time for you to open your first farm.</p>



<h2 id="h-valheim">Valheim</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Take to the open seas. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If anything, despite its visual style, Hytale might just share the most in common with Valheim. Exploration is central to progression in Valheim, and you’ll need to travel across the world in search of more powerful resources, whilst also engaging with the various enemies and hazards that litter the land.</p>







<p>Although Valheim is also in Early Access, it’s much further along in development compared to Hytale, and there’s a ton of content to engage with. If you’re desperate to live out your Viking fantasies, then Valheim should be your next purchase.</p>



<h2 id="h-disney-dreamlight-valley">Disney Dreamlight Valley</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Meet tons of recognisable characters. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Disney Dreamlight Valley is a deceptively content-rich game full of stuff for you to unpack. It’s described as a hybrid between a life-sim and adventure game, and there aren’t many better ways to put it.</p>



<p>Whilst it does lack the survival elements of Hytale, it does instead feature similar base-building and adventuring aspects. If those are what you love about Hytale, and if you’ve got a strong affinity for Disney characters, then don’t sleep on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-best-games-like-disney-dreamlight-valley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-enshrouded">Enshrouded</h2>



<figure><figcaption>One of the best building systems around. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s another Early Access title, but Enshrouded needs to be on this list for its building systems alone. Some truly wondrous creations can be built, and it’s all so incredibly simple, but there’s a lot more to Enshrouded than just building. </p>



<p>Explore and survive in a vast open world filled with secrets to uncover and enemies to fight. It’s a hostile world, but thankfully, there are plenty of items and gear ready to craft. It might share more similarities with Valheim than Hytale, but it’s a best-in-class survival game that’s worth checking out.</p>



<h2 id="h-modded-minecraft">Modded Minecraft</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s like a whole new game. Screenshot by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Okay, this final entry might be cheap, but give it a chance. If you’ve enjoyed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-minecraft-crossplay-mod-has-been-created/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale</a> but feel that Minecraft doesn’t quite scratch the same itch, then try modding it! Minecraft is one of the most popular games to mod, and some of them can genuinely reshape the game. </p>



<p>From building factories to exploring new dimensions, the possibilities are truly endless with modded Minecraft. Best yet, if you’re confused or uninterested in debugging a compatible mod list, then there are thousands of pre-curated modpacks ready to be installed and played in moments.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/developer-behind-fallen-trailer-responds-to-ai-backlash</link>
            <guid>1411738</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The founder, director, producer, and writer behind indie title <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallen"><u>Fallen</u></a> has responded to claims its reveal trailer was built using generative AI, confirming that it was a "tone pitch" with AI "placeholders [that] briefly escaped the context [they were] meant to live in."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After the Fallen reveal teaser debuted on IGN, commenters were quick to critique it, with one writing: "Woof. Any way to unreveal it?" and another saying: "can't wait to not touch this with a 10-foot pole."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Are game companies even aware of how controversial using AI art is?" asked someone else in the comments. "Why can't [they] just read the room."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can watch the trailer yourself below:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, creator Brooke Burgess has clarified that while there are AI "placeholders" in the trailer, the gameplay, environments, cinematics, and combat is "real, in-engine UE5.4 work" and "all writing is mine (no LLMs), all audio is bespoke, VO is from my colleague Kasper Michaels, and all creative support [and] implementation was done in close collaboration with my lead."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think most of the confusion boils down to context," Burgess told <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fallen-gen-ai-real-in-engine-ue54-work/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TheGamer</u></a>. "What ended up being shared as an 'official trailer' was actually our early dev 'tone pitch,' i.e., a work-in-progress UE5 teaser designed for funding discussions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There are [AI-generated] placeholders in there, specifically some 2D test assets used to explore mood and presentation (for example, how 'lost souls' and fallen angels in the game might react when spoken to and judged, along with [work-in-progress] HUD elements). That material was never intended as final content, nor as a statement on how the shipped game would be made."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a separate interview, Burgess told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/fallen-creator-brooke-burgess-on-the-struggle-to-get-game-funding-above-1-million" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GamesIndustry.biz</u></a> last week that he was not "waving the flag of AI by any stretch."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm not going to sell my soul and be like, 'Yeah, I'll do it by myself, let me prompt this whole game into existence'," Burgess said. "No, I want to work with really talented people and make something cool. But if integrating it in a way that doesn't affect creativity, but helps to save a little bit of money and gets the game out there to people, and gives us a chance to make something cool and memorable, and then make something else after that — it's something I have to factor in."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He also revealed that "every" prospective publisher has asked how he intends to use AI to "save money."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Every publisher I've talked to has brought up: 'So, have you thought about how AI might be able to save money on this?'" he added. "Almost all of them. They want to know that you're thinking about it, that you understand the potential."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallen is an "epic dark fantasy action adventure game" featuring an avenging angel sent to the depths of Hell for one purpose — "to judge every demon, lost soul, and fallen angel, and bring an end to the cycle of suffering once and for all!" We don't have a release date or even a release windows at this time, but it is expected to come to both PC and consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Opinion on the use of AI in games continues to divide studios and their fans, with some vehemently against its use, while others claim it's an inevitable part of the future. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-co-founder-and-former-gta-writer-dan-houser-says-ai-is-like-when-we-fed-cows-with-cows-and-got-mad-cow-disease"><u>Rockstar co-founder and former Grand Theft Auto writer Dan Houser recently likened AI to mad cow disease</u></a>, but the CEO of Genvid — the company behind choose-your-own-adventure interactive series like Silent Hill Ascension — has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gen-z-loves-ai-slop-former-square-enix-exec-claims-a-lot-of-ai-sentiment-is-driven-by-emotion-rather-than-logic"><u>claimed "consumers generally do not care" about generative AI in games, and stated that: "Gen Z loves AI slop."</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA CEO Andrew Wilson has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean"><u>said AI is "the very core of our business,"</u></a> and Square Enix recently implemented mass layoffs and reorganized, saying it needed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-undergoes-mass-layoffs-as-it-reorganizes-to-consolidate-development-in-japan"><u>be "aggressive in applying AI</u></a>."

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/21/a-yakuza-kiwami-3-demo-is-rolling-out-today/</link>
            <guid>1411729</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sega has announced that a free demo for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/yakuza-kiwami-3">Yakuza Kiwami 3</a> &amp; Dark Ties is rolling out this week, starting today on PC and going live on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, Xbox Series X|S and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> tomorrow. The full release is coming on 12th February in just a few weeks.</p>
<p>The demo will be live on Steam from 3PM GMT today, 21st January, but console players will have to wait 14 hours until 5AM GMT on 22nd January for the demo to arrive there.</p>


<p>This free demo will give a preview of both sides of this expanded remake. Here’s how Sega breaks down the two experiences:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Yakuza Kiwami 3, players can explore Ryukyu, Okinawa as Kazuma Kiryu, beating down bad guys while dynamically switching between Kiryu’s brutal Dragon of Dojima: Kiwami and weapon-based Ryukyu styles and indulging in immersive side experiences like karaoke, sub-stories, outfit customisation and more.</li>
<li>In Dark Ties, players can enjoy a slice of the all-new story featuring Yoshitaka Mine, exploring Kamurocho and variety of side experiences while also sinking their teeth into Mine’s shoot-boxing combat to stylishly dispose of foes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yakuza Kiwami 3 is a remake of the third game in the popular crime drama series, recreating the PS3 original with some modernisation and new additions. As Kiryu has to save Okinawa’s Morning Glory Orphanage from those looking to force him and the children out of their home, he’ll be able to jump into a new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/23/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-adds-a-new-bad-boy-dragon-mode/">Bad Boy Dragon mode that was revealed in December</a>.</p>
<p>So, what do you do in Bad Boy Dragon? Well, basically, Kiryu joins and leads the Haisai Girls gang to dominance. You’ll gather allies and train them up until they can take on the toughest gangs in the country, fighting in turf wars for territory, jumping into Baddies Battles with a small party of five, or going for a 20-member battle in Rumbles. You can also hop onto your motorbikes and raid enemy bases. There’s a ton of customisation here that looks like it could be &nbsp;a fun timesink.</p>

<p>Then there’s Dark Ties, which sees Yoshitaka Mine trying to bolster his reputation and rise through the ranks. This is a fresh side-story to the main Yakuza 3 tale, but RGG has now revealed the Hell’s Arena underground fight club that you can dive into. Your goal is to dive into 1v1 Hellish Brawls and perilous races to avoid hunters through a treasure-filled dungeon in Survival Hell.</p>

              <p>The Xbox Elite Series 2 Core Controller works with Xbox consoles and PC and emphasizes comfort, control, and customization. The controller itself is white and features a wraparound grip covered in soft rubber. With support for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Windows PC, Android, and iOS, one controller can accompany you from the couch to your computer desk, or even to your mobile device.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6519/">You may purchase the Xbox Elite Series 2 Core Controller on Amazon for just $110, a $40 discount and 27% off its regular price of $150.</a></p>

<h2>The perfect controller for hardcore Xbox players</h2>
<p>The Xbox Elite Series 2 Core Controller contains adjustable-tension thumbsticks. These allow you to adjust the tension to either loose or tight, based on what feels best for you. Shorter hair-trigger locks allow less travel, reducing the time it takes for actions to register. The wraparound rubberized grip covers the back and sides of the controller, providing additional grip during longer gaming sessions.</p>
<p>You can create up to three custom profiles and switch between them with a single button. Button remapping in the Xbox Accessories app lets you place actions wherever it makes sense for your gaming experience and save each profile for future use.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include connecting to Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One consoles via Xbox Wireless, Bluetooth, or the included USB-C cable. Once connected to one of these console types, you can pair your controller with their Windows PC, Android smartphone, or iOS device to enable gameplay and/or other compatible services. You can also use the included 3.5mm stereo headset jack to connect a wired headset to the controller instead of using an available headset port on their system.</p>



<p>When you buy the controller, you’ll get all the necessary accessories to get started using the upgraded controls right away. Included with the controller are the USB-C cable, a D-pad, two standard thumbsticks, and a thumbstick adjustment tool used to adjust the tension system of the thumbsticks. Additional optional parts to further customize the controller are also available for purchase.</p>
<p>The Xbox Elite Series 2 Core Controller combines improved comfort, additional control options, and greater flexibility in how many devices it can connect to, offering users an upgrade. You can expect up to 40 hours of battery life from the controller, reducing the need to recharge it during extended gaming sessions. When taking into account the adjustable hardware, custom profiles, compatibility with multiple devices, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6519/">and the sale price of $110 versus the regular retail price of $150, the Xbox Elite Series 2 Core Controller is a great way to enhance your gaming experience while continuing to utilize the same systems you have been using.</a></p>

<p>It's a beast</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>If you happen to be lucky enough to own a Switch 2, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X, then chances are you've had to do a little rearranging just to get them all to fit correctly underneath (or to the side of) your TV.</p>
<p>Well, YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@xnzxnz">Xiao Ningzi</a> has come up with a rather novel – and surprisingly elegant – solution, by combining all three consoles into one giant machine. The result is pretty cool, albeit not one that we'd be in a rush to emulate anytime soon.</p>
<p>Essentially, with a simple press of a button, the 'Ningtendo PXbox 5', as it's been christened, can switch between all three consoles at will. You might be wondering how it works with docking the Switch 2, and this is done by sliding the console into the side of the device, with a red eject button used to pop it back out. The downside to this is that it has to go in sideways, which is a little concerning, but if the vents are kept clear, that's the main thing, right?</p>
<p>Switching between each console takes mere seconds, though we remain unconvinced that it would stay cool enough to keep everything safe and in good working order. Still, it's a fun little experiment, and we applaud the process Ningzi went through to get everything done.</p>

			<p><em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> went through a <strong>deep identity crisis</strong> following the glorious 16-bit entries in the series. The transition to <strong>3D gameplay</strong> wasn't smooth at all, and the <strong>many experiments conducted by Team Sonic weren't always successful.</strong> </p>



<p>2022's <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/sonic-frontiers-review-wheres-the-fun-in-being-careful/"><strong><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Sonic Frontier</em> is, in my opinion, among those experiments that</strong> <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">succeeded,</strong></a> as, even with some issues, the game did a great job <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">capturing the spirit of the franchise</strong> while trying to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">push the formula in a new direction</strong>. SEGA and Team Sonic, apparently, share my sentiment.</p>



<p><strong>Known and reliable insider Nate the Hate</strong>, who has an <strong>excellent track record</strong> with many early reveals (<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-16th/">including the Switch 2 official announcement date last year</a></strong>) <strong><a href="https://xcancel.com/NateTheHate2/status/2013707082789237065#m">replied to an X user question</a></strong> regarding the <strong>next entry in the Sonic the Hedgehog series</strong>. </p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Did you like Frontiers?</em>" the leaker replied, leaving <strong>little doubt about the direction of the yet-to-be-announced game.</strong></p>



<p>While the game is generally regarded as a solid entry in the series, the community seems divided on a hypothetical <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Sonic Frontiers 2</em>. </p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Hopefully the artstyle is more cartoonish. Frontiers felt too much like one of those "Mario in UE5" type videos,"</em> said Reddit user KittenDecomposer96 on the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qif3a7/natethehate_seemingly_says_the_next_sonic_game/">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a></strong>. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"I really felt like they dropped Sonic on a generic UE5 terrain and randomly sprinkled some Sonic elements over the place,"</em> agreed Phos-Lux, echoing the wider community sentiment.</p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">The evolution of Sonic Frontiers' open-world gameplay</strong>, however, is making other fans <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">excited</strong> about the possibilities. <em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">"They could make it open world and connect the areas, let us actually see Sonic's world properly,</em>" said Phos-Lux, highlighting well what Team Sonic could do for the next entry in the series.</p>



<p>As the identity crisis I mentioned above often led Team Sonic to almost completely discard gameplay formulas in favor of others, I would definitely welcome the developer <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)">iterating on and improving the Frontiers open-world formula</strong>. While the game's plot justified the generic visual identity of the open world, I couldn't help by wonder how much better the game would have been if it had the colorful cartoonish visuals that have defined the series, no matter the quality of each game.</p>



<p>Regardless of how the next Sonic the Hedgehog game will play, it hopefully won't take much longer to know <strong>what's next for the franchise. </strong>2026 marks the series' <strong>35th Anniversary</strong>, and its celebrations would be perfect to unveil what's next for it.</p>

            <p>Ah, no, not that one. That, I assume, has been the reaction of folks who've gone to pre-order the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon-2025">Marathon</a> reboot on Steam, and immediately been informed that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> is sneaking its way back onto their machines. Thankfully, Bungie have now fixed whatever issue was causing the latter to take pre-purchases of the former as a cue to re-install itself.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Yep, ahead of its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathons-final-release-date-locked-in-by-bungie-with-the-shooter-finally-set-to-run-out-of-cover-soon">arrival on March 5th</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>'s been trying to do its mate and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-still-fully-dedicated-to-releasing-marathon-by-march-as-they-sigh-in-disappointment-at-bungies-money-numbers">higher-ups at Sony</a> a solid by persuading folks they might as well fire up the MMO.</p>
<p>Hence the following post from Bungie early this morning: "We've resolved an issue where Destiny 2 would begin installing after pre-ordering Marathon on Steam. We have also resolved an issue where Collector's Edition owners would receive an error when attempting to activate their game code on Steam."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We've resolved an issue where Destiny 2 would begin installing after pre-ordering Marathon on Steam. We have also resolved an issue where Collector's Edition owners would receive an error when attempting to activate their game code on Steam.</p>— Marathon Development Team (@MarathonDevTeam) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/2013752445231305147?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2026</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Given PC Destiny 2's file size can balloon up to around 170 GB, that's certainly a relief. I'd liken it to suddenly having a piano dropped on your hard drive, but I reckon Destiny 2 would want to be classed as some sort of weird futuristic instrument with a name like 'The Keypresser'. As opposed to Marathon, which would almost certainly insist that whatever the instrument's name was, it must be painted lime green and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nobodys-reinventing-the-wheel-with-marathons-mechanics-says-former-art-boss-so-the-visual-design-needed-to-take-risks">vaguely remind you of plastic IKEA furniture</a>.</p><p>Then again, the Destiny 2 side of the fence has had its own Marathon pre-order problem. Bungie have also <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/2013356027261935971">fixed an issue</a> which was leading Marathon-themed gear for the MMO, which is included as part of a Marathon pre-order, from showing up for collection at Destiny 2's special deliveries kiosk. So, people who wanted Marathon got an extra Destiny 2, and people who wanted Destiny 2 with a bit of Marathon in it just got Destiny 2.</p>
<p>If only I was as good at self-promo as the shooter about running around with a wee robot eye. I'd probably be ruling the galaxy by now.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jbl-boombox-4-drops-below-black-friday-prices-as-the-latest-portable-speaker-hits-a-new-low-2000661377</link>
            <guid>1411708</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="585">A dependable portable Bluetooth speaker is one of those essentials you don’t realize you need until the moment music is missing. Whether you’re hosting friends in your living room, hanging out in the backyard, spending a day at the beach, or heading off on a weekend camping trip, good sound can completely define the mood. Phone speakers sitting in red cups simply don’t cut it, and that’s where a powerful option like the JBL Boombox 4 earns its place. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6802/">Right now, it’s even more appealing thanks to its first big price drop that brings it down to $450 — an 18% discount and its lowest prices to date.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6802/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="734" data-end="777">Big, Powerful Sound That Fills Any Space</h2>
<p data-start="587" data-end="1128">The JBL Boombox 4 is built to make a statement, both visually and sonically. Weighing in at about 13 pounds and stretching nearly 20 inches wide, it’s unapologetically large. That size translates directly into sound performance. This speaker delivers room-filling volume with deep, punchy bass that small portable speakers simply can’t match. From blasting music outdoors to filling a large indoor space at a house party, the JBL&nbsp; Boombox 4 creates an immersive, high-energy atmosphere.</p>
<p data-start="1130" data-end="1626">Despite its size, JBL designed the Boombox 4 with portability in mind. A sturdy integrated handle makes it easy to carry from place to place, so moving the party from indoors to outdoors is effortless. It’s also built to handle the elements. With an IP68 waterproof and dustproof rating, the speaker can survive splashes, rain, sand, and poolside accidents without skipping a beat. Durability like that means you can just sit back and enjoy the music instead of worrying about protecting your gear.</p>


<h2 data-start="1805" data-end="1850">All-Day Listening</h2>
<p data-start="1628" data-end="2130">Battery life is another standout. On a full charge, the JBL Boombox 4 can deliver up to 28 hours of continuous playback. That’s more than enough to last through an all-day event and well into the night. If you need even more time, JBL’s Playtime Boost mode can extend listening by up to an additional six hours, bringing it to a maximum of 34 hours of playtime. There’s also a built-in power bank, allowing you to charge your phone or other devices directly from the speaker—super useful when outlets are nowhere to be found.</p>
<p data-start="2132" data-end="2576" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Bluetooth connectivity keeps things simple, letting you stream music from phones, tablets, laptops, or TVs. With Auracast support, you can even link multiple compatible speakers together for synchronized audio throughout a larger space.</p>
<p data-start="2132" data-end="2576" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6802/">The JBL Boombox 4 comes in your choice of three colors.</a> There’s the standard black, a stylish blue, and “Squad” which is a camo pattern. All three options are on sale for the same discounted price of just $450.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After a lengthy wait and a last-minute delay last month, Echoes of Elysium is finally poised to release in early access, with the release date and exact start times now confirmed.</p>



<p>The action-adventure RPG hands players their very own airship to customize and expand with crafting, weapons, and more, as you explore the world of Elysium, an environment full of mysteries to uncover.</p>



<p>If you’ve been anxiously waiting for the Echoes of Elysium release date, Insider Gaming has all the details on the exact start time, so you can work out exactly how many hours there are to wait.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-echoes-of-elysium-release">When Does Echoes of Elysium Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Skybound. Image via Loric Games Inc.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Echoes of Elysium is set for release on Tuesday, January 27, bringing an end to the long wait fans have had to endure.</strong></p>



<p>An initial early access release date was slated for December 4, before a last-minute announcement pushed the release date back to the above date.</p>



<p>The delay allowed the team to be “deeply focused on improving stability and overall game feel,” and was about “addressing real issues” so that when players jump in, the “experience is solid, reliable, and ready to grow.”</p>



<p>Tweaks include crash resolving and smoothing out rough systems, as well as porting the game entirely to a new version of Unity. The result is a build that is “significantly more stable” and “in a far better position,” so the delay has been worth the wait.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new gacha-RPG title is spinning onto the scene with the release of Arknights: Endfield, and a customary question to ask with every release is whether the title will be available with an Xbox Game Pass subscription.</p>



<p>Arknights: Endfield releases on January 22, expanding the Arknights universe on the back of the original game, which was released in China in May 2019 and in other countries in January 2020.</p>



<p>If you were a fan of that title and are keen to jump into Arknights: Endfield, Insider Gaming has all the details on whether the title is available with a Game Pass subscription.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-arknights-endfield-on-xbox-game-pass">Is Arknights: Endfield on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New journey. Image via GRYPHLINE</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Arknights: Endfield is not available on Xbox Game Pass, and it isn’t available on Xbox Series X|S at all.</strong></p>



<p>However, that doesn’t close the door entirely to Game Pass fans as, while it isn’t available on the service, Arknights: Endfield is available on PC, and it’s a free-to-play game, so you don’t need to splash out any additional funds to enjoy it.</p>



<p>While it won’t be available through Game Pass specifically, PC players can still enjoy it. Unfortunately, there’s no similar news for Xbox Series X|S players, as there is no indication the game will arrive on the console.</p>



<p>That might be frustrating for Xbox Series X|S players, particularly as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arknights-endfield-platforms-ps5-xbox-series-x-s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arknights: Endfield is available on PlayStation 5</a>. </p>



<h2 id="h-will-arknights-endfield-be-added-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Arknights: Endfield be Added to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>It is unlikely that Arknights: Endfield will be added to the Xbox Game Pass service, as the free-to-play approach means it’s not necessary.</strong></p>



<p>Recent updates to the Xbox app on PC make it easy to launch games across different launchers, so putting the title on Game Pass wouldn’t make much difference, and, due to the free-to-play nature, there’s no need to add Arknights: Endfield to the service if a console release on Xbox Series X|S occurs later down the line.</p>



<p>Free games have been added to Game Pass in the past, however, often providing additional in-game bonuses, so this is a route that could appear in the future. For now, though, there is no indication that Arknights: Endfield will be available on Game Pass anytime soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> developer Embark Studios has said players who spawn late don’t realize they “economically profit way more” than players who don’t.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/that-really-sucks-arc-raiders-lead-responds-to-complaints-about-late-spawns-says-late-joiners-are-important-and-profit-way-more-but-embark-knows-its-annoying-to-have-no-time-for-objectives/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar</a>, design lead Virgil Watkins discussed the extraction shooter’s divisive late spawn system, which can see players join games with around 20 minutes left to go. The feeling from some is that this can be a frustrating experience because it gives late joiners less time to complete objectives, and there isn’t as much loot around. But Watkins suggested the data tells a different story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We 100% acknowledge the whole thing of, 'Man, I came in to do that trial and now I clearly don't have enough time to do that, and that sucks, so I'm just going to leave,' or whatever. That aspect is definitely not great,” Watkins admitted.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"But similar to the perception of free kits versus what they do, the perception around late joining and what it affords you has been quite interesting. Players are like, 'The loot's all gone,' or whatever else. But players who late join economically profit way more than people who aren't. The session, when they are fresh, does eventually get quieter, and very often they come across the remnants of fights or can maybe take out bigger drones or hit high-ticket areas more readily than other players. So that's been a very interesting thing to look at."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what is the goal behind the late join system? According to Watkins, it helps mitigate deserted raids. Indeed, Embark distributes loot in such a way so “there should be plenty of stuff for players to do” even if they join late.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It will be interesting to see if Watkins’ explanation here turns sentiment on late spawns around. Since Arc Raiders’ explosive launch, its late spawn system has come under fire from some who feel it needs to be overhauled. There’s frustration on both sides, with those who have to face late spawns having been in a game from the start also expressing concern.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Game of 2025</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's crazy that my team can clear a section of Stella Montis, place traps near the popular entrances, and start looting... only to have a full team of three, heavy shield, volcano running players spawn 50 FEET AWAY from us in a random room in the corner of the area... spawning basically on top of us, at 15 MINUTES REMAINING,” said one fan last month. “There is no counter, there is no chance of winning, they bypassed our traps as they spawned in the room next to me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The ONLY players who should be spawning in five minutes into the raid or later are FREE LOADOUTS. Tarkov got that system down with the player Scavs, and it works very well. The initial spawn should be player loadouts only, then free loadouts come in at 25, 20, and 15 minutes remaining. Does that sound reasonable?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm not crazy right? I've spawned literally on top of players who were looting and have gotten extremely unfair free kills because of it. Even reworking the spawning mechanic wont fix it, as you shouldn't have to worry about a random full geared 3-man at 15 minutes remaining after 5 minutes of silence after your team wiped out 12 players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Spawning in a 20 with gear sucks. Most of the PVP is gone, half the loot is already extracted. It sucks for everyone else too, they are low on meds, shields are nearly broken, and now 3-9 completely fresh, geared players have arrived at unexpected locations you just cleared.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-update-targets-infamous-stella-montis-glitch-but-some-say-rats-are-still-in-the-walls">Embark released a new patch for Arc Raiders</a> that stamped out some infamous out-of-bounds exploits – but players said "rats" still live in the walls of Stella Montis.

<p>Reunion, which is set to release on March 26th, kicks its tale into gear via a big fire at Caledon University, where Max teaches photography. "Returning from a weekend away, Max finds her beloved Caledon ablaze, as a raging inferno destroys the hallowed grounds and ends the lives of Max’s friends, students and faculty alike," reads the blurb. Max, having escaped thanks to her supernatural time rewinding powers, then has three days to work out who did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFTLKWw542g">reverse Billy Joel song</a> and became a twisted firestarter.</p>
<p>Chloe shows up to help, with developers Deck Nine explaining her return as "a shocking repercussion of Max’s merging of the timelines" at the end of previous entry <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Double Exposure</a>. Chloe's got "nightmares of a past she never lived", and also her handy backtalk ability, which is perfect for interrogating suspects to help Max solve the game's narrative puzzles.</p><p>Deck Nine promise plenty of choices, many words, and all of the emotions as the pair's story wraps up.

<p>Arknights: Endfield is a mix of elements, featuring action, RPG, and adventure-style gameplay, wth some strategy and base-building thrown in for good measure. If you’re looking forward to Arknights: Endfield, check out its release date and start times.</p>



<p>On the surface, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arknights-endfield-release-date-start-times/Endfield%20is%20Coming%20to%20PlayStation%205%20-%20Insider%20Gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arknights: Endfield</a> looks like another cutesy action game featuring ‘interestingly dressed’ characters, certain to catch the eyes of players. But there’s more to Arknights: Endfield than this, and it’s a significant step up over its predecessor.</p>



<p>It got a great reception at Gamescom 2025, and its pre-registrations show it could be very popular.</p>

It's an exciting launch for us. We're still in the early stages of this rollout. Roughly a third of our members&nbsp; have access to TV-based games as a process of upgrading the TV technology and TV clients to be able to handle that," said Peters.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"And recently, with our party games on TV—</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Boggle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pictionary</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>LEGO Party!</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—we've seen really strong uptake.

Games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> if its pursuit of Warner Bros. Discovery proves successful).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Following that reset, Netflix has focused on expanding its slate of games with social party titles, recognizable properties from third-party studios (such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Red Dead Redemption</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">), and more casual titles based on its own IP.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/should-triple-a-sequels-have-smaller-budgets-than-their-predecessors-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Should triple-A sequels have smaller budgets than their predecessors?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The hope is that Netflix subscribers—all of whom have access to Netflix Games—will either choose to play those titles on mobile devices,&nbsp;web browser, or on compatible televisions (while using their smartphone as controller, in some instances).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Given Netflix boasted over 325 million paid members during the fourth-quarter of the last fiscal year, it's not hard to see why the company is keen to make video games as accessible as possible. According to Peters, however, there is still some way to go on that journey.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We are just scratching the surface today in terms of what we can do in this space, but we are already seeing multiple instances of how this approach not only extends the audience's engagement with the service and with the story, but it also creates synergies that reinforces both mediums. So the interactive and non-interactive side. That drives more engagement and more retention," he added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Bottom line: we're very bullish on the opportunity side. We're seeing progress, but we still have a lot of work to go do.

            <p>Those who pre-ordered Marathon on Steam following its release date reveal may have noticed something strange come in the aftermath of their eager purchase, as Bungie's other big release was being sneakily installed for those keen on the upcoming extraction shooter.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/2013752445231305147">In a statement</a> from the official Marathon development team account, news that this ultimately harmless (but funny) bug has been fixed was conveyed to the public.</p>
<p>It reads: "We've resolved an issue where <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> would begin installing after pre-ordering Marathon on Steam. We have also resolved an issue where Collector's Edition owners would receive an error when attempting to activate their game code on Steam."</p>

<p>Marathon has proven quite the popular pre-order <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-release-date-reportedly-leaks-via-xbox-store-pre-order-trailer">ever since the release date announcement occurred earlier this week</a>. The game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-soars-to-steams-top-sellers-after-release-date-reveal">quickly soared to the upper echelons of Steam's top sellers page</a>, ranking only under some AAA titles with major discounts and mainstays like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter Strike 2</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-art-lead-departs-bungie-of-his-own-volition-ahead-of-games-new-release-date">The art lead for Marathon recently left the team of his own volition</a>, only a few months before the game's release. This came following a major gameplay overhaul for Marathon following public tests, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-plagiarism-scandal-resolved-satisfaction-of-artist">an art plagiarism scandal</a> which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">reportedly rocked morale</a> at the company.</p>

Former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/titanfall-2-review">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> devs deserve the benefit of the doubt, however, which is why we're keeping tabs on what's going on with <a href="https://playhighguard.com/">Highguard</a> ahead of its 26th January launch.</p>
<p>Only a few days ago, we learned (via <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2026/01/17/highguard-did-not-pay-for-its-infamous-game-awards-finale-slot/">Forbes</a>) that showrunner <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> enjoyed what he'd seen of the game so much that he offered Wildlight Entertainment that final slot at the show free of charge. Glance around social media for a bit and you'll also notice the talk has slowly shifted towards "what if Highguard is actually good?" after its middling trailer. After all, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and Apex Legends are among the best-feeling FPS we've had in recent times. What if marketing for the game simply hasn't been <em>good</em>?</p>
<p>There was nothing offensive about the first look at the game; <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-big-reveal-this-year-was-for-a-shooter-from-the-creatives-behind-apex-legends-and-titanfall-and-it-looked-fine">it looked fine</a>. The problem is "fine" rarely cuts it anymore, and the shadow of <a href="https://www.vg247.com/concord-review">Concord</a> cratering in 2024 still looms over the entire hero shooter space. FPS aficionados have been wondering why we haven't heard anything from the official channels since The Game Awards. The official website has been running a countdown, sure, but where's the buzz? Is Wildlight trying to pull off an Apex Legends-inspired drop here?</p>
<p><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/history/">SteamDB's update history</a> suggests the game's alive and well, on track for its launch next Monday across PC (Steam) and current-gen consoles. In fact, activity has ramped up again this week, with new tags being added and taken out, and package changes happening in the background. Even if the initial wave of backlash was scary, it appears plans haven't changed and we're just look at an unusual pre-launch period.</p>

<p>Across X/Twitter and BlueSky, YouTubers, streamers, and other notable names in the games industry are beginning to believe in <a href="https://x.com/Snamwiches/status/2013742846629601773?s=20">the possibility of the game popping off</a> once we actually get to play it. "I'm half convinced it's going to be good. Too many people put their chips down on it failing," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/papapishu.bsky.social/post/3mcm6giae7k2j">posted Aftermath's Chris Person</a> on 17th January. If we look at past examples of games <em>that part </em>of YouTube dogpiled on, we could say Highguard's chances of success might actually be solid.</p><p>In any case, the actual marketing for the game might actually be the absence of any official marketing. Somehow, that's led to viral tweets and posts about <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/austinwalker.bsky.social/post/3mcl4gx5yfs2h">closely examining a single paragraph of info</a> and it maybe just <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/headfallsoff.com/post/3mcl6ox2wnk2n">containing the executable for Tribes 2</a> (my beloved). It takes me back to the old days of collective psychosis over shocking online game launches, and that isn't too bad a feeling.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>You can’t imagine an RPG landscape without Final Fantasy at the centre of it. From its formative years on the NES and SNES through to Final Fantasy 7’s iconic transition to the original PlayStation, this is a series that hasn’t just characterised generations of consoles and RPGs, it has extended its reach through music, movies, and myriad different gaming genres.</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE - One-Winged Angel Trailer | Switch 2 &amp; Xbox" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YwZ8SkxWIQU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s impossible to understate just how crucial the success of Final Fantasy VII Remake was. Thankfully, it thoroughly exceeded expectations, and after a period of PlayStation exclusivity (with a PC port lagging behind), it’s now arriving on Xbox Series X|S consoles and Nintendo’s Switch 2 with its improved and expanded Intergrade form. &nbsp;Looking at the version for Nintendo’s incredible hybrid, this is a truly excellent way to experience this iconic game.</p>


<p>The sense of scale in Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is incredible. From the opening cutscene that captures the city of Midgar, the lived-in streets and children’s playgrounds loomed over by mako reactors, it’s clear that the original game’s vision has been fully realised here. The art direction stays true to the polygonal originals, while bringing the cast, and the world, to life like never before. Perhaps most surprisingly, the Switch 2 port manages to retain some of the visual enhancements from the full-fat PS5 version of Intergrade, rather than simply targeting the original PS4 outing.</p>


<p>Straight away, it’s clear that this is the upgraded lighting and texture package, and it serves to enhance what was already a fantastic-looking game. Light diffuses through smoke and fog, armour and clothing textures look more realistic, while shadows and reflections are of higher quality.</p>
<p>Rejoining Cloud, Barret, Jessie, Biggs and Wedge for that initial infiltration mission sets you on course for one of the most iconic journeys in gaming. We can argue all we like about whether the second game in this remade journey lives up to the first, and we can argue all we like about whether the original should have been broken up in the way that it has, but indisputably, Final Fantasy Remake Intergrade remains one of the best RPG games of recent years. That doesn’t change here in this Switch 2 version.</p>
<p>There’s also no change to the frame rate, at least compared to the original PlayStation 4 release. Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade runs at a locked 30fps on Switch 2. There’s no apparent dips, no fluctuations, and it’s a rock-solid experience, one that feels excellent whether playing docked or handheld.</p>

<p>That said, if you’ve played the PS5 edition, you can feel the slower response time in combat from playing at 30fps, and during exploration. Still, you cannot expect a game with this degree of visual fidelity to hit 60fps on the Switch 2, and given how well it does run, and the fact it has some of the next-gen visual upgrades, it feels like Square Enix have made another high water mark for what we should expect from Switch 2 ports going forward.</p>
<p>There’s a suite of difficulty levels available, and you need to be careful about which of these you opt for, because they really do make a key difference to how Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade feels. While there’s the expected Easy and Normal options, you can also opt for ‘Classic’, which sees your character automatically attack, leaving you free to select abilities, items and special attacks.</p>
<p>Here, though, there’s also a head start option that sees you begin from a higher level, equipped with swords that hold a huge chunk of SP, and pockets packed with an insane number of potions, Phoenix Down and the like. If you’re a returning player, it does serve to speed you through the earlier hours, but if you’re a newcomer, it removes so much of the experience that I’d advise against this mode. It’s nice to have all these options, but just take a moment to think about how you want to experience this incredible title.</p>

<p>There’s so many reasons that I absolutely love this game, but replaying it on Switch 2, it’s the sense of place, the sense of community and the boring, mundane, vital sense of humanity that strikes hardest. It’s the rats in the street, the snippets of overheard conversation, the crowds who grumble as you steam right through them in Sector 7. It’s a world that feels lived in, a trick that George Lucas got right the first time in Star Wars, and which Final Fantasy 7 Intergrade uses to ground the world, and its story, while giving you the kind of setting to create a cavalcade of ideas, daydreams and half-truths.</p>
<p>Of course, the exquisite visual design gives you rather more than the PlayStation original. The added fidelity allowed the team at Square Enix to capture interactions that feel realistic, Cloud’s awkward-but-sweet pauses and attempts at aloofness are countered by Barret’s gruff persona, rubbing up against his true tender nature. Aerith, Tifa and Jessie all feel like real, rounded characters, and as you dig into each of their individual back stories, you come to understand what’s led them to this place. For all that the 1997 original managed to achieve plenty of that same character building with far less at its disposal, Remake Intergrade brings everything into stark relief, fulfilling the true vision of its creators.</p>

<p>On top of the original Final Fantasy VII Remake, Nintendo and Xbox players are getting the Intergrade DLC as well, available from the off at the title screen, should you want to leap straight into the extra content. This puts the delightful Yuffie front and centre, and adds a chunk of extra story, context and new mechanics in the form of Fort Condor. It completes the opening chapter in Square Enix’s immense three-part reimagining of this story, and it’s well worth playing through, especially for the interactions with many of the characters you’ve met in the main game.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that Square Enix has made this a thoroughly approachable port by pricing it at £39.99 at launch. While the initial release of Final Fantasy VII Remake was nearly six years ago, this is the first opportunity that Xbox and Nintendo fans have had to get their hands on it, and plenty of companies would have popped this out for £60. Square Enix definitely deserves kudos for a more consumer-friendly approach.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has released a surprise update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/donkey-kong-country-returns">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a>, with features for both original Nintendo Switch and free <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> improvements as part of the update.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Country Returns HD – Update Overview – Nintendo Switch &amp; Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sl2YybDiluQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>All players across Switch and Switch 2 will now be able to play as and with Dixie Kong, subbing in for Diddy Kong. She has a different boost that she offers DK while jumping in single player, while she is also usable as the Player 2 character in co-op.</p>
<p>The update also adds a new Turbo Attack mode, which takes Time Attack and ramps up the speed of the game for even more challenge.</p>
<p>But the biggest benefits are for Switch 2 players, with improved game resolutions to take advantage of the 1080p built in screen and 4K output, as well as reduced loading times. The game also now supports local GameShare for its multiplayer.</p>

<p>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD launched around a year ago in January 2025, a late-feeling port and remaster of the game for Switch, but with the (then unannounced) <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> on the horizon. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/14/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-review-switch/">our review,</a> I said, “[it] is a fine remaster of the Wii platformer, bringing along all the tweaks from its Nintendo 3DS port. It’s not much more than that, but it’s still a great platformer.”</p>
<p>Here’s the full patch notes:</p>
<p><span>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD – Ver 1.1.0 Patch Notes</span></p>
<ul>
<li>You can now play as Dixie Kong. Her action when jumping is different from when jumping with Diddy Kong.
<ul>
<li>When playing alone, as you grab a barrel, you can switch between either Diddy Kong or Dixie Kong as the character that appears.</li>
<li>When playing with two people, P2 can switch between Diddy Kong or Dixie Kong by pressing the stick (the L Stick in the case of playing with both Joy-Con 2 or Joy-Con controllers) on the world map.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A Turbo Attack mode where you can race through the stage at high speed has been added.
<ul>
<li>If you clear the course once, it will appear at the same time as the Time Attack mode.</li>
<li>If you can clear it within the time limit, you will acquire a turbo medal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now supports Brazilian Portuguese language.
<ul>
<li>You can switch the language in the “Language” setting in the “System” menu of “System Settings.”</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Switch 2</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Now supports “GameShare (Local User).”
<ul>
<li>You can select “GameShare (Local User)” from “2 Players” on the game start screen or the menu screen of the world map.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Optimized for the <a title="Platforms > Nintendo Switch 2 [737 articles]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/platforms/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> display and high-resolution TVs for improved image quality.</li>

            <title><![CDATA[Review: Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade (Switch 2) - A Big, Bold Reimagining, And A First-Class Port]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade</link>
            <guid>1411669</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<p>I can’t tell you how many times I’ve gawked at the opening sequence to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/final_fantasy_vii">Final Fantasy VII</a> over the years. From a three-year-old, gazing up at the intro for the first time from the carpet of my living room, to watching the camera zoom out and pan across Midgar in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/final_fantasy_vii_remake">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> back in 2020, I’ve watched this cutscene in its various forms time and time again, and it never fails to amaze me.</p>
<p>So it shouldn’t surprise anyone that I’m in awe once more with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> on Nintendo Switch 2, except this time, I’m watching the same bird fly over Midgar, the kids play in the slums, and Aerith walk through the city all on a 7.9-inch LCD screen. And I’m not just in love with the wonderful music or the perfect set-up to one of the most incredible worlds in RPGs; I’m actually amazed at how good the whole thing looks on my little Switch 2 screen.</p>
<figure><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161497/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Remake is astonishing on Nintendo’s console, and is easily one of the best Switch 2 ports so far. Yes, there are caveats like 30fps, softer screen resolution, and some fuzzy textures. But Square Enix has clearly put the time and effort in here to ensure the best possible result, and with the Episode INTERMission DLC included as standard too, this might be the definitive way to play Remake on the go.</p>
<p>And that’s how I spent most of my time with it. Honestly, it’s a bit of a revelation: in both handheld and docked, Remake looks spectacular, especially when you’re exploring the iconic dieselpunk metropolis. It’s packed full of people, scrapheaps of junk, vehicles, and flowers and dead grass attempting to break through the otherwise barren grounds. I had to pinch myself a few times as I reacquainted myself with the Sector 7 Slums or the narrow alleyways of Wall Market.</p>
<p>Every single inch of Remake on Switch 2 is a real testament to the lighting, which director Hamaguchi-san <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/lighting-is-the-crucial-factor-how-square-enix-made-final-fantasy-vii-remake-look-great-on-switch-2">has acknowledged as key</a>. It makes this version appear closer to the PS5 release’s Performance Mode than the original PS4 one. I’d say that playing it docked, other than the lower frame rate and the 'dithering' around Cloud and other spiky-haired characters’ hair (apparently something to do with the upscaler struggling to interpret subpixel information), I wouldn’t be able to tell at first blush.</p>
<figure><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161490/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Areas like the aforementioned Slums are where those texture problems are most noticeable on flowers and scrap heaps in particular, but this is where most of the original's texture problems were, too. NPC faces here are also a little odd-looking, but again, this is an existing problem with Remake on other platforms. Basically, you really have to be paying attention and looking for cracks, or have ludicrously high expectations.</p>
<p>In terms of the frame rate, while docked, I didn’t notice any significant dips at all – not in combat where I was punching and kicking my way through foes with Tifa or slicing and dicing as Cloud, nor in some of the busiest areas like Wall Market. Even the motorbike sections, where lighting and particle effects are flying around the place, nothing distracted me.</p>
<p>Handheld was a little less consistent, but mostly just during cutscenes and transitions when there’s fire, trains, or a <em>lot</em> of close-up movement. And it’s never for more than a few seconds, which I can live with when playing on a small screen. The softer image quality might also take a bit of getting used to, but again, this isn’t a high-powered PC or a PS5. And this is based on the PS5 Intergrade version anyway.</p>
<figure><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161498/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>So, the <em>port</em> part of Remake is a huge success, and luckily, the game itself is, as well. It’s a fantastic RPG with some of the best combat in the genre, and a complete reimagining of the iconic three-to-five hour sequence of the PlayStation’s original release over 30 hours. And it works.</p>
<p>The action is superbly tuned, focused on utilising your entire party to take down enemies and bosses by staggering them, then dealing a huge amount of damage by using ATB-consuming skills. Every character is very different to play as, too; Tifa is excellent at putting pressure on the enemy and then dealing the big numbers once staggered, while Barret’s long-ranged gun arm can easily take down airborne enemies. You have to engage with every system in order to win, even in Normal Mode.</p>
<p>It’s not turn-based, which I know some purists aren’t happy with, but Remake still incorporates a little traditional RPG with a menu which allows you to briefly pause battles and select skills for you and your allies. I use a mix of menu-hopping and shortcuts, the latter of which doesn’t break up the flow of combat — helpful for Cloud and Tifa, who are almost always in the heat of action — and I also constantly switch between characters depending on the situation.</p>
<figure><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161502/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Touching on the narrative, I want to stress that, while Final Fantasy VII Remake is pretty darn faithful to the 1997 original, it also tests the boundaries of what a ‘remake’ actually is, particularly towards the end. I don’t like all of the changes, and a few of the new characters didn’t click with me at first, but when Remake nails it, it <em>really</em> nails it. Particularly with its characters.</p>
<p>If, like me, you grew up with Final Fantasy VII, it’s incredible to see this world and these characters fully realised on modern hardware. Cloud is not the mopey fellow the Compilation will lead you to believe; he actually has some snark and silliness to his character. And Aerith is just a remarkable human who carries the story of both this and Rebirth on her back – <a href="https://www.rpgfan.com/feature/more-than-just-a-flower-girl-a-personal-thank-you-to-aerith-gainsborough/">I’ve sung her praises before</a>, and I’ll keep doing it.</p>
<p>And seriously, the dialogue and banter in this game can be hilarious, with Cloud’s stoicism often challenged by Aerith’s teasing, and Barret’s over-enthusiastic pleas to save the planet batted down by Cloud’s own bluntness. It knows when to balance the levity with serious moments, and that's something I think most video games struggle with.</p>
<figure><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161499/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>For those who haven’t touched Final Fantasy VII before and are worried, don’t fret – even with some of the additions, the Switch 2 port is still an amazing way to experience (part of) one of the most influential games of all time. The story beats are all the same, and the tone and outright weirdness of the original are also all intact, perhaps even better than ever. The new Honeybee Inn sequence alone is worth the price of admission.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> is still the best port on the system due to its sheer size and scope, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is close behind for its visual detail, incredible lighting, and largely consistent frame rate.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Even in its attempts to swing big and do something different, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade respects where it’s come from. The classic's pro-revolutionary heart is still intact, and it’s never afraid to get a little weird and funny. The Switch 2 version makes impressively few compromises to get this gorgeous-looking game running on the system – even at 30fps, this looks and feels fantastic.</p>
<p>The fact that everything from the PS5 release is preserved in such excellent fashion here is remarkable, and it makes me excited (and anxious) about Rebirth’s incoming port.</p></section>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> Gameplay - Nintendo Switch</h2><p dir="ltr">Once I was into the game itself, I was very impressed with the level of detail that the Switch 2 was able to pump out. From the opening sweeping shots of Midgar, to the close-up facial detail on Aerith and Cloud playing in Handheld mode, I was honestly a bit shocked at just how great this game looked, knowing I was playing it on mobile hardware.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/undefined" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Moving from the Mako Reactor and its neon lights to the soft city streets and the full light of the Sector 7 slums, the game looked and played incredibly well. While there were obvious downgrades in the graphical quality to accommodate the Switch 2, it's a fantastic way to experience the game for the first time, or return, letting you play while enjoying a second screen experience.</p><p dir="ltr">The one aspect of the game that was noticeably downgraded was that of characters' hair and certain particle effects. For a character so well known for his hairstyle, it's a shame to have a Cloud whose face is so clear and expressive have a grainy mop on top of it.</p><p dir="ltr">This is the same for all hair in the game, which becomes very apparent when completing the side quest where it's your goal to round up cats.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">In cutscenes, the lower quality hair is very apparent, but when in gameplay, it's easier to ignore.</p><p dir="ltr">Within gameplay, I found little to no stutters or hitching of the frame rate. Whirling around the screen as Cloud, particle effects from various spells and Barrett's gunfire, and enemy explosions didn't tank the framerate in any noticeable way.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the cutscenes. There would be a variety of times when hitching would appear not when looking at something impressive, but instead a few moments beforehand. I suspect this is to do with something loading off screen, and then the camera turning towards it.</p><p dir="ltr">The first example of this I ran into was when deboarding the train in the initial cutscene, as it swings from Jesse and AVALANCHE to Barrett and Cloud jumping off the train, there's noticeable stutter.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-vii-remake-switch-2-exploration.jpg?itok=x8C8hyZu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">While it isn't present in every cutscene, I do have to at least appreciate that if the game is going to hitch while in cutscenes, at least it does it before the cool thing instead of directly during it?</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> Cheats For Efficient Replays</h2><p dir="ltr">One fantastic upgrade to <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> with this new release, and one that will be coming to all versions of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> is a number of toggleable settings that the game calls "Streamlined Progression."</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">These options essentially act like cheats, similar to the ones that you can find on the remakes of the classic <em>Final Fantasy</em> titles, and let you constantly have Max HP or MP, always deal Max Damage, increase your experience gain by double, and even have Max Gil and Recovery Items.</p><p dir="ltr">While I wouldn't recommend these options for a first playthrough, knowing that Remake and Rebirth are two 40+ hour games that are getting a finale to their trilogy sometime in the future, it's nice that you can replay the story with a bit more efficiency. As this was my third time playing through the game, I happily enabled the 2x EXP &amp; 3x AP Gain and had a very leisurely jaunt through the game.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Should You Pick Up <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> <em>Intergrade </em>For Switch 2?</h2><p dir="ltr">Six years after the release of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake,</em> I think it's definitely worth picking up <em>FFVII Remake Intergrade</em> for the Switch 2… if you haven't played it/had access to it before, or you want to be able to play it specifically in handheld.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-vii-remake-switch-2-explosion.jpg?itok=yvhUUo9x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">The gameplay and story are still of fine quality, and while the graphics do take a notable hit, it's to be expected with the console you're playing it on. Even with the downgrade, it's one of the prettiest looking games available on the Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Knowing that it's already been out, and can likely be picked up at a massive discount on PS4/PS5 and PC, it is likely not going to be worth the full price of entry, especially with the downgrades to the visuals.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake</strong> was previewed with a code provided by the publisher over the course of 8 hours - All images were taken by the previewer.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new leak has revealed how the Fortnite x Fall Guys collaboration will play out, and it will introduce a new game mode called Crown Jam. </p>



<p>Fall Guys had announced that they would be returning to Fortnite with a new collaboration, with something to do with a “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fall-guys-and-fortnite-tease-new-collaboration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ball</a>” this time around. It was later leaked that ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-pimlico-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pimlico</a>‘ was a working title for Crown Jam, the Fall Guys-themed game mode. Now, a leaked video has confirmed these details, with the new mode arriving on January 23, 2026. </p>







<p>The Fortnite x Fall Guys Crown Jam mode leak comes from Loolo_WRLD on <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/2013913593419378859" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), who has seemingly got their hands on an IGN video describing the new game mode. The video explains that this is a 3v3 limited-time mode that blends basketball, football, and obstacle-course chaos, where the goal is to dunk the ball into the opposing team’s hoop. </p>



<p>The game mode will also introduce new physics for the Fall Guys game mode, allowing players to feel “every jump, tackle, and slam dunk”. There’s also a new mechanic called ‘Hype’, which can be increased by playing to unlock new abilities. The abilities include Big Bean, where the character becomes bigger, Bounce Pad, which allows them to jump higher, and Confetti Crash, which you can use to attack enemies. Players will be randomly assigned to one of 6 teams. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Fortnite x Fall Guys Crown Jam mode will release on January 23 and will only be available until February 9. </p>

There is a rumour that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-rumored-to-be-working-on-a-minecraft-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minecraft collaboration</a> is in the works.

            <p>Nintendo has announced a free update for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a> on Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>This update adds iconic Kong clan member Dixie to both single-player and two-player local co-op. Dixie can give DK a boost when jumping, while her ponytail acts as a sort of propeller for "reaching new heights". I mean, I can't even get my ponytail to stay in place for an entire day, and most of what I do is sit at my desk, but I promise I am not jealous…</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>As well as the addition of Dixie Kong, this update also adds Turbo Attack, which means players can race through "high-speed versions of each level" with the aim to get to the end before the time limit runs out. From the teaser video for this update, which you can check out further below, it looks like you will need some good reflexes to make all the jumps and what not in good time.</p>
<p>While the above additions are for both Donkey Kong Country Returns HD on Switch and Switch 2, there are also some improvements specifically for Nintendo's newer console. These include enhanced resolution, higher-definition graphics, and quicker load times.</p>
<p>So yes, we are getting the Switch 2 update to a Switch 1 game, which was a port of a 3DS game, that was a port of a Nintendo Wii game. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country-returns">Donkey Kong Country Returns</a>, and returns, and returns, and returns again. Now, try parsing all that after a few drinks.</p>
<p>Nintendo has added GameShare support to Donkey Kong Country Returns HD, as well. Now, as promised, you can check out the Donkey Kong Country Returns HD Update Overview trailer below:</p>

<p>Not played Donkey Kong Country Returns HD on Switch (or Switch 2) yet, and wondering if you should give it a go? Here is what Katharine Castle had to say about the release on its debut last year: "A straightforward remaster that struggles to outshine the Switch port of Tropical Freeze, but Returns HD is still a challenging and satisfying platformer that stands the test of time."</p>
<p>Katharine awarded it three stars in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-review-a-formidable-platformer-that-still-holds-up-today">Eurogamer's Donkey Kong Country Returns HD review</a>.</p>

<p>Arknights: Endfield has plenty for players to sink their teeth into, and a bunch of codes are available to redeem for handy bonuses to help your progression.</p>



<p>With so much to explore, it always helps to get everything you possibly can in your possession, and Insider Gaming has all the active codes to redeem in Arknights: Endfield.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-active-arknights-enfield-codes">All Active Arknights: Enfield Codes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Goodies. Image via Hyppergryph</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are several codes available to redeem in Arknights: Enfield, providing a boost of rewards, including various forms of currency.</strong></p>



<p>The majority are available for players across all platforms, though there is one additional PC-exclusive code. While some of the codes appear to be available permanently, others are limited-time and must be redeemed before the expiration date.</p>



<p>Once redeemed, all rewards must be claimed from the in-game mailbox within 30 days, or they will disappear, so it’s a good habit to claim the rewards immediately after redemption.</p>



<p>The table below shows all the active codes in Arknights: Enfield and the rewards earned for redemption.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-arknights-endfield-codes">How to Redeem Arknights: Endfield Codes</h2>



<p><strong>Code redemption in Arknights: Endfield is completed through a specific menu in the game, though it won’t be unlocked immediately.</strong></p>



<p>Early progression must be ticked off before the feature to redeem codes is made available, and more playtime is required to unlock the Mail feature, where bonuses can be claimed.</p>



<p>Here’s the step-by-step process to redeem codes in Arknights: Endfield.</p>



<ol>
<li>Play through the main story in Arknights Endfield until you complete the Valley Reboot mission.</li>



<li>In the menu, select the settings cog in the top-left of the screen.</li>



<li>Select the ‘Platform &amp; Account’ section.</li>



<li>Choose the ‘Exchange Code’ option.</li>



<li>Input the desired code.</li>



<li>Claim the rewards from your mailbox.</li>
</ol>



<p>If you’re yet to unlock the Mail feature, don’t worry, as any redeemed rewards will be waiting for you when you reach that stage in progression.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Yesterday, Life is Strange: Reunion was unveiled in full, with Deck Nine and Square Enix revealing the next game in the decade-old franchise. It follows directly on from 2024’s Life is Strange: Double Exposure, and for the first time since 2017, it brings back Chloe Price, the other half of the ‘Pricefield’ ship.</p>



<p>She’ll join Max Caulfield in a race against time to once again save the world (or at least their little bit of it) from certain cataclysmic catastrophes. However, following the reveal, much of the Life is Strange community has shared a wave of disappointment about Ashly Burch, the original voice actor for Chloe Price, <strong>not </strong>reprising her role.</p>







<h2 id="h-chloe-price-will-not-be-played-by-ashly-burch">Chloe Price Will Not Be Played by Ashly Burch</h2>



<p>Ashly Burch brought Chloe Price to life in the original Life is Strange title, released in 2015. However, she was unable to reprise that role in 2017’s Life is Strange: Before the Storm, a prequel, because of an embroilment in a voice actor’s strike at the time. This meant that Rhianna DeVries stepped in and fulfilled the role, doing a fairly decent job overall.</p>



<p>Yesterday, when Deck Nine unveiled Life is Strange: Reunion, it went with the announcement that DeVries would be returning alongside Hannah Telle (Max Caulfield) to play Chloe Price.</p>



<p>Fans took to social media to stress their concerns about this decision, with many suggesting that it’s not a ‘true reunion’ if the original voice actor isn’t involved.</p>







<p>One distressed user wrote, ‘My expectations could not be lower for Life is Strange: Reunion. It’s hard to be excited after the last game, and now we know it’s not even Ashly Burch as Chloe… Like what the f*** are you guys doing?’</p>



<p>Another offered a lengthy explanation to cover the community’s dismay:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Life is strange bringing back Chloe due to fan backlash but still not giving enough of a s*** to fork up enough cash to hire her original voice actor whenever <strong>Ashly</strong> <strong>Burch</strong>’s performance was half the reason anyone even liked that character in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In an attempt to dig deeper, one user raised a fair point:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Something definitely off with this game when Deck Nine brought back Rhianna DeVries for Chloe instead of <strong>Ashly</strong> <strong>Burch</strong> while there’s no SAG-AFTRA strike currently happening like during Before the Storm’s development.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For the diehard fans of Life is Strange, Reunion will be more or less a guaranteed purchase, even if it’s a reluctant one. The wrapping of Max and Chloe’s story is too much of a dramatic pull to be ignored, and it’s a sequence that’s almost a decade in the making (and wanting).</p>







<p>Will you still be buying Life is Strange: Reunion this March, even though Ashly Burch isn’t in it? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Named <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/11590?tab=description">Witcher Online</a> and spotted by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/witcher-3-online-multiplayer-mod/">Polygon</a>, the mod's the work of a user going by Rejuvenate7. As they demonstrate in the trailer above, their creation's mainly focused on simply letting you hang out in The Witcher 3's gorgeous world with your mates on a custom server, with emotes providing basic ways to interact with each other. The premise is similar to mods like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-skyrim-together-co-op-mod-is-out-now-bringing-multiplayer-to-elder-scrolls-v">Skyrim Together</a>, though Witcher Online seems less advanced than that mammoth project at this stage. By the looks of it, gangs of up to five characters are supported.</p>
<p>You can wander the streets of Novigrad or Toussaint, go riding or swimming together, get a fresh trim, or just find somewhere with a nice view to sit and chat. Witcher Online's also compatible with another mod, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/6402">Chill Out</a>, which looks to be responsible for some of the emotes and facilitates hanging out in taverns. By default, everyone plays as their own Geralt, but grabbing the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/5940">Custom Player Characters</a> mod allows you to swap his model out for the likes of Yennefer or Lambert.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://rejuvenate.gitbook.io/witcheronline/general-information/playguide">technically do missions and contracts together</a>, as shown in the video above, but this comes with the caveat that "other players cannot help you fight monsters, solve puzzles, or complete objectives". So, you'll be playing together simply by trying to work through each story beat in your character's version of the game world simultaneously, for example trying to sync up when you all step into a certain cutscene and which choices you make. Rejuvenate7 wrote that they've gone this route to prevent risk of folks' saves corrupting or softlocking, which very much makes it a worthy sacrifice in my eyes.</p><p>To get started with Witcher Online, you'll need a non-pirated copy of The Witcher 3 from either Steam or GOG, updated to its latest version, 4.04. If you're unsure which version you're running, verifying you game files should push you up to that latest one. You also look to need the Blood and Wine and Hearts of Stone DLCs, plus the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/2110">Community Patch - Shared Imports</a> mod. Beyond that, there's a setup guide <a href="https://rejuvenate.gitbook.io/witcheronline/guides/getting-started">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now, all I need to do is find someone willing to accompany me on a jog up towards Kaer Trolde, so we can chill on the bridge in a fashion which definitely won't see them nudged off the edge to see how big a splash that causes.</p>

            <p>EA and BioWare's failed action-RPG shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fond-anthem-farewells-begin-as-biowares-destiny-like-game-reaches-last-day-of-operation">Anthem was put down on 12th January</a>. No offline or P2P alternative for this one, at least officially. It was gone for good, with both the publisher and the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-was-abandoned-in-death-as-in-life-its-a-game-ea-and-bioware-would-rather-forget">seemingly eager to move on</a>. However, fans aren't ready to let go.</p>
<p>Even though plans for a community-led revival project were already underway a couple of months ago <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1pb8b3v/cenotaph_an_anthem_revival_project/">under the name Cenotaph</a>, it was the video posted on 17th January by user <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@andersson799">And799</a> on YouTube (hat tip to <a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-revival-private-servers-shutdown-bioware-fan-2000661358">Kotaku</a>) that ignited real hopes of getting the back online:</p> <figure>

<p>This person was quick to underline this is just a personal research experiment, and if you look at their YouTube channel, it's clear they enjoy the process of looking through files and systems, mostly of EA-published games. Still, you can see for yourself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/anthem">Anthem</a> doing mostly fine while running on private servers. Moreover, two players are shown in the same lobby. What doesn't work is the whole layer of the player's online profile and other stuff probably centralized on EA's now-missing servers.</p>
<p>Right after Anthem's death, ex-BioWare executive producer Mark Darrah pointed out during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxwrCRdqZb8">his massive video</a> on the game's inception, life, and death that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-local-servers-existed-at-bioware">code for local servers actually existed</a> and could be "salvaged and recovered." In fact, he suggested a $10m plan to reboot the game as a single-player-first experience if EA decided to part ways with the IP. That's a lot of wishful thinking, but it's definitely something the game's fans would celebrate. Looking at private experiments like And799's showing a lot of promise already, we're betting on fans figuring this one out eventually at the very least.</p><p>For now, other industry figures are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-weighs-complicated-riddle-of-multiplayer-game-preservation">chiming in on multiplayer game preservation</a> as more and more online-only games are shut down. Up next on the chopping block is Amazon's troubled MMORPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/new-world">New World</a>, which was recently delisted and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-world-shutting-down-unless-saved-by-rust">will shut down on 31st January next year</a>.</p>

            <guid>1411624</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This morning, <strong>Ryu Ga Gotoku</strong> <strong>Studio</strong> and <strong>SEGA</strong> have announced that a free <strong>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</strong> demo will be released later today on all platforms, albeit at different times. The PC version will get it first, at <strong>7 AM Pacific Time</strong>, while the console versions for Sony's PlayStation 5, Microsoft's Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2 will be available for download at <strong>9 PM Pacific Time</strong>.</p>



<p>Unlike other recent demos, users <strong>won't be able to carry over their save data to the full game</strong>, so it's really just a way to try the game before purchase. RGG Studio and SEGA have also outlined which sections have been prepared for the demo:</p>



<ul>
<li>In Yakuza Kiwami 3, players can explore <strong>Ryukyu</strong> in <strong>Okinawa</strong> as <strong>Kazuma Kiryu</strong>, beating down bad guys and dynamically switching between the brutal Dragon of Dojima: Kiwami style and the weapon-based Ryukyu style. Players can also indulge in immersive side experiences such as karaoke, sub-stories, and outfit customisation.</li>



<li>In Dark Ties, players can enjoy <strong>an all-new story featuring Yoshitaka Mine</strong> and explore <strong>Kamurocho</strong>, experiencing a variety of activities while also mastering Mine's shoot-boxing combat to stylishly dispose of foes.</li>
</ul>



<p>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties <a href="https://wccftech.com/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-0-directors-cut-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was announced at the <strong>RGG Summit 2025</strong></a> in September. According to the developers, this is <strong>an 'extreme' remake</strong> of the third mainline installment in the series, which originally launched in 2009 for PlayStation 3 and later appeared on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. </p>



<p>Additionally, there's new content in the form of Dark Ties, which is centered on Yoshitaka Mine. Narratively, <strong>it is a prequel</strong> in which Mine willingly plunges into the dark world of the Yakuza after losing everything.
