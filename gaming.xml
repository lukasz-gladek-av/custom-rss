This week, tales of hurt feelings and anger among some developers and fans of <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>emerged after it failed to take home Game of the Year honors at this year’s Game Awards. Additionally, the announcement that pricey <em>Killzone </em>skins were coming to&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2, </em>a game that already costs $40 to purchase,<em>&nbsp;</em>did not go over well with fans. Also, Day of the Devs gave us loads of great games to look forward to in its latest showcase, and we’ve got the rundown on those. All this and more in the pages ahead.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f924423a3dd756ead6076d48ada3fd08" data-recommend-id="image://f924423a3dd756ead6076d48ada3fd08" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Our monkey hero stands in the snow, facing his greatest nemesis: the Game Award." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Our monkey hero stands in the snow, facing his greatest nemesis: the Game Award." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Game Science / The Game Awards / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f924423a3dd756ead6076d48ada3fd08" data-recommend-id="image://f924423a3dd756ead6076d48ada3fd08" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Our monkey hero stands in the snow, facing his greatest nemesis: the Game Award." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Award ceremonies are very silly.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-of-the-year-2024-%E2%80%93-best-original-soundtrack.1067037/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/21/game-of-the-year-2024-best-original-soundtrack/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>As wild as it is to have quirky pixel art and claymation going up against photo realistic graphics in our best Visual Design award, it’s just as broad a spectrum of styles and genres when looking at soundtracks. From jazzy chip tunes to sweeping orchestral scores, there’s such variety in video game soundtracks these days that it’s almost impossible to choose.</p>
<p>And yet here we are, picking the soundtracks that stuck with us most through the year, whether it was ramping up the atmosphere, putting a little smile on our faces as we played, or even getting us to sing along while hurtling through a loading screen – can you guess what game that refers to?</p>

<p>There are are a remarkable 101 different tunes in the soundtrack of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">Astro Bot</a>, each one reflecting the style and tone of level you are playing. From disco to ragtime to 80’s hair rock you will never get bored from the upbeat bops that propel you forward just as much as the actual on screen action – just imagine what the soundtrack to a Muppets game would be like and you would be close.</p>
<p>Just like the in-game cameos, the music features nods toward Sony’s franchises, the Bot of War track is superb with with a perfectly timed “BOY!” dropped in the music, and the jazzed up glitchy remix of the Uncharted theme will bring back many happy memories. If you’ve managed to finish the game you can stop by the massive PS5 in the Crash Site where the various components of the console will serenade you, singing “Cooling Fan” and “GPU” in time with the theme.</p>

<p>The music was honoured at this years The Game Awards with a full orchestral version of the game’s theme, I Am Astro Bot, check it out:</p>
<p><iframe title="I Am Astro Bot - The Game Awards Orchestra 2024 (GOTY Remix)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8KfP5AzFLEI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>– Tuffcub</p>
<h2>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth – Runner Up</h2>
<p>You’d be hard pressed to name a more iconic soundtrack than Final Fantasy VII.&nbsp;Nobuo Uematsu’s score has gone down in games history as the defining soundtrack of a generation. Over the years since, it has graced theatres and halls as part of Distant Worlds, and been alluded to in everything right up to Metaphor ReFantazio (which sounds eerily like Uematsu at times).</p>
<p>This incredible score not only defined a generation, but set the bar for what we expect from this franchise. With that in mind, it’s safe to say that composers Mitsuto Suzuki and Masashi Hamauzu had a lot riding on their work, when it came to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/">FF7 Rebirth</a>. Not only did they have to remaster perfection, but they had to expand on it, filling in the blanks where the story branched out into new and untold areas.</p>
<p>One example of their brilliance is the boss fight against Jenova Emergent, which has all of the motifs you would expect from the score, while also being a fresh new track.&nbsp;And when you beat Jenova, you get the victory march — yes that one — again redone beautifully, and with lyrics this time.</p>
<p>But we can’t just focus on the big stuff that you’d expect — like the remastered Chocobo theme or Sephiroth’s One-Winged Angel. The rest of the game sounds incredible, from big brass band battles to synth pop, upbeat guitars.</p>
<p>Ultimately, however, you only have to look to the main theme for something that beautifully sums up how exquisite this soundtrack is.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Final Fantasy VII Rebirth OST - Boss Battle Theme (Jenova Emergent)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KLa3ICmfYvc?list=PL27wclc9Dr4lr_sY0MYiqBxJbr2-WUU5J" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This wistful, melancholy but hopeful score underlines everything you’ll feel playing this game. And talking of playing, you can even take to the in-game pianos in every city and try your hand at playing it yourself.</p>
<p><em>– Nic B</em></p>
<h2>Helldivers 2 – Runner Up</h2>
<p>Sometimes all you really need is one booming leitmotif to lodge itself into the collective consciousness of gamers. For a couple months earlier this year, it felt like almost everyone was joining in with the “Dun-dun-dun-duuuuuuuuuuuuuun, Duuun-duuuuuun” of the drop sequence in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/14/helldivers-2-review/">Helldivers 2</a>, the orchestral soundtrack perfectly capturing the bombastic patriotism and themes of the game as you hurtle towards overwhelming odds against bugs, bots, and now glowy-eyed alien zombies.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="A Cup of Liber-tea (Helldivers 2 Main Theme)" width="780" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ED3E4mXOpBQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/review/forever-skies-apocalyptic-adventure/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

						
			<p>Jumping into <a href="https://wccftech.com/forever-skies-full-release-delayed-to-2025-extending-early-access-period/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forever Skies</a>, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. From the title alone, I was expecting some sort of War game, but I was pleasantly surprised to find out it was a post-apocalyptic survival game that takes place on Earth. There were two significant periods in which I played the game. The first was during the initial Early Access period, and the second was after the<a href="https://wccftech.com/forever-skies-co-op-launch-available-today-huge-overhaul-added-in-new-update/"> co-op update</a> was released. During these times, the changes made were incredibly obvious, and for the most part, they made the experience a lot smoother and more user-friendly. Games like this can often be quite overwhelming, as you're being introduced to a lot of new features, which usually include traveling through space or something of the sort.</p>
<p>However, I found that Forever Skies is a very peaceful game, regardless of difficulty. It eases you into the game as you need and tells you how and where to find everything. While some may find this a bit "hand-holdy," it's perfect for being introduced to all of the necessary features of the game.</p>
<p>Pressing play, I was a little bit disappointed with the intro cutscene. Both times I watched it, before and after the update, it was severely broken. The cutscene froze often, was very laggy and the subtitles were in no way synced up with the audio, which isn't helpful for those who do need subtitles. While I managed to get the gist of what was happening in the cutscene, it doesn't give a great first impression of what's to come in Forever Skies. I was immediately a bit on edge and wasn't sure what to expect, especially if the cutscene was in such a state.</p>
<p>What came after the cutscene made up for it significantly. The game was easy to dive into, and immediately, I found myself loving every second of it. Comparing it to games like No Man's Sky, Forever Skies isn't nearly as overwhelming. The only thing I would wish for with this game is that it gets Steam Deck support, as this is the perfect game to play on the go or while you're lounging.</p>
<p>The world that you are put into is desolate, and it's very obvious that there is a strong feeling of loneliness and danger. The atmosphere is quite heavy, and I loved that about the game. You could sense the feeling of desperation, especially when fighting to create food and water for survival without risking your health further. I loved the crafting system and the ability to take materials from floating objects through the sky, turning them into Synthetics and Metals for you to use in crafting. I was a little bit surprised at how small my airship was to begin with, especially when it came to putting the engine on the ship. It felt like there wasn't really enough space to do so, and it left me a little bit concerned about how using the ship would pan out.</p>
<p>Admittedly, once you get a bit further into the game, encountering the horrifying creatures that are now inhabiting Earth is absolutely terrifying and does rip you out of the safe and sound mindset that you've been carrying prior to that event.</p>
<p>From the outset, you're thrown into the deep end of exploration and scavenging for resources. Luckily, it's all explained to you, and it's very easy to get started on hoarding materials like your life depends on it (because it does). You then have to craft a research station and a crafting machine, which will allow you to get access to clean water and edible food. My only gripe with the process of doing this is that when crafting items, it's on a timer. For example, if I were to craft a membrane for the water purifier, that would take 30 seconds, while other items could take up to and over a minute to create. If this was in the late game, it wouldn't be as much of a problem. However, getting started, you essentially have to stand around and wait for it to be done, as there are no other quests for you to complete.</p>

<p>Because I played it before the update initially, it meant that by the time I got around to playing it again, my save wasn't compatible with the latest version of the game. While this is an issue that probably didn't affect many people, it was a bit frustrating to have to go through it all again. However, it was interesting to see the changes that the developers made to the game, especially in the intro scenes. It felt like the tutorial area was easy and quicker to get through compared to the previous version.</p>
<p>Overall, I had a great time with Forever Skies, and I can't wait to sink more time into this game. It is very well padded out and has a lot of love poured into it. This game is the perfect game to dive into after a long day and can prove to be quite relaxing. Admittedly, I have not played it in co-op, and I'm happy to continue to play this game solo, but the option is now there for those interested. The only real issue is the laggy cutscene at the beginning and the flying being terribly slow to start with. Of course, this is something that you can upgrade later on in the game, but it makes short distances feel like endless corridors.</p>
<p>Despite that, I love&nbsp;<span>Forever Skies's echo chamber feeling, as well as the loneliness and desolation that come with it. Even though it's post-apocalyptic, I found myself soothed by the gameplay. I hope that one day I get to see this game become&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1641960/Forever_Skies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam Deck verified</a>, as it would be the perfect game to play on a</span> portable device.</p>

				<p>Forever Skies has a great, relaxing core gameplay loop. The atmospheres are vibrant, but still provide the feeling of desolation and complete loneliness. It's very easy to dive into, once you get past the laggy and broken cutscene at the beginning of the game. Overall, Forever Skies is a great experience, and significantly less overwhelming than other games in this genre. </p>

OhSnap, the company behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24262221/this-40-magnetic-phone-grip-does-what-popsockets-cant-and-its-on-sale">the excellent magnetic PopSocket alternatives I showed you in October</a>, is now officially turning his design into the coolest looking gamepad attachment I’ve ever seen for a phone: </p></div><p>It’s no taller or wider than an iPhone, so it should slide into a pocket. It’s got a MagSafe pattern of magnets to attach it to your magnetic ring device. You don’t have to remove it to use your phone like a phone, because the whole gamepad retracts underneath<em>,</em> a little like the slide-out keyboard phones (or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452167/sony-xperia-play-2-playstation-phone-prototype-concept-leaked-images">PlayStation Phones</a>) of old — and now, it’s mounted on a spring-loaded arm that pops out at the push of a button and also slightly angles your device towards your face.</p><div><figcaption><em>The OhSnap Mcon’s hinge in action.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Video by Josh King / OhSnap</cite></p></div><p>OhSnap even found room for a pair of Nintendo Switch-esque analog sticks, with drift-resistant Hall effect sensors, and pair of fold-out grips so you can (theoretically) hold it more like a full-size gamepad. The sticks are clickable buttons, and it’s got a full set of shoulder buttons and triggers as well.</p><div><figcaption><em>An illustration with the grips unfolded.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: OhSnap</cite></p></div><p>Two months ago, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike">Retro Game Corps</a> came away <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3969hkkFSE">impressed with a prototype</a>, and it seems King has been <em>very</em> busy since then. As he explains <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIgugX2gODE">on YouTube</a>, he initially tried to start his own company around the gamepad, even attracted a few investors, manufactured some boards and was working toward injection molding, before he started running out of money and reached out to OhSnap about a partnership.  </p><p>Speaking of money, we don’t have any idea how much it’ll cost, particularly at retail — OhSnap is planning to launch a Kickstarter on January 2nd to raise funds. <a href="https://ohsnap.com/pages/mcon-signup-page">It’s taking signups here for now</a>.</p><p>I should be getting my own hands on a prototype next month at CES 2025 in Las Vegas, and I’ll let you know how it feels. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

(not pictured: Ira Crosby) <a href="https://t.co/snfI2KiM27" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/snfI2KiM27</a></p>— Erik Wolpaw (@Wolpaw) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wolpaw/status/1870213443221106918?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 20, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"Did you know the construction of the Leaning Tower of Pisa was one hundred and ninety nine years late?

A perhaps more extreme example of something taking a long time to complete than this comic, but an apt analogy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For fans of Team Fortress 2, you'll find the gang all here including a newly married Soldier and even a maskless Spy. The issue also has a dedication to Rick May, the voice of Soldier who died in 2020 at the age of 79. The story itself concludes a long, winding journey that TF2 fans have been waiting a long time to see updated, so I won't spoil the rest of the comic here. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The comics have served as an invaluable tome to find out more about the different TF2 characters, especially background characters like Miss Pauling and The Administrator. The comics are very much worth a full read if you haven't checked them out already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve is continuing the trend of emerging from what seems like some kind of gaming hibernation, first with the release of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck</a> and the testing of its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deadlock-valve-steam-announcement-page">new hero shooter, Deadlock</a>. This new comic issue serves that Valve creatives are still tinkering in the background, working on new stories for our favorite games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.

And for games media, it sure… was. <a href="https://aftermath.site/ziff-davis-ign-gamesindustrybiz-humble-buyouts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Layoffs</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-eic-resigns-over-new-editorial-edict" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shakeups</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-closed-layoffs-eulogy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closures</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/ign-gamer-network-eurogamer-gamesindustrybiz-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ill-advised purchases</a>, and <a href="https://aftermath.site/waypoint-vice-remap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mystifying revivals</a> were in plentiful supply, but there were also a few bright spots. I’m serious! On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we salvage a few diamonds from a whole mess of rough.</p><p>As we’ll be celebrating with our families next week, this one’s technically our last show of the year. We discuss a little of everything: Our favorite <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-awards-tga/495677/game-awards-2024-biggest-announcements-trailers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Awards reveals</a> (<em>Onimusha</em>, an <a href="https://aftermath.site/games-used-to-have-more-orbs-what-happened-soul-orb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">orb game exemplar</a>, is back, and so is <em>Okami</em>!) as well as some that have us less thrilled (more Neil Druckmann nihilism in <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em>, <em>Borderlands 4</em>’s continuation of the series’ quiet identity crisis). Then we talk about <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike-the-game-awards-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SAG-AFTRA voice actors demonstrating outside the show</a> and the potential impacts of a second Trump presidency on their future prospects.</p><p>After that, we briefly touch on cameras in games, which absolutely nobody <a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-camera" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has Opinions about</a>, and then Chris fills us in on the love of his life: <em>Slitterhead</em>. Lastly, we hand out our own awards for the best and worst games media moments of the year. Oh, and we discuss Riley’s holiday gaming dilemmas, all of which would be solved if he just bought a Steam Deck.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can create a future in which the worst games media moment of the year is, like, “So-and-so published a kind of silly piece” and not “Everything’s on fire, and the fire got exponentially bigger while we were handing it its award.”</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I want to start with the best games media moment, and a moment that demonstrated the continued usefulness of the media even in its diminished state: Dr Disrespect. We had that <a href="https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-allegations-twitch-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outing</a> from a former Twitch employee of what he probably did [to get banned from Twitch in 2020], and then both Ash Parrish and Cecilia D’Anastasio <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-dr-disrespect-allegations-journalists" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaped into action and managed to verify it</a>. That’s what took it from being this bit of hearsay to a story that had actual ramifications that brought down what was at the time the Dr Disrespect empire.&nbsp;</p><p>He unfortunately <a href="https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-rumble-conor-mcgregor-hitman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bounced back with a Rumble deal</a>, but we kinda all saw that coming. I even <a href="https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-minor-whisper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote a piece</a> about how that was probably gonna happen. But his credibility in the eyes of any sort of mainstream establishment was obliterated – and justifiably so. He had inappropriate interactions with a minor. You should not be able to come back from that – at least not in any way where you get accepted by major brands and platforms.</p><p>It was impressive reporting, and it was good to see both of those reporters get their dues in some ways – though I’m sure people also came after them and were shitty because that’s the nature of being a reporter in the year 2024. But they did the thing. They made it happen.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I’ve got a good one. Was <a href="https://aftermath.site/ign-creators-guild-union-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the IGN union</a> this year?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yes it was.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, that’s a good one.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>The IGN union has been really cool, with the caveat that clearly management has been combative in certain ways. They did those <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ign-management-lays-off-three-union-members-in-massive-breach-of-trust-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weird layoffs of a few union members</a>.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I was just explaining last night to a friend who isn’t in journalism the whole IGN <a href="https://aftermath.site/ign-gamer-network-eurogamer-gamesindustrybiz-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">buying Gamer Network</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/ziff-davis-ign-gamesindustrybiz-humble-buyouts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs and buyouts situation</a>, and they were like “What? How is that allowed that one company can own all the websites?” And I was like “Well, you see…” And as we’ve discussed a million times on this podcast, a union can’t do everything, but some folks are lucky to have that.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>And I will say, if you look at those buyouts [that management is offering to staff], the terms are pretty healthy. People are getting between four and six months of severance, as well as COBRA [insurance] coverage. It’s understandable why a lot of people are taking that buyout, and I would imagine the union – even just its existence, if nothing else – played a role in obtaining that buyout package. It’s not ideal, but it is something.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> We’ve done a lot of writing this year about the crappy <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-gamurs-group-games-journalism-escapist-dot-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">labor</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/freelance-video-game-journalism-rates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conditions</a> at various websites, and those things might still exist even if those websites had unions, but unions can definitely fight them. As we go into 2025 – and as we were just talking about, who knows what the state of organized labor will be under Trump – but it’s definitely something.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> OK so, now it’s time for the bad moments. There are plenty to choose from! I think I’m gonna say it’s a tie between <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-closed-layoffs-eulogy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Informer getting shut down</a> and kind of <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-eic-resigns-over-new-editorial-edict" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everything that’s happened to Kotaku</a>, but especially when [editor-in-chief Jen Glennon] resigned over the editorial edict to produce exponentially more guides. I think that was kind of the flashpoint for pretty much everything that was to come.</p><p>With Game Informer, the immediate tragedy was obvious, and it had ripple effects in that, as I understand it, the Game Informer Vault – which contained a lot of material video game history – ended up becoming the plaything of one of these fucking GameStop execs.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I wrote <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-gamestop-stores" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a blog about that</a>.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>He has a bunch of their stuff in his office and whatnot, which is awful. What a waste. And of course, tons of people out of work very suddenly. Another publication bites the dust – one that was relatively well funded. They did some work that verged on being in the realm of advertorial, but nonetheless, they also did some really good work, some really interesting stuff. Game Informer was foundational for me; I read it all the time growing up. I have crystal clear memories of where I was when I was reading particular issues. It’s that much of a thing. So its demise was super tragic.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>The revival of former Vice properties is not great, but also it’s just kind of a bummer more than actively [bad for the world]. It’s embarrassing. Twenty percent of me was like “I get getting that paycheck, but that’s really <a href="https://aftermath.site/vice-waypoint-site-news-reopen-open" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bad writing</a>.” Who is this for? Why are you doing this? What are you getting out of this? You’re just doing SEO manipulation at this point.&nbsp;</p><p>I kinda understand what would make someone think they could salvage an unsalvageable website, because it is such a brand that you were aware of. It’s not as bad as the Kotaku thing, because the Kotaku thing a) is personal, and b) is actively harming people now. Whereas I’ve heard the Remap folks talk about [Waypoint’s revival], and they’re kind of whatever about it. They got a good deal. They got to keep the feed. They got out.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s comical, more than anything. I’ve been looking at Shane Smith’s presence, because [Vice] brought him back. Again, who is that for? It’s like a more Gen X-y Bill Maher but with less of the appeal. The YouTube channel Vice had – which hundreds of people built; they sent people all over the world – is now just “Hot Ones” without [Sean Evans].&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> They’re still making videos! I just watched one about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHCPMDLzIA4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Axie Infinity</em></a>. I was curious about what crypto games were doing about Trump being into crypto, and I found a Reddit post of the <em>Axie Infinity</em> people being really excited that search interest in<em> Axie Infinity</em> had spiked. I was trying to figure out why, and they had traced it back to a Vice YouTube from last month or something, and I was like “Vice still has a YouTube channel?”</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, they do, and you should tune in if you’d like to see Shane Smith interview [noxious streaming personality] Destiny.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sandisk-logo-rebrand"><h3>Congratulations To Sandisk On A Rebranding That Rules</h3></a><p>More brands should look like they sell Laserdisc players</p></div><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/silo-apple-tv-architecture-politics-world"><h3>I Want To Live In The Silo</h3></a><p>You can plot the entire course of a human life in this universe</p></div><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-immersive-machinegames"><h3>A Wheezy Indiana Jones Is Incredibly Relatable</h3></a><p>'Always knew someday you’d come unlocking, opening then walking back through my door'</p></div></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

These are more than just festive trinkets, though, as the added clutter has been used to carefully hide presents that, once acquired, unlock some of those new maps. Completing additional Santa Claus quests can unlock even more goodies, with daily quests also gifting players with rewards should they continue to log in between now and December 26. There's also a limited Christmas Banner, which contains six new units to collect.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/anime-defenders-1734476101342.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Anime Defenders Christmas Update is available now.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to every new holiday item added as part of the Anime Defenders Christmas Update, players can take advantage of a new trading currency: Emerald.

But like I've said before, the year also had its lows where even established franchises like Dune, Like a Dragon, Mario and plenty of others had a hard time sticking the landing between their multiple releases this year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And like the content we consume, we as humans are also subject to ups and downs throughout the year, and we know everyone has their good and bad days. But it's time to recognize the most outstanding members of our community -- the users that more often than not exemplify the best parts of our community. We enjoy celebrating them for all they do to create a positive atmosphere here at IGN. From users who comment daily to those who visit sparingly, we are grateful for your passion for and dedication to having spirited conversations with your fellow community members.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">They say good things come in threes, so to celebrate our third year of fostering a positive and inclusive environment for all members we're once again paying tribute to our top users based on their accounts and how they interact with others in the community. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/04/08/commentsoftheweek-blogroll-01-1649456618377.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year we celebrated and rewarded 11 upstanding members of our community, with of a portion of them maintaining a perfect comment record.

The closest category you voted on was the Best Game of 2024, which was decided by less than 1500 votes, cementing Black Myth: Wukong as the IGN audience's favorite over Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth, which are tied for second. And while Game of the Year was the most-voted category this year, the Best TV Show category was just behind it in total votes and, despite the resentment we often hear around recent Marvel projects, it was Agatha All Along that took the win with 27.5% of the votes, beating out popular shows like Shogun, Fallout, and The Penguin. Again, thank you to everyone who joined in on the fun; we look forward to seeing how 2025 turns out. </p><h2 data-cy="title1">Keepin' It Clean</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout the year, we have also been monitoring those on the opposite end of the spectrum who do not foster a positive experience. We remove the most problematic users regularly to improve everyone's overall experience. But we also use this time before the end of the year as an opportunity to remove those who were given more time to see if their infractions throughout the year created a pattern or were potentially just someone having a bad day or week. So, in addition to recognizing the users who uplifted our community, we have also removed several users who have consistently violated our community guidelines. These banned accounts are those who have engaged in hate speech, harassment, or other toxic behaviors. We know these actions are not always popular, but they are necessary in our commitment to creating a safe and welcoming space for everyone at IGN. With that being said we will be updating the ToS in 2025, so be sure to check them out once those go live in early January. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we continue to build upon our community, we will continue to monitor and address any problematic behavior to ensure that our community remains a positive and inclusive place for everyone. We can create a respectful, supportive, and enjoyable community by working together. Keep an eye out in 2025 as we have even more plans for the community to ensure we are fostering a welcoming space for everyone and hopefully a few surprises.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We appreciate our readers who regularly make us their home for gaming, entertainment, and more. We are excited to continue building and improving together in the coming months and years.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-review-shadow-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-1851726797<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>, the live-action adaptation of Sega’s speedy platformer is entering a new era. With each subsequent movie, the <em>Sonic </em>films have sought to shed the generic “family” movie image for one that was more honest to the anime-inspired twists and turns of the long-running platformer series. And this latest film succeeds. <em>Sonic 3 </em>is a loose adaptation of one of the most beloved stories in all of the series’ 30 years. While the film does tweak some things along the way, it doesn’t shy away from the otherworldly, supercharged melodrama that differentiated <em>Sonic </em>from its contemporaries in the early 2000s. <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>still falls into the occasional trap of talking down to the all-ages audience with low-hanging jokes and some frankly groan-worthy segments, but more than ever, the third film earns the right to delve into the video game excess that made these characters so beloved in the first place.</p><p>While there are a few lapses in judgment, <em>Sonic 3</em>’s greatest strength is that it prioritizes its nonhuman characters, rather than sidelining them in service of the less-interesting humans. After the colossal letdown of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/knuckles-review-paramount-plus-episodes-season-one-1851423404&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/knuckles-review-paramount-plus-episodes-season-one-1851423404"><em>Knuckles </em>series’ human-centric story</a></span>, I was relieved to see <em>Sonic 3</em> not only focus on the anthropomorphic aliens, but also give them some of their best material yet. Keanu Reeves’ Shadow is the heart of the film. Though his backstory differs slightly from the games, the same throughlines of grief and vengeance flows through him. Reeves’ performance in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-keanu-reeves-dlc-tokyo-stage-1851720674&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-keanu-reeves-dlc-tokyo-stage-1851720674"><em>Shadow Generations </em>tie-in DLC</a></span> was rough, but his soulful delivery in the film carries the heavy weight Shadow bears in the darkest stories the movies have told.</p><p>Though the specifics are slightly different, <em>Sonic 3</em> draws heavily from the dueling character perspective of the game it draws most from, <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>. The movie takes most of that game’s key components, effectively delineating the movie into two tones depending on which speedy hedgehog is at the center of any given scene. The moments when Shadow is the focus are as contemplative and evocative as the ones in his debut in the Dreamcast game two decades ago. Sonic’s scenes, meanwhile, are cheerful and optimistic, with the angst of Shadow’s darker story bleeding through as the movie attempts to examine both characters’ reactions to loss.</p><figure id="" data-id="a0abe766b2c8392b1145f18c28821450" data-recommend-id="image://a0abe766b2c8392b1145f18c28821450" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles stand in a burning Tokyo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles stand in a burning Tokyo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a0abe766b2c8392b1145f18c28821450" data-recommend-id="image://a0abe766b2c8392b1145f18c28821450" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles stand in a burning Tokyo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The clear duality <em>Sonic 3 </em>draws between Sonic and Shadow is what makes the film a more intentional video game adaptation than the previous films. More than just bringing in familiar characters and lore, <em>Sonic 3</em> actively adapts the structure and symmetry of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em> to great effect. Though the movie sadly is missing a key player, as Rouge the Bat doesn’t appear in <em>Sonic 3</em> as some speculated, the asymmetry between Sonic and Shadow, even as they appear to be equal in strength and skill, is the clearest sign of a directorial intent that was too nebulous before. <em>Sonic 3 </em>sheds most of the cheesy distractions from previous films, like <em>Sonic 2</em>’s wedding subplot or the inane pop culture references that have plagued these movies. Instead, the film is clearly in pursuit of something that feels true to the source material and doesn’t always talk down to the kids in the room. Surprisingly enough, the movie is one of the most poignant explorations of Sonic and Shadow’s contrast, coming off years of Shadow being treated like a bit player. It respects its characters enough to not water down the darkest parts of who they are. Well, it does so for the protagonists, at least.</p><p>While I loved Sonic and Shadow’s rivalry, I didn’t expect to come out of <em>Sonic 3</em> soured on Jim Carrey’s performance as Doctor Ivo “Eggman” Robotnik. Carrey plays two roles in the film, reprising his role as the eccentric mad scientist, and Eggman’s grandfather, Gerald Robotnik. Gerald has had an important but mostly posthumous role throughout the <em>Sonic </em>series, and I was wary of Carrey’s portrayal of him in the trailers as the movie seemed to be taking a more humorous approach to a character notoriously known for some of the most <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtLsYuzCkZo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtLsYuzCkZo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spine-chilling moments</a></span> in the franchise. Gerald is alive and well(?) in <em>Sonic 3</em>, and it gives Carrey the opportunity to mostly riff with himself. While both characters have their moments, most of these films’ greatest sins are on display while the Robotniks are on screen. These moments are where you’ll find the needle drops, an unexpected dance break, and all the unfunny bits that come off like an adult writing for children they don’t believe could grasp something even slightly sophisticated. Almost all of that falls under Carrey’s screen time and feels like a waste of his talents and the mad scientists he plays.</p><figure id="" data-id="29c9fc9b3f352a74af8ebb948bac7eb3" data-recommend-id="image://29c9fc9b3f352a74af8ebb948bac7eb3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Robotniks look at something off-screen on a futuristic ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Robotniks look at something off-screen on a futuristic ship." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="29c9fc9b3f352a74af8ebb948bac7eb3" data-recommend-id="image://29c9fc9b3f352a74af8ebb948bac7eb3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Robotniks look at something off-screen on a futuristic ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Paramount’s overreliance on human characters has been one of the most glaring issues of the <em>Sonic </em>films. Capable actors playing Sonic’s human friends were often given the worst material in the script and it made even the shortest scenes feel excruciatingly long. <em>Sonic 3 </em>isn’t innocent of this, as <em>Jessica Jones </em>actor Krysten Ritter joins the cast as GUN agent Director Rockwell who mostly exists as a temporary obstacle for everyone before being quickly shuffled off the board. The <em>Knuckles </em>series might as well have not been named as such, as Idris Elba’s take on the beloved Echnida was barely in the show. For two movies, it felt like Carrey’s unhinged, show-stealing performance as Eggman was immune to this, but the movie does such an otherwise good job of keeping the focus on Sonic and Shadow that those distracting, low-effort propensities funneled into his performance instead of elsewhere.</p><p>The best human interactions in <em>Sonic 3 </em>are the ones that come back to its two leads, such as Alyla Browne’s role as Shadow’s best friend Maria, or Sonic’s father/son relationship with James Marsden’s small-town cop Tom. Lee Majdoub also gives an earnest performance reprising his role as Agent Stone dealing with his toxic relationship with the ol’ Egghead. But so much of the job of distracting children with zany antics falls at Carrey’s feet. It robs him of the wit and comedic timing that he had in the first two films. I’m sure he was having a blast on set, but he deserved better than what he had to work with.</p><figure id="" data-id="934e4a4630f146519f1c1d0690c0678e" data-recommend-id="image://934e4a4630f146519f1c1d0690c0678e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sonic and Shadow stare each other down." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sonic and Shadow stare each other down." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="934e4a4630f146519f1c1d0690c0678e" data-recommend-id="image://934e4a4630f146519f1c1d0690c0678e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sonic and Shadow stare each other down." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Some of that friction only happens because Gerald is alive in this version of the tale, and it’s not the only difference even the most casually engaged <em>Sonic</em> fan will notice. There are a few key changes from game to film that long-time fans will notice, but overall, <em>Sonic 3</em> goes out of its way to preserve the AMV-bait vibes of the series’ early-00s angst, and pulls it off with something that is constantly entertaining, mostly respectful of its characters and audience, and the truest to the spirit of the franchise. Watching Sonic and Shadow clash with an edge and style that feels even more electric than anything the first two movies even attempted is a blast, and its final battle is especially raw, emotionally cathartic, and well-earned after three good, gradually improving movies and a bad TV show.</p><p>I think “earned” is the word my mind keeps wandering to as I think back on <em>Sonic 3</em>. These movies have come so far from when Paramount first revealed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-movie-first-trailer-ugly-design-delay-redesign-1851446390&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-movie-first-trailer-ugly-design-delay-redesign-1851446390">the horrifying gremlin</a></span> that was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ugly-sonic-hedgehog-cameo-chip-dale-rescue-rangers-disn-1848955965&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ugly-sonic-hedgehog-cameo-chip-dale-rescue-rangers-disn-1848955965">Ugly Sonic</a></span> in the first trailer it has since tried to wipe from the internet. Each movie has gradually tried to introduce more of the weird, earnest shit that has kept Sonic and Shadow in the hearts of millions even as the series has hit snags that would have ended most other big franchises. If you’d told me 20 years ago that a live-action adaptation of <em>Sonic Adventure 2 </em>would one day hit the big screen I don’t think I would have believed you. If you’d told me it would be good, I would have believed you even less. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For example, Heavy has a sister and she eventually falls in love with Soldier! Anyway suddenly, nearly seven years after issue six, Valve has published the seventh installment in the main <em>TF2</em> comic series and finally revealed Spy’s face. </p><p><strong><em>And uh, yeah, minor spoilers below for issue seven. Take this as your last warning.</em></strong><em> </em></p><p>After 17 years of playing <em>Team Fortress 2</em>, it’s very odd to finally be looking at Spy without his mask on.

A lot of plot lines are tied up in this issue in a way that’s satisfying, if a bit rushed. </p><p>Still, I’m happy to see Valve finally tying up the <em>TF2</em> comic and its story. Will we get more <em>TF2 </em>comics in the future? Maybe, but as for the main overarching plot of the franchise (yes, it eventually developed one), it seems done. And that’s nice. Maybe now, with this wrapped, Valve can bring closure to&nbsp;another franchise and its plotlines, too. I’m talking about<em> Half-Life 3</em>. I want to play <em>Half-Life 3</em>.
