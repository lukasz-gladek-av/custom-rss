Not all of the seasonal content has arrived yet, but dataminers are already showing off new bundles planned for the in-game shop, including this upcoming weapon blueprint with a must-see weapon inspection.</p><p dir="ltr">As leaked by <a href="https://x.com/thund3rCOD/status/1928208792518267150" rel="nofollow ">Thund3r</a>, the "Combo Bash" Mastercraft weapon blueprint for Season 4's new FFAR1 assault rifle has a highly detailed weapon-inspection animation.

		<p>This is it. The last week without a Switch 2. I am actually incredibly hyped ‚Äì way more than I have been for the past couple of console launches ‚Äì and I think it‚Äôs because of one thing: Mario Kart World. We‚Äôve basically been playing the same Mario Kart game for 11 years. Yes‚Ä¶ 11! Don‚Äôt get me wrong, those have been some great years, and Mario Kart 8 has been tweaked, updated and added to across that time, so it‚Äôs not the same game. But‚Ä¶ it is the same game. Mario Kart World is a totally new take on Mario‚Äôs kart racing franchise, and I can‚Äôt wait to check it out.</p>
<p>The other nice thing is that there are fewer launch games for me to pick up here. I‚Äôm always an idiot and buy too many things at launch, and then none of them get played properly, but there‚Äôs a small batch that I‚Äôm interested in, having played other games elsewhere. I do wonder how that will play out for third parties, and whether they‚Äôll see the return they‚Äôre hoping for with legacy titles, but here‚Äôs hoping it doesn‚Äôt put them off from bringing more Switch 2 games to the table.</p>
<p>This week, I‚Äôve been playing a few things, going from Doom: The Dark Ages to a bunch of different sized wheels in Warhammer 40,000 Speedfreeks, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/26/roadcraft-review/">Roadcraft</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/27/f1-25-review/">F1 25</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has spent this week playing Chains of Freedom for review, Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3, Warhammer 40k Rogue Trader, and Oblivion.</p>

<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been probably been playing Destiny 2 this week, but he‚Äôs also been writing about a batch of other things that he‚Äôs going to tell you about, including Hell is Us, which he seems rather taken with. You can <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/30/hands-on-hell-is-us-preview/">read his preview right here</a>.</p>

<p>After jetting off to Madeira for most of the week, <strong>Aran‚Äôs</strong> gaming was limited to starting Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon for review. He says, ‚ÄúSo far I have escaped a dungeon and killed a miniboss found in a hidden dungeon in a blood-filled lake.‚Äù Sounds delightful!</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> has been playing Hypercharge: Unboxed but says it is ‚Äúmore fun in concept than it is in execution‚Äù, calling it, ‚ÄúA pretty by-the-numbers arcade shooter that‚Äôs fun for a short while‚Äù.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs not all he‚Äôs had on the go though, as he tell us, ‚ÄúAfter chipping away at it for a couple of weeks, I also crossed Resident Evil 8 off my backlog. I really enjoyed the setting and many of the smart refinements Capcom has made to the series‚Äô new formula. Presenting players with a cast of twisted villains, then tasking us with taking them down works great just as it did in Resi 7. However, much like its predecessor, there‚Äôs a jarring theme shift between atmospheric horror and sci-fi that I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of.‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> has been carrying on this week. Specifically with&nbsp;Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which is ‚Äúa great RPG with memorable characters, an engaging story, and superb combat but irritating platforming sections‚Äù and continued to enjoy Revenge of the Savage Planet in co-op with his partner.</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> has also been Revenging that Savage Planet, saying, ‚ÄúIt works really well in the transition to third person‚Äù. He‚Äôs also rinsed Doom the Dark Ages, telling us, ‚ÄúIt was a fun campaign but the pacing felt off in places. I‚Äôve had the chance to try out a few demos early with previews on the way and really enjoyed Near Mage ‚Äì review up soon. Finally as a result of the early demos I‚Äôve been trying to beat the NES Ninja Gaiden games and my God they‚Äôre tough. Resisted save state scumming so far but don‚Äôt think that‚Äôll last much longer.‚Äù</p>
<p>And&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> has been doing some prep work for the impending arrival of the Switch 2 next week. That‚Äôs meant going all the way back to the PS4 to capture some Yakuza 0, Cyberpunk 2077, Kunitsu-Gami and more for comparisons ‚Äì Cyberpunk on PS4 is such a rough time‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs also dipped into the Splitgate 2 open beta, which is a pretty good time while everyone‚Äôs still figuring out how to best use portals, jet packs and everything else.</p>
<p><em>What about you? What have you played?</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-seemingly-teasing-more-splinter-cell-remake-news-is-coming-soon/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We've heard next to nothing about the Splinter Cell Remake since Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-snowdrop-engine-linear-not-open-world/">confirmed the remake was coming</a> after years of waiting for Ubisoft to even <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ceo-were-working-on-splinter-cell-comeback/">say that they are bringing the series back</a>.</p>
<p>Last August, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-toronto-managing-director-says-splinter-cell-remake-remains-in-stealth-mode/">a sly comment</a> from the managing director at Ubisoft Toronto, the studio that's leading development on the Splinter Cell Remake, amounted to Ubisoft saying they had nothing to say at the time. That was the last time we heard anything directly from Ubisoft about the coming remake.</p>
<p>Today, however, Splinter Cell was brought up again, through the company's <a href="https://x.com/Ubisoft/status/1928421132438224990">account on X</a>. The post is just a photo of Sam Fisher, not from the original 2002 game, but from 2005's Chaos Theory, captioned with emoticons making a face and a Splinter Cell hashtag.</p>
<p>The image's alt-text reads "<em><span>Close-up of Sam Fisher from Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, showing a stern expression with focused eyes, short dark hair, and a rugged beard, set against a blurred high-tech background. He's locked in.</span></em>"</p>
<p><iframe title="Splinter Cell Remake: Stepping Out of the Shadows | Ubisoft [NA]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HH1_ZCSf_HY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Summer Game Fest is around the corner, and interestingly, Ubisoft is not included in the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-has-record-setting-60-partners-for-this-years-showcase/">image showcasing the partners for this year's show</a>. Keighley also claimed that this year's show has 60+ partners, but the image and the <a href="https://www.summergamefest.com/">website</a> only list 57. This was likely purposeful, for Ubisoft to announce its involvement in Summer Game Fest separately with a yet-to-be-announced Ubisoft Forward event sometime during the SGF weekend.</p>
<p>That's all just speculation, but with how vocal Splinter Cell fans have been about asking for a return of the series, the company has to be acutely aware of the impact even mentioning Splinter Cell has. It's not likely that Sam Fisher would show up a week ahead of SGF if Ubisoft didn't have something to show regarding the Splinter Cell Remake.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we'll get an announcement soon that Ubisoft does have something Splinter Cell Remake-related to show.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nine Sols Sales Top 800k, Developer Red Candle Reveals]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nine-sols-sales-800k</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nine-sols-sales-top-800k-developer-red-candle-reveals.1202694/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nine-sols-sales-800k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Red Candle Games has revealed that Metroidvania action platformer&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>has reached a big sales milestone, with the game also celebrating its first anniversary.</p>

<p>Released on May 29th last year,&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>has, according to a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1809540/view/544484746860692250" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, reached 800,000 copies since its launch. That number counts across all platforms, too, so it includes not only the game's initial PC release, but also November's console ports.</p>

<p>Red Candle also includes a timeline of&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>' achievements in the post, revealing that by the six-week mark, the game had reached 6,000 Steam reviews and earned itself an Overwhelmingly Positive rating (which, across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1809540/Nine_Sols/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">all reviews</a>, it still holds at time of writing).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nine-sols-sales-800k-explosion.jpg?itok=knOIaziU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nine-sols-sales-800k-explosion.jpg?itok=ya2byuep 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>has managed to sell 800,000 copies across all platforms since launching last year.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>, it's a 2D action platformer with heavy Metroidvania elements created by Taiwanese studio Red Candle Games, best known for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/devotion-removed-from-steam-amid-outcry-over-winnie-pooh-reference" rel="nofollow">controversial</a>&nbsp;horror adventure game&nbsp;<em>Devotion</em>.</p>

<p>The game revolves around Yi, who must seek out the titular nine Sols in order to take their Sol Seals. His true motivations are unclear at the outset of the game, but become clearer as the plot progresses.</p>

<p>Yi also befriends a young human child by the name of Shuanshuan at the start of&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>, and it's his relationship with Shuanshuan that informs his character development and reveals more about the world in which the game takes place.</p>

<p>While&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>is a Metroidvania, that might not be the best attitude with which to approach it; you can think of it more as a semi-linear platformer that takes influence from&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice" rel="nofollow">Sekiro</a>&nbsp;</em>than as a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight" rel="nofollow"><em>Hollow Knight</em></a>-style sprawling and interconnected experience.</p>




<p>If you'd like to give&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>a go (and I'd recommend you do so), you can check it out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1809540/Nine_Sols/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10007919" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/nine-sols/9N3LGKGF3CC2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nine-sols-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. It's well worth your time.</p>

The app will also provide a detailed history of who children use GameChat with and for how long.</p><p>Nintendo is being especially restrictive when it comes to kids using GameChat‚Äôs video capabilities and a camera. ‚ÄúPermission is required from a parent or guardian every time younger players want to use video chat to ensure family rules about use of video sharing are followed.‚Äù When a player under 16 starts a video chat, a request will be sent to the parental controls app that needs to be approved before the chat can begin.</p><p>Earlier this week, Nintendo also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/676287/nintendo-switch-2-mobile-app-screenshots-backup-upload">updated its Nintendo Switch App</a> ahead of the new console‚Äôs arrival with new features that make it much easier to upload screenshots and videos to a mobile device, as well as expanded functionality for the Switch 2 editions of <em>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As I wrote earlier today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/should-you-play-elden-ring-nightreign-solo">I would not recommend Nightreign as a solo game</a> at this point as it's clearly not the intended way to play.</p>
<p>However, it seems FromSoftware is aiming to respond to the current backlash to make solo play more feasible.</p>
<p>The studio previously stated it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-could-receive-two-player-mode-post-launch">considering a two-player option post-launch</a>, acknowledging it was "something that was overlooked during development".</p>
<p>"FromSoftware's multiplayer spin-off is an exhilarating rush and a celebration of the studio's prior achievements Souls veterans will devour," I wrote in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Elden Ring Nightreign review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-nobunaga%E2%80%99s-ambition-awakening-complete-edition-q-a.1202634/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-nobunagas-ambition-awakening-complete-edition-qa/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Koei Tecmo's only Nintendo Switch 2 launch game is NOBUNAGA‚ÄôS AMBITION: Awakening Complete Edition, an improved version of the game that launched in July 2023 for PC, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch. Awakening was the sixteenth installment in the popular series of turn-based grand strategy games. Ahead of that game's launch, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/nobunagas-ambition-awakening-preview-and-qa-with-director-ryu-michi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> an interview with Koei Tecmo's producer and director Michi Ryu.</p>
<p>The Complete Edition (which will also be available on Sony's PlayStation 5 console) features DLC from the original title as well as six new scenarios along with climactic Decisive Battles. Players will be able to launch joint offenses with allies, break through the frontlines en route to enemy castles, and appoint officers to influence both political and economic strategies while experiencing life as a daimyo in the troubled times of the Warring States Period (16th-century Japan).</p>
<p>With the game's debut scheduled for next week, we contacted Michi Ryu once again to discuss specifically the Nintendo Switch 2 version of NOBUNAGA‚ÄôS&nbsp; AMBITION: Awakening Complete Edition. The game will be available on June 5 as part of the Switch 2's launch lineup.</p>
<p><iframe title="NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION: Awakening Complete Edition - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kvZG8Jiz7oQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>When did you first receive your Nintendo Switch 2 development kit?</strong></p>
<p>I can't give you a concrete answer, so I'll leave it to your imagination (laughs).</p>
<p><strong>How long has this version been in development, and what do you think about the new platform's ease of development?</strong></p>
<p>While I can't disclose the exact timeframe, we had previously released the Nintendo Switch version, so porting to Nintendo Switch 2 was possible to achieve within a small team in a short period.&nbsp; Besides the porting, we have also worked on adding new hardware features and preparing game content updates, so overall, it took a considerable amount of time. Developing on this new platform feels the same as the Switch, which makes the process easier. However, there are always some challenges when launching a game (laughs).</p>
<p><strong>Can you share your thoughts on the new console? What is the most interesting new feature, in your opinion?</strong></p>
<p>The platform has evolved in many ways. There are many interesting aspects, but in terms of strategy games, the possibility of being able to use the Joy-Con 2 as a mouse might be the most notable one. Although we think that using the controller to play is more than enough, it's undeniable that a mouse, which allows more intuitive control, is better suited for this genre. Being able to accomplish this through hardware features is a significant advantage.</p>
<p><strong>In terms of raw computing power, is it closer to the PlayStation 4 or the Xbox Series S?</strong></p>
<p>Since the "NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION" series is not available on Xbox, we cannot make a comparison.</p>
<p><strong>Are you using NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution for NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION: Awakening Complete Edition? Is it essentially the same as DLSS SR on PC?</strong></p>
<p>We are not using DLSS.</p>
<p><strong>What resolution and frame rate options are you offering for the Switch 2 version?</strong></p>
<p>The game runs at Full HD and 30fps. We also experimented with 4K and 60fps, but the power required to render the Japanese archipelago with these graphics is more than you can imagine and difficult to keep stable, so we had to give up. We hope to revisit this challenge in the future if the opportunity arises.</p>
<p><strong>NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION: Awakening&nbsp;was previously launched on the first Switch. What kind of improvements can players expect in the Switch 2 version?</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to the hardware evolution of Switch 2, the graphics have been significantly improved. Elements like the sea, sky, and ground look much more real, enhancing the immersive experience of the game. Being able to have this level of graphics in a portable format is a major point to be enjoyed by players. Additionally, with mouse operation via Joy-Con 2 and USB mouse support, intuitive controls are now possible. We have also included some game content that was previously only available in Asia, so we hope players will enjoy those as well.</p>
<p><strong>Is the experience of playing with the controller as a mouse similar to using the mouse on PC? What are the differences, if any?</strong></p>
<p>The mouse controls have been closely recreated. Although there are some differences between the hardware, such as assigning the mouse wheel to the stick, the functionality has been covered.<br>
Moreover, shortcuts have been assigned to the other Joy-Con 2, so the overall functionality might even surpass that of using a mouse alone.</p>
<p><strong>Are you taking advantage of the improved HD Rumble in NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION: Awakening Complete Edition?</strong></p>
<p>HD Rumble is not supported.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anything else you'd like to add about the Switch 2 version of your game?</strong></p>
<p>The Nobunaga's Ambition series is a title that is a traditional Japanese game with a long history of over 40 years. This is the first time in the series that we are releasing a complete edition, and it's thanks to the positive reception of the latest title (NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION: Awakening) and its steady sales. I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has played it. And if you haven't tried it yet, I hope you'll take this chance to pick it up and try it out.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/675590/nintendo-switch-pokemon-home-legends-za-generation-x<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Though the first Nintendo Switch era of <em>Pok√©mon </em>games was undeniably rocky at times, it brought the series‚Äô trading and organization systems into a new level of maturity. It wasn‚Äôt always <em>easy </em>to complete Pok√©dexes in remakes like <em>Brilliant Diamond</em> and <em>Shining Pearl</em> and new entries like <em>Sword</em> and <em>Shield</em>. But those games helped The Pok√©mon Company create a more seamless way to move your monsters from one title to another, or swap them with friends. And with the <em>Pok√©mon </em>franchise about to make its big debut on the Switch 2 with the cross-generation game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637256/pokemon-legends-z-a-trailer-day-night-cycle"><em>Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A</em></a>, it feels like The Pok√©mon Company is getting ready to take the trading system to the next level.</p><p>In the <em>Pok√©mon </em>games, filling up your Pok√©dex has always been an exercise in patience, planning, and understanding that Nintendo and The Pok√©mon Company want you trading with other players rather than trying to catch ‚Äôem all on your own. The games‚Äô trading mechanics evolved as the series jumped from the Game Boy to new hardware. By Generation IV (the DS games), players could swap monsters remotely over the internet without needing to use wired link cables. And after years of many legendary and mythical pok√©mon only being obtainable through in-person events, The Pok√©mon Company and Game Freak used <em>Pok√©mon</em>‚Äôs Generation V to introduce a serial code redemption system that made snagging super-rare monsters infinitely easier.</p><p>Bringing pok√©mon you first caught on older titles like the GBA‚Äôs <em>Pok√©mon Emerald</em> up to more modern ones like the 3DS‚Äôs <em>Ultra Sun</em> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/12/how-to-trade-pokemon-between-every-generation">was still a very tedious process</a>. But with each generation of games, The Pok√©mon Company was clearly building out a digital system that allowed players to experience their <em>Pok√©mon </em>adventures as one massive, continuous journey. That project continued in the Switch era with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18089644/pokemon-lets-go-new-players-kids-nintendo-switch">2018‚Äôs <em>Let‚Äôs Go </em>games</a>, 3D remakes of <em>Pok√©mon Yellow </em>that featured new mechanics inspired by <em>Pok√©mon Go</em>.</p><div><p>It was wild to see Nintendo using a console title to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17963926/pokemon-lets-go-nintendo-switch-pikachu-evee">capitalize on the success of a mobile application</a>. But the way the <em>Let‚Äôs Go </em>games connected with <em>Pok√©mon Go</em> and the Pok√©mon Home cloud storage service spoke volumes about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17963926/pokemon-lets-go-nintendo-switch-pikachu-evee">Nintendo and The Pok√©mon Company‚Äôs vision for the franchise‚Äôs future</a>. </p></div><p>Like the 3DS‚Äôs <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/4/4693376/pokemon-bank-cloud-storage-service">Pok√©mon Bank</a> and Pok√© Transporter companion applications, Pok√©mon Home gave players an online space to stash their ‚Äômons and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21134790/pokemon-home-pokedex-transporter-move-3ds-games-switch-android-ios">a way to move them between games</a>. Home‚Äôs ability to connect with Bank made it useful for longtime fans looking to keep their favorite monsters with them. But the application was also clearly meant to help newer players ‚Äî people drawn to the franchise by games like <em>Scarlet / Violet </em>and <em>Legends: Arceus</em> ‚Äî start building collections that would keep them invested (both emotionally and financially) in the series.</p><p>By requiring subscriptions, Pok√©mon Home and the Switch <em>Pok√©mon </em>games‚Äô online features helped Nintendo come into its own as a services company. Since Nintendo Switch Online‚Äôs launch in 2018, Nintendo has sweetened the deal by gradually adding <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24339906/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-nso">more of its classic games to the service</a>, along with other features, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24288201/nintendo-music-streaming-hands-on-impressions">a streaming music app</a>. It‚Äôs been a little frustrating to watch the company choose not to put most of its older pre-DS <em>Pok√©mon </em>games online. But much like Nintendo and The Pok√©mon Company‚Äôs tradition of making it impossible to complete the Pok√©dex without having access to both versions (e.g., <em>Red </em>/ <em>Blue</em>) of the same game, this has felt like a calculated movie on the company‚Äôs part to keep players thinking about spending more money.</p><p>Especially with <em>Pok√©mon Go </em>and the various Switch remakes in the mix, Nintendo and The Pok√©mon Company built out an ecosystem of modern games that give players a way to catch virtually every single one of the franchise‚Äôs creatures. And while none of the past Switch games have been focused on cataloging <em>all </em>the pok√©mon, that feels like something that could change as <em>Pok√©mon </em>moves to the Switch 2. </p><p>Like <em>Arceus </em>before it, <em>Legends: Z-A </em>(a Switch game that‚Äôs also getting a Switch 2 edition) will likely feature a limited selection of ‚Äômons in order to put more focus on new gameplay mechanics and a fresh story. But as the Switch 2 becomes Nintendo‚Äôs flagship platform, we could and arguably should see the <em>Pok√©mon </em>series evolve in some surprising ways. <em>Legends: Z-A </em>looks like a significant upgrade from <em>Scarlet </em>/ <em>Violet</em>, but the franchise‚Äôs potential to change more radically feels like something Nintendo has to be thinking about as it prepares for the next generation of mainline (rather than spinoff) games developed specifically for the Switch 2.</p><p>Something as simple as bringing the classic games to NSO with Pok√©mon Home compatibility would make buying into the larger ecosystem with its various subscriptions a much more interesting prospect. It would be a huge win for Pok√©fans still hanging out on the original Switch, and it would make upgrading to the Switch 2 feel even more like following the franchise into the future.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Playtonic, the developer behind the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yooka-laylee">Yooka-Laylee</a> series, has confirmed layoffs at the studio.</p>
<p>In a statement shared on social media, the studio stated it has "felt the knock-on effects" of recent changes in the industry and so, "after exploring every possible avenue" it has made "the incredibly heartbreaking decision to say goodbye to some truly brilliant members of the Playtonic team".</p>
<p>It's unclear if Playtonic's next game, the remaster Yooka-Replaylee, has been affected. It's set for release later this year.</p>

<p>"We've all seen in recent years how the games industry has been changing, resulting in studio after studio finding themselves in situations where to continue to exist, they must make painful decisions - decisions that impact the lives of so many individual talented developers," the statement reads.</p>
<p>"This isn't a reflection of anyone's talent or dedication, the people leaving have poured so much heart, creativity, and care into everything we do. They've helped shape our studio, our games, and our culture, and we're incredibly proud of what we've built together."</p>
<p>The studio surmised: "This isn't simply a difficult moment, it's a period of profound change in how games are created and financed. The landscape is shifting, and with it, so must we."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/a-third-persona-4-voice-actor-has-confirmed-they-wont-be-returning-for-the-persona-4-remake/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Two days ago, <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-seemingly-confirmed-by-spider-man/">Yuri Lowenthal confirmed in a post on BlueSky</a> that he wouldn't be returning to reprise his role as Yosuke in the Persona 4 Remake, a project that had been <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-persona-2-remaster-development/">rumored</a> to be happening, but not yet confirmed.</p>
<p>Lowenthal's claims that he potentially "<em>begged</em>" to be asked back and the fact that he deleted his original post made it look like Lowenthal had gone rogue, confirming his absence from the game as a small rebellious act against Atlus and SEGA.</p>
<p>But then a second actor, Erin Fitzgerald, <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-wont-see-the-return-of-another-beloved-voice-actress/">confirmed her absence from the Persona 4 Remake</a> in a similar manner. Again, posting on BlueSky, Fitzgerald said, "<em>For those asking, I have not been asked to reprise my role as Chie Satonaka in the Persona 4 remake. RIP. I am blessed to have recorded as many Persona 4 games as I did playing her.</em>"</p>
<p>And now today, for a third day in a row, another Persona 4 voice actor has come out on social media to say that they will not reprise their role in the Persona 4 Remake. This time, it's Amanda Winn Lee, the only difference this time is that <a href="https://x.com/amandawinnlee/status/1928242559685472293">she posted the news on X</a> instead of BlueSky.</p>
<p>"<em><span>Since, I've had several people ask me: No, I wasn't asked to voice Yukiko in the P4 remake</span></em>."</p>
<p>The first time, it seemed like Lowenthal had gone rogue. Fitzgerald's post then opened up the possibility that the cast are all voicing their displeasure about not being asked back for the remake. That could still be true, but now that a third actor has come out and made the same claim, for a third day in a row, for a game that's not even officially confirmed, it's starting to feel like a marketing ploy ahead of the game's reveal, most likely next week during <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-has-record-setting-60-partners-for-this-years-showcase/">Summer Game Fest.</a></p>
<p>A user on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oscarexplosion.bsky.social/post/3lqefs2747226">BlueSky</a> also cleverly noticed that the order of these announcements also matches the order the characters each of these actors play are added to your party in Persona 4. If Matt Mercer is next to say that they weren't asked back to voice Kanji Tatsumi, with the same wording, then this has almost certainly all been a marketing ploy to build up awareness of the upcoming remake ahead of its official reveal.</p>
<p>The twist is probably that it's not called Persona 4 Remake, with the word 'Remake' swapped for something else, similarly to how the remake of Persona 3 was called <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/persona-3-reload-review/">Persona 3 Reload</a>, and that instead of recasting everyone, the whole voice cast is indeed returning for whatever the remake is actually called.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-witcher-3-is-getting-cross-platform-mod-support-later-this-year.1202586/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-3-cross-platform-mod-support<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt Red has announced that&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 3&nbsp;</em>will be getting cross-platform mod support later this year, potentially bringing some of the game's most popular mods to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/es/en/news/51479/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-cross-platform-mod-support" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the game's official website, cross-platform mod support will be added to the game via the mod.io platform, which is the same one used by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-developer-teases-robust-cross-platform-plan-for-mod-support" rel="nofollow">games like&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>, among others.</p>

<p>Naturally, console mods will be available at no extra cost; all you'll need to do is create a mod.io account and connect it to your CD Projekt Red profile in order to access mods on PS5 and Xbox.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-witcher-3-cross-platform-mod-support-griffin.jpg?itok=21bUxwMw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-witcher-3-cross-platform-mod-support-griffin.jpg?itok=aTIDBPbU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You could turn this griffin - or, indeed, Geralt - into something truly bizarre when&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 3&nbsp;</em>mods land on console later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll only be able to mod&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 3&nbsp;</em>on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S; the last-gen versions of the game won't be getting mod support. Additionally, only mods approved by CD Projekt Red will be accessible on consoles.</p>

<p>While CD Projekt Red's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-3-redkit-mod-editor-release-date" rel="nofollow">REDkit mod editor</a> isn't necessary for creating&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 3&nbsp;</em>mods on consoles, the developer does recommend that you use it if you want the "best chance" of your mod being approved.</p>

<p>Additionally, if your mods use scripts, you will need to use REDkit, so it's probably worth downloading it and getting to grips with it now if you're planning to put anything together for PS5 or Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>It's also not possible to create mods for the game directly on the consoles themselves. You'll need to make the mods on PC, even if you're intending for them to be used specifically on consoles.</p>




<p><em>The Witcher 3&nbsp;</em>recently celebrated its tenth anniversary, but the series isn't stopping there, of course; back in December last year, CD Projekt Red <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-4-official-reveal" rel="nofollow">officially unveiled&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 4</em></a>, although it's likely to be some time before we get more info about it.</p>

<p>Additionally, the studio revealed earlier this week that pre-production on the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>sequel <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cd-projekt-profits-cyberpunk-sequel-pre-production" rel="nofollow">has officially begun</a>. Again, though, expect to wait quite a while before an official announcement.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-declares-victory-the-battle-of-super-earth-is-won-what-next-for-the-illuminate<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 2‚Äôs ongoing Galactic War appears to have reached another turning point, with the Federation declaring victory over the Illuminate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúThe Illuminate have retreated from Super Earth battlespace,‚Äù reads the in-universe message to the game‚Äôs community. ‚ÄúThe Heart of Democracy has been defended. The Battle of Super Earth is won.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Illuminate‚Äôs invasion certainly took its toll on Super Earth, with only two Mega Cities left standing: Prosperity City and Equality-on-Sea.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúRemaining Illuminate forces were last observed making FTL jumps from Super Earth orbit,‚Äù the message continues. ‚ÄúThe enemy has also vacated New Haven, Pilen V, and Widow's Harbor, burning the surface of those planets as they fled. No stations detect Illuminate forces ‚Äî the enemy has gone into hiding. They will be found.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúAfter days of nonstop fighting, Super Earth stands. The mettle of Managed Democracy has been tested; the will of the people has overcome the enemy. The Helldivers have achieved victory.‚Äù</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The thing is, no-one actually believes the Helldivers have achieved a long-lasting victory here. As is developer Arrowhead‚Äôs way, Federation communication is by default propaganda, and further turmoil is almost certainly coming down the pipe. And players really want to chase the Illuminate as they retreat, potentially to their home planet to stamp them out for good.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, an in-game message revealed the President of Super Earth was killed while fighting back the Illuminate forces. But again, there was a healthy dose of scepticism from players, with some saying it might have been an Illuminate communication in disguise. What‚Äôs really going on here?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It‚Äôs worth noting that Helldivers 2 suffered a controversy this week surrounding the invasion, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-gets-review-bombed-again-this-time-over-its-big-battle-for-super-earth">leading to a fresh flood of negative reviews</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the days since the Heart of Democracy update went live, players have fought to hold the various Mega Cities of Super Earth, which correspond to major cities in real-life. York Supreme, for example, corresponds roughly to New York, and Remembrance to Buenos Aires. As the invasion continued, more and more cities fell, leaving only Equality-On-Sea (Shanghai) and Super Earth's capital, Prosperity City (Stockholm) standing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Efforts rallied behind Equality-On-Sea to make a last stand. But Equality-On-Sea never hit 100%; the current arc closed with the cities' percentage meter at 99.9783%. Many of the negative reviews are in Chinese, and while the machine translation doesn't seem accurate enough to quote, there are some recurring points one can easily glean: frustration over driving the narrative, the perception of a thumb on the scale from Arrowhead, and repeat mentions of "99.9783%."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What‚Äôs next? Well, for a start, the Federation needs a new president. Let‚Äôs see what Game Master Joel has up his sleeve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreigns-toughest-challenge-so-far-finding-friends-to-play-with<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It‚Äôs early days for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, but already players have run up against their toughest challenge so far. No, it's not a classic FromSoftware boss, it‚Äôs the struggle to find friends to play with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring Nightreign drops players into the shifting lands of Limveld, exploring and fighting for survival either solo or in groups of three. There is no way to play two-player co-op. We‚Äôve already reported on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreigns-massive-steam-launch-tarnished-by-mixed-user-reviews-over-lack-of-duos-co-op-voice-chat">Elden Ring Nightreign‚Äôs ‚Äòmixed‚Äô Steam user review rating</a>, with most of the complaints revolving around a lack of a duos option as well as no voice chat.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Playing Elden Ring Nightreign solo is proving to be a particularly difficult experience. As explained in IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-review"><u>Elden Ring Nightreign review</u></a>: "Let‚Äôs get the most important caveat out of the way first: if you are hoping to tackle Nightreign entirely solo, and are anything less than a hardcore Elden Ring player that actively seeks out ways to make that already difficult game even more challenging, Nightreign isn‚Äôt for you. Yes, there is technically a single-player option, but it is so poorly balanced that I would be shocked if it isn‚Äôt patched and adjusted within the first month of release. And this is coming from someone who lives and breathes these types of games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, solo players are faced with matchmaking with random players, which itself is presenting problems because of a lack of coordination required to defeat Elden Ring Nightreign‚Äôs bosses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, players are turning to the Elden Ring community for help. The Elden Ring subreddit, for example, is packed with requests from duos looking for a third player (yes, the community is having fun with this situation).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúThere‚Äôs like a zero % chance I‚Äôd find one other person to play with much less two,‚Äù said redditor trickponies. ‚ÄúIs the game even worth it solo?‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players are pointing out that Elden Ring Nightreign does have matchmaking, so you can play trios if you do not have friends to play with. But, as others have countered, playing this game with randoms isn‚Äôt always the best experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúI have seen too many videos on this sub to trust randoms with anything more than the newspaper,‚Äù said one player. ‚ÄúI love you all. But from a distance. My blood pressure can only take so much.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players are turning to Discords and other online platforms as they hunt for like-minded fans to team up with. Elden Ring Nightreign hasn‚Äôt even been out 24 hours, but this is proving to be a big hurdle for the community as they work their way through the game.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Nightreign solo cuz my friends have a 9 to 5 and I'm unemployed <a href="https://t.co/t47UrYoDSv" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/t47UrYoDSv</a></p>‚Äî Raph (@RaphDeee) <a href="https://twitter.com/RaphDeee/status/1928074268279026068?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 29, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Some Elden Ring fans are even saying they won‚Äôt buy the game because they don‚Äôt have any friends to play with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúYeah, as disappointing as it is, Imma have to pass on this game, purely because I don't have any friends to play it with and I can't play solo,‚Äù said Twinkie454.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others are calling on FromSoftware to rebalance the solo experience so it‚Äôs more manageable. ‚ÄúWe'll see what FromSoft does to re-balance it, so maybe have some patience,‚Äù one person said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, as you‚Äôd expect, some fans are offering to help others out. ‚Äú.... Did we just become best friends?!‚Äù said one Elden Ring player. ‚ÄúGet the game bestie, I'll see you tomorrow when I get off work!‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite these issues, Elden Ring Nightreign has enjoyed a massive launch on Steam, with an incredible 313,593 peak concurrent users on Steam overnight. That was enough to make Elden Ring Nightreign one of the most-played games on Valve‚Äôs platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it sounds like FromSoftware may add a duos option at some point in the future. In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-time-director-learned-from-miyazaki-ign-first"><u>IGN's interview with Elden Ring Nightreign director Junya Ishizaki</u></a>, the Nightreign lead developer discussed the choice to lean on solos and trios as the core experience options. When asked why there's no option for a pair of players to drop in together without a matchmade third player, Ishizaki said it was overlooked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The simple answer is that this is simply something that was overlooked during development as just a two-player option, so we're very sorry about that," said Ishizaki. "As we said before, we set out to make this a multiplayer co-op game for three players, balanced for three players, so that was the main focus and it's at the core of Nightreign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of course, I myself as a player understand that and often want times where I'm just playing myself, so this is something that we considered from the start," Ishizaki continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And so we did put a lot of effort into creating this experience that was playable for solo players in as much as the rules and new systems allowed. So in putting all our efforts into that aspect, we kind of overlooked and neglected the duos aspect, but this is something that we are looking at and considering for post-launch support as well."</p><div id="top-25-fromsoftware-bosses" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Top 25 FromSoftware Bosses</h3><h3>Top 25 FromSoftware Bosses</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We‚Äôve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks">Nightreign tips and tricks</a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides">all the eight Nightlord Bosses</a>, and if you‚Äôre wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes">Nightfarer Classes</a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant">How to Unlock the Revenant</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess">How to Unlock the Duchess</a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters">How to Change Characters</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Grace was reportedly credited as outsourcing and co-dev lead, although it's unclear if she has personally donated this plaque, or if it was somehow lost and donated when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown"><u>PlayStation shut down developer Firewalk Studios towards the end of last year</u></a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Concord, a live service hero shooter from Sony-owned Firewalk Studios, has gone down as one of the biggest flops in PlayStation history. Amid disastrously low player numbers, Sony pulled Concord offline just two weeks after launch. One estimate suggested it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing"><u>only sold around 25,000 copies</u></a>. At the time, we awarded <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-review"><u>Concord a 7 in our review</u></a>, writing: "Concord isn‚Äôt the most innovative or content-heavy hero shooter you could play, but with such fantastic competitive gameplay, 16 compelling characters to master, and 12 well-designed maps, it‚Äôs got the makings of something that could go the distance in the months and years to come."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're thinking a plaque like this could be worth something for collectors and fans alike, you're not wrong. So far, it's attracted dozens of bids and is, at the time of writing, <a href="https://shopgoodwill.com/item/231642470" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sitting on an asking price of $3,002</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/concord-devs-commemorative-plaque-hits-auction-the-price-is-already-soaring-3206903/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Dexerto</u></a>).

I know that they were trying to do the best they could, and they were a talented group of artists, so I feel terrible for that.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It has proved a costly failure for Sony. Concord's initial development deal was around $200 million but sources familiar with the agreement say the $200 million was not enough to fund Concord's entire development, nor did it include the purchase of the Concord IP rights or Firewalk itself. It's thought ProbablyMonsters ‚Äî Firewalk's original parent company ‚Äî raised $200 million in 2021.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
