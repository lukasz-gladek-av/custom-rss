			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows isn't far away, and those who plan to pick up the game will be transported to Feudal Japan as of November 2024. The game will be available on all platforms except for the Nintendo Switch, and it's now rumored to offer a 60 FPS mode on all platforms. However, it is said to have the best display quality on PS5 Pro. This rumor comes from <a href="https://x.com/arabhardware/status/1836713669163393197?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1836733526441349582%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es3_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arabhardware on X</a> and was then translated and 'confirmed' by <a href="https://x.com/_L3vi3?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1836733526441349582%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a news account</a> dedicated to Assassin's Creed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: World Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zKua34QXhMA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This post also continued to claim other details in the game, such as enemies suffering from heatstroke if they stood in the sun for too long, tying into the fact that weather changes will affect the game play. We suspect that the weather system will affect game play like it does in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, for example. According to ArabHardware, if it is raining, enemies will not hear you when you are walking in the rain.</p>
<p>There are also reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gamescom-preview-the-most-visually-advanced-assassins-creed-to-date/">huge improvements</a> being made to the game play physics as they are using AnvilNext and have continued to make upgrades to that engine for this game. While these details are simply rumors for the moment, there will be an Assassin's Creed Shadows preview event later in the month which will hopefully clarify some of the points made.</p>
<p>Additionally, in <a href="https://www.magazinesdirect.com/az-magazines/6937074/play-magazine-single-issue.thtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an interview with Play</a>, Art Director Thierry Dansereau spoke about the size of Assassin's Creed Shadows, saying that it is "bigger than Mirage, but smaller than Valhalla," saying that the game is roughly around the size of Assassin's Creed Origins. Compared to previous games, the focal point of the game will be taking place in Honshu, as "this is where all the events related to Oda Nobunaga are taking place."</p>
<p>The post by ArabHardware also claims that players won't be able to hide as Yasuke, due to his size, and the fact he makes a sound when he moves. However, he does have a bow and arrow that he can utilize to stealth kill enemies.</p>
<p>Of course, take this all with a pinch of salt, as none of this information has been confirmed by Ubisoft. The preview of Assassin's Creed Shadows will likely occur at the end of September, and details will be revealed at Tokyo Game Show 2024. This event takes place between September 26 and September 29, and plenty of games will be showcased at the event.</p>

        <p>Rockstar and Valve reportedly working to "find a fix"</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a> is no longer officially supported by Steam Deck, thanks to the introduction of some anti-cheat software which can, in fact, be made compatible with Steam Deck. Say what now?
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Rockstar added BattlEye Anti-Cheat to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> and GTA Online in an update on Tuesday 17th September, together with options to disable the anti-cheat functionality for Story Mode play on the Rockstar Games Launcher or third-party launchers. In the process, support for Steam Deck play has fallen through like a police helicopter into a traffic jam.</p>
<p>"Steam Deck does not support BattlEye for GTA Online," the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/271590/announcements/detail/6356356787200715685?snr=2___">changelog</a> baldly notes. "You will be able to play GTAV Story Mode but unable to play GTA Online."
</p>
<p>
It's all a bit curious because, as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24248585/gta-v-steam-deck-battleye">The Verge</a> point out, it's been possible to set up BattlEye to run on Steam Deck for years, though the Linux-based OS doesn't support it by default thanks to its Proton Windows compatibility layer. Apparently, it's as straightforward as sending BattlEye's vendors a mail. As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/grand-theft-auto/gta-online-is-no-longer-compatible-with-steam-deck-thanks-to-its-new-anti-cheat-software-despite-battleye-having-an-opt-in-system-for-this-sort-of-thing/">PCGamer</a> add, GTA Online is or was one of the most-played Steam Deck games, so all this is causing a bit of a stink down Los Santos way.
</p>
<p>
In their changelog, Rockstar lay the responsibility for the loss of compatibility at Valve's door. "GTAV and GTA Online are not officially supported on Steam Deck and all technical support questions should be directed to Valve's Steam Deck support content and community," it reads. This, players have been doing. One redditor has allegedly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1fk8hp7/weather_update_gta_v_has_been_updated_to/">heard from a Valve rep</a> that they're "working with Rockstar Games to find a fix".
</p>
<p>I'm a bit mystified, frankly, but there's precedent for big publishers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/8/22923163/fortnite-steam-deck-update-epic-tim-sweeney">being iffy about whether they can run anti-cheat software over the Steam Deck's Linux-based OS</a>. Presumably, you can still fire up GTA Online on the Deck if you dual-boot Windows and skip the Proton layer.</p>
<p>
If there's one thing everybody can agree on, it's that GTA Online has a cheating problem. I'm interested to see how they'll <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-biggest-question-gta-6-has-to-answer-is-what-to-do-about-gta-online">tackle that and GTA Online in general</a> after the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>.

The game’s mix of melee combat and gunplay feels good and is a natural evolution of the OG <em>Space Marine</em> from 2011.

Thankfully, these and many other parts of <em>Space Marine 2 </em>are going to be tweaked and improved. </p><p>On September 18, Saber Interactive posted a lengthy FAQ on <em>Space Marine 2</em>'s official Steam page.

			<p>We've just <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-faq/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR3iIdzGYSeTvVTrZh08UrAl8dVMwTUk4okUif2S0hgESJInOmQIUwsN4Ms_aem_gDv4y5NjcKyl6HQjo90tPw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> the official <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> PC system requirements. The major advantage over 2020's game is that the installation size on your local drive is much smaller, with only 50GB required. However, the 'recommended spec' now asks for 32GB of RAM, while the 'ideal spec' lists 64GB RAM, which is certainly more than most gamers have installed on their PCs.</p>
<p>Another improvement of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 will be found in the highly reduced bandwidth consumption, according to Asobo Studio CEO and Co-Founder Sebastian Wloch, who told <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/19/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Wire</a>:</p>
<p><em>The very important thing is overall bandwidth consumption is way down because you only download what you really see when you see it, and we don’t pre-download at hundreds of gigabytes. Microsoft Flight Simulator (2020) already had over two petabytes of data on the cloud. That was the whole world data. We kept adding to that, but we still had planes, airports, meshes, points of interests like castles, and textures that were all installed. That’s the part that kept growing with the marketplace content, which had grown to 2 TB. Now we integrated everything into the cloud, and it is all streamed and kept into a rolling cache on the hardware. You don’t have to install any new World Updates; they’re just streamed seamlessly.</em></p>

The 2TB “Galaxy Black” special-edition Xbox Series X is mostly the same as the standard Series X, but it features a double-capacity SSD and a slick paint job. We’re inching toward its October 15th release, and interested parties willing to pony up the $599.99 asking price can already preorder one at <a href="https://howl.me/cm69OQot1NK">Best Buy</a> and directly from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/configure/Xbox-Series-X-2TB-Galaxy-Black-Special-Edition/8smbrt7wmfp9">Microsoft</a>.</p><p>Those who crave the pricier Xbox are primarily getting three unique things for their money:  </p><div><ul><li>2TB of built-in storage, which is twice the amount available on the standard $500 Xbox Series X (which can still be expanded with proprietary storage add-ons).</li><li>A fresh paint job, if black is your thing, that’s reminiscent of the star-filled darkness of space. It shares some vibes with Microsoft’s previous limited-edition console, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641632/microsoft-xbox-series-x-halo-console-elite-2-controller"><em>Halo</em>-themed Xbox Series X</a>, and features green accents on its bottom stand.</li><li>A unique controller with matching speckles on the D-pad and a splash of green on the bottom.</li></ul></div><p>Those changes aren’t nearly as drastic as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/11/24241002/playstation-5-ps5-pro-comparison-differences-specs-software-ray-tracing">new hardware on the PS5 Pro</a> (which features a new GPU, among other performance benefits), but I must admit, the new Xbox looks sick.</p><div><p><h3><a data-item-id="yXNNu1" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://howl.me/cm69OQot1NK">Xbox Series X – 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition </a></h3></p><p><span>$<!-- -->600</span></p><p>A special-edition Xbox Series X with a unique starry design and an expanded 2TB of built-in storage.

It features a Blu-ray drive, too, unlike the compact Series S and <a href="https://howl.me/cm7xSlqtQXQ">discless Series X</a>, the latter of which launches alongside Microsoft’s limited-edition console in October for $449.99.</p><p>While the previous generation of Xbox One consoles saw the release of the mid-cycle Xbox One X, the upcoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24240801/ps5-pro-details-playstation-event-september-2024">PS5 Pro</a> seems to be the lone spec-bumped premium console this generation. Documents revealed during the <em>FTC v.

These new Xbox consoles are obviously not that, but Microsoft calling an audible on that plan is not terribly surprising since recent times have been tough for the Xbox division, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24151047/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-microsoft">studio closures</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242695/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-650-employees">layoffs</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24074166/microsoft-xbox-strategy-multiplatform">plenty of strategy shifts</a>.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Galaxy Black Xbox Wireless Controller features a unique D-pad and green undercoating.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Microsoft</cite></p></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For each game there are dedicated training and practice modes (complete with hitboxes, hurtboxes, startup information, input readers, and more), along with rollback netcode to let you play with friends from all over the world, display filters, and customizable difficulty and attribute (timer speed, attack power) settings.</p><p>Then, on top of that, you’ve got full move lists, marquee cards (previously shown only on arcade cabinets) and music players, as well as a museum mode full of concept art, high-definition character and game art, and tons more.<br></p><p>Hit Next to get into the games, themselves! </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bae9c114fa9df6a07576f4548d02545e" data-recommend-id="image://bae9c114fa9df6a07576f4548d02545e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Xmen Children of the Atom's title screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Xmen Children of the Atom's title screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bae9c114fa9df6a07576f4548d02545e" data-recommend-id="image://bae9c114fa9df6a07576f4548d02545e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Xmen Children of the Atom's title screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s hard to call <em>any</em> version of these games “grounded,” but <em>X-Men: Children of the Atom</em> is certainly the <em>most</em> grounded and straightforward of this collection. A six-button fighting game, characters have more normals and fewer specials than in other versions, letting you focus on your movement, managing your meter, and selecting the Light, Medium, or Heavy versions of your limited special moves to express yourself. </p><figure id="" data-id="f6506c316964081dc842ddb7f12e9dd4" data-recommend-id="image://f6506c316964081dc842ddb7f12e9dd4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Frozen Man battles Hulk Barbie." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Frozen Man battles Hulk Barbie." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f6506c316964081dc842ddb7f12e9dd4" data-recommend-id="image://f6506c316964081dc842ddb7f12e9dd4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Frozen Man battles Hulk Barbie." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This is also one of the few games in this collection that is 1v1, meaning you don’t have to manage your tag team partner’s health, assist calls, or anything like that. Just pick your character, get used to their moves, specials, and supers, and make the most of them. On the ‘<em>Street Fighter</em>’ to ‘wild 3v3 nonsense’ spectrum, <em>Children Of the Atom</em> is as close to <em>Street Fighter</em> as this collection gets.<br></p><p>  Because of that, this is the best entry if you like your fighting games simple and straightforward. While quite a few special moves can be a bit wild (particularly Omega Red, with his screen-filling tentacles), it’s still probably the best entry in the series for the classic, grounded gameplay players have come to expect from Capcom titles like <em>Street Fighter</em>. There’s even an ‘auto-guard’ mode, which is perfect for beginners who want to ease into things. The music is also rocking, which is always a big plus.</p><h3 id="h5955"><a id=""></a>Coolest Characters</h3><p> The coolest character is obviously Iceman <em>(You’re fired—Ed)</em>, but some of the others include: Omega Red, Sentinel, and Wolverine.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="97a44de5d28574eb95b2b3fbf9aaa08b" data-recommend-id="image://97a44de5d28574eb95b2b3fbf9aaa08b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="97a44de5d28574eb95b2b3fbf9aaa08b" data-recommend-id="image://97a44de5d28574eb95b2b3fbf9aaa08b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Expanding beyond the X-Men, this was the first entry in the franchise to incorporate heroes and villains from the larger Marvel universe. Fan favorites like Spider-Man, Hulk, and Iron Man make an appearance, as well as some more niche villains like Shuma Gorath and Blackheart.</p><p><em>Marvel Super Heroes</em> also distinguishes itself by incorporating an Infinity Gem mechanic, a theme that would return much later in <em>Marvel VS. Capcom Infinite</em>, even if the mechanic itself changed quite a bit. </p><figure id="" data-id="0ad4c5b15b511f1620bc500967769362" data-recommend-id="image://0ad4c5b15b511f1620bc500967769362" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sergeant American vs Arachno-Boy" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sergeant American vs Arachno-Boy" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0ad4c5b15b511f1620bc500967769362" data-recommend-id="image://0ad4c5b15b511f1620bc500967769362" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sergeant American vs Arachno-Boy" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> Here you attack your enemies with special moves to knock Infinity Gems out of them, pick them up, then activate their unique effects with a special input. The effect changes based on which Gem is used, with the Soul Gem giving health back to the player, and other gems giving you increased speed, armor on your attacks, and more. When the Infinity Power gauge fills up, filled by every attack, you’ll also gain access to an Infinity Special. </p><p>  This is the best entry for players who like the gameplay of <em>X-Men: Children of the Atom</em>, but want a bit more meat on the bone. With a more varied cast and the Infinity Gem mechanic to deal with, things aren’t as straightforward as they initially seem. This means there is a little more to dig into while staying in a 1v1 fighting game format. The ‘auto-guard’ beginner-friendly mode from <em>Children of the Atom</em> also returns, although this time it limits you to only three Arcade Mode battles if you select it.</p><h3 id="h5956"><a id=""></a>Coolest Characters</h3><p>Wolverine, Spider-Man, Iron Man and Magneto</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f2adebe62163dfbf98ae141bbe51eb8f" data-recommend-id="image://f2adebe62163dfbf98ae141bbe51eb8f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f2adebe62163dfbf98ae141bbe51eb8f" data-recommend-id="image://f2adebe62163dfbf98ae141bbe51eb8f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p> The precursor to <em>MvC</em>, this is when things really started to kick off. The first tag game and the first crossover game in the series, it paved the way for what would come later, although it left behind the greater universe reflected in Marvel Super Heroes, focusing on only the X-Men side. </p><figure id="" data-id="ef7eb4a5784d1a321073968e12106e6e" data-recommend-id="image://ef7eb4a5784d1a321073968e12106e6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Human Cannon stamps on Lil Bo Peep." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Human Cannon stamps on Lil Bo Peep." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ef7eb4a5784d1a321073968e12106e6e" data-recommend-id="image://ef7eb4a5784d1a321073968e12106e6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Human Cannon stamps on Lil Bo Peep." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> It also made some key changes to the Capcom characters, compared to their <em>Street Fighter</em> counterparts. Ryu and Ken are very similar, however Ryu has larger fireballs and he can throw them horizontally in the air. If that sounds like Akuma to you, just wait, because not only did they give Akuma’s diagonal air fireball to Ken, but scrolling off the upper edge of the character select screen reveals a hidden character; Akuma himself. </p><p>  <em>X-Men Vs. Street Fighter</em> is great if you want to experience a solid, but basic, tag fighting game. It still controls like the earlier games in the series, but this time you’ll control two characters. What makes it great as a ‘beginner’ tag game? Instead of also having to learn how to use Assist attacks from your off-screen character, all you need to do is switch your injured character out when they have taken damage, letting them heal off-screen before you switch back to them. Interestingly, this means it’s also the closest gameplay equivalent to the most recent<em> MvC</em> entry, <em>Marvel Vs. Capcom: Infinite</em>, a very fun game in its own right.</p><h3 id="h5957"><a id=""></a>Coolest Characters</h3><p> Storm, Magneto, Wolverine, Sabretooth, and (of course) hidden character Akuma.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="af3f9e227ebc589ed522c219298c269f" data-recommend-id="image://af3f9e227ebc589ed522c219298c269f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="af3f9e227ebc589ed522c219298c269f" data-recommend-id="image://af3f9e227ebc589ed522c219298c269f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p> This is where the <em>Marvel Vs. Capcom</em> formula truly takes shape for the first time, so it makes perfect sense that—especially if you want to dip your toes into the series before it demands learning three characters—<em>Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter</em> is a great place to start. Characters are very similar to the later <em>MvC</em>, but you only have two per team. This also means things are a bit less hectic and easier to keep track of. </p><figure id="" data-id="b034c2f747376aa0829ab3e134fc6c05" data-recommend-id="image://b034c2f747376aa0829ab3e134fc6c05" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Princess Clara punches and kicks The Human Tree." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Princess Clara punches and kicks The Human Tree." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b034c2f747376aa0829ab3e134fc6c05" data-recommend-id="image://b034c2f747376aa0829ab3e134fc6c05" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Princess Clara punches and kicks The Human Tree." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> The final missing piece of the <em>MvC</em> formula, added in this entry, is the Assist. Press Medium Punch and Medium Kick to summon your off-screen teammate to perform their assist attack. With a broad range of abilities, and the option to do simultaneous supers with both team members at once, this entry in the series lets players set up some of the grimy and oppressive situations the series would later become known for, even if it does tone down some things, like infinites from <em>X-Men Vs. Street Fighter</em>. </p><h3 id="h5958"><a id=""></a>Coolest Characters</h3><p> Sakura, Blackheart, Shuma-Gorath (and don’t forget about the six powerful hidden characters).</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="65e2c3233fc6b37d948c33079822c44b" data-recommend-id="image://65e2c3233fc6b37d948c33079822c44b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="65e2c3233fc6b37d948c33079822c44b" data-recommend-id="image://65e2c3233fc6b37d948c33079822c44b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p> The previous game, <em>Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter</em>, broadened the versus series to encompass both X-Men and characters from the greater Marvel universe. With <em>Marvel Vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes</em>, it was finally time to do the same for <em>Street Fighter</em> and Capcom, with representation from Strider, Mega Man, Darkstalkers, and more. Even if your favorite character isn’t on the main roster, they likely appear as a Special Partner, the name for the assist mechanic in <em>MvC1</em>. </p><figure id="" data-id="9017da1082f0e4771eb26a05723f2bcc" data-recommend-id="image://9017da1082f0e4771eb26a05723f2bcc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Pokémon and Power Range take on the force of The Twirler and his legendary ribbon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Pokémon and Power Range take on the force of The Twirler and his legendary ribbon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9017da1082f0e4771eb26a05723f2bcc" data-recommend-id="image://9017da1082f0e4771eb26a05723f2bcc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Pokémon and Power Range take on the force of The Twirler and his legendary ribbon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h5959"><a id=""></a>Coolest Characters</h3><p>Strider, Captain Commando, Venom, Gambit (and the five hidden characters)</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="781846c3546020ecc17ae40b70cf55bf" data-recommend-id="image://781846c3546020ecc17ae40b70cf55bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="781846c3546020ecc17ae40b70cf55bf" data-recommend-id="image://781846c3546020ecc17ae40b70cf55bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p> The classic. The gold standard for beautiful nonsense. The reason people were so excited this collection was announced.

This entry also got rid of the dedicated ‘assist’ character list, opting to add three assists to each playable character, and letting you choose which type of assist you wanted them to use. Now you need to think about more than just withdrawing wounded characters so they can heal: You’ll need to consider which assists you’ll have backing you up if you momentarily retreat. </p><h3 id="h5960"><a id=""></a>Coolest Characters</h3><p> Sentinel, Cable, Dr. Doom, Strider (but there is tons of fun to be had with loads of characters in this game) </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="52a77b000fd0647a6ecd0a824d834837" data-recommend-id="image://52a77b000fd0647a6ecd0a824d834837" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="52a77b000fd0647a6ecd0a824d834837" data-recommend-id="image://52a77b000fd0647a6ecd0a824d834837" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player select screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p> One of these things is not like the other, and this time, it’s <em>The Punisher</em>.

<ul>
<li>Added ability to Save Custom Audibles across all modes.
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Dev Note</strong>: As you change audibles in your formation at play call, they will save automatically and will not change from game to game. You will be able to do this for up to 32 playbooks. To change audibles, press LT/L2 after choosing a formation in playcall.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Tuned Wear and Tear to slow down the accrual rate.</li>



<li>Fixed a kickoff exploit where players could cause the ball to not be caught by the receiving team.
<ul>
<li><em>Dev Note: We will continue to monitor feedback on this fix and will make further changes if necessary.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Fixed an issue with Smart Routed Custom Stems which resulted with a Speed Boost off the line at the snap.</li>



<li>Slight Composure tuning to increase the impact to attributes when getting hot or cold.</li>



<li>Several Zone Coverage AI improvements:
<ul>
<li>Addressed an issue preventing the Curl Flat zone depth coach adjustment from working properly when set at less than 15 yards.</li>



<li>Addressed an issue causing Curl Flat defenders to continue to drift away from an eligible receiving threat in close proximity.</li>



<li>Addressed an issue causing outside Deep Third defenders to bail too quickly from their alignment at the snap.</li>

Preorders for all products begin September 26 and will be released on November 21.</p><p>The PS5 Pro bundle is likely the most limited edition, with only 12,300 units available worldwide. The bundle comes with the PS5 Pro itself, a vertical stand, a charging station, and the DualSense Edge controller and case, all in the classic PlayStation style. It also comes with an original PlayStation controller style cable connector, four cable ties styled after the sacred symbols, and a sticker, poster, and paperclip.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The other console available is a PlayStation 5 Slim Digital Edition but it does come with a matching disc drive cover for those wanting to use discs on the retro themed console (but the disc drive still needs bought separately). It also comes with a regular DualSense controller, vertical stand, and the original PlayStation controller style cable connector, four cable ties styled after the sacred symbols, sticker, poster, and paperclip.</p><p>Sony didn't share a price for any items in the collection, but fans not looking to drop a ton of money will be relieved to know the DualSense controller will be available separately, alongside the DualSense Edge.</p><p>Preorders will be available through PlayStation Direct on the aforementioned September 26 date to those with a PlayStation Network account, according to the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/19/celebrating-30-years-of-playstation-with-a-nostalgic-look/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>.

                <p>Almost everyone's experience in the Dragon Age games varies depending upon the choices they make while playing them. And according to BioWare, the team behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-feels-like-bioware-at-its-most-confident/1100-6526566/" data-ref-id="1100-6526566">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> wants to honor the choices made by players in the previous titles by not being tied down to only one official continuity.</p><p>Creative director Jon Epler told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard-devs-try-to-avoid-the-idea-of-there-being-a-single-canon-and-theyd-rather-ignore-your-choices-in-the-previous-rpgs-than-undo-them" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> that as far as BioWare is concerned, the studio wants to "avoid the idea of there being a single canon" in the Dragon Age games. He added, that "if we don't feel we can do something respectful of the choice you made we oftentimes just don't necessarily reference it... We never want you to feel like your world state is being invalidated."</p><p>Since The Veilguard takes place roughly a decade after Dragon Age: Inquisition, one of the ways that BioWare addressed the issue was by setting the sequel in a different part of Thedas. Epler noted that the key to juggling the multiple-canon approach was by never directly contracting the decisions made by the players in the older games.</p><p>"We may not always reference your choice, because it may not have an actual impact on the story that you're telling right now," said Epler. "But we're never going to be like 'and that thing you did never happened.'"</p><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard will be released on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on October 31.</p>

For those looking to keep active inside as the weather gets colder, another bundle option is available featuring a vanilla Nintendo Switch with the classic Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy-Con. This will have Nintendo Switch Sports pre-installed, a Leg Strap accessory, plus 12 months of Nintendo Switch Online.

These bundles differ from those announced by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> this week, which feature <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> - the console's most popular game - with either a vanilla Switch or a Switch OLED.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's online store has the Switch Lite Animal Crossing bundle priced at £200 - meaning you effectively get the game and Switch Online membership at no extra cost. 
</p>
<p>
It's the same with the Switch Sports bundle, which Nintendo's online store is selling for £260 - the same price as a standard vanilla Switch. 
</p>
<p>
With <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-now-q1-2025-report">Switch 2 set for a 2025 launch</a>, these bundles will likely help shift hardware for Nintendo as the company prepares for the Switch 1's last Christmas. Do you know anyone without a Switch yet?
