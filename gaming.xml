              <p>We’re cruising right toward the the end of 2025 which means we’re in the thick of the holiday season and we’ve got lots of gift shopping to take care of. You can hold out until Black Friday or Cyber Monday in order to saver some cash, but right now, if you know where to look, you can find some pretty lucrative deals ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>For instance, Amazon has the popular portable power station — the Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 — currently on sale for 55% off: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5383/">1500W AC battery normally goes for $839 and this discount brings it down to just $386</a>. This bundle also includes an AC cable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5383/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This is a great product to keep on hand in the back or your car or in your garage in the event of an emergency. You find yourself without power, perhaps during a thunderstorm causing a blackout, you can rely on this backup battery to keep your phones charged or to power important appliances.</p>
<p>On the subject of charging phones, the Jackery Explorer 1000 vs power station is capable of refueling your mobile devices up to 7.5 times faster the first generation model. With its six ports, you can even keep six different devices charged at once. This way, everyone in the family is covered in an emergency.</p>
<p>The six ports include<strong> three standard outlets which provide AC 1500W pure sine wave power</strong>. Then we have two USB-C ports, one able to produce 100W while the other does 30W. Then there’s the USB-A port capable of 18W.</p>



<h2>Fast-Charging</h2>
<p>When it comes time to actually recharging the Jackery power station itself, charging with standard settings will have it back up to capacity from zero in just 1,7 hours. If you need something a little faster than the default mode, you can actually set it to emergency super charging mode using the companion app on your phone. On this setting, the Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 is able to get back up to 100% in just one hour.</p>
<p>Perhaps you don’t need it charged super fast and you’re more concerned about the noise it’s making. Set it to quiet charging mode which will bring it down to barely 22dB, letting it slowly recharge over five hours. You can also choose to purchase the optional solar panels which open you up to even more charging options. The panels can be used to recharge it in just three hours.</p>
<p>The battery is built to last. The Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 will be able to provide you with roughly 4,000 cycles of recharging in its life. This is estimated to work out to about 10 years of use.</p>

                <p>Skydance Games is once again pushing back its upcoming action game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra/">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>--although it hasn't given any new details about when to expect the game, except "beyond early 2026."</p><p>The publisher announced the delay on its Twitter. "Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is an ambitious project, and we are committed to ensuring it meets the level of quality that our team, players, and fans expect," the announcement reads.</p><p>To that end, Skydance Games, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed/1100-6531490/" data-ref-id="1100-6531490">already delayed the game</a> to early 2026, has announced that it is once again pushing the date beyond that window.</p><p>You can read the full statement below:</p><p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is the first game from Skydance New Media, a developer founded in 2019 by the similarly named film studio. Amy Hennig, of Uncharted fame, is the studio's president and is leading development on the title as well, which puts players in the shoes of four playable characters, including Black Panther and Captain America, as well as a Gabriel Jones, a member of the Howling Commandos, and Nanali, a Wakandan spy leader.</p><p>As suggested by the game's title, Rise of Hydra is set during World War II in Nazi-occupied Paris, but--in true action-adventure form--the game will span the globe and take players to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-will-be-set-in-occupied-paris-wakanda-and-beyond/1100-6528536/" data-ref-id="1100-6528536">Wakanda and beyond</a>.</p>

The console comes with 256GB of internal storage, but that probably won’t be enough room for your entire digital game library. Thankfully, however, <strong>Samsung’s 512GB P9 microSD Express card</strong> is already on sale for $94.99 ($5 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FT995SPF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> you clip the on-page coupon. The 256GB model is also available on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FT99KCV8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, though only for its MSRP of $54.99.</p><p>The current discount may seem small, but the P9 is already around $20 less expensive than most other 512GB microSD Express cards. The only option that’s cheaper is <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FONN-MICRO-SD-EXPRESS%2F15708762625" rel="sponsored">a card from Onn</a>, Walmart’s house brand, which is available for around $85 but is frequently out of stock. Also, while the Switch 2 is one of the first mainstream gadgets to use a microSD Express card for extra storage, you can pop them into certain cameras, tablets, and drones with a microSD USH-I slot. The P9 offers sequential read speeds of up to 800MB/s, but only gadgets with a microSD Express card slot can take full advantage of the highest speeds.</p><p>As for how far 512GB of storage gets you, well, it depends. The number of digital games that will fit on the P9 is reliant on their size; <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/814762/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a></em> requires 43.4GB of space, while <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/777653/silksong-impressions-team-cherry-metroidvania-sherma-is-cool">Silksong</a></em> only takes up 4.1GB. If having a combined 768GB of storage for games seems like overkill, consider that the Switch 2 version of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade </em>requires a 93GB download.</p><p>Even physical game collectors may end up needing a microSD Express card, as many publishers have opted to release their games on game-key cards. These titles use a physical cartridge to authenticate your copy of the game, but require you to download a digital copy onto your system’s internal storage. There are also plenty of indie games that are only released digitally, or are only released on a cartridge long after their initial launch. Regardless of which types of games you choose, though, it’s better to have more space than you need than have to decide which games to take with you on a trip.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandt Ranj</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/815946/samsung-p9-microsd-express-card-nintendo-switch-2-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-quietly-offloads-the-15-6-inch-yxk-portable-screen-now-going-for-literally-pennies-2000641696</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-quietly-offloads-the-15-6-inch-yxk-portable-screen-now-going-for-literally-pennies.1346440/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A single screen can often feel limiting, especially when you need to work on multiple applications at once or share the display with others. Adding a full-size second monitor isn’t an option for everyone, but you can consider investing in a portable display that offers that extra space without the bulk.</p>
<p>Most portable monitors out there are quite affordable, with prices starting at $50, but we just found a way to grab one for even less. Amazon is currently offering the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5381/">15.6-inch <em>Yxk</em> portable screen for just $39, thanks to a 33% discount off its regular $59 price</a>. If you’ve been looking for a budget-friendly way to upgrade your work or play setup, now is the time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5381/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Consistent Visuals From All Angles</h2>
<p>The display itself measures 15.6 inches, which is the same size as most standard laptops. You’re getting a 1080p Full HD IPS screen with HDR support for clear, vibrant visuals with exceptional color accuracy. The 178-degree viewing angle ensures consistency from all angles, so you will be able to view the content clearly even when you’re not sitting directly in front of the screen. This also makes it easier to share the screen with others, as everyone won’t have to huddle around a single spot uncomfortably.</p>



<p>Long work sessions will no longer be tough on the eyes, thanks to Low Blue Light technology that actively reduces the amount of blue light emitted from the screen. Even better, you can choose between several display modes (mirror, extend, or second screen only) based on what you’re working on. Maybe go for the second screen mode when you need to work on different apps simultaneously, and the mirror mode while presenting! There are also two built-in speakers that make sure audio comes through clearly.</p>
<p>In terms of connectivity, it has two full-function USB-C ports and a Mini HDMI, meaning you can connect it to a range of devices, including laptops, phone, Xbox, PC, etc. The built-in stand makes it easy to set it up literally anywhere, from desk to bed.</p>
<p>Despite the generous size and power, the monitor weighs just 1.43 lbs and is only 0.31 inches thick. It slips into your laptop bag without bulking things up – ready to go where you do! Note that the discount ends soon, so it’s best to snag one for yourself before that happens.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Take-Two Interactive is using some AI tools in areas of its business that aren't creative, but the company is not looking to use those tools to replace any staff, CEO Strauss Zelnick said during Take-Two's November earnings call.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think there are plenty of areas of business where the tools we have rolled out at the enterprise are helping us. We are not either using this as an excuse to, or frankly seeing the opportunity to, reduce headcount," Zelnick said on the call, answering a question about how Take-Two has rolled out AI tools in the non-creative areas of its business. "We are seeing this as an opportunity to take our very talented people and release them from more mundane tasks so they can do more creative and more interesting tasks and we can work better as an organization. But if you said, 'Can you cut your cost profile by 5% tomorrow by using all things AI?' The answer is no."</p><p dir="ltr">Zelnick has previously said in interviews that he thinks the capabilities of generative AI tools are overstated, and that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-doesnt-believe-ai-can-compete-with-grand-theft-auto/1100-6535814/">AI can't replace games made by humans like Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. During the earnings call, he clarified those comments somewhat, but he also reiterated that he thinks AI can potentially be a useful tool in game development in the future, if "properly deployed."</p><p dir="ltr">"To be clear, I didn't say that I don't see it as a positive," Zelnick said. "What I said was that AI is based on backward-looking data sets meeting compute, meeting LLMs, and none of that replaces forward-looking genius. That's not an opinion, that's factual. I defy anyone to controvert those facts.</p><p dir="ltr">"Of course, technology drives a lot of what we do here. Now, creativity is our lifeblood, but how do we express our creativity? We do so with computers, with technical tools. We always have. So as toolsets improve, we can become more efficient, we can become more effective. And our creative people, therefore, are freed up to be more creative. So AI, depending on how you define it, and properly deployed, of course is positive for creativity, and therefore is, of course, positive for game creation."</p><p>Zelnick's comments that AI won't lead to layoffs at Take-Two come in contrast to other executives. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/">Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/">Microsoft's Brad Smith</a> have both said that AI advancements will lead to job losses in the short term, though they claim AI will eventually lead to higher employment rates.</p>

                <p>Major League Baseball wrapped up its 2025 season last week, and now, Sony San Diego Studios is looking ahead to the 13th iteration of MLB The Show. As expected, MLB The Show 26 is in development and the team behind the game is pulling the curtain back on a few of the features that will be included.</p><p>Sony shared the MLB The Show 26 details on <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/06/goal-setting-mlb-the-show-26/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official PlayStation blog</a>. Next year's game will introduce Road To The Show's high school and college modes, as well as a focus on players' mid-to-late careers. Meanwhile, Diamond Dynasty is adding two new experiences, Diamond Quest and Weekend Classic. However, the team didn't elaborate on what those experiences entail.</p><p>Franchise mode has been adjusted to be "more strategic and rewarding" in the offseason, with no further details in that area. Some of the subtle changes to the game include new animations and a revamped throw meter. The popular Negro Leagues storylines will continue with Season 4, which will once again revisit some of the players whose achievements were overlooked for decades.</p><p>Players who want to get an early start on next year's game can earn up to 26 The Show packs by playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mlb-the-show-25/" data-ref-id="5000-660215">MLB The Show 25</a>. Earning a Now &amp; Later pack in 25 will allow players to redeem a Show pack when 26 is released by signing into the title with the same account they used for the previous game</p><p>Fans who sign up for The Show's <a href="https://account.theshow.com/scoutingreport" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Scouting Report</a> by November 15 will earn five Now &amp; Later packs. On November 21, Now &amp; Later packs will be available to earn in MLB The Show 25 in the 11th Inning XP path. By early 2026, there will be a dedicated Now &amp; Later program in the game.</p><p>Sony hasn't set a date for MLB The Show 26, but the yearly editions traditionally arrive in March.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Have you heard the news? <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> has been delayed again</a>. The open-world crime simulator is no longer releasing in May 2026 and will now instead launch in November 2026. So why the delay? According to Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick, it’s because Rockstar Games is seeking “perfection” and the studio’s Metacritic track record is proof that this strategy works.</p> <p>During a November 6 earnings call, Zelnick, who leads Rockstar parent Company Take-Two, was asked about how the <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-gta6-reaction-news-2000641817"><em>GTA 6</em> delay</a> was affecting the studio and what Rockstar Games was doing at this stage in development. While Zelnick declined to get into the “inner workings” of the developer, he did talk about the company’s culture and focus on making critically acclaimed games.</p>

 <p>“I think the culture of Rockstar [Games] is extraordinary, and we’re all pushing hard to to seek perfection,” said Zelnick during the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251106169372/en/Take-Two-Interactive-Software-Inc.-Reports-Results-for-Fiscal-Second-Quarter-2026">earnings call.</a> Take-Two’s stock <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/06/take-two-gta-vi-delay.html">sank around 7 percent</a> after news of the delay was made public. The CEO then praised how highly rated Rockstar-developed games are on review aggregator Metacritic.</p>

 <p>“I mean, the Metacritic scores of Rockstar releases are, generally, speaking, not generally I mean, with very few exceptions, have been over 95,” explained Zelnick.&nbsp; “<em>GTA V</em>, as you know, has been the standard bearer, not just for our company, but for the industry through three console generations, and to this day, is still, I would argue, the most technologically advanced title in the marketplace, despite [being more than a] decade old, and that doesn’t happen by accident.”</p>

 <p>I’d quibble a bit here and point out that only seven of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/company/rockstar-games/?sort-options=score">Rockstar’s video game releases have hit 95 and only 4 got a higher score on Metacritic</a>, with most landing in the high 80s and low 90s. But there’s no denying that over the last 15 years Rockstar Games has mostly produced critically acclaimed blockbusters like <em>Red Dead Redemption, GTA V, and Red Dead Redemption II.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p>Zelnick added that Rockstar and all of Take-Two’s studios are focused on “seeking excellence, teamwork and kindness.” Not sure how reported efforts at union busting factor into that, but it’s a nice sentiment.</p> <p>Of course, the problem is that with each passing year and each delay, the expectations for <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> grow and grow. The video game industry isn’t standing still and waiting for Rockstar to make the next big open-world masterpiece. The genre has continued to evolve thanks to games like <em>Elden Ring, Kingdom Come Deliverance, Far Cry, Tears of the Kingdom, Death Stranding 2, Forza Horizon 5,</em> and others. What people expect from a big, AAA open-world video game has changed a lot since 2013’s <em>GTA V</em> and 2019’s<em> Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. Will Rockstar’s pursuit of “perfection” make it harder for the studio to keep up with the rest of the industry, leading to a game that feels dated? Or will the studio innovate and help reshape the genre it practically created? We’ll find out in November 2026. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-date-delay-ceo-strauss-zelnick-2000641798">Probably. Maybe. We’ll see.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Corded, heavy, and noisy vacuum cleaners should really be a thing of the past by now. If you’re still dragging one of these around every morning, wondering who ever said cleaning was therapeutic, it’s probably time for an upgrade.</p>
<p>Dyson has some of the best options out there, and right now, one of its latest models just hit its lowest price ever. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5380/">Dyson V9 Motorbar vacuum cleaner is now going for just $269 on Amazon, after a massive 55% discount</a>. It comes with multiple attachments to tackle different spaces, and does its job without waking the whole house up. This early Black Friday deal is available to both Prime and non-Prime members, but it ends soon. Get your orders in before the price goes back up to $599, or the stock runs out for good.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5380/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Cleans Multiple Surfaces Like a Pro</h2>
<p>This vacuum is Dyson’s most lightweight model yet, meaning you won’t be left with sore arms after a session. It comes with a whole set of attachments that include a crevice tool, a hair screw tool, a Motorbar cleaner head, and a combination tool; one for every type of surface and mess. The Motorbar cleaner head automatically adjusts to different floor types and is built to de-tangle hair as it cleans. <strong>V9’s high-velocity motor spins at up to 120,000rpm to generate up to 100 Air Watts</strong> of powerful suction, so expect it to handle even the most stubborn dirt and debris like a pro.</p>



<p>You can choose between three cleaning modes based on what you’re tackling; Eco, Med, and Boost. A <strong>single charge gets you up to 40 minutes of runtime</strong>&nbsp;which is enough to sweep through a couple of rooms, plus the living area. There’s a bright LCD screen on top that keeps you in the loop about remaining run time, current power mode, filter maintenance reminders, etc.</p>
<p>Best of all, the <strong>vacuum easily converts into a handheld</strong> for when you need to clean stairs, car seats, upholstery, etc. Once you’re done cleaning, simply press the eject button to empty the dirt into the bin. Then, you can drop it into the wall-mounted charging dock, and it will be ready for the next cleaning session in no time!</p>
<p>This is the lowest price we have seen this new model drop to. On a regular day, it would run you around $599, but you can grab it for $269 if you’re quick.</p>

In the aptly-titled Celeste's Journal quest in Arc Raiders, you'll need to visit two separate locations on opposite ends of the Dam Battlegrounds map to collect this trader's possessions, so strap in for quite a raid.</p><p>If you want to make things easier on yourself for Celeste's Journals, you'll want to equip an augment with a safe pocket, as you'll need to extract with both of the journals and return to Speranza to complete this quest.

            <p>Hi everyone, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> has been delayed again. It's now set to arrive on November 19th, 2026, about half a year on from the May 26th date it'd landed on following its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-has-been-delayed-even-though-take-two-boss-kept-telling-everyone-it-wouldnt-be">last delay</a>. November 19th, 2026 will apparently be a Thursday, just in case you were wondering.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This latest delay was announced by Take-Two and Rockstar as part of the former's latest financial report. "We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve," reads a tweet from Rockstar. The tweet begins "hi everyone", which isn't funny, but my evening brain's finding it so, mainly because it makes the post read a bit like a substitute teacher announcing that the regular teacher's stuck in traffic until November 19th, 2026, so can you all please react to that news without erupting into complete anarchy.</p>
<p>Anyway, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick spoken to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">IGN</a> about the delay, which sees the much-hyped crime/love game slip a whole year from its original autumn 2025 release goal. "Rockstar has our full support of course, and we are confident they will deliver an unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience," he said. Asked what's changed since he said he was confident in that original 2025 goal, the exec added: "It’s- it's all of 2025. We’ve had more time to develop the title. And so we are getting closer to the release. We are grateful that it is still within the same fiscal year. And mostly we’re grateful to Rockstar for constantly seeking perfection."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>Grand Theft Auto VI will now release on Thursday, November 19, 2026.</p><p>We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and… <a href="https://t.co/yLX9KIiDzX">pic.twitter.com/yLX9KIiDzX</a></p></div>— Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1986540361011880167?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>He's also chatted with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again?r=52dp8y&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true">The Game Business</a>. In that discussion Zelnick stressed that Take-Two "feel really good" about the new date, adding that even though it's a year away, the company's date setting's "not that far in advance if you look at when you need to deliver a game to get it out". In the meantime, the exec said, Rockstar'll keep on plugging with GTA Online so people can get their crime/not as much love fix.</p><p>So, there you go. This latest delay comes on a day which has seen protests outside of Take-Two's London offices and Rockstar North's Edinburgh HQ in response to the studio firing around 30 UK-based workers for "gross misconduct", as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-rockstar-accuse-fired-staff-of-leaking-secrets-unions-launch-street-protests-against-publisher-take-two">Edwin reported</a>. The IWGB Union have claimed that this was done as retaliation against an attempt to unionise, while Rockstar have since asserted that the fired staff shared "confidential information on a public forum".</p>

              <p><em>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</em> stars Captain America and Black Panther during World War II and is written by Amy Hennig, one of the masterminds behind the <em>Uncharted g</em>ames. It’s also not coming out anytime soon. It’s been delayed again and doesn’t have a new release window this time.</p> <p>“<em>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</em> is an ambitious project, and we are committed to ensuring it meets the level of quality that our team, players, and fans expect,” Skydance Games announced <a href="https://twitter.com/SkydanceGames/status/1986539089164972440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1986539089164972440%7Ctwgr%5E56ccbf8232d563aa478d6ce3a863eaaa720620aa%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost-new.php">on X</a> on Thursday while everyone was preoccupied <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787">with other game delay news</a>. “To fully realize our vision for <em>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</em>, we’ve made the decision to shift our release window beyond early 2026.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Important update regarding MARVEL 1943: Rise of Hydra. <a href="https://t.co/y3WRSjVmds">pic.twitter.com/y3WRSjVmds</a></p> <p>— Skydance Games (@SkydanceGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/SkydanceGames/status/1986539089164972440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Rise of Hydra</em> was originally supposed to ship in holiday 2025. Then in May of this year, Skydance <a href="https://x.com/SkydanceGames/status/1922275645402337325">announced it would be pushed back</a> to early 2026 so the team could add more “polish.” At this point it seems like there’s more than just additional polish that’s needed.</p>

 <p>For anyone who hasn’t been following the project, <em>Rise of Hydra</em> takes place in Occupied Paris and is based on the limited comic book series <em>Captain America/Black Panther: Flags of Our Fathers</em>. The action-adventure sports a team-up between Steve Rogers, Azzuri, Howling Commandos member Gabriel Jones, and Wakandan spy chief Nanali.</p>

  <p>The game was first confirmed back in 2021, teased at the D23 Expo in 2022, and finally received a full Unreal Engine 5 trailer in 2024. Skydance has been hyping the cast and the cinematics looked great but we’ve yet to see any real gameplay or get a real sense of the caliber of the game. But it would be cool if a new game Hennig worked on <a href="https://kotaku.com/before-it-was-cancelled-star-wars-1313-was-going-to-be-470003660">finally got to actually come out</a>.</p> <p>It’s also the only <em>Black Panther</em> game we’re likely to get for some time. EA <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-panther-ea-cliffhanger-monolith-productions-1851782787">canceled its own</a> and shut down the studio making it. Things were very different when <em>Rise of Hydra</em> was first greenlit as well. Hopefully it arrives before too much longer. Just maybe not during fall 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new update from Battlefield 6 developers reveals that bots are being reintroduced to Verified Experiences. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6 developers have been addressing bots across various modes in their title since the game’s launch. The lead producer recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-bots-system-explained-by-lead-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explained</a> how the bot system works in BF6, the criteria that need to be met, and how they can help the situation. Now, a new update reveals that bots will be returning for their community experiences.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-bots-will-grant-reduced-xp-and-each-game-mode-supports-12-of-them">Battlefield 6 Bots Will Grant Reduced XP and Each Game Mode Supports 12 of Them</h2>



<p>The latest update regarding bots returning to Battlefield 6’s Verified Experiences was shared through an official post from the BattlefieldComms <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1986550835615027359" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter). <span>The developers had&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1981556746482307086" target="_blank">temporarily removed</a>&nbsp;bots from Verified Experiences to support healthier matchmaking in their Community Servers and Portal Experiences update last month,</span> and are now reintroducing them to Conquest, Breakthrough, and Rush. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The post explains that each game mode will support up to 12 bots. If bot backfill is enabled, matches will require eight players to start, with up to 6 bots filling each team. If backfill is not enabled, you will need 20 players to start the match. </p>



<p>Bots will provide reduced XP in BF6, and player XP will remain at 100% (similar values to Multiplayer modes). Moreover, when bots are enabled, players’ statistics, such as hours played, kill/death ratio, and total revives, will not show any gains or losses. The stats system is currently not functioning as intended and is being actively adjusted. Lastly, challenges will remain completable.</p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield 6 players are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-players-turn-off-crossplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">editing game files</a> to turn off matchmaking against ‘overpowered’ aim assist. Additionally, the game has reportedly sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-has-reportedly-sold-over-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 10 million copies</a> across all platforms.

		<p>Perhaps hoping to bury their bad news behind <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/gta-6-has-been-delayed-again-to-november-2026/">the GTA 6 delay</a>, Skydance Games has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a> has been delayed beyond its early 2026 window and has no new release date or window.</p>
<p>In a classic apology text image announcement thing – do these have a technical term? – &nbsp;<a href="https://xcancel.com/SkydanceGames/status/1986539089164972440">the team writes</a>:</p>


<p>“At Skydance Games, our goal is to deliver unforgettable, premium games that honor the characters and worlds we’re fortunate to work with. MARVEL 1943: Rise of Hydra is an ambitious project, and we are committed to ensuring it meets the level of quality that our team, players, and fans expect.</p>
<p>“To fully realize our vision for MARVEL 1943: Rise of Hydra, we’ve made the decision to shift our release window beyond early 2026.</p>
<p>“We’re grateful for the passion and support from the community and players around the world. The team is working hard to create something truly special, and we look forward to sharing more with you as development progresses.”</p>

<p>It’s another significant setback to the Amy Hennig-led superhero game. Announced in March of last year, after originally been teased in 2021, the initial target was a &nbsp;2025 release… but outside of the cinematic reveal trailer last summer, we’ve heard and seen precious little about this game.</p>
<p>You’ve just got to hope they weren’t planning on a November 2026 release, because… that’d be a bit awkward now, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p>Taking the superhero fight back to World War 2,&nbsp;Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra will have four playable characters with the perspectives switching between Captain America, Black Panther, Nanali, and Gabriel Jones. This will give different gameplay aspects too, with Nanali likely having much more sneaking and spying compared to the other characters.</p>
<p>The cast for the game includes Khary Payton as Azzuri, T’Challa’s grandfather and the Black Panther in this game’s timeline, Drew Moerlein taking on the role of Steve Rogers/Captain America, Megalyn Echikunwoke portraying Nanali, a Wakandan spy, Marque Richardson lending his voice to Gabriel Jones, a member of the Howling Commandos, Lyne Renée voicing Julie, a member of the French Resistance, and Howard Stark, Tony Stark’s father, is being voiced by Joel Johnstone.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-announces-more-layoffs-as-part-of-us-and-europe-restructuring/">VGC broke the news</a> earlier today and reports that Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu held a video call to staff outside of Japan — including Europe, the UK, and the US — to tell employees that a "fundamental restructuring of the overseas publishing organization" will be taking place.</p>
<p>This will involve staff losing their jobs and those that remain will also be required to be present in the office more often. Employees are being told the news today, and staff have already shared posts on social media announcing their departures.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-undergoes-mass-layoffs-as-it-reorganizes-to-consolidate-development-in-japan">IGN</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-06/square-enix-lays-off-staff-in-global-restructuring?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MjQ1ODk3NCwiZXhwIjoxNzYzMDYzNzc0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNUJMWDNHUEw0MjkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.8hIi4eIEjJGIFf5pODYhOL8-J_P1II2FnRzzFRYs6BY&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a> have also corroborated this information, with today's <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf">progress report</a> stating that the restructuring "Implementation of structural reforms in overseas publishing organizations to further strengthen global publishing capabilities and improve operational efficiency".</p>
<p>According to the Progress Report (linked above), the Overseas Structural Reform is expected to save around 3 billion yen, or around USD $19.6 million.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Square Enix told both Bloomberg and IGN that the decision to make cuts and layoffs was "extremely difficult" though declined to tell the outlet how many jobs this will hit. According to IGN, around 137 jobs are potentially affected in the UK.</p>
<p>The company "extend[s] our heartfelt gratitude" to those affected and that "During this period of transition, we remain committed to treating each individual with the utmost respect and providing extensive support throughout this process."</p>
<p>This news follows the news <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/square-enix-aims-to-automate-70percent-of-qa-with-generative-ai-by-2027">that Square Enix hopes</a> to "Automate 70% of QA and debugging tasks in game development by the end of 2027" using generative AI. Today's layoffs are reportedly unrelated to that announcement, as per <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m4yebaj5jk2o">Jason Schreier on Bluesky</a>.</p>
<p>But it does come at a time when the video game industry is struggling, and over three years after Square Enix already sold off <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/05/embracer-group-to-acquire-crystal-dynamics-square-enix-montreal-eidos-montreal-plus-ips-for-usd300-million">a number of its international development teams to Embrace Group</a>.</p>
<p>More details are sure to emerge; we wish for all the best for those impacted by today's layoffs.</p>

			<p>Skydance Games and Amy Hennig's upcoming Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra has been delayed once again, and will no longer hit its previously announced early 2026 release window, the studio announced today.</p>



<p>It's the second major game delay to be announced today, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">Grand Theft Auto VI's delay</a> understandably taking up most of the oxygen. Skydance Games even made its announcement five minutes before Rockstar Games' post went live.</p>



<p>In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Skydance Games wrote, "<em>Our goal is to deliver unforgettable, premium games that honor the characters and the worlds we're fortunate to work with. Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is an ambitious project, and we are committed to ensuring it meets the level of quality that our team, players, and fans expect</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>To fully realize our vision for Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra, we've made the decision to shift our release window beyond early 2026. We're grateful for the passion and support from the community and players around the world. The team is working hard to create something truly special, and we look forward to sharing more with you as development progresses</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>We've known that Amy Hennig and Skydance Games have been working on a Marvel project for a while, though its official title <a href="https://wccftech.com/1943-rise-of-hydra-amy-hennig-2025-unreal-engine-5-trailer/">wasn't revealed until March 2024, at which point it was also slated to launch in 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, (shortly after Rockstar first announced GTA VI would launch in May 2026, in fact), Skydance Games confirmed that Rise of Hydra <a href="https://wccftech.com/amy-hennig-and-skydance-games-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-into-2026/">would not make its initially set 2025 release window, and pushed the game to early 2026</a>.</p>



<p>Now, its release window seems to be sometime mid-to-late 2026, though we've been given no more specifics than that. Wherever it lands, it's clear that 2026 is shaping up to be a year for big releases.</p>

While the wait is a little longer, we are incredibly excited for players to experience the sprawling state of Leonida and a return to modern day Vice City.”</p><p>Previously, <em>GTA VI</em> was set to launch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660057/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026">on May 26th, 2026</a>. Before that, Rockstar planned to release the game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23988446/gta-vi-trailer-leaked-vice-city">in 2025</a>. It will be released on PS5 and Xbox Series X / S.</p><p>“When we set a date, we really do believe in it,” Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=4150086&amp;post_id=178213565&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=69bfp&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email">tells <em>The Game Business</em></a>. “We said when we set the last date, if a game requires more polish to be the best possible version of itself, then we will give that game more time.

It’s in the same fiscal year, it happens to be a great release window, and naturally we’re really supportive of Rockstar’s approach.”</p><p><em>GTA VI</em> will take place in Vice City and stars two protagonists, Jason Duval and Lucia Caminos. “Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them,” according to Rockstar’s description of the second trailer for the game, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQRLujxTm3c">which was released in May</a>. “But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a criminal conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida — forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive.” Rockstar’s first <em>GTA VI</em> trailer debuted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdBZY2fkU-0">in late 2023</a>.</p><p>Last week, Rockstar was accused of union busting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/811999/gta-vi-rockstar-games-union-busting">after firing 30 to 40 employees</a>. A Rockstar spokesperson <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/-grand-theft-auto-studio-says-fired-employees-were-leaking-information">told <em>Bloomberg</em></a> that it took action against a “small number of individuals who were found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum” and that “this was in no way related to people’s right to join a union or engage in union activities.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/816005/grand-theft-auto-vi-gta-g-delayed-november-2026]]></content:encoded>

Naturally, some are claiming this delay is a play to distract from those headlines, but I can’t imagine a project of </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto 6</span></i><span>’s scale being delayed solely to draw attention away from something like that. There’s too much riding on it, and the game is already projected to break records.</span></p> <p><span>If </span><i><span>GTA6 </span></i><span>does manage to hit its new November 19 release date, it will have been 13 years between </span><i><span>GTAV</span></i><span>’s launch in 2013 and its follow-up’s arrival. That’s a huge gap, but Rockstar has been supporting </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto Online </span></i><span>in the years between, so it’s not like the series has been dormant all that time. Still, the series did skip a console generation, as the PS4 and Xbox One didn’t get their own </span><i><span>GTA</span></i><span>. They did get a port of </span><i><span>GTAV</span></i><span>, though, and it sold a bajillion copies, too.</span></p>

		<p>Rockstar has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> has been delayed again, and is now coming out on 19th November 2026.</p>
<p>“We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait,” <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/ak3ak31a49a221/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-set-to-launch-november-19-2026">the studio writes</a>, “but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve.</p>


<p>“We want to thank you again for your patience and support. While the wait is a little longer, we are incredibly excited for players to experience the sprawling state of Leonida and a return to modern day Vice City.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">GTA 6</a> had previously been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/02/gta-6-gets-a-release-date-but-its-been-delayed-to-2026/">set for launch on 26th May 2026</a>, and while this was the first firm date that we had for launch from Take Two and Rockstar, it had come after the better part of a year of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/gta-6-targets-late-2025-release-date-as-take-two-narrows-launch-window/">Take Two execs assuring</a>&nbsp;that the game was going to launch in 2025.</p>
<p>The studio has, quite awkwardly, been grabbing headlines for what has been lambasted as “brazen” union busting by leaders of the IWGB union who has been helping to coordinate unionisation efforts among employees. 30-40 employees were let go last week, which <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/rockstar-responds-to-union-busting-accusations-says-fired-employees-were-leakers/">Rockstar has claimed was for disclosing confidential details in a public forum</a>, though this is disputed by the IWGB. This will no doubt rumble on for a while to come.</p>

<p>The last we saw of GTA 6 came in May with the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/06/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-a-second-trailer/">the game’s second trailer</a>:</p>
<p><iframe title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQRLujxTm3c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI will take us all back to Vice City for Rockstar’s latest crime story, featuring Lucia, the series’ first female protagonist, who’s coming fresh out of prison, and Jason, who works with the local drugrunners after quitting the army.</p>
<p>The trailers have shown off the modern day setting in the fictionalised state of Leonida, with a handful of things like social media influence and excesses feeding into the atmosphere, though that won’t stop there being plenty of iconic classic cars and inspirations from the breadth of American culture in the South East of the country and Florida in particular. From packed beaches to going across the swamps on hover craft, and partying at the tops of skyscrapers, there’s also jokes thrown into the trailer about battling crocodiles in back garden swimming pools, “Floridaman” antics – Leonidaman in the game – and plenty more.</p>

			<p>After it was<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/"> initially set to launch on May 26, 2026</a>, Rockstar Games has announced that Grand Theft Auto VI will suffer at least one more delay, as the game gets pushed from May 26, 2026, to November 19, 2026.</p>



<p>The news was announced in a brief post on X (formerly Twitter) from the official Rockstar Games account. No specific reason is cited for the delay; Rockstar just says that it needed the extra time to hit the level of polish and quality it wants.</p>



<p>"<em>Hi everyone,</em>" the post begins. "<em>Grand Theft Auto VI will now release on Thursday, November 19, 2026. We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve</em>."</p>

</div></figure>



<p>In a reply to the post, Rockstar continues, "<em>We want to thank you again for your patience and support. While the wait is a little longer, we are incredibly excited for players to experience the sprawling state of Leonida and a return to modern-day Vice City.</em>"</p>



<p>Earlier this year, when Rockstar announced its May 2026 date, a little more than a year before it would arrive, it seemed like that could be the final delay for the game. Not only had Rockstar called its shot a year out, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-reportedly-had-no-chance-of-releasing-in-2025-for-months-due-in-part-to-a-real-desire-to-avoid-crunch/">but reports had claimed it had no chance of arriving in 2025 anyway</a>. It felt like it was always going to have been a 2026 release, so now that we had a 2026 date, it felt fairly set in stone.</p>



<p>That said, this delay is absolutely not surprising, considering how much time, effort, and money has been poured into Grand Theft Auto VI. Rockstar and Take-Two will settle for absolutely no less than what they deem perfect, and will take all the time it needs to hit that quality bar.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again">The Game Business</a> published shortly after the delay was announced, Take-Two Interactive boss Strauss Zelnick commented on the delay, saying, "<em>When we set a date, we really do believe in it. We said when we set the last date, if a game requires more polish to be the best possible version of itself, then we will give that game more time. And that's exactly what happened</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We feel really good about this release date. It's in the same fiscal year, it happens to be a great release window, and naturally, we're really supportive of Rockstar's approach</em>."</p>

<p>Your gear determines much of your success while playing a game of <i>Arc Raiders</i>, but so do your skills. The game chops up 45 different skills across three trees, with most skills improving your general mobility and speed, as well as your ability to loot.</p> <p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-tips-solo-group-recycle-free-loadout-2000641174">14 Essential Tips For Getting Started In <em>Arc Raiders</em></a></p> <p>But with so many choices, it’s easy to get lost. So let me share with you my thoughts on which skills are most beneficial, based on my 60 hours with the game.</p>

 <p>Keep in mind, however, that I’m primarily a solo player, and my choices have often been made with that in mind. And while I don’t shy away from gunfights, I’m a fan of stealth games, so I’m often sneaking around on maps like Sam Fisher. I’ve also not yet weighed in on which of the skills at the very ends of the skill trees are best. The game is still young, so metas have yet to be solidified. Still, you can’t go wrong with the options I’ve laid out here.</p>

 <h2><span id="skill-tree-basics"></span>Skill tree basics<span></span></h2> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> has a level cap of 75. You get 1 XP per level, which you can invest in a skill tree that covers 45 different skills distributed across three main branches. You can sink multiple points into many of these skills. So, no, you can’t unlock everything in the tree. You also can’t respec easily (you’ll have to wipe your character to do so by completing a project, which requires a ton of loot and has a specific timed window in which to send your character off).</p>

 <h2><span id="10-universally-great-skills-for-(almost)-every-playstyle%e2%80%93solo-or-grouped-up"></span>10 universally great skills for (almost) every playstyle–solo or grouped up<span></span></h2> <p>There are a ton of different ways to play <i>Arc Raiders</i>, with various guns and gadgets to help you live out the fantasy of a sniper, grenadier, shotgunner, or even freerunner.</p> <p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-solo-night-raid-quest-pvp-pve-2000641437">So Much Happens In A Single Hour Of&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em></a></p> <p>Still, there are some skills that will benefit just about anyone. At a minimum, everyone should invest at least one skill point into each of the starting points of each three. For Mobility that’s “Nimble Climber,” which lets you climb and vault faster. For Conditioning that’s “Used to the Weight,” which lets you move faster while wearing heavier shields. And for Survival, “Agile Croucher” lets you move faster while crouching.</p>

 <p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-roadmap-new-map-patch-barricade-2000641734#comments"><em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>Has A Big Roadmap And A New Update But Fans Want Some Things Kept Secret</a></p> <p>You need to buy these skills to progress in their respective trees, but they also should give you a good idea of the general direction each tree will take you. From there, I highly recommend observing what you think your weak points are while playing and what you’d like to improve.</p>

 <p><strong>But from the Mobility tree, everyone should at least snag “Marathon Runner” and “Youthful Lungs”</strong> so you can move and run farther and for longer.</p> <p><strong>From the Survival tree, I recommend everyone at least grab “Looter’s Instincts” and “Silent Scavenger.”</strong> These will help you loot faster and more quietly.</p>

 <p><strong>From the Conditioning tree, I recommend “Gentle Pressure” and “Proficient Pryer.”</strong> These two will combine to make your breaching faster and quieter.</p> <p>Lastly, <strong>everyone should aim to get “Security Breach”</strong> from Survival at some point, as it’s required for looting specific locations.</p> <p>These 10 skills will help you with some of the most consistent activities in <i>Arc Raiders</i>: traveling and looting.</p> <p>In my estimation, the usefulness of every other skill is highly dependent on your play style. For example, something like “Downed but Determined,” found in the Conditioning tree, will let you stay in a down-but-not-out state longer before you get fully knocked out. Personally, I’d rather focus on avoiding being downed and investing skill points into something like “Revitalizing Squat” in Survival, which boosts your stamina regeneration while crouched.</p>

 <p>Again, my playstyle, which is often solo, sees me routinely covering lots of distance, so taking a breather while crouched helps me stay moving–plus, if I’m hunkered down in cover and crouched, I’ll also regenerate stamina faster to get away from whatever bad situation ‘m in.</p> <p>That said, I can still offer some general guidelines for things to consider when selecting your skills based on whether you primarily play solo or in a group.</p> <h2><span id="15-of-the-best-skills-for-solo-players"></span>15 of the best skills for solo players<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641791" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641791"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641791">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>All of these skills should be considered in addition to the universal skills mentioned above. In my opinion, Mobility is perhaps the most important skill category for solo players who often need to get the hell out of a bad situation as fast as possible. <b>Consider investing in these Mobility skills if you’re running on your own</b>:</p>

 <ul> <li><b>Slip and Slide</b> (sliding is already pretty generous, so at least one point should work for a while)</li> <li><b>Sturdy Ankles</b></li> <li><b>Calming Stroll</b> (this ability lets you recover stamina while walking at the same rate as if you were still, making it a great way to recover stamina while still heading toward your destination)</li> <li><b>Effortless Roll</b></li> <li><b>Heroic Leap</b></li> </ul> <p>As you can probably guess, this is leaning toward a more parkour-based build, but I’ve found high Mobility is essential to staying alive when you don’t have backup regardless of how much you intend to move around like a typical <i>Assassin’s Creed </i>protagonist.</p> <p><b>From the Survival tree, I recommend the following skills for solo play:&nbsp;</b></p> <ul> <li><b>Revitalizing Squat</b> (lets you regenerate stamina more quickly while crouched, which can help you make your getaway if you’re hiding from an assailant)</li> <li><b>In-Round Crafting</b></li> <li><b>Good As New</b></li> <li><b>Stubborn Mule </b>(good only if you’re okay pushing your luck and exfiltrating with an encumbered status from carrying so much)</li> <li><b>Three Deep Breaths</b></li> <li><b>Traveling Tinkerer</b></li> </ul> <p>I haven’t unlocked some of these skills myself yet, but they’re likely to be the next ones I grab. Again, everything here maximizes stamina recovery and the ability to get what you need to do faster. And crafting in round is a great way to restock restorative items or make up for a poorly chosen loadout.</p> <p>Lastly, there’s Conditioning. As a CrossFit girl IRL, I’m all about conditioning, but I haven’t found it as useful in <i>Arc Raiders</i> for solo play. But your mileage may vary. <strong>I recommend investing in these Conditioning skills for solo runs:&nbsp;</strong></p>

 <ul> <li><b>Unburdened Roll</b> (if your shield pops, especially unexpectedly, this makes a reflexive roll less burdensome on your Stamina)</li> <li><b>A Little Extra</b></li> <li><b>Loaded Arms</b></li> <li><b>Fight or Flight </b>(you’ll need to grab Blast Born before you can buy this, which I don’t find as useful a skill, but them’s the rules of the tree)</li> </ul> <p>Depending on how you like to play the game, some of these skills might be more useful than others. And I’ve also left out some of the “end game” skills, as well as tips on which skills you should sink the most points into after the initial XP cost. The efficacy of any given skill is highly dependent on your own playstyle–and at that point, competency in this game means you should be making your own judgement calls for certain strategies you prefer. For example, I really like being able to breach something as fast as possible, so I’ve been investing more points into Proficient Pryer. But maybe that’s not as important to you, or, you have someone you play with who’s your group’s designated breacher, and so maybe it makes sense for another person to invest in these skills to round out your group’s abilities.</p> <p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-extraction-virgil-watkins-interview-2000639879">I Asked&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ Design Director If Camping Makes Me A Bad Person</a></p> <p>Speaking of groups, let’s have a look at which skills are going to be the most beneficial for a crew.</p> <h2><span id="4-of-the-best-skills-for-groups"></span>4 of the best skills for groups<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641794" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641794"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641794">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Consider these group skills in addition to the universal skills I mentioned above, as well as some of the skills that are suitable for a solo player–being really fast and quiet makes you effective as a lone wolf, but it also makes you an asset on your team.</p>

 <p>When considering group play, we need to consider what actions are impossible when you’re on your own. Here’s one example: You can’t revive yourself in <i>Arc Raiders</i>! If you get downed near an extraction point, you can still potentially crawl your way to safety, but one of the first benefits of having comrades is that they can get you back on your feet. There are a few skills that help you with staying in the game while you’re in a downed-but-not-out state, so those are essential ones to snag. Let’s break it down for each of the trees.</p> <p><b>For Mobility, one skill makes the most sense for group play: Crawl Before You Walk.</b></p>

 <p>Everything else in this branch makes you faster and ups your stamina capabilities. So invest in those as you deem appropriate. If you think your character is too slow and quick to exhaust, then invest in the general skills I outlined, as well as the ones suitable for solo play. But also consider what role you’re going to play in your group. Maybe you’re the designated medic, carrying more restoratives than other people. If that’s the case, then you probably want to be speedy so you can get to a dying teammate as quickly as possible.</p> <p><b>From the Survival skill tree, grab Traveling Tinkerer if you’re typically in a group.</b> In addition to In-Round crafting, this will help you be the go-to person for crafting supplies Topside.</p>

 <p><b>For Conditioning, I recommend grabbing Downed But Determined and Turtle Crawl</b>. These will increase the amount of time you’re down-but-not-out, thus increasing your chances of getting revived by a teammate.</p> <h2><span id="what%e2%80%99s-in-my-skill-tree"></span>What’s in my skill tree?<span></span></h2> <p>I mostly play solo, and while I’ve purchased a few skills with a “see what happens” philosophy in mind, most of my choices were about making myself faster so that I can more quickly and efficiently get out of bad situations and cross great distances.</p> <p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvp-toxic-betrayal-leaper-2000640905"><em>Arc Raiders</em>: The Sickest, Silliest, And Most Spectacular Moments From The Game So Far</a></p> <p>At level 40, I’ve invested 25 points into Mobility, 9 points into Survival, and 7 into Conditioning. Here’s what my tree looks like:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000641795" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641795"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641795">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>For now, I’m quite happy with my build. In fact, if I froze my build options here, I wager I’d still have a perfectly fun time in the game; I’m fast and I’m hard to kill. (Someone tried again this morning. Didn’t work out for them.)</p> <p>I’d like to be able to craft more items during a game, so Traveling Tinkerer is on my list, as is A Little Extra, which will net me more resources while looting. I’m finding I’ve left behind my reliance on Free Loadouts and instead need to double down on crafting new gear and repairing what I have, so that seems to make the most sense.</p>

<p>Skydance Games’ Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is delayed and will not release in early 2026, according to the company. A new release date has not been announced yet.</p>



<p>If you are a big Marvel fan, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-gameplay-emerges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a> has been on your radar for some time. As a showcase for Unreal Engine, the game brings players to 1943 with Black Panther and Captain America to defeat Hydra. With an all-star cast including The Walking Dead’s Khary Payton and Horizon Forbidden West’s Drew Moerlein, it was set to be not only a graphical marvel, but a fun one with a rich narrative. Unfortunately, it seems fans are going to have to wait until later in 2026 to get their hands on it.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/SkydanceGames/status/1986539089164972440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a tweet from Skydance Games</a>, the company revealed that Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra will not make its planned early 2026 release. Instead, it will launch at an unspecified date, likely still in 2026. According to the developers, the team wants to ensure that the game lives up to the hype. The delay announcement does come at an inconvenient time, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> pushed its release to November 19th, 2026.</p>



<p>We hadn’t seen much of Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra in quite some time. The last update we had about it was from leaked gameplay and screenshots. Unfortunately, the game hasn’t had a new trailer since 2024, which showed off the story. Early 2026 usually lasts from January to March, so the delay could only have been a month or two behind its planned release. We’ll likely hear more in the coming months, but, for now, our adventures with Captain America and Black Panther are on hold.</p>

<p>Activision has just dropped all the details you need to know about Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Zombies Mode ahead of launch. </p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is all set to release next Friday, on November 14, 2025. Ahead of the launch, the developers have been releasing all the necessary information players need before entering this mode. Their latest intel drop tells us all we need to know about BO7 Zombies Mode maps, weapons, Dark Aether equipment, Augments and Research, Perk-A-Colas, Ammo Mods, Field Upgrades, Gobblegums, game modes, Wonder Weapons, Customization, HUD, and Dead Ops Arcade 4.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-zombies-maps-and-main-quest-timing">Black Ops 7 Zombies Maps and Main Quest Timing</h2>



<p>Black Ops 7 Zombies Mode will feature seven maps at launch: Janus Towers Plaza, Vandorn Farm, Blackwater Lake, Ashwood, Exit 115, and Zarya Cosmodrome. Moreover, the main quest in Ashes of the Damned is scheduled to start at 10 AM PT on November 14.</p>

<p>BO7 Zombies mode will let players try out a selection of 30 different primary and melee weapons. Out of these, each of the 28 ranged weapons can be chosen before a Zombies match begins, and it will occupy the first slot in the player’s Zombies Loadout. Between the two melee weapons, players can choose one to occupy the next slot in their loadout.</p>



<p>Each weapon has the ability to be Pack-a-Punched, have its Rarity increased, and an Ammo Mod applied to it, which adds additional destructive power to it. Moreover, every weapon has an optional Weapon Prestige and Weapon Camo Progression, with Military, Special, and Mastery Camos.</p>



<h2 id="h-dark-aether-equipment">Dark Aether Equipment </h2>



<p>Black Ops 7 Zombies mode will also feature a full selection of Tacticals, Lethals, and Support that can be used for pre-match loadout or created at a crafting table. There are player levels and equipment unlock criteria that players will have to meet to make certain Zombies content available to them.
