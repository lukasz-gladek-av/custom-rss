            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I’m looking forward to a weekend filled with a bunch of squad-based shooter action, with the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/09/battlefield-6-review/">Battlefield 6</a>. There’s always a bit of a disconnect between playing shooters for review, where I’m turning on streamer modes to hide user names and being a lone wolf most of the time, and then playing after release where I can join a party and voice chat.</p>
<p>But that’s not all I’ll be playing, because I’ve still got reviews of the daft walking simulator Baby Steps and the UGC dungeon crawler King of Meat to finally wrap up.</p>

<p>It’s been a big jumble of games for <strong>Gamoc</strong> this week, who’s returned to Atomfall: The Red Strain DLC, and had Dreams of Another and Rise of Industry on the go for upcoming reviews. Add some spooky fun times with Phasmophobia, wand waving in Beat Saber and some VR shooty stuff in Synapse, and he’s had a busy gaming week!</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong>, meanwhile, reviewed the decidedly average <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/06/blood-of-mehran-review/">Blood of Mehran</a>, and swiftly went back to Ghost of Yotei to mop up the last few things he needed to grab the platinum trophy! After all that modern gaming, he needed something a bit older, with Dark Void and Spec Ops: The Line – “Dark Void is very average but had some fun ideas though the aerial combat induced some motion sickness. Spec Ops The Line holds up well with the messaging relevant as ever.”</p>


<p>Always finding new beat ’em ups to batter around, <strong>Ade</strong> played the “rogue ’em up” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/09/absolum-review/">Absolum</a>. It’s not perfect, but “It’s a really fun game, well worth a look, even with a few too many issues holding it back from greatness.” To make up for those weaknesses, he also played more Hades 2. And when not playing Absolum with Ade, <strong>Laura</strong> has been ” Hoovering slimes, and solving ghost crimes” in Slime Rancher 2 and Banishers.</p>
<p>With Battlefield 6 on his horizon, <strong>Jim</strong> booted up Battlefield 1 and immediately got his butt kicked. So he played Ghost of Yotei, and has thoroughly enjoyed his time with it – “I dig the freefrom structure which was interestingly a complaint I had about Assassin’s Creed Shadows.”</p>

<p>It was a bunch more Digimon Story Time Stranger for <strong>Jason</strong>, who says it’s up there as his Game of the Year. “Something I didn’t mention in the review is how good the grind is once you hit just before the end game, as you can just hop around in the story grinding and doing side quests.”</p>
<p>And we’ll round things out with <strong>Steve</strong> this week, who’s been enjoying By Sweet Carole’s Gothic Disney vibes, and revisiting Yooka-Replaylee which, aside from the poor title, promises a lot of improvements over the original version. And then, of course, there’s been a ton of Steam Next Fest demos ahead of next week, and a bunch of indie horror games for this time of year!</p>
<p>Now then, what have you been playing?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Build a Rocket Boy's debut title, MindsEye, is likely to finish 2025 <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/metascore/?page=15">as the worst-rated game this year</a> and one of the year's biggest flops. Prior to release, there was plenty of hype around it due to former Grand Theft Auto producer and Build a Rocket Boy founder, Leslie Benzies, leading the charge at the studio alongside Mark Gerhard. But even before the game was out, signs began to appear online that things weren't going well at Build a Rocket Boy.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-debuts-new-mindseye-trailer-showcases-new-gameplay-and-post-launch-roadmap-details/">Negative early previews, combined with a launch trailer that failed to impress</a>, and a lack of information on the game so close to its release, gave players waiting to grab MindsEye misgivings about the game, to say the least. Then, <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-build-a-rocket-boy-chief-executives-have-left-the-studio-a-week-before-mindseye-launches/">two chief executives at Build a Rocket Boy left the studio</a> just two weeks before MindsEye's launch, which came shortly after <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-releases-statement-warning-a-major-day-one-patch-will-be-missing-from-mindseye-physical-copies-after-early-copies-appear-in-the-wild/">physical copies of the game got out into the wild early</a>, and players had begun posting clips of the severe technical issues the game had and its lacking gameplay.</p>



<p>A statement from Build a Rocket Boy claiming a day one patch would solve these issues fell on deaf ears, especially since when that day one patch came, it didn't do what Build a Rocket Boy promised, and the game was still riddled with issues. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-heartbroken-over-the-games-launch-details-patches-coming-throughout-june/">studio released a statement committing to fixing it</a>, saying they were "<em>heartbroken</em>" over the state of the game's launch, while <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-giving-players-refunds-for-mindseye/">PlayStation had begun giving players who purchased the game refunds if they wanted one</a>.</p>



<p>Leslie Benzies <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-ceo-blames-saboteurs-mindseye-struggles/">pointed at internal and external saboteurs for the poor state of the game</a> (which he had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">already done when MindsEye was getting negative previews</a>), but <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/">after mass layoffs were confirmed at the studio</a> and reports that the game's flop could push IO Interactive, the game's publisher and the first game published by the Hitman devs, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-disastrous-launch-io-ionteractive-publishing/">to abandon its publishing arm</a>, former and current Build a Rocket Boy developers have laid the blame for the studio's struggles where it arguably should fall: with its leaders.</p>



<p>The buck has to stop somewhere, usually with the people who have the letters 'CEO' in front of their name, and according to <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/barb-open-letter/">93 former and current Build a Rocket Boy developers in an open letter</a>, that's exactly who is to blame.</p>



<p>"<em>Employees and ex-employees at Build a Rocket Boy (BARB), together with the Game Workers Branch of the Independent Workers of Great Britain (IWGB), are writing to address the longstanding disrespect and mistreatment of your staff</em>," the letter, which is titled 'Open Letter to the Executive Leadership at Build a Rocket Boy', begins.</p>



<p>"<em>For years, you have expected them to adapt to your every whim, with those in disagreement being shut down or cast aside. We estimate a UK-majority of the 250-300 workers across the company have now lost their livelihoods. These layoffs happened because you repeatedly refused to listen to your workforce's years of experience, resulting in one of the worst video game launches this decade.</em>"</p>



<p>The letter goes on to directly call out three key faults in leadership, including "<em>lack of transparency and communication,</em>" "<em>unbearable levels of overtime</em>," and "<em>disastrous handling of redundancies</em>," before continuing that these are just some of the more public faults.</p>



<p>"<em>Our experience at the company has been one of burnout, job insecurity, health issues, and the failure of a game that many of us have put years of our lives into. BARB needs to change. CEOs need to take a backseat and allow the skilled people who remain at the company to forge the path ahead</em>."</p>



<p>The developers also name four demands they have of leadership:</p>



<ol>
<li>A public apology for this mistreatment of employees and proper compensation for laid-off employees</li>



<li>The option for remaining employees on redundancy notice to either work their notice period or take Payment in Lieu of Notice (PILON)</li>



<li>A concerted, meaningful, and documented effort to improve conditions and processes within the company, including the acknowledgement of the IWGB as a trade union</li>



<li>A commitment to use official external partners to action any future redundancies and prevent unfair treatment</li>
</ol>



<p>The developers close off the letter by saying, "<em>Mark Gerhard and Leslie Benzies, you often refer to your employees as 'family.' But we ask you to consider; is this really how you treat your own?</em>"</p>



<p>Way before any of this happened, when Build a Rocket Boy was in its earliest days, Leslie Benzies and the studio's leadership <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-series-former-producers-build-a-rocket-boy-completes-110-million-series-d-fundraising/">secured $110 million in funding for the studio and its debut projects</a>. With Benzies name attached to the studio, and the promise of a new Grand Theft Auto-sized game, there was a lot of excitement around what Build a Rocket Boy could become.</p>



<p>Now, it seems like the only thing it'll become is another failed studio, unless something drastically changes. </p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/tech/797879/fractal-design-scape-pc-gaming-headset</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fractal%E2%80%99s-first-gaming-headset-is-as-refreshingly-elegant-as-its-pc-cases.1321951/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Not many gaming headsets have a Scandinavian minimalist aesthetic, which is why Fractal’s $199.99 Scape caught my eye. Like many of <a href="https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/">Fractal’s PC cases</a>, this headset looks more sophisticated than you might expect from gaming gear, with clean lines and simplistic color schemes that might blend in better with your furniture and desk setup.</p><p>I’ve spent the last few weeks using the Scape at work and while playing games, and it’s among the best that I’ve ever tested in this price range. The fit and finish are impressive for a first-gen device from a company with no lineage in audio hardware. Its sleek design comes in gray or black, with minimal LEDs that add a subtle glow around the bottom edge of the ear cups (these are the first LEDs in a headset I haven’t wanted to immediately switch off). It has a chunkier version of Apple’s Digital Crown on the back of its left ear cup. The knob controls volume and can be clicked to pause and resume content (double- or triple-clicking skips and reverses songs, respectively).</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6Nzk3ODg4"><p><span>$<!-- -->200</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Great sound</li><li>Sleek charging cradle</li><li>Web-based settings customization</li><li>Has a built-in mic for when boom mic is detached</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>No ANC </li><li>Lie-flat ear cups would have been nice</li><li>Can’t do 2.4GHz and Bluetooth concurrently</li></ul></div></div></div><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption><em>The knob is great for small volume adjustments, and to play, pause, or skip tunes.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>This headset features a button on its right ear cup that lets you toggle between three premade audio equalizer settings. It’s great to have these controls on the hardware, not just buried within a companion app. And configuring the Scape feels as elegant as using it. Everything —including customizing those EQ presets — is handled by a web tool called Adjust Pro. It also lets you tweak the mic’s sidetone, adjust the headset’s LED lighting (you can opt for one of 10 tasteful themes, including “campfire,” and “northern lights,” set it to a custom color and pattern, or turn it off), and install firmware updates when needed. You can even download a portable version of the Adjust Pro app that works without installation or an internet connection. It’s all very thoughtfully designed.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption><em>In Adjust Pro, you can select from different lighting themes for the LEDs or turn them off.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>I like that Fractal gives you two mic options. You can use the flexible flip-to-mute boom mic for superior voice quality, or detach it to enable the Scape’s built-in microphone. Not many headsets allow for this level of flexibility, but we’re seeing it on occasion with models built to pass as over-ear headphones in public; SteelSeries’ new $600 Arctis Nova Elite wireless headset is the most recent example. The recording quality from the Scape’s boom is serviceable (the built-in mic is less good, but works in a pinch). Pressing and holding the mute button toggles microphone noise cancellation. I have an oscillating fan going in my office, and the setting mostly tuned it out. You can adjust the amount of sidetone in the web app — the higher the value, the more you’ll be able to hear your own voice (and maybe your breathing, too) through the headset, along with more background noise.</p><p>Fractal advertises over 40 hours of battery life with the RGB lights off, or around 24 hours with them on. Even with them on, the headset had no issue surviving a few full days of work, as well as a weekend full of gaming, before needing a charge. However, battery life wasn’t a concern during most of my testing because the included magnetic charging dock removes almost all of the friction usually involved in charging a headset. (You can also plug the headset in via the included USB-C cable and keep using it as it charges.) The dock also serves as a stand to keep it off your desk, and as an extender for its 2.4GHz audio transmitter.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption><em>The Scape automatically shuts off once placed on the dock, turning back on upon removal.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>The dock or just its transmitter can be used with other devices; I’ve been plugging it into my Switch 2 dock after work. Or you can toggle the switch on the Scape’s left ear cup to switch on Bluetooth (it can’t pipe in audio from both 2.4GHz and Bluetooth sources simultaneously). It supports multipoint over Bluetooth, letting it connect to two devices, but it can’t play audio from both devices simultaneously.</p><p>The Scape’s connectivity isn’t nearly as versatile as some recent headsets, including the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/776006/astro-a20x-headset-switch-ps5-xbox-price-features">$179.99 Astro A20 X</a>, which connects via 2.4GHz to a box that lets you swap between two wired sources with a button, and also has Bluetooth (it can’t mix Bluetooth and its Lightspeed wireless, though). <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/788141/steelseries-arctis-nova-elite-review">SteelSeries’ new $599.99 Nova Elite</a> sets a high bar, lettings you hear up to four wireless audio sources mixed together: three inputs plugged into its base station’s USB-C and aux ports, and one over Bluetooth, including three wireless sources, plus audio coming through its base station’s wired aux port (the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23132836/steelseries-nova-pro-wireless-review-gaming-bluetooth-anc">2021 Nova Pro Wireless</a> can do three wireless sources simultaneously). I’d love to see Fractal expand the number of devices you can listen to at once in the next version of its headset.</p><p>Fractal’s headset delivers better sound quality than I was expecting for its price. Songs and games come through with warmth and a high level of detail. It’s surprisingly competitive to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/757680/sony-inzone-pc-gaming-headset-keyboard-mouse-hands-on">Sony’s $349.99 InZone H9 II</a>, and it handily beats the Astro A20 X . The big difference is that the H9 II has active noise cancellation, while the Scape doesn’t. It’d be great to have ANC here, but I wouldn’t pay the extra $200 just to get ANC, especially since it’d mean giving up the Scape’s sleek design, clever charging dock, and easy customization.</p><p>The Scape stands out as a great-looking, great-sounding headset that’s nearly effortless to customize. While it lacks some features compared to its pricier competition (concurrent multi-source audio, ear cups that lie flat, and ANC would all be nice), Fractal’s first headset leaves little else to be desired at this price.</p><p><em>Photography by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/797879/fractal-design-scape-pc-gaming-headset]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Following the inauspicious launch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> and subsequent layoffs at developers Build A Rocket Boy, 93 current and former staff at the studio have signed an open letter demanding an apology, while accusing Build A Rocket Boy's senior leadership of having "consistently mishandled the redundancy process" and mandating "unbearable levels of overtime" around the game's launch.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/barb-open-letter/">The letter</a> calls out Build A Rocket Boy co-CEO Mark Gerhard and MindsEye director Leslie Benzies by name, and was organised by the <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/">Independent Workers of Great Britain</a> union, who announced that the workers will also file legal claims against the studio. The current and former staff accuse the studio's leadership of "longstanding disrespect and mistreatment" and allege that an estimated 250 to 300 workers have been let go as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mindseye-director-reportedly-says-the-studio-will-relaunch-the-game-as-around-300-staff-are-at-risk-of-being-laid-off">layoffs at Build a Rocket Boy</a> so far. "These layoffs happened because you repeatedly refused to listen to your workforce’s years of experience, resulting in one of the worst video game launches this decade," the letter reads.</p>
<p>It goes on to make specific accusations about a number of issues, including an alleged mishandling of layoffs. "We believe you have consistently mishandled the redundancy process, causing confusion and distress for all staff," the letter reads. "Employees have received misinformation, been handed dismissal notices with the wrong notice periods, and been put in the wrong teams so that their performances were scored by the wrong people. These and other errors have potentially resulted in the wrongful dismissal of dozens of staff members."</p> <div>

<p>Build a Rocket Boy's execs are also accused of having enforced eight hours of mandatory overtime per week for every employee in the four months running up to Mindseye's launch, with staff then allegedly struggling to take back time off in lieu they were granted due to requests for them to keep grinding away at "high-priority" work which continued once the game had launched. A lack of transparency and communication on the part of studio leadership is also cited in the latter.</p><p>"Our experience at the company has been one of burnout, job insecurity, health issues, and the failure of a game that many of us have put years of our lives into," the current and former staff wrote. They call for Build a Rocket Boy to give a public apology, give staff on redundancy notice the option to either work their notice period or take a payment in lieu of notice, commit to using "official external partners" for any future redundancies. "A concerted, meaningful, and documented effort to improve conditions and processes within the company, including the acknowledgement of the IWGB as a trade union," rounds out that list.</p>
<p>I've reached out to Build a Rocket Boy and Mindseye publishers IO Interactive for comment.</p>

              <p>Let’s rewind time for a moment. Remember when cell phones first passed that threshold where they stopped being a luxury and became something that just everyone had? They weren’t smart yet, they were just phones. And for those first several years, each iteration got smaller and smaller. Screens weren’t important. Customers prioritized the convenience of being able to fit your phone in any pocket. They only started trending upwards in size when we started to be able to access the internet, and watch videos. Social media became phone-first in design and manufacturers began making the screens bigger to accommodate a better experience when glued to your screen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4691/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>
<p>Though, the advent of the smartphone has not eliminated the benefits of a smaller device. Some of us still would prefer to have something less intrusive. It might also help us reduce our embarrassingly high screen-times to switch over to a phone that isn’t designed to keep out attention for 24 hours a day. That’s where the NanoPhone shines. It’s on sale over at StackSocial at the moment. It’s already starting as an extremely affordable price relative to other smartphones on the market — $200 — but has come down to less than half that. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4691/">For a limited time, you can snag yourself this mini 4G smartphone for only $90.</a></p>

<h2>The Size of a Credit Card</h2>
<p>The NanoPhone is a fully functional smartphone that comes in an incredible compact form factor Its touchscreen only measures in at three inches across, but it still presents in HD. It weighs under three ounces and can be fit reasonably into your pocket without taking up the whole thing.</p>
<p>The cameras are perfectly serviceable for a phone at this price point. You’d be working with a 5MP lens on the back of the device with a 2MP selfie cameras on front for quick pics and video calls. The phone’s 2,000mAh batter will last your through the day and the phone recharges over the now standard USB-C cable.</p>



<p>This phone supports 4G LTE and data plans with most cellular providers. It’s SIM card-ready right out of the box, able to be set up with Verizon, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and all other US carriers. You can even use it with budget and no-contract service providers including Cricket, Boost, Visible, and Mint.</p>
<p>The phone is running Android 10 so you can use a whole slew of your favorite apps like WhatsApp, Instagram, X (The Everything App), YouTube, and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new announcement by ARC Raiders reveals the Expedition Project, a new way to incorporate optional progression wipes. </p>



<p>ARC Raiders is all set to release on October 30, 2025, and the developers recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-delay-explained-embark-game-not-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> why things went silent at the studio: they had dipped into the PvP pot for the game’s future. Now, they have provided players with new details about the progression wipe system, and that it isn’t mandatory. </p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-expedition-project-makes-wipes-optional">ARC Raiders Expedition Project Makes Wipes Optional </h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/expedition-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lengthy blog post</a> by ARC Raiders design director Virgil, it was revealed how the game will handle progression wipes. The developers had already stated that they do not intend to do mandatory wipes and have stuck to their words. They understand the benefits of global wipes, as they provide experienced players with a fresh game; however, it doesn’t cater to players who don’t have much time to play. </p>



<p>The game features a ‘Projects’ feature that players can access at level 20. The first major project in this section is the Expedition Project, and once players complete it, they can reset their character. After completing a reset, players can do it again by completing another one of these projects. Expedition Project will operate on a roughly 8-week cycle, during which players can make progress towards their project. </p>



<p>Once the 8 weeks are complete, players will have the option to finalize the project for an additional week. If they have fulfilled all the project’s requirements, they can finalise it. If the player’s project isn’t ready during this window, their progress will be retained, and they can continue working on it until the next finalisation window. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-will-be-kept-and-removed-in-arc-raiders-progression-wipes">What Will Be Kept and Removed in ARC Raiders Progression Wipes</h2>



<p>Anything that is related to the character’s progress will be wiped, including levels, skills, items/inventory, workshop, crafting capabilities, etc. Any cosmetics earned or purchased, achievements, rankings, etc., will be retained. “Anything rooted solely in the metagame or involving real money will be preserved.” After completing their Expedition Project, players will be able to skip most of the onboarding and tutorial steps, which include unlocking certain features, maps, etc. </p>



<h2 id="h-benefits-of-completing-expedition-projects">Benefits of Completing Expedition Projects</h2>



<p>Players who complete Expedition Projects in ARC Raiders will receive some benefits and rewards; these are yet to be finalised, but these are the type of rewards players can expect: Permanent account unlocks for each completed Expedition, unique cosmetic rewards for completed Expeditions, account “buffs” that are applied for the duration of the following Expedition cycle, And sequential completions of the Expedition Project increase the magnitude of these buffs, up to a limit.</p>



<p>In other news, here’s why ARC Raiders was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-ban-arc-raiders-black-ops-7-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">censored in Black Ops 7.</a> What are your thoughts on ARC Raiders featuring optional progression wipes?

Wario has thrown a bucket on Mario's head, so it's up to players, controlling a forest fairy, to guide the plumber to safety across 100 levels.

            <p>Developers on the ill-fated action game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> have signed an open letter to developer Build A Rocket Boy's executive leadership, citing "longstanding disrespect and mistreatment" of staff.</p>
<p>The letter has been signed by 93 current and former employees of Build A Rocket Boy, along with the Game Workers Branch of the Independent Workers of Great Britain union.</p>
<p>Following its disastrous launch earlier this year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-developer-reportedly-prepping-for-layoffs-after-botched-launch">studio confirmed the redundancy process had begun</a>. In the open letter, employees claim an estimated 250-300 workers across the company have now lost their livelihoods.</p>

<p>"These layoffs happened because you repeatedly refused to listen to your workforce's years of experience, resulting in one of the worst video game launches this decade," the letter reads.</p>
<p>Complaints from employees include a lack of transparent communication, "unbearable" levels of overtime, and "disastrous handling of redundancies" among others.</p>
<p>"Information has been sparse and vague, with you often making radical changes to the way we worked with little or no input from those affected," the letter reads.</p>
<p>In the four months leading up to launch, a mandatory eight hours of overtime was implemented for every employee. This was given back as time in lieu at a rate of seven hours for every eight worked, but due to "continued requests for extra 'high-priority' work" many employees have not been able to claim this back.</p><p>"We believe you have consistently mishandled the redundancy process, causing confusion and distress for all staff," the letter reads. "Employees have received misinformation, been handed dismissal notices with the wrong notice periods, and been put in the wrong teams so that their performances were scored by the wrong people. These and other errors have potentially resulted in the wrongful dismissal of dozens of staff members."</p>
<p>It continues: "Our experience at the company has been one of burnout, job insecurity, health issues, and the failure of a game that many of us have put years of our lives into. BARB needs to change. CEOs need to take a backseat and allow the skilled people who remain at the company to forge the path ahead."</p>
<p>The employees have made the following demands:</p>
<ul>
<li>A public apology for this mistreatment of employees and proper compensation for laid-off employees</li>
<li>The option for remaining employees on redundancy notice to either work their notice period or take Payment in Lieu of Notice</li>
<li>A concerted, meaningful, and documented effort to improve conditions and processes within the company, including the acknowledgement of the IWGB as a trade union</li>
<li>A commitment to use official external partners to action any future redundancies and prevent unfair treatment</li>
</ul>
<p>The letter concludes: "Mark Gerhard and Leslie Benzies, you often refer to your employees as 'family'. But we ask you to consider: is this really how you treat your own?"</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We stand in solidarity with employees and ex-employees at Build a Rocket Boy as they file legal claims through our union and publish an open letter, condemning the way in which they’ve been mistreated and discarded by the studio’s millionaire executives. <a href="https://t.co/WWm4vxKEfd">https://t.co/WWm4vxKEfd</a> <a href="https://t.co/bOOHaQEakQ">pic.twitter.com/bOOHaQEakQ</a></p>— IWGB Game Workers (@IWGB_GW) <a href="https://twitter.com/IWGB_GW/status/1976622237848658253?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>"The treatment that workers at Build A Rocket Boy have been facing in the past 12 months has been shocking," said IWGB Game Workers chairperson Spring Mcparlin Jones. "They have been routinely belittled, cheated, and manipulated by the company they dedicated years of their lives to. Despite this, they were able to keep trust in each other and work together to fight for fair treatment."</p><p>Scott Alsworth, IWGB Game Workers PR officer, said: "What we've seen at Build A Rocket Boy is the continued normalisation of millionaire executives scapegoating workers for their own mismanagement and profiteering. The sorry financial state the studio now finds itself in is not the work of outside forces or some fifth column of angry trade unionists; it's the unequivocal result of poor leadership, high-level incompetence, and outright contempt. The blame invariably lies with those in charge."</p>
<p>Former BARB employee Isaac Hudd stated the studio has "shown little regard for the wellbeing of its staff" and the disappointing launch was due to a "pattern of poor decisions from senior management". </p>
<p>Ben Newbon, another former employee, added: "The callousness shown by management towards staff at Build A Rocket Boy is truly awful. Even before the disastrous launch of MindsEye, staff had suffered months of crunch, resulting in some horrific mental and even physical illnesses, beyond the typical widespread burnout. Studio leadership have chosen not to take responsibility for the game's failure and instead blamed saboteurs, as if individual employees or online influencers could have caused this. The arrogance of leadership to believe they can act with impunity throughout development and the following redundancies has pushed myself and many former and continuing employees to take a stand.".</p>
<p>Newbon's comments refer to co-CEO Mark Gerhard claiming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">negative reaction to the game was paid for</a> in a "concerted effort" against the studio.</p>
<p>MindsEye was the debut game from Build A Rocket Boy, meant to kickstart the studio's user-generated metaverse Everywhere.</p>
<p>However, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">plagued with technical issues</a> from its launch and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-review">critically panned</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-studio-execs-depart-build-a-rocket-boy-one-week-before-games-debut">Two execs left the studio</a> just one week before the game's debut.</p>
<p>Since its release, the studio promised performance improvements. Yet publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> has distanced itself from the project, with CEO Hakan Abrak claiming the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launch-what-we-didnt-hope-for-says-io-interactive-ceo-as-publishing-future-in-question">company's future as a publisher was now in question</a>.</p>
<p>Lead actor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-actor-feared-he-may-never-work-in-games-again-following-disastrous-launch-but-admits-players-are-entitled-to-their-opinion">Alex Hernandez feared he may never work in games again</a> following the devastating reception to the game.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Build A Rocket Boy for comment on the open letter.</p>

<p>The next game in the nearly 30-year-old Age of Empires franchise is in development, and it will seemingly be using Unreal Engine. That would see the company leave the Essence Engine and Bang Engine, which had been used for Age of Empires 4 and Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition, respectively, behind. </p>



<p>According to multiple job postings on Microsoft’s website, Xbox Game Studios is “hard at work continuing the great legacy of Age of Empires”. As the work continues on the franchise, World’s Edge, the studio behind Age of Empires 4 and the definitive editions of the second and third games, is looking for two positions that specifically call out using Unreal Engine. </p>



<p>The two roles—Pricing Unreal Engineer and Senior Unreal Engineer—require those with <strong>“a background in&nbsp;all aspects of&nbsp;Unreal Engine&nbsp;game&nbsp;development&nbsp;and experience&nbsp;leading external resources.”</strong></p>



<p>No other details on what the future could look like for Age of Empires, but the direction it’s going in, at least when it comes to the tech stack, seems clear. </p>



<p>What do you hope for from the next installment in Age of Empires, seemingly Age of Empires 5?

Right now, Battlefield 6 ranks as the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topselling/global" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 1 best-selling game on Steam</a> in the US and globally.</p><p>"All signs, at least pre-launch, suggest Battlefield is back in the fight. Our estimates reflect a perfect storm of pent-up demand after years of missteps and a huge potential comeback narrative," he said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Glenn Israel has worked on the Halo franchise for 17 years, joining Bungie back in 2008 when the studio was known for Halo, and stayed with the series by following it to 343 Industries (now Halo Studios) where he has been since. He is no longer working on the series that he spent nearly two decades with, however, as he announced with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7379767940897959936/">a statement on his LinkedIn</a> that he has left Halo Studios, though the statement leaves plenty of questions as to the circumstances under which he is leaving.</p>



<p>"<em>As of today and after seventeen long years, I am officially no longer contributing to the Halo universe</em>," Israel wrote. "<em>There is little more I can say for the moment, though I intend to share this particular story in its entirety when it is absolutely safe to do so next year</em>. <em>In the meantime, I have a message for anyone and everyone who needs to hear it</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I know that</em> <em>the state of our industry seems dire but never forget that you are free to choose. No illusion of security nor promise of wealth or fame or power is worth trading away your health, your dignity, your ethics or values - and no one can force you to. Stay strong, take evidence when necessary, and find where you belong. As always, I'll be here if you need to talk</em>."</p>



<p>As Israel mentions, he'll share more about the details of his departure at some point in 2026, but his statement also seems to suggest he's not leaving amicably.</p>



<p>It's no secret that 343 Industries/Halo Studios has had its struggles in the last few years, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-joe-staten-joins-netflix-343-creative-director-frank-oconnor-leaves/">key members of the team leaving</a> before Israel, <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-halo-devs-blame-microsoft-343-industries/">layoffs and allegations towards parent company Microsoft for the studio's internal issues</a>, and fans turning on the studio for decisions <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-halo-devs-blame-microsoft-343-industries/">like leaving behind couch co-op on Halo Infinite</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection-microsotrancation-plans-abandoned/">almost including microtransactions in the Master Chief Collection</a>.</p>



<p>The future of the series has been unclear amidst all of this, particularly since Halo Infinite <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-infinite-team-fell-short-on-post-launch-plan-retrenched-now-booty/">didn't exactly hit its mark at launch</a>. As far as what we know is next for the series, Halo Studios has committed to sharing more at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-studios-whats-next-for-halo-halowc-2025/">Halo World Championships taking place later this month on October 24</a>, which could also be where <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-development-virtuos/">a rumoured remake of Halo Combat Evolved is first revealed</a>.</p>



<p>Whenever Israel is able to share more about his departure, it'll be interesting to see what he touches on and how the changes to the studio and its struggles impacted his decision to leave Halo behind.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-logitech-webcam-works-with-switch-2-and-is-practically-free-compared-to-nintendo%E2%80%99s.1321864/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you had been hoping to snag yourself some cool new tech gadget on sale during Amazon’s Prime Big Deals Days, you’re not out of luck just yet. While the event only extended from October 7 to October 8, some products are still on sale.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4690/"> This Logitech webcam for example is normally listed at $40, but right now has been marked down by 36% off. That ends up saving you $14 as the price comes down to only $26 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>The Logitech Brio 101 is a Full HD 1080p webcam that comes in your choice of either black or white and can be mounted easily on top of your monitor, TV, or laptop screen. The camera utilizes auto-light balance which can on the fly boost brightness and reduce shadows to allow folks you’re on the video call with to see you crystal clear, regardless of the lighting conditions of the room you’re in. Then when no longer in user, the cover slide can be closed over to ensure your privacy when you’re not on a video call.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4690/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The webcam has a built-in microphone so you can cut down on the number of peripherals needed to join and Zoom or Discord call with colleagues, friends, or family. It is also compatible with Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and a number of other video conferencing applications.</p>
<h2>Compatible with Nintendo Switch 2</h2>
<p>Nintendo’s follow-up to the immensely successful Switch saw some of the lightest changes from its predecessor. That’s not a bad thing. Many Nintendo fans just wanted more of the same, just on better performing hardware, though Nintendo can’t help themselves but to squeeze in one or two new gimmicks.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 features all new chat functionality including the ability to have video calls with friends. Some games even support integrating your video feed to the gameplay, super imposing your video onto in-game elements. Nintendo has its own proprietary USB camera and a handful of — but not all — third party cameras support the Nintendo Switch 2. Luckily, the Logitech Brio 101 is one of those that is supported on the Nintendo Switch 2, so you can enjoy gaming and chatting with your friends with a webcam at a fraction of the price Nintendo sells its for.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Camera is listed at $55.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4690/"> The Logitech Brio 101 webcam is usually $40, but with the 36% discount, it comes down to just $24.</a> That’s less than half the price the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera sells for.</p>

              <p><span>When </span><i><span>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</span></i><span> was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-batman-legacy-dark-knight-arkham-new-game-2000618481"><span>revealed at Gamescom earlier this year</span></a><span>, the trailer looked like a blocky version of the </span><i><span>Batman: Arkham </span></i><span>games, which we haven’t gotten a proper sequel to in a decade. Yeah, the name </span><i><span>Arkham</span></i><span> has been slapped on VR spin-offs and mobile apps, but there hasn’t been an honest-to-god open-world </span><i><span>Batman </span></i><span>action game since </span><i><span>Arkham Knight </span></i><span>in 2015. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gotham-knights-batman-batgirl-nightwing-dlc-wb-games-1850378621"><i><span>Gotham Knights</span></i></a> <span>came close, but was weighed down by loot nonsense and a miserable grind. Rocksteady, the developer of the original trilogy, pivoted to the loot shooter </span><i><span>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</span></i><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-justice-league-review-is-it-good-batman-1851222047"><span>which didn’t go over well</span></a><span>. So there’s been a dearth of interesting </span><i><span>Batman </span></i><span>games in recent years, and while I figured it would come to an end at some point, I just expect the next to come from </span><i><span>Lego </span></i><span>developer TT Games.</span></p> <p><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight</span></i><span>’s trailer showed the mini-figure version of the Caped Crusader grappling around Gotham, descending upon unsuspecting baddies, and investigating crime scenes just like he did in games like </span><i><span>Arkham City</span></i><span>. I played about 30 minutes of the game, and even though I hadn’t played any of the </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>games in a decade, my muscle memory kicked in when I was surrounded by a group of minifigure goons and the parry prompt appeared over one of their heads. People joke that </span><i><span>Arkham</span></i><span>’s beat-em-up combat is a rhythm game because every action, whether it be a punch, the swing of a bat, or the firing of a gun, has an equivalent QTE prompt response coded into Batman’s arsenal of moves. When you really get into the groove, Batman is practically dancing across a battlefield as he dodges, parries, and punches, and even with the more snappy </span><i><span>Lego </span></i><span>movement, it still feels fluid and rhythmic. It is quite literally an </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>game, albeit with the slapstick </span><i><span>Lego </span></i><span>flair you’ve come to expect from its parodies. Batman’s finishing moves are less of the “you expect me to believe that man isn’t dead?” brutality we see Bruce Wayne dish out in </span><i><span>Arkham</span></i><span>, and more silly stuff like covering an enemy’s head with a trash can. Foes still break apart like any Lego character would, but I guess if you can just rebuild anything in these games, that’s not </span><i><span>technically </span></i><span>Batman breaking his no-kill rule.</span></p>

  <p><span>The </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>comparisons don’t stop at fights, as </span><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight </span></i><span>also has an open world to grapple and glide around. Though the pieced-together Gotham City might not be as atmospheric and dour as Rocksteady’s, getting around the crime-ridden Lego metropolis is just as satisfying. It’s easy to get distracted grappling to every high platform or gliding around with Batman’s wings spread over the city, but </span><i><span>Legacy </span></i><span>has enough of the random crime missions and collectibles that even a detour from your original objective is usually rewarded with something to do. You’re also able to ride around the city in the Batmobile, but I was so caught up in flying around the rooftops that I actually forgot to head to the ground level and drive around. My bad.</span></p>

 <p><span>Though </span><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight </span></i><span>clearly has a lot of </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>influence, it still has </span><i><span>Lego </span></i><span>foundations. The game can be played with couch co-op or by swapping between characters on the fly if you’re riding solo. The section I played, which had Batman and Commissioner Gordon infiltrating an Ace Chemicals plant, had puzzles that required both characters to solve. Batman’s gadgets can clear certain obstacles–his grappling hook, for instance, letting you pull locks off walls and crates–while Gordon has a gun that can stop up air vents or leaking pipes to clear the way for you to move forward. It’s easy enough to go back and forth between characters, but I imagine those segments will feel more rewarding when you have a second player next to you and it actually feels like a team effort. Gordon is one of several buddy characters Batman will team up with in </span><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>People might have an image of </span><i><span>Lego </span></i><span>games in their minds as games with simple co-op action and a lot of referential humor, and </span><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight </span></i><span>has all of that. But it’s also the closest thing to an </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>game we’ve gotten in years, and what I played so far makes it feel like a competent one. We’ll see how well it holds together or breaks apart when it comes to PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch 2 in 2026.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nearly 100 past and present employees at Mindseye developer Build a Rocket Boy have signed an open letter against the studio for its “longstanding disrespect and mistreatment” of staff.</p>



<p>Published on <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/barb-open-letter/">Friday by the IWGB Game Workers</a>, this letter directly calls out several issues employees claim to have faced from management, including founder Leslie Benzies. </p>



<p>After the poorly received launch of Mindseye, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-developerbegins-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Build a Rocket Boy laid off</a> what the union says was 250-300 people because of their refusal to <strong>“listen to your workforce’s years of experience, resulting in one of the worst video game launches this decade.”</strong></p>



<p>The letter says that there was a “lack of transparency and communication”. The employees believe that <strong>“information has been sparse and vague, with you (Benzies) often making radical changes to the way we worked with little or no input from those affected.”</strong></p>



<p>The letter also mentions the studio implementing a mandatory eight hours of overtime per week for every employee in the four months leading up to the game’s launch. Time Off In Lieu was given to the staff at seven hours per every eight worked, but, they say that many employees have yet to be able to use any of the time off because of <strong>“continued requests for extra “high-priority” work, even after launch.”</strong></p>



<p>Regarding layoffs, the letter calls what has happened a “disastrous handling”. It’s alleged that employees were given wrong information, including being grouped with the wrong internal teams, and given wrong notice periods, which may have seen a number of employees wrongfully dismissed.</p>



<p>The employees, both current and former, are demanding a public apology for the mistreatment as well as <strong>“proper compensation”</strong> for those who were let go. They are also asking for a meaningful and documented effort to improve conditions within the company that includes acknowledgement of the IWGB as a trade union, a commitment to using external partners for future redundancies, and the option for remaining employees on redundancy notice to either work the rest of their time or take Payment in Lieu of Notice.</p>



<p>The letter closes with calling out Benzies and co-CEO Mark Gerhard, saying, “you often refer to your employees as ‘family’. But we ask you to consider; is this really how you treat your own?”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Build a Rocket Boy for comment on the letter. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 developers have stated that the open beta’s maps were intentionally smaller than the ones we get at launch. </p>



<p>With Battlefield 6 launching today, players will be going straight in to check out the maps that weren’t available during the game’s open beta weekends. Some players are so excited, they have already started recreating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-maps-remade-in-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty maps</a> in the game’s Portal mode. Now, the developers have revealed why they opted for smaller maps in BF6’s open beta. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-open-beta-s-smaller-maps-made-it-easier-to-test-different-aspects-of-the-game">Battlefield 6 Open Beta’s Smaller Maps Made it Easier to Test Different Aspects of the Game </h2>



<p>In a new interview in <a href="https://www.pcgamer-magazine.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer Magazine’s 415 issue</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6-devs-say-the-plan-was-to-launch-with-bigger-maps-all-along-and-that-the-betas-notoriously-smaller-maps-were-intentionally-smaller-than-the-ones-we-know-are-coming-in-the-full-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>), the design director for Battlefield 6, Salim Fasahat, explained why the game’s open beta had smaller maps. Fasahat first stated, &nbsp;“They were intentionally smaller than the ones we know are coming.” He added that there were a few reasons behind this decision, including gaining a better understanding of different modes, the scale at which they can operate, which types of maps work, and more. </p>



<p>Fasahat added that the smaller BF6 maps made it “easier to test and focus on gun play.” The whole team is “super excited to have people explore all of those maps.” For those wondering, Manhattan Bridge, Saints Quarter, New Sobek City, Mirak Valley, and Operation Firestorm were not available in the Open Beta. The maps that players have already tested include Siege of Cairo, Iberian Offensive, Liberation Peak, and Empire State. </p>



<p>In other news, the developers of Battlefield 6 have confirmed that the game will not use <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-wont-use-anything-made-by-generative-ai-devs-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">generative AI</a>. Additionally, the Portal community is already making <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-community-is-already-making-star-wars-ships/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars ships</a>.

Together with the Game Workers Branch of the Independent Workers of Great Britain, the 93 BARB employees and ex-employees have singled out studio leaders Mark Gerhard and former GTA lead developer Leslie Benzies, citing various issues.</p><p>According to the letter, BARB leadership allegedly failed to effectively communicate with workers, and staff were subjected to "unbearable" levels of overtime in the four months leading to the launch of MindsEye.

The report said the game was canceled early in development and would have put players in control of a Black protagonist who escaped enslavement and started a new life away from the South. He is later recruited by the Assassins, returns to the South, and confronts prominent racist groups like the Ku Klux Klan.</p><p>It would not have been the first Assassin's Creed game set in North America, as Assassin's Creed III takes place during the American Revolution, set in 18th-century Boston, New York City, and the American frontier.

            <p>Tavern Keeper will finally enter early access on Steam on 3rd November, following 11 years of development.</p>
<p>The fantasy pub sim from Greenheart Games is the studio's follow-up to the hugely popular Game Dev Tycoon, and merges tavern management with RPG tropes as players serve dwarves, orcs, and humans alike.</p>
<p>The game is narrated by British actor Steven Pacey, perhaps best known for his role in the '80s sci-fi series Blake's 7, but more recently heard in video games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-ii">Dark Souls 2</a> (as The Rat King) and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Black Myth Wukong</a> (as the old monkey), as well as TV series House of the Dragon and Love, Death &amp; Robots.</p>

<p>Judging from the trailer above, Tavern Keeper has a British, Two Point meets Fable sort of vibe, despite coming from an international team. If you're keen to try it out before its early access launch, there's an updated <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/436780/Tavern_Keeper/">demo available on Steam now</a> ahead of Steam Next Fest later this month.</p><p>"After 11 years we're ready to open the doors to our follow-up to Game Dev Tycoon. Our hybrid management sim, witty RPG and decoration sandbox game Tavern Keeper, will launch into Early Access in November," said Patrick Klug, director and co-founder of Greenheart Games. "It's been a long journey, and we're thrilled that players can soon experience what we've been crafting for them over so many years."</p>
<p>Eurogamer last went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tavern-keeper-lets-you-run-a-pub-staffed-by-orcs">hands-on with Tavern Keeper</a> back in 2019, when contributor Johnny Chiodini described it as a "really loving, mischievous game".</p>
<p>"It's clearly made with a great deal of reverence for simulator games and the fantasy genre, but there's a delightful sense of humour at play that makes it more than the sum of its parts," wrote Johnny.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/a-minecraft-movie-2-confirmed-2027</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-minecraft-movie-2-confirmed-for-2027-surprising-absolutely-nobody.1321831/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In a shocking turn of events, this year's box office smash hit&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie&nbsp;</em>is officially getting a sequel. I bet you couldn't possibly have seen that one coming.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/minecraft-2-release-date-1236574896/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Deadline report</a>,&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie 2&nbsp;</em>(which probably won't be its final title, if only because&nbsp;<em>Another Minecraft Movie&nbsp;</em>is staring the filmmakers right in the face) is set for release on July 23rd, 2027.</p>

<p><em>A Minecraft Movie&nbsp;</em>director Jared Hess will once again helm the sequel, and the script is being written by Hess and Chris Galletta, the latter of whom was one of the five writers for the first&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>movie. Whether more writers will join the sequel in future remains to be seen.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/a-minecraft-movie-2-2027-jack-black-original.jpg?itok=CtajRS-4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/a-minecraft-movie-2-2027-jack-black-original.jpg?itok=lCUjvW2R 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We don't know whether any cast members from&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie&nbsp;</em>will return for the sequel.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, since the movie is well over a year and a half away from release, other details about the project are scarce right now, so we don't know whether actors like Jack Black and Jason Momoa will be reprising their roles in&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie 2</em>.</p>

<p>Similarly, we don't know what kind of narrative direction the sequel will take, but Deadline says "the buzz" around the project is that "there were always other worlds to build out and characters in the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>-verse", so there should be at least a few new faces in the movie.</p>

<p>If you missed the original&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie</em>, it was released earlier this year, and while it hasn't broken $1 billion at the box office yet, it's easily the highest-grossing movie in the US domestically, as well as the second highest-grossing movie of the year around the world.</p>

<p>The movie is essentially an isekai story in which four misfits are dragged into a blocky world of creativity and must escape with the help of Jack Black's charismatic Steve. I <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-minecraft-movie-trailer" rel="nofollow">honestly was not a fan of the movie's first trailer</a>, but hey, $420 million is nothing to sniff at.</p>




<p>The&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>movie sequel joins a host of other video game-related film projects currently in the works, including adaptations of the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-movie" rel="nofollow"><em>Call of Duty</em></a>, Bloober Team's horror game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-medium-movie-adaptation" rel="nofollow"><em>The Medium</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, the latter of which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zelda-live-action-movie-link-zelda-cast" rel="nofollow">also due for a 2027 release</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dell’s decided to show the competition just how a serious laptop deal gets done. They’ve taken one of their premier models — a 2025 Inspiron 15.6-Inch Full-HD Touchscreen with 32GB of RAM, a massive 2TB SSD, and Windows 11 Professional preloaded — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4689/">and taken a 72% hack out of its price, listing it for just $869 at Amazon</a>. For added incentive they’re throwing in a $199 accessories bundle, with a wireless mouse, USB hub, and more, on the house.</p>
<p>All that built-in processing heft, not to mention the Intel 13th Gen 10-core i5-1334U processor with 12M cache and speeds reaching 4.6GHz, are almost unheard of in a laptop being offered at such a dramatically reduced price. Then there’s the touchscreen, which presents all sorts of possibilities, especially when you add an inexpensive stylus to mark up, draw, edit, and perform all kinds of productive and creative tasks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4689/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Absolute Upgrade</h2>
<p>Unless you’ve bought a brand-new laptop within the past 12 months or so, this 2025 model Dell Inspiron touchscreen laptop would almost certainly be an upgrade for you, even above and beyond the preloaded Windows 11 Pro with Microsoft Copilot that would normally cost you a subscription fee. When you read about all the perks and bells and whistles packed into this Dell Inspiron, you might just start looking differently at your current laptop and all of its little flaws, slowdowns, and outdated bits.</p>
<p>And while that 2TB SSD is more than likely going to be enough for as long as you have this Dell laptop, you can add to the ample 32GB of RAM for faster and more efficient multitasking by adding to the two available memory slots, all the way up to 64GB. The Wi-Fi 6 connection will be among the fastest for some time to come, and the vast range of ports, including USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, and an SD card reader, add to the future-proof qualities of this Dell laptop.</p>



<h2>Don’t Ask Questions</h2>
<p>What else can we say about this seriously upper-echelon Dell touchscreen laptop? It’s ultra-slim in construction and weighs a very commuter-friendly 3.66 pounds, so there’s no size issue. You might be able to take issue with the modest 6-hour battery life, but as complaints go, that’s small potatoes.</p>
<p>Is this a post-Prime Day deal? Or is it a very-very-early Black Friday deal? There’s really no sense overthinking it when you see a outstanding laptop like this 2025 Dell Inspiron with a 15.6-inch full-HD touchscreen, tons of memory and storage, Windows 11 Pro and Copilot locked and loaded, and a bundle of free accessories take a huge price dip like this. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4689/">Head to Amazon now before someone changes their mind about offering this superstar laptop for just $869.</a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/valves-next-steamvr-headset-has-reportedly-entered-mass-production/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve%E2%80%99s-next-steamvr-headset-has-reportedly-entered-mass-production.1321822/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Valve is getting closer to pulling back the curtain and releasing its next SteamVR headset to the world. According to one Chinese analyst group, the next headset has reportedly entered mass production. </p>



<p>First spotted by <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/valves-next-headset-reportedly-enters-mass-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">UploadVR</a>, XR Research Institute claims that a production of 400,000-600,000 headsets is happening for the device that has been codenamed “Deckard”. There’s even the belief that the headset, which is expected <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steams-new-vr-headset-might-have-a-name/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to be called the Valve Frame</a>, could be announced and released before the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Adding to the legitimacy of the claim, Valve insider Brad Lynch says that Deckard DV1 and DV2 models recently appeared in the SteamVR Beta. According to Lynch, <strong>“DV units are the final stages before the model (PV) that consumers will buy.”</strong></p>



<p>No other details regarding pricing or specs are currently known. What is expected, however, is that the headset will launch alongside the new “Roy” controllers being developed for the device.</p>



<p>The SteamVR headset isn’t the only piece of tech Valve has been working on. During the summer, what appears to be Valve’s next attempt at a console, Valve Fremont, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-fremont-steam-console-appears-on-geekbench/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeared for the first time</a> on the benchmarking website Geekbench. The appearance on the site suggests a device featuring a six-core/12 thread processor running at 3.2 GHz with 8GB of DDR5 memory and a custom AMD RX 7600 GPU. Those specs, however, can always change between now and when the device officially launches. </p>



<p>What do you think of a new SteamVR headset coming from Valve as soon as this year? When do you think it’ll be officially announced?

<p>During a new interview, the VP general manager of Dice and Criterion spoke about not using generative AI in Battlefield 6. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6 finally launches today, October 10, on all platforms. Ahead of the release, the developers have revealed several details about the title through interviews, with the lead producer recently stating that the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-servers-should-be-ready-for-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">servers should be ready for launch</a>. Now, another person from the development team has spoken about generative AI and BF6. </p>



<h2 id="h-generative-ai-is-very-seducing-but-won-t-be-used-in-battlefield-6">Generative AI is ‘Very Seducing’ But Won’t be Used in Battlefield 6</h2>



<p>During a new interview with the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xrkxdkkrno" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BBC</a>, the VP general manager of Dice and Criterion, Rebecka Coutaz, spoke about Battlefield 6 and generative AI. Coutaz first stated that players will not see GenAI in BF6; however, it was used in the preparatory stages to provide “more time and more space to be creative.” The VP added that GenAI “is very seducing”, but at the moment there is no way to incorporate it into the daily work that the developer does. </p>



<p>Coutaz discussed GenAI further, stating that they can “break the magic with AI,” enabling them to be more innovative and creative. According to the VP, GenAI is “not anything to be scared of in our industry”. The gaming industry is “an environment at the bleeding edge of technology,” where teams are accustomed to change. The only challenge is how they can productively incorporate them into their workflows, which helps them take their games to the next level.  </p>

Additionally, players on PlayStation can earn more XP than those on Xbox or PC. What are your thoughts on Battlefield 6 not using generative AI?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake"><u>Silent Hill 2 Remake</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cronos-the-new-dawn"><u>Cronos: The New Dawn</u></a> developer Bloober Team is working on a number of new projects, including a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2"><u>Nintendo Switch 2</u></a> version of its disorientating horror <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/layers-of-fear-2023"><u>Layers of Fear</u></a>, Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition, and a number of smaller games from its subsidiary, Broken Mirror Games, which include a mysterious Switch exclusive, codenamed Project M.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We don't quite know exactly when The Masterpiece Edition will land — it's still labelled as coming in 2025 despite the fact we're running down the clock of what's left of the year — but as reported in the firm's <a href="https://ir.blooberteam.com/2025/10/09/bloober-team-ujawnia-aktualny-kalendarz-wydawniczy-swoich-projektow/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent investor briefing</a>, it's described as a "complete edition," presumably bundling the base game with subsequent content and the refreshed visuals we saw in 2023's Layers of Fears. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Broken Mirror's offering? Here, we can expect isometric horror <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/i-hate-this-place"><u>I Hate This Place</u></a> based on the 80s comic of the same name that's still listed as releasing next month, but has been delayed to January 29, 2026. But there are also two codenamed games in development, too: Project M and Project F.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We know next to nothing about Project F, but Project M is thought to release next year. While the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIYTTFIZS0c" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>live-action teaser we saw earlier this year</u></a> gives away very little — other than the M could stand for "Marionette", perhaps?! — Bloober confirms it will be available exclusively on both Switch 2 and the OG console.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And of course, after the phenomenal success of Silent Hill 2 Remake, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-remake"><u>Bloober is also remaking the first game in the franchise</u></a>. There's not much to go on, unfortunately, but we did get <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-1-remake-officially-in-development-at-bloober-team-konami-has-announced">a brief tease during June's Konami Press Start Live showcase</a> that included the Silent Hill logo and its iconic music. No release date was mentioned, unfortunately, but it followed news in February that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-developer-bloober-signs-deal-for-another-game-for-konami-could-it-be-more-silent-hill"><u>Bloober Team had signed a deal with Konami</u></a> to make a new game based on the Japanese company’s IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/layers-of-fear-2023-review"><u>We thought 2023's Layers of Fear remake was 'Okay,' awarding it 6/10</u></a>, writing: "Layers of Fear is an atmospheric tour through the shattered psyches of some seriously tortured artists, but predictable shock tactics fail to provide more than a handful of genuine scares, let alone layers of them."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

There’s always a chance we’ll get fresh printings since the Final Fantasy set will be standard legal for a while, but the option is there if you’re particularly keen to lock down the cards and have cash to burn. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to want for restocks to buy at MSRP, I respect that as well. I recommend following the <a href="https://x.com/IGNDeals" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGNDeals team on Twitter/X</a>, and they will be sure to update you whenever there are stock updates in the coming months.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Limit Break Game Edition Commander Deck</h2><div catalogid="73100320-bb0a-4140-b302-a29270875eda" id="229401"><div id="229401" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Limit Break Commander Deck - Game Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">First up, a new version of the Limit Break Commander Deck offers the same 100-card deck you can find already, but with a download code for the original Final Fantasy 7 on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aeKpP5?object_uuid=9e7f1239-d981-4da7-9504-b3463d2b2aaf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Is that worth paying upwards of $180 for</a>?
