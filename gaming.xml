Others can be entirely different fighters, such as bosses or even guest characters. I’ll be going over how to play as every one of these hidden fighters in this guide, in addition to providing a small breakdown of what makes each one unique.</p><h2 id="h13700"><a id=""></a><strong>Where to find character unlock instructions in-game</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="ad42a17bfe0a72534606aafd64ba6488" data-recommend-id="image://ad42a17bfe0a72534606aafd64ba6488" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The screen explaining how to unlock characters." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The screen explaining how to unlock characters." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ad42a17bfe0a72534606aafd64ba6488" data-recommend-id="image://ad42a17bfe0a72534606aafd64ba6488" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The screen explaining how to unlock characters." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This may come as a surprise, but the necessary steps to play as nearly every secret character are available in the game. They’re just a little bit buried within some menus.<br></p><p>Head to the main menu, and then select Fighter Awards. You’ll then need to press the button labeled Toggle Player Progress Page in the bottom right corner. This will take you to the specific awards for each game, which are simply to complete a run with each character. Scroll through and you’ll notice some awards with “???” on them—these are the secret fighters. Press the How to Use button to find specific directions for unlocking them.</p><p><strong>As helpful as it is to have these hints readily available, you can only access them from the main menu.</strong> Feel free to return to this guide if you need a quick refresher while you’re choosing your characters!</p><h2 id="h13701"><a id=""></a><strong>What does Easy Select mean?</strong></h2><p>Whether you’ve looked at the instructions on the Player Progress Page, or went straight to the Game Settings to tinker around, you likely noticed that most six games have a setting called Secret Characters. They’re all set to Easy Select by default, which is what this guide will be assuming you’ve left enabled. However, you might be a little confused about what that or the other options mean.</p><p><strong>Easy Select means that you can choose secret characters without needing to use any complicated inputs.</strong> There might still be some extra-simple inputs, but you’ll usually just need to move off the character select portraits.</p><p>Original Select means that it functions similarly to later releases, or a different setting back on the arcade version. Only some secret characters might be selectable, and even then it will likely require a complicated input.</p><p>Disabled is the last of the common options, and it means there are no additional fighters available to choose from. You’ll be limited simply to what’s available on the character select.</p><h2 id="h13702"><a id=""></a><strong><em>X-Men: Children of the Atom</em> Secret Characters</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="84a36d8359ddbcbdc9dfa2a42cef8f4f" data-recommend-id="image://84a36d8359ddbcbdc9dfa2a42cef8f4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Akuma and Magneto on the X-Men: Children of the Atom VS screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Akuma and Magneto on the X-Men: Children of the Atom VS screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="84a36d8359ddbcbdc9dfa2a42cef8f4f" data-recommend-id="image://84a36d8359ddbcbdc9dfa2a42cef8f4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Akuma and Magneto on the X-Men: Children of the Atom VS screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The first and earliest game in this compilation is <em>X-Men: Children of the Atom</em>. Its three secret characters include two bosses and a guest from the <em>Street Fighter</em> series.<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Juggernaut</strong> – Highlight Cyclops and press up for the Juggernaut. He’s incredibly slow, but makes up for it with specials and supers that take out huge chunks of an opponent’s life bar.</li><li><strong>Magneto</strong> – Highlight Omega Red and press up for Magneto. As the final boss, he’s the cheapest character by far. Strong moves, a shield super that nullifies most attacks, and a regenerating super meter are just some of his highlights.</li><li><strong>Akuma</strong> – Highlight Wolverine and press up for Akuma. He doesn’t have a sprite image of his face, so you’ll know you’re good once there’s no face image on your side. This version of the character is pretty close to how he is in <em>Super Street Fighter II Turbo</em>, only with a unique counter super and the debut of his Tenmakuujinkyaku dive kick. One glaring caveat is that his health is very low, so be sure to keep note of that.</li></ul><h2 id="h13703"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Marvel Super Heroes</em> Secret Characters</strong></h2><p>Next on the list is <em>Marvel Super Heroes</em>. Just like the previous title, this game’s hidden characters include two bosses and one character from a Capcom series.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Doctor Doom</strong> – Highlight Wolverine and press up for Doctor Doom. As the sub-boss of this game, he’s naturally very powerful. His specials and supers deal incredible damage, and he can fly too.</li><li><strong>Thanos</strong> – Highlight Magneto and press up for Thanos. He’s the final boss of the game and you’ll feel like one when playing him. Thanos has six different supers, one for each Infinity Gem he wields. You’ll be able to use them pretty often too because he builds up his super meter very quickly.</li><li><strong>Anita</strong> – Highlight Spider-Man and press up for Anita. Based on a side character from the <em>Darkstalkers</em> series, Anita is a test character that was initially only available in the Japanese version. She’s unfinished and pretty broke, with plenty of rough animations and a super that can take out nearly all of your opponent’s health.</li></ul><h2 id="h13704"><a id=""></a><strong><em>X-Men vs Street Fighter</em> Secret Characters</strong></h2><p>There’s only one hidden character in <em>X-Men vs Street Fighter</em> and it’s someone from a previous game in this compilation. There’s no Easy Select option for this title, but that’s fine because it’s easy to play this elusive fighter.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Akuma</strong> – All you need to do is press up while looking at anyone on the top row of the character select screen. He’s based on his appearance in <em>Street Fighter Alpha 2</em>, so you have all the typical fun Akuma tools and the legendary Raging Demon super. His trademark low health is also here, so I suggest playing offensively but carefully.</li></ul><h2 id="h13705"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Marvel Super Heroes Vs Street Fighter</em> Secret Characters</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="9f24556dcf33a9ced0bd6652e23bddfb" data-recommend-id="image://9f24556dcf33a9ced0bd6652e23bddfb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cyber-Akuma, U.S. Agent, and Shadow on the Marvel Super Heroes VS screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cyber-Akuma, U.S. Agent, and Shadow on the Marvel Super Heroes VS screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9f24556dcf33a9ced0bd6652e23bddfb" data-recommend-id="image://9f24556dcf33a9ced0bd6652e23bddfb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cyber-Akuma, U.S. Agent, and Shadow on the Marvel Super Heroes VS screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Marvel Super Heroes vs Street Fighter</em> has the highest number of secret fighters, although most are palette swaps. A couple of them don’t change anything gameplay-wise, but the rest offer unique properties.<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>U.S. Agent</strong> – Highlight M. Bison and confirm the character while holding the start button. He’s a palette swap for Captain America who plays the same.</li><li><strong>Armored Spider-Man</strong> – Highlight Spider-Man and confirm the character while holding the start button. He has one hit of armor and doesn’t jump quite as high, but otherwise plays the same as the web crawler you know.</li><li><strong>Mephisto</strong> – Highlight Omega Red and confirm the character while holding the start button. He’s a palette swap for Blackheart and the primary difference is that his attacks set opponents on fire. That being said, this is purely a visual change and the fire doesn’t do any extra damage.</li><li><strong>Dark Sakura</strong> – Highlight Hulk and confirm the character while holding the start button. This is much more than a simple palette swap for everyone’s favorite spunky shoto. She ends up borrowing some moves from Akuma, including air fireballs, and even gets her own Raging Demon variant.</li><li><strong>Mech-Zangief</strong> – Highlight Blackheart and confirm the character while holding the start button. <strong>If you hate playing defensively, this is the character for you.</strong> Mech-Zangief gains permanent hyper armor at the cost of blocking and an acceptable jump height.</li><li><strong>Shadow</strong> – Highlight Dhalsim and confirm the character while holding the start button. Following what happened in his ending in <em>X-Men Vs. Street Fighter</em>, this is a souped-up version of Charlie. He’s faster and his supers hit a lot harder.</li><li><strong>Cyber-Akuma</strong> – Highlight Akuma and confirm the character while holding the start button. The final boss of the game is pretty much a busted version of Akuma, so you can have a lot of fun playing Cyber-Akuma. All of his moves come out quicker and in most cases a lot stronger too. He can even perform a Raging Demon in the air for some ungodly reason.</li></ul><h2 id="h13706"><a id=""></a><strong>Marvel vs Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes Secret Characters</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="df5e67c7751c0883d1453a06444fd04f" data-recommend-id="image://df5e67c7751c0883d1453a06444fd04f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Marvel vs Capcom character select screen with Shadow Lady, Roll, War Machine, and Venom shown." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Marvel vs Capcom character select screen with Shadow Lady, Roll, War Machine, and Venom shown." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="df5e67c7751c0883d1453a06444fd04f" data-recommend-id="image://df5e67c7751c0883d1453a06444fd04f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Marvel vs Capcom character select screen with Shadow Lady, Roll, War Machine, and Venom shown." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Every secret character in <em>Marvel vs Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes</em> except for one is a palette swap. Even then, that one outlier still shares moves with someone else on the roster.<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Hulk (MSH Version)</strong> – Highlight Ryu and press up to use Hulk (MSH version). Commonly called Orange Hulk by fans, this version is meant to play similarly to the big green guy in <em>Marvel Super Heroes</em>. It’s not the same though, as there are some obvious changes to move properties. Other notable differences include no super armor and faster movement.</li><li><strong>Hyper Armor War Machine</strong> – Highlight Zangief and press up to use Hyper Armor War Machine. Just like Mech-Zangief from the previous title, this palette swap of War Machine has hyper armor but can’t block or jump that well.</li><li><strong>High-Speed Venom</strong> – Highlight Chun-Li and press up to use High-Speed Venom. Commonly called Red Venom by fans, even though he’s obviously orange, this palette swap is the most precarious to play. His movement and attacks are incredibly fast, which is balanced out by him taking nearly double the damage from attacks.</li><li><strong>Roll</strong> – Highlight Mega Man and press right to use Roll. She’s the only one who isn’t a palette swap and has her own sprites, but her moveset is technically the same as Mega Man. To be more precise, she’s worse than Megaman due to low damage and lengthy delays for her attacks. Roll is a gag character in this game like Dan Hibiki, only less viable and a lot cuter.</li><li><strong>Shadow Lady</strong> – Highlight Gambit and press down to use Shadow Lady. Arguably the most distinct hidden fighter, Shadow Lady is a visual palette swap of Chun-Li with unique robotic moves. This includes a triple jump, an air dash, missile attacks, and turning her hands into a giant drill.</li><li><strong>Morrigan (Lilith)</strong> – Highlight War Machine and press down to use Morrigan (Lilith). The only reason to use her will be if you want a team with two succubi. Aside from a more accessible air dash, this palette swap suffers from a worse fireball and worse supers.</li></ul><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-impressions-1851643432&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-impressions-1851643432">Capcom’s Latest Collection Of Arcade Classics Gives <em>The Punisher</em> Its Due</a></span></p><h2 id="h13707"><a id=""></a><strong>Marvel vs Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes Secret Characters</strong></h2><p>The original arcade release of <em>Marvel vs Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes</em> required characters to be unlocked through an experience system.

                <p>Microsoft has announced that it is closing the Xbox Ambassadors program after 13 years of operation. In a <a href="https://ambassadors.microsoft.com/xbox/blog/celebrating-the-legacy-and-evolution-of-the-xbox-ambassadors" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>, Microsoft thanked fans for supporting the program for the past decade-plus, but the time has come to close it down due to an adjustment to "the needs of our global community," Microsoft said.</p><p>The Xbox Ambassadors program will close after the end of the this current season, ending in mid-October. Microsoft said it's ending the program in part because Xbox players are "finding more value" in other, similar places, including the Xbox Insider program, Fanfest, and the Xbox Rewards program.</p><p>"Thanks to the work of this group, the chance for players to experience the joy of gaming is more global and inclusive than ever--and we believe that now is the right moment to bring the learnings and values of the Ambassador community into all of our player engagement programs," Microsoft said.</p><p>Seasonal Ambassador quests are being phased out, with resources instead going to the Rewards with Xbox and Xbox Research programs--more details will be announced soon, Microsoft said.</p><p>"You will also have a new, more global way to share feedback directly with us through Xbox Research, providing the chance to receive more early access to new games and features, and help us improve the Xbox experience for everyone," Microsoft said.</p><p>Additionally, the Xbox Ambassador Champions system is "evolving" into what's called Xbox Community Champions.</p><p>"We recognize that this evolution of the program may feel like a loss for some of you, but our work in maintaining an inclusive community of thoughtful players continues in new and expanded ways," Microsoft said. "We are incredibly proud of your impact and through your continued engagement, we will together continue to make Xbox the most fun place for everyone to play."</p><p>The Xbox Ambassadors program will officially go offline on October 15, which is also the last day existing Xbox Ambassadors can claim outstanding rewards. Microsoft is also giving members who have been active during the latest season a "special thank you," though it's not clear what this will be.</p><p>Now until October 15, Microsoft will host weekly sweepstakes to give Ambassadors a final chance to use their ticket balance. Finally, the Xbox Ambassadors badge given to members will be updated in the future with a "legacy" design.</p><p>Microsoft has made a number of cuts and changes to the Xbox business in recent times, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cuts-650-more-gaming-jobs-but-no-studios-closed-or-games-canceled/1100-6526439/" data-ref-id="1100-6526439">more than 2,500 layoffs since the start of 2024 at the Xbox team.</a></p>

Developer Mojang has revealed the next instalment of its formerly annual Minecraft Live digital showcase will air on 28th September, marking the first edition to be broadcast following the studio's recently revealed format changes.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, a "new take" on Minecraft Live will broadcast at 6pm BST/1pm EDT on Saturday, 28th September. It can be watched via the <a href="http://minecraft.net/live">Minecraft website</a>, YouTube, or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, and promises "news about our games, content creators, and more."
</p>
<p>
Notably, however, it won't see the return of Mojang's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/295k-minecraft-fans-criticise-lack-of-new-content-in-stop-the-mob-vote-petition">increasingly controversial</a> mob vote, which the studio confirmed it was retiring earlier this month. That news came alongside the announcmement Minecraft Live is ditching its traditional annual format, and will now air twice a year. This revamped version will be the place to learn about "the latest features we're working on, what's coming into testing, and the newest news from across the Minecraft franchise". Perhaps we'll also see more of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-trailer-gives-first-look-at-block-stars-jason-momoa-and-jack-black-in-action">decidedly iffy looking</a> live-action Minecraft movie.

<p>
Mojang's Minecraft Live makeover isn't the only change in the works for the mega-popular survival game. The studio also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-ditching-single-summer-update-for-more-regular-releases-ps5-version-incoming">recently confirmed sweeping changes to its content release schedule</a> that'll see the blockbusting sandbox adventure trade its traditional single summer update for multiple content drops throughout the year. This, it said, would help satisfying players' desires for "new Minecraft content more often".
</p>
<p>
Mojang's first update for Minecraft following that announcement released earlier this week, bringing bug fixes, gameplay tweaks, and a new experimental Bundles feature - letting players stack different blocks or items together in the same inventory slot to save space. That update was accompanied by the news Minecraft will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-is-ditching-psvr-support-next-year">ditching PSVR support</a> next year.

<p>It’s not Days Gone 2, but the franchise could be making its way to PlayStation 5 (PS5) anyway. </p>



<p>With rumors of an upcoming State of Play from PlayStation along with announcements of remasters, a new possibility has entered the  arena. Based on a tweet from Jordan Middler, it would appear that Days Gone is going to be one of those games announced.</p>



<p>“If he was angry that his character is in Astro Bot, he’s going to lose his mind at this,” Middler <a href="https://x.com/JordanMiddler/status/1836805409593565403" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said in a reply</a> to another post suggesting that an “even less exciting” remaster than the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported Horizon Zero Dawn</a> was coming.</p>



<p>He then seemed to double down <a href="https://x.com/JordanMiddler/status/1836807397433651544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when replying to a comment</a> about Sony not spending the resources to remaster a game from 2019 that sold around 9 million units.</p>



<p>For those unaware of the context, just weeks ago, writer and director on the game, John Garvin, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-director-slams-bend-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took to social media</a> to bash developer Bend Studio. Garvin took offense to main character Deacon St. John being a part of the recently released Astro Bot.</p>



<p>“Kinda sad that Deek&nbsp;<em>(Deacon St. John)</em>&nbsp;has been reduced to promoting other games … well done Bend Studio,” he said at the time. “Way to protect your legacy!”</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that nothing about a Days Gone remaster for PS5 has been confirmed, nor has Insider Gaming been able to independently verify the information. Until that comes, please take this rumor, like others, with a grain of salt.</p>



<p>What do you think of Days Gone making its way to PS5 via a remaster? Let us know in the comments, and take the discussion further in the official Insider Gaming Forums.</p>

<!-- cache hit 41:single/related:1ceb858334b42523bd879caf02fdffc3 --><!-- empty -->
<p>Last week, Rockstar added <a href="https://www.battleye.com/">BattlEye</a> support to <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em>, offering some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/06/gta-online-publisher-goes-after-paid-cheating-services/">much-needed</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/10/fortnite-gta-v-hackers-face-legal-action-for-online-cheating/">anti-cheat</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/10/rockstar-clears-out-illegitimately-gained-gta-online-cash/">protection</a> for the game's highly successful <em>GTA Online</em> multiplayer mode. That anti-cheat support wasn't welcome news for Steam Deck players, though, who now get confronted with an error when trying to log in to <em>GTA Online</em>.
</p><p>According to Valve, though, Rockstar could solve this minor technical issue with a single email.</p>
<p>In both <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/271590/announcements/detail/6356356787200715685?snr=2___">a Steam Community update</a> and <a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/articles/33490543992467/Grand-Theft-Auto-Online-BattlEye-FAQ">a Rockstar Support FAQ</a>, the developer notes that "Steam Deck does not support BattlEye for <em>GTA Online</em>. You will be able to play <em>GTAV</em> Story Mode but unable to play <em>GTA Online</em>." As such, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/271590/Grand_Theft_Auto_V/"><em>GTA V</em>'s Steam page</a> now lists the game as "Unsupported" for Steam Deck users, because "the game's anti-cheat is not configured to support Steam Deck."</p>
<p>But BattlEye support on the Linux-based Steam Deck hasn't presented a technical problem to developers for years now. Back in late 2021, shortly before <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/steam-deck-the-comprehensive-ars-technica-review/">the Steam Deck's launch</a>, Valve <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3104663180636096966">wrote</a> that "BattlEye on Proton [and thus Steam Deck] integration has reached a point where all a developer needs to do is reach out [to] BattlEye to enable it for their title. No additional work is required by the developer besides that communication."</p>
<p>Shortly after that announcement, popular games including <em>ARK: Survival Evolved</em>, <em>DayZ</em>, and <em>Arma 3</em> all took advantage of that opportunity to support both BattlEye anti-cheat and Steam Deck compatibility at the same time. But many <a href="https://steamdb.info/tech/AntiCheat/BattlEye/">other BattlEye titles on Steam</a>—including <em>Destiny 2</em>, <em>The Crew 2</em>, <em>The Day Before</em>, and <em>Riders Republic</em>—have apparently not bothered to "reach out to BattlEye" to enable the same Steam Deck support.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>What differentiates <em>GTA V</em> from those other incompatible BattlEye games is that the game has been <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/steamdecktopplayed/pastyear">one of the most popular on the Steam Deck</a>, complete with a fully functional online mode, for years now. Without a fix, Rockstar's move will make a previously playable online game functionally unplayable for a whole lot of Steam Deck owners, some of whom have no other way to play the game.</p>
<h2>Waiting for a fix</h2>
<p>Luckily for those players, there are some signs that this situation might not last forever. In a Steam Support response <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1fk8hp7/weather_update_gta_v_has_been_updated_to/">posted by a Reddit user</a>, a Valve representative writes that the company is "working with Rockstar Games to find a fix."</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gtaonline.png" data-height="2160" data-width="3840" alt="Artist's conception of Valve staff chasing down Rockstar for some answers."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gtaonline.png" data-height="2160" data-width="3840">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Artist's conception of Valve staff chasing down Rockstar for some answers.</p><p>Rockstar</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a chance Rockstar might just not be interested in letting Steam Deck players into their (newly locked down) online ecosystem, though. That's because <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/why-the-steam-deck-might-be-too-open-for-fortnite-and-destiny-2/">BattlEye on Linux operates in a "user-space" mode</a> that's much easier to bypass than <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/04/ring-0-of-fire-does-riot-games-new-anti-cheat-measure-go-too-far/">the "kernel-level" protections</a> it offers on Windows. And even stronger kernel-level anti-cheat might not work as well in a Linux environment.
</p><p>"We don’t have confidence that we’d be able to combat cheating at scale under a wide array of kernel configurations including custom ones," Epic's Tim Sweeney <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1490565925648715781">wrote in a 2022 social media post</a> regarding the potential for <em>Fortnite</em> to come to the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Modders have already decided not to wait for Rockstar and are <a href="https://github.com/YimMenu/YimMenu/pull/3697">working on their own BattlEye bypass</a> for Steam Deck, which may or may not be effective at granting GTA Online access. Here's hoping that fix isn't needed for long and Steam Deck owners can get back into one of their most popular games soon.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">"Not a quick fix, but we will add an option to change your Marine's face," Focus said.</p><p dir="ltr">Other pieces of Space Marine armor, including decals, hands, and facemasks, will be able to be more fully customized in future patches as well. More colors from the various successor Space Marine chapters are set to be added too, and Focus said it is still discussing if players will be able to customize the appearance of their AI squadmates.</p><p dir="ltr">While many players have asked for it, Focus said class-restricted cosmetics like cloaks and tabards won't be coming to all classes, as they are a part of the identity for each class and help players quickly identify the class in combat. Players also shouldn't expect the ability to customize their Battlebarge or Thunderhawk, as Focus said it would be "very cool," but not a priority, with the art teams currently focused on creating new maps. When it comes to customizing Chaos Space Marines in the game's PvP mode, Focus said there are lore restrictions preventing some customization options. However, the team would like to expand Chaos customization, but "the reality is they won't be as modular as the Loyalist."</p><p dir="ltr">On the gameplay side, Focus said adjustments will be coming to some of the game's harder difficulties. The Veteran campaign difficulty will be adjusted to be "more fair," and the campaign's AI squadmates when playing single-player will be made less passive and participate in specific objectives more in a future patch. For the PvE Operations mode, Focus said it recognizes that enemies at higher difficulty can be "too bullet spongy," which makes certain weapons, like the various Bolt Rifles, feel underpowered.</p><p dir="ltr">"That's the core issue, rather than the Bolters themselves," Focus said. "For now, we are testing some tweaks in difficulty to make the enemies have less health but keep the engaging difficulty."</p><p dir="ltr">Matchmaking connectivity improvements is a top priority for the team, with a bigger patch coming soon alongside new content to address the issue. There are also specific improvements to PvE and PvP matchmaking in the works. Focus said it is working to make it so players who have selected the same class in Operations mode won't be matchmade together, but will be keeping the one-player per-class restriction in place, at least for matchmaking. The team is instead considering removing class restrictions when playing in private lobbies--another feature the team is currently working on. On the PvP side, the team is "looking into" a feature that will rebalance teams after a match.</p><p dir="ltr">Other information revealed in the Q&amp;A includes why Focus won't add a FoV slider or the ability to swap shoulders when firing guns, as well as why players aren't temporarily invulnerable when performing a cinematic gun-strike attack. For more details, be sure to check out the full Q&amp;A.</p><p dir="ltr">Focus has already outlined a content roadmap for Space Marine 2, with updates planned into 2025. The game's Season 2 update, slated to come later this year, will add new PvE missions as well as a new enemy, weapon, and difficulty. Updates for 2025 include more PvP modes and maps, an expansion to the Battlebarge, and even further in the future, a horde mode.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-is-already-breaking-franchise-records/1100-6526389/" data-ref-id="1100-6526389">Space Marine 2 quickly became the most-played Warhammer game of all-time on Steam</a> when it released earlier this month. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/1900-6418276/" data-ref-id="1900-6418276">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 review</a>, we called Saber Interactive's sequel "a more than worthy successor to the 2011 original," with "brutally gory action" that "brings the tabletop game to life in all its grimdark splendor."</p>

			<p>It seems like that not-so-exciting PlayStation remaster <a href="https://wccftech.com/jeff-grubb-says-next-state-of-play-likely-to-announce-a-less-exciting-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> by Jeff Grubb yesterday could be Days Gone. The rumor comes from VGC's Jordan Middler, who joked that Days Gone Director John Garvin, who recently criticized Sony for putting protagonist Deacon St. John sitting on a beach in the new Astro Bot game, would 'lose his mind at this.'</p>
<p>For context, Garvin has long been critical of Sony, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-remake-in-the-works-days-gone-2-not-happening-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did not give its green light to make a sequel</a> despite more than decent sales and reception. Developer Bend Studio is now <a href="https://wccftech.com/days-gone-studio-sony-bend-seemingly-working-on-playstation-live-service-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working</a> on a brand-new IP that features online multiplayer and includes some of the open world systems seen in Days Gone.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">If he was angry that his character is in Astro Bot, he’s going to lose his mind at this. <a href="https://t.co/gbf1ClopvE">https://t.co/gbf1ClopvE</a></p>

<p>— Jordan Middler (@JordanMiddler) <a href="https://twitter.com/JordanMiddler/status/1836807397433651544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 19, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Days Gone launched in April 2019 for PlayStation 4. I really enjoyed my time with the game and rated it 8.4 out of 10:</p>
<p><em>Days Gone puts Bend Studio once again on the map of all PlayStation gamers after many years of oblivion. While it doesn't deliver any meaningful innovations in terms of open world and gameplay mechanics, it's a fun game that sports gorgeous graphics and a surprisingly great story and cast of characters.</em></p>
<p>However, given the <a href="https://wccftech.com/days-gone-q-we-were-blown-away-by-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC launch</a> that took place around two years later and the fact that PlayStation 5 users can already play the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/days-gone-ps5-dynamic-4k-60fps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at 60 frames per second</a>, this remaster feels quite unnecessary, perhaps even more so than the <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-rated-by-esrb-for-ps5-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a> that the ESRB 'leaked' earlier this week. Sony appears to be mass-producing remasters of relatively recent games, but many fans are wondering if this is really the best use of their resources.</p>
<p>Anyway, going back to Days Gone, the post-apocalyptic zombie IP was supposed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/days-gone-film-adaptation-on-the-way-game-creators-arent-happy-with-cast-choice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">receive a film adaptation</a> featuring Sam Heughan from Outlander as Deacon St. John. However, we haven't heard any update on the movie project in over two years.</p>

Bungie's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-returns-to-its-roots-with-a-pvp-twist-on-classic-fps-series-marathon">Marathon reboot</a> will reportedly launch with a $40 price tag, despite the recent failure of Sony's similarly priced Concord - with development "too far along" to pivot to free-to-play.
</p>
<p>
That's according to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/09/18/new-marathon-details-on-heroes-price-and-radio-silence/">Forbes' Paul Tassi</a>, who, citing a "source with knowledge of Marathon", claims Bungie's uncertainty around monetisation came to a head after free-to-play live-service shooter The Finals <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destructive-shooter-the-finals-hasnt-performed-as-well-as-expected-says-publisher">underperformed</a>. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-performed-well-ahead-of-expectations-and-topped-more-than-8m-sales">subsequent success</a> of Sony's live-service shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-review">Helldivers 2</a>, which launched with a $40 price tag, is said to have ultimately convinced Bungie and Sony this was the right approach for Marathon too.
</p>
<p>
That, however, was before Sony's second live-service shooter of 2024, Concord, took the same $40 monetisation approach and proved so commercially disastrous it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">pulled from sale after just two weeks</a>, with refunds being given to players. But despite Concord's failure, Bungie and Sony reportedly still plan to release Marathon with a $40 upfront cost - complete with a "standard cosmetic shop/battle pass stuff" - "barring anything seismic", simply because, says Tassi, development is "too far along to pivot back to free-to-play".

<p>
Alongside discussion of Marathon's monetisation, Forbes' report also includes a number of gameplay details. The extraction shooter is, for instance, said to adopt a class/hero system broadly similar to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, but with a greater focus on customisation. Characters will reportedly each have a handful of unique abilities, such as double jumps and fast revives - but the emphasis is said to be on customisable guns and gear, universal character implants, and gameplay buffs earned through XP and changeable skill trees.
</p>
<p>
Forbes says this marks a shift from the game's original vision, which changed when Joe Ziegler <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-gets-new-director-as-part-of-creative-leadership-shakeup">replaced</a> former game director Christopher Barrett this spring - after Barrett was reportedly ousted from Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-former-marathon-reboot-director-chris-barrett-reportedly-ousted-following-inappropriate-behaviour">following inappropriate behaviour</a>. Barrett's original vision for Marathon is said to have echoed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s Dreaming City, with puzzles and secrets to solve - but those elements were "just not coming together in practice".
</p>
<p>
It's also claimed Marathon (which will reportedly retain the well-received visual style seen in its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y-e2krA3uE">announcement trailer</a>) won't get a "significant" reveal until spring next year - even though its development team is said to be "very, very eager to get more in front of players and be able to talk about it." Forbes adds there's a lot riding on Bungie getting Marathon right, given a lack of goodwill from Sony following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-leadership-reportedly-overstated-studios-financial-prospects-to-sony-leading-to-need-for-layoffs">recent failures</a>. However, "Bungie getting Marathon out in 2025 with enough content and a high enough quality bar will also be tough."
</p>
<p>
Bungie referred to Marathon as one of its key focuses back in July, following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-former-marathon-reboot-director-chris-barrett-reportedly-ousted-following-inappropriate-behaviour">decision to lay off 220 staff</a>. Those layoffs came after 100 job cuts last October, and saw many former and current Bungie employees <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inexcusable-current-and-former-bungie-employees-react-to-sweeping-layoffs">calling for the studio's CEO Pete Parsons to resign</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-wont-be-available-on-other-consoles-until-10-08-2025/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Silent Hill 2 Remake has already been confirmed to be a PlayStation 5 exclusive as well as on<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124490/SILENT_HILL_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> PC</a>, but officially, it has been confirmed not to be on 'other formats' until 10.08.2025. The release date for Silent Hill 2 is just around the corner. It will be released on 8 October, just in time for Halloween. Whether this means that it's confirmed that Silent Hill 2 will be available on Xbox in the future remains to be seen in 2025, with the possibility it will also be released on the Nintendo Switch successor, should the console be powerful enough.</p>
<p>At the moment, it hasn't been confirmed whether the game will be given any new sparkly features for the PlayStation 5 Pro or whether it will even be added.</p>
<p>A new trailer for Silent Hill 2 has also been released, giving players another glimpse into the game. For those using a DualSense controller, Haptic Feedback will mimic every impact with a melee weapon, and Adaptive Triggers will offer resistance with the Shotgun.</p>
<p><iframe title="Silent Hill 2 - Immersion Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OWACgbMeg8Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The horror game will also have 3D audio support, which is perfect if you plan on using a headset to immerse yourself in the game. The sound is also available on TV speakers and analog/USB stereo headphones, so it isn't required to have the Pulse 3D Wireless headphones for the PlayStation 5, especially if you're playing the game on PC instead. 4K resolution will also be supported for those that have the relevant display, giving more of a movie-style feel to the game as well as deeper immersion and visual quality.</p>
<p>One of the cooler features is the DualSense Lightbar, which turns red if you need healing and stays green if you are in full health.</p>
<p>There are plenty of features coming to the updated version of Silent Hill 2 to make the game more accessible to those who want to play it. Whether you're a returning player to the franchise or just getting stuck in, there are features that can enhance your time in the game, such as the capability to turn of the UI or activate the 90s filter so that it feels just like the classic game.</p>
<p>Although the remake is shaping up to be rather faithful to the original, there will be s<a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-completionist-route-will-take-more-than-20-hours/">ome extra features</a>, like new exploration and new puzzles to solve. However, the original leads have returned to the remake, so it's bound to be good if Masahiro Ito and Akira Yamaoka are actively involved.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">2021's Battlefield 2142 was a disappointment in the eyes of some longtime Battlefield fans, but the developers at DICE have said they <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-battlefield-is-a-reimagination-of-the-series/1100-6516478/">took the feedback on board</a> to help make the next game better. Recently, the first key details on the next Battlefield game emerged, and for now at least, the developers seem to be saying all the right things to help people believe the next game could be a return to form.</p><p dir="ltr">Only time will tell if the team delivers, of course, but fans are already buzzing with excitement on the news that the new Battlefield will seemingly emulate older titles and do away with some of the things that Battlefield 2042 did. Most importantly, the new Battlefield game will not have 128-player matches or Specialist characters--two highly criticized elements of Battlefield 2042.</p><p dir="ltr">The game is set in the modern day, and that's also a welcome change for fans and a change of pace from the latest games that took place in the future and the past. It also sounds like the new Battlefield game could have a battle-royale element, too. At least four studios are handling development on the new Battlefield game, which doesn't have an official title as of yet.</p><p dir="ltr">Following the first official information being released this week at an EA event, we're rounding up all the key information to know about the next Battlefield game.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#When_will_the_new_Battlefield_be_released_">When will the new Battlefield be released?</a></li><li><a href="#Preorder_the_new_Battlefield_">Preorder the new Battlefield </a></li><li><a href="#New_Battlefield_trailer_information">New Battlefield trailer information</a></li><li><a href="#New_Battlefield_platforms">New Battlefield platforms</a></li><li><a href="#New_Battlefield_story__setting__and_characters">New Battlefield story, setting, and characters</a></li><li><a href="#What_will_it_be_called_">What will it be called?</a></li><li><a href="#Battle_royale_">Battle royale?</a></li><li><a href="#Who_s_developing_the_new_Battlefield">Who's developing the new Battlefield</a></li><li><a href="#Weapons__destruction__and_gameplay">Weapons, destruction, and gameplay</a></li><li><a href="#Taking_on_Call_of_Duty_">Taking on Call of Duty?</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_will_the_new_Battlefield_be_released_"><strong>When will the new Battlefield be released?</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">EA has not confirmed a release date for the next Battlefield, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-battlefield-game-will-have-a-free-to-play-battle-royale-report/1100-6521440/">a report said</a> it could launch as soon as October 2025. That timeline appears to be reasonable, as there was a three-year gap between the last two games, Battlefield V (2018) and Battlefield 2042 (2021).

And I think we have to get back to the core of what Battlefield is and do that amazingly well, and then we'll see where it goes from there," Vince Zampella told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-first-battlefield-concept-art-revealed-vince-zampella" rel="nofollow ">IGN</a>. "But I think for me, [that] peak of Battlefield-ness is in that Battlefield 3 and 4 days. So I think it's nostalgic for players, for me, for the teams even. Those are kind of the heyday...although I would say 1942 also."</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4369906-screenshot2024-09-19at1.15.54pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4369906" data-ratio="0.55292125317528" data-width="1181" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4369906-screenshot2024-09-19at1.15.54pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4369906"></a><figcaption>Battlefield 3</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4369906-screenshot2024-09-19at1.15.54pm.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_will_it_be_called_"><strong>What will it be called?</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">The new Battlefield game doesn't have a name yet, but Insider Gaming reported that EA's teams are currently "weighing up" options, in part by launching surveys. Some of the options reportedly include "Battlefield 6" or simply "Battlefield."</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Battle_royale_"><strong>Battle royale?</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">EA already runs a popular battle-royale game with Apex Legends from developer Respawn. But a report from Insider Gaming said the new Battlefield game will have its own battle royale mode as well, and that this could be developed by Ripple Effect. There isn't anything else to go on at this stage, however. EA did previously experiment with a battle royale mode called Firestorm in Battlefield V. But that was only playable within Battlefield V. Insider Gaming said the new Battlefield battle royale will be a free-to-play standalone game, and that the setup could be similar to how Activision offers a premium Call of Duty release alongside Call of Duty: Warzone.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Who_s_developing_the_new_Battlefield"><strong>Who's developing the new Battlefield</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">DICE, the creator of the Battlefield series, is leading development on the new Battlefield game's multiplayer element. Motive, the team behind Star Wars: Battlefront II and the upcoming Iron Man game, is taking the lead on the game's single-player campaign. Need for Speed and Burnout studio Criterion, meanwhile, is handling "content and experiences." Ripple Effect, meanwhile, is making "a new Battlefield experience" that some believe could be a battle royale.</p><p dir="ltr">When former Call of Duty boss Vince Zampella took over as head of the Battlefield franchise, he talked about creating a "Battlefield universe" of connected experiences. This four-studio approach seems to be part of that ambition. The team was originally one group stronger, as Master Chief creator Marcus Lehto was running a studio called Ridgeline that was contributing to this vision, but the team was closed by EA as part of a wider cost-cutting initiative.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Weapons__destruction__and_gameplay"><strong>Weapons, destruction, and gameplay</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">The Insider Gaming report said the team at DICE is aiming for 45 different weapons at launch, which is more than double what Battlefield 2042 had at release. The report went on to say the team is aiming to have 10 multiplayer maps available at launch, with presumably more to come after launch.</p><p dir="ltr">The Battlefield series is known for its destruction elements, with players able to bulldoze buildings and shoot out walls for tactical or hilarious purposes. It seems the new Battlefield game will carry this forward (of course), and the Insider Gaming report said the game will have "caliber-based destruction" similar to what Rainbow Six Siege offers. On another front, the report said players will be able to pick up and move downed players, and that this feature would be available in the rumored battle royale experience, too.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of multiplayer gameplay, Zampella suggested that 128-player matches are going away. Battlefield 2042 launched with these massive-scale matches, but players complained that the maps were too big and player populations too low (even with bots inserted into matches), and DICE later scaled things back. It seems DICE is not going to repeat this with the next game.</p><p dir="ltr">"The 128 player, did it make it more fun? Like...doing the number for the sake of the number doesn't make any sense," Zampella told IGN. "We're testing everything around what's the most fun. It's a different play space, and I think you have to design around that. So we are designing something that is more akin to previous Battlefields," Zampella says. "I'd rather have nice, dense, really nice, well-designed play spaces. Some of them are really good. I can't wait for you to see some of them.</p><p dir="ltr">Another highly criticized element of Battlefield 2042 were its Specialist characters, which replaced the traditional class-based system that Battlefield fans know and love. Zampella joined the team after the decision to do this, and while he applauded DICE's ambition to try something new, he admitted, "Not everybody liked it." So for the new game, "Specialists will not be coming back," Zampella said. "So classes are kind of at the core of Battlefield, and we're going back to that."</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Taking_on_Call_of_Duty_"><strong>Taking on Call of Duty?</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Battlefield and Call of Duty are two of the top game franchises in the shooter space, and Zampella said he believes the new Battlefield game has the "possibility" to outsell Call of Duty. However, Zampella stressed that EA is hoping to make a product that stands apart from Activision's Call of Duty series.</p><p dir="ltr">"I mean, is that what we're going for? I mean, not directly, but always," he said about Battlefield outselling Call of Duty. "We're not looking to take down Call of Duty. We're making something that's different and we're making something that's us. But yeah, it definitely has the possibility."</p>

			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows isn't far away, and those who plan to pick up the game will be transported to Feudal Japan as of November 2024. The game will be available on all platforms except for the Nintendo Switch, and it's now rumored to offer a 60 FPS mode on all platforms. However, it is said to have the best display quality on PS5 Pro. This rumor comes from <a href="https://x.com/arabhardware/status/1836713669163393197?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1836733526441349582%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es3_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arabhardware on X</a> and was then translated and 'confirmed' by <a href="https://x.com/_L3vi3?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1836733526441349582%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a news account</a> dedicated to Assassin's Creed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: World Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zKua34QXhMA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This post also continued to claim other details in the game, such as enemies suffering from heatstroke if they stood in the sun for too long, tying into the fact that weather changes will affect the game play. We suspect that the weather system will affect game play like it does in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, for example. According to ArabHardware, if it is raining, enemies will not hear you when you are walking in the rain.</p>
<p>There are also reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gamescom-preview-the-most-visually-advanced-assassins-creed-to-date/">huge improvements</a> being made to the game play physics as they are using AnvilNext and have continued to make upgrades to that engine for this game. While these details are simply rumors for the moment, there will be an Assassin's Creed Shadows preview event later in the month which will hopefully clarify some of the points made.</p>
<p>Additionally, in <a href="https://www.magazinesdirect.com/az-magazines/6937074/play-magazine-single-issue.thtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an interview with Play</a>, Art Director Thierry Dansereau spoke about the size of Assassin's Creed Shadows, saying that it is "bigger than Mirage, but smaller than Valhalla," saying that the game is roughly around the size of Assassin's Creed Origins. Compared to previous games, the focal point of the game will be taking place in Honshu, as "this is where all the events related to Oda Nobunaga are taking place."</p>
<p>The post by ArabHardware also claims that players won't be able to hide as Yasuke, due to his size, and the fact he makes a sound when he moves. However, he does have a bow and arrow that he can utilize to stealth kill enemies.</p>
<p>Of course, take this all with a pinch of salt, as none of this information has been confirmed by Ubisoft. The preview of Assassin's Creed Shadows will likely occur at the end of September, and details will be revealed at Tokyo Game Show 2024. This event takes place between September 26 and September 29, and plenty of games will be showcased at the event.</p>
