            <p>New casting rumours have begun doing the rounds for Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda live-action film adaptation, suggesting the possible ages of its lead protagonists.</p>
<p>Nintendo's own <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> first confirmed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-is-working-on-a-live-action-the-legend-of-zelda-movie">live-action The Legend of Zelda movie back in November 2023</a>, with a rather casual post on social media. Following this news, many hoped that Euphoria actress Hunter Schafer may land the role of Princess Zelda. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/miyamoto-admits-nintendo-faces-an-extremely-high-hurdle-with-zelda-film">Schafer herself said it would be "pretty cool" to get the part</a>.</p>

<p>However, the adaptation's latest casting rumours suggest Nintendo is looking for actors between the ages of 16 and 23, at least for both Link and Zelda, which would potentially age Schafer out of consideration (Schafer was born in December 1998, making her 26).</p>
<p>Word of this casting process comes from internet tipster DanielRPK (via <a href="https://zeldauniverse.net/2025/06/17/casting-for-zelda-movie-is-possibly-in-the-works/">ZeldaUniverse</a>), who is perhaps best known for scoops on Marvel TV shows and movies. According to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/131325843">DanielRPK's Patreon account</a>, casting for the roles of Link, Princess Zelda, Ganondorf, Impa, and/or the King of Hyrule could be taking place as we speak. </p>
<p>It's claimed the casting period could be wrapped by the end of August. Meanwhile, the current rumour is that filming for the Zelda adaptation will start sometime this November, with production aiming to then be complete by the following spring.</p>
<p>While we don't yet know which game the film will be adapting, given the ages of the actors they are looking for it is safe to rule out the likes of the very first game, when <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-The-Legend-of-Zelda-Ocarina-of-Time-3D/Vol-5-Mr-Shigeru-Miyamoto/2-Many-Characters-Many-Roles/2-Many-Characters-Many-Roles-224609.html">Link was around 12 years old</a>. Likewise, according to the <a href="https://amiibo.fandom.com/wiki/Toon_Link_(Super_Smash_Bros.)">amiibo description for Toon Link</a> (as he is often referred to), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-wind-waker">Wind Waker</a>'s Link would have received his green tunic on his 12th birthday.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the film's Link and Zelda are being cast to look more like very young adults, we could perhaps be looking at an adaptation more along the lines of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a>, in which flashbacks take place around and on <a href="https://zeldawiki.wiki/wiki/Spring_of_Wisdom_(Voice_Memory)">Zelda's seventeenth birthday</a>. An adaptation of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">Ocarina of Time</a>, however, may prove more complicated to adapt, given its time-travelling mechanic.</p>

<p>As for what we do know, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-is-being-made-in-close-collaboration-with-the-true-genius-of-miyamoto">Miyamoto will produce the Zelda film</a>, which is being co-financed by Nintendo and Sony Pictures Entertainment (Sony will also handle worldwide theatrical distribution).</p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda film adaptation is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-has-delayed-its-legend-of-zelda-film">currently slated for release on 7th May, 2027</a>. It will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/upcoming-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-could-be-the-first-of-a-trilogy">allegedly be the start of a trilogy</a>, planned for release over six years.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Put your Switch 2 down for a second, folks, because we are mere minutes away from <em>another</em> Nintendo Direct!</p>
<p>It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> that's taking the spotlight for this one, with a 15-minute deep dive into the upcoming adventure swinging into action at <strong>2pm BST / 6am PDT / 9am EDT / 3pm CEST</strong>.</p>
<p>We still don't know exactly what the showcase will hold, but we feel like Nintendo probably has a secret or two up its sleeve. We've seen a fair amount of Bananza from the reveal Direct, Treehouse footage and our own hands-on time with it at the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-rock-surfing-and-boulder-bashing-donkey-kong-bananza-is-brilliantly-bonkers">Switch 2 Experience</a>, but this looks like the kind of game that has <em>a lot</em> packed into it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we don't have long to wait until the Direct gets underway. The presentation is being streamed on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVUidGTR8xg">Nintendo of America YouTube channel</a> (and its regional variants), but you can also watch along with us — and have a good old natter about all the surprises — below.</p>
<p>So, get comfy, grab a banana or two, and let's get ready to rock and roll.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/help-us-rank-the-biggest-games-from-summer-of-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">All the big summer presentations are now complete, which means we now have a pretty clear picture as to what games we’ll be playing over the next year or so. Across IGN’s Summer of Gaming we’ve seen plenty of exciting reveals, from the debut of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> as part of Summer Game Fest (arriving next February!) to the big <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clockwork-revolution">Clockwork Revolution</a> trailer during the Xbox Games Showcase (which launches… when it launches.) </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With more than a dozen presentations held over the last few weeks, there has been at least a little something for everyone. Cozy gamers found games to love among the trailers featured in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS_nFj3inRw&amp;ab_channel=IGN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wholesome Direct</a>, fans of the grimdark future got excited about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-returns-space-marine-master-crafted-edition-and-more-all-the-announcements-and-trailers-from-warhammer-skulls-2025">Warhammer Skulls</a>, and first-party devotees feasted on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-everything-announced">PlayStation’s State of Play</a> and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-2025-everything-announced">Xbox Games Showcase</a>. But with everything now out in the wild, it’s time for the hard work: to rank the biggest reveals. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve selected the 25 biggest games of the season, based on a multitude of factors (including trailer and page views, social media chatter, and staff excitement) and entered them into a Tier List. Where each of those 25 games sits on the Tier List is up to you. S rank is for the most exciting, D rank is for the games you think show little promise, and then there’s space for everything else in between. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the 25 games are many that have an easy shot at hitting S rank. Resident Evil Requiem proved itself as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-trailers-of-summer-of-gaming">biggest, most-watched trailer of the season</a>, and our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-9-requiem-hands-on-preview">hands-on preview</a> suggests it's certainly one to watch. And how about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/invincible-vs">Invincible VS</a>, which looks like a fantastic tag-team fighter as well as a pitch-perfect adaptation of the beloved comics? Then there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/007-first-light">007 First Light</a> with its cinematic first trailer – but will the Bond film vibes be matched by worthy gameplay? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other games are tricker to rank. We finally, after years of waiting, saw Capcom’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pragmata">Pragmata</a>, but does it look as exciting as you’d hoped it would? How about the announcement of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-1-remake-officially-in-development-at-bloober-team-konami-has-announced">Silent Hill remake</a>? We’ve not seen a second of it, but it <em>is</em> being developed by Bloober Team, who knocked it out the park with its Silent Hill 2 remake. And then there’s sentient lighthouse simulator <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/keeper">Keeper</a>, Double Fine’s long-awaited return, but its debut trailer seemed to keep at least a few cards close to its chest. Where will all these games (and more) rank? It's up to you to decide. </p><div id="summer-of-gaming-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Summer of Gaming Tier List</h3><h3>Summer of Gaming Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For more from IGN's Summer of Gaming, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-most-anticipated-games-from-summer-of-gaming">most anticipated games of the season</a>, as well as this month's IGN First, which is all about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</a>. </p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/hades-2-full-release-is-getting-close-as-development-enters-final-phase<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>After over a year in early access, it looks like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii">Hades 2</a> is finally gearing up for its full release — which, let's not forget, will be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/hades-ii-will-officially-launch-on-switch-2-and-switch-ahead-of-other-consoles">arriving on Switch and Switch 2 ahead of other consoles</a>.</p>
<p>We still don't have a precise release date for the hotly-anticipated sequel, we should point out, though with the release of the latest early access update, Supergiant Games has teased that it is "getting close" to ver. 1.0 (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-gets-fresh-early-access-update-as-development-finally-approaches-full-release">Eurogamer</a>).</p>
<p>"After more than a year of Early Access development, we're now starting to prepare for our v1.0 launch," the team wrote in a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/512959549469100056">blog post</a> on Steam. Supergiant says it is "heading into the final phase of Hades II development, which involves adding the story's true ending and other finishing touches", and it will be sharing more info on the full release "as soon as we can".</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>As the post suggested there, the new 'Unseen Update' expands the game's core combat, Guardian encounters and character relationships, and gears things up for the introduction of the game's "true ending" — which the dev plans to add before the ver. 1.0 release, fortunately.</p>
<p>All this means that Supergiant is now officially winding down its early access phase. "Our goal remains ensuring we've created our biggest, most replayable, most feature-rich game yet," the blog post continues, "and — most importantly — a worthy successor to the original Hades".</p>
<p>"We have a big game to wrap up," the post concludes. "While we can't yet say when our v1.0 launch will be, we're very excited to be getting close, and to share the complete experience with you. This also means some of the most important work on Hades II is still to come, so <em>may moonlight guide us!</em>"</p>
<p>It has felt like a long time coming, but boy are we excited to see what the full release has to offer. We went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-hades-2-is-a-hell-of-a-time-even-in-early-access">hands-on</a> with the early access build last year, and we were delighted by what we saw. Heck, if this sequel is even a fraction as compelling as its predecessor, we're going to be in for an almighty time sink when it finally lands on Switch.</p>

            <p>If, like me, you ended up keeping a bit of an eye on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> once its release popped into view like a weird mind portal, you might remember one of the execs behind it causing a fuss with <a href="https://www.vg247.com/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-concerted-effort-against-it">some Discord comments</a> alleging bots were being used to bad mouth the game.
</p>
<p>Well, in a twist that'd be strange for other games, but feels pretty par the course for this one, developer Build A Rocket Boy's now denied that it's been using bots to say nice things about MindsEye. This wasn't totally out of the blue. Some folks had spotted some posts about the game with suspiciously similar wording.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Taking a minute to set the record straight and refute this, and other false claims that are swirling," the studio tweeted in response to a thread that saw journos Mike Channell and Kirk McKeand highlight some examples of potentially botty MindsEye posting.</p>
<p>"BARB has never used any bots nor will we. We’re pumped to see players loving the latest MindsEye update! #NoBots". Cor, a hashtag and everything.</p>
<p>As a, well, a social media weirdness masochist for lack of a better term, I decided to look into the examples cited by Channell and McKeand myself. I also quickly checked to see if I could find more examples of multiple posts about MindsEye that use weirdly similar language - such as all insisting that the game's given them goosebumps, before casually listing the different systems you can play it on in a manner that's not at all sales-pitchy.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Hey both, thanks for flagging. Taking a minute to set the record straight and refute this, and other false claims that are swirling. BARB has never used any bots nor will we.

<p>Quick scans through the comments and Twitter replies on <a href="https://x.com/IGN/status/1933592983980400804">IGN</a> and <a href="https://x.com/eurogamer/status/1934580739859009561">Eurogamer</a>'s MindsEye reviews - with two comments that are exactly the same left in the Facebook comments on the latter having kicked off Channell's thread - didn't reveal anything I'd class as sticking out beyond the norms I'd expect from your average internet comments section.
</p>
<p>Looking into the post histories of the accounts in the goosebumps-citing post chain McKeand shared a screenshot of, I did find that <a href="https://x.com/Ashleykate_3">two</a> of <a href="https://x.com/jus_stark">them</a> have only existed since April this year, and that the former also <a href="https://x.com/jus_stark/status/1933486172874870976">retweeted</a> one of the latter's weird MindsEye posts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, one put out <a href="https://x.com/onlinenow99/status/1932708620388778049">four</a> very <a href="https://x.com/onlinenow99/status/1932719162478281043">similar</a> and very <a href="https://x.com/onlinenow99/status/1933279562785566823">promo-y</a> <a href="https://x.com/onlinenow99/status/1933284779392446726">posts</a> about Mindseye across June 11th and 12th alone, all of which hype it up and mention the platforms it's available on. It even retweeted one of them in that same timeframe.</p>
<p>Based on the few examples I looked at, I'd say this feels like it could pretty easily just be your standard weird engagement-farming bot activity done in isolation, rather than the potential astroturfing suggested in the original thread. And again, BARB have denied it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Treyarch confirmed the game won't include futuristic movement abilities like wall-running or jetpacks, as have occasionally appeared in past Call of Duty games.</p><p>Details about the movement system and Black Ops 7's campaign settings were confirmed during the latest episode of the <a href="https://youtu.be/F7NvcBZJzbQ?si=bVB3tpPRBo34-BbH" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official Call of Duty podcast</a>. Podcast host Stephanie Snowden shut down rumors of potential wall-running and jetpacks in Black Ops 7. When co-host Miles Ross asked about Black Ops 7's movement, Snowden replied, "I can confirm no wall-running, no jetpacks, but it will feature an evolution of omnimovement."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Official Cinematic Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>While some fans may be disappointed in another year of boots-on-the-ground Call of Duty, leaks suggest Black Ops 7 could feature some form of a "wall-jump" or double jump with this evolution of omnimovement.</p><p>The episode also included an interview with Treyarch's associate creative director, Miles Leslie. Leslie discussed Activision's reveal trailer it showed during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">June's Xbox Games Showcase</a>, as well as some of the Easter eggs hidden within. The developer also confirmed part of the campaign shown in the trailer takes place in Japan. </p><p dir="ltr">"We're super excited about this because Black Ops has never gone really deep into Japan," Leslie said.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to Japan, it's also confirmed that part of the campaign takes place on the long-rumored Avalon map. It was originally rumored that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-players-think-theyve-discovered-the-next-warzone-map/1100-6527488/">Avalon would be the next Warzone map</a>, but recent leaks suggested it was scrapped for battle royale and would instead be used for campaign and Zombies content. The speculation of an Avalon battle royale map returned after Black Ops 7's trailer included a scene with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/possible-new-call-of-duty-warzone-map-teased-in-black-ops-7-trailer/1100-6532265/">squad flying down onto Avalon with wingsuits</a>, with fans hoping it was teasing a Warzone or Blackout-style battle royale map.</p><p>According to Snowden, the scene in question is part of Black Ops 7's co-op campaign set on Avalon, which will support up to four players. Snowden didn't outright say the content isn't also made for battle royale, however, so there is still hope for fans wanting battle royale on Avalon. Call of Duty's battle royale maps are often made with parts of campaign settings.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the hosts acknowledged the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-season-4-update-broke-multiplayer-lobbies-in-this-one-way-activision-investigating/1100-6531959/">buggy launch of Season 4</a> for Black Ops 6 and Warzone. "When there are bugs or issues present in the game we know that that is frustrating," Snowden said. "Since then, we've been focused on patching and updating a number of those issues."</p><p dir="ltr">The podcast hosts also confirmed the final Zombies map for Black Ops 6 will arrive with the launch of Season 5. Call of Duty still has plenty of content to arrive before then, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-4-start-date-and-details/1100-6531690/">Season 4 Reloaded</a> set to bring more multiplayer maps, events, and game modes.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 launches later this year for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. For more news, make sure to check out all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-announced-marks-first-back-to-back-black-ops-release-eve/1100-6532238/">rumors and announcements for Black Ops 7</a>.</p>

<p>According to PlayForum (via machine translation), Shift Up is working on platform-specific optimisation to reflect the Switch 2's lower power compared to Sony's console (and PC).</p>
<p>Indeed, Stellar Blade was one of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-stellar-blade-on-ps5-pro-a-simple-but-hugely-effective-upgrade">first games optimised for Sony's more powerful PS5 Pro console</a> and has been praised for its performance.</p>
<p>PlayForum also stated the Switch 2 version plays into Shift Up's multiplatform strategy, expanding beyond a single-platform hit.</p>
<p>Beyond Stellar Blade, the studio has its Goddess of Victory: Nikke game, plus its newly announced flagship Project Spirits.</p>
<p>A sequel to Stellar Blade is also in development and has been set to a 2027 release in a recent investor presentation from the studio.</p>
<p>Director Hyung-tae Kim stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-2-better-story-than-stellar-blade">Stellar Blade 2 will address the lack of narrative in the original game</a>, which had its total number of cutscenes cut due to cost-saving measures. This included details on why main character Eve changes clothes so much.</p>
<p>"In the early stages of development, we planned to include detailed settings such as the reason the main character changes clothes in the story. However, as production progressed, the cost of producing cutscenes became too much," he said. "And eventually, for the sake of efficiency, we had no choice but to reduce cutscenes that supplemented the world view or character narratives outside of the main plot. That's how we were barely able to complete the game."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Playable on Switch 2, too</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>EA's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lost_in_random">Lost In Random</a> was very well-received when it launched back in 2021, with our very own review awarding the hybrid of roguelike, dice-rolling, deckbuilding, boardgame and real-time action (phew!) a rather <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/lost-in-random">great 8/10</a>.</p>
<p>So, it may be of interest to you to know that the sequel to all of this very good stuff, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lost_in_random_the_eternal_die">Lost In Random: The Eternal Die</a>, came out yesterday on Switch (and Switch 2, though only via backwards compatibility - how very exciting that we now live in such a thriving ecosystem).</p>
<p>Described as a "fast-paced roguelike set in the world of Lost In Random", this sequel from Stormteller Games — now with Thunderful on publishing duties — serves as the next chapter in the story of a world where children must roll a dice to decide their stations in life. Which seems harsh (although what's the chances they'll end up in a worse spot than "games journalist"?)</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Of course, your main protagonists aren't having any of that, and we expect a further fight back against the establishment will follow as a new tale involving the Queen of Random — yes, the world here is called Random, you see — unfolds before us in the series' unique graphical style. As the press release details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mastery Meets Chance</strong>: Engage in fast-paced, second-to-second combat that blends real-time action with strategic decision-making - and a touch of luck.</p>
<p><strong>Forge Your Playstyle</strong>: Wield four unique weapons, throw your die-companion, and combine 100+ relics with powerful card-based abilities to unleash devastating synergies.</p>
<p><strong>Ever-Changing World</strong>: Traverse four randomly generated worlds, each with its own distinct secrets and challenges and face over 30 different enemy types and formidable bosses.</p>
<p><strong>A Dark Fantasy Tale</strong>: Immerse yourself in a fully voiced story set in a Tim Burton-inspired world, brought to life with hauntingly beautiful landscapes and an enchanting soundtrack."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Judging by the game's trailer, there's more than a little <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a> in the mix here, which is a very good thing indeed, and feedback over on Steam has been <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2564520/Lost_in_Random_The_Eternal_Die/">very positive</a> thus far, so this is defo one to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>Lost In Random: The Eternal Die released yestoday (17th June) with a 10% launch discount putting it at <strong>$22.49/£17.99.</strong> The Fortune Edition, which includes a special digital artbook, exclusive soundtrack and cosmetic DLC is available for <strong>$28.99/£23.19.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-widespread-nvidia-dlss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Although pre-release footage suggested the contrary, the Nintendo Switch 2 makes widespread use of NVIDIA DLSS, but it may be difficult to notice if the upscaler is being used due to differences in image characteristics compared to PC.</p>
<p>Replying to a supporter's question during this week's episode of their podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry highlighted how the new Nintendo consoles makes widespread use of the NVIDIA upscaler, saying that it was difficult to say if this was indeed the case before launch due to the image characteristics of Switch 2 DLSS being different from those seen on PC. Based on certain visual elements, however, it is now possible to say if a game is using NVIDIA DLSS on the system, such as the disocclusion and aliased edges patterns seen in the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet update.</p>
<p>Looking further into the matter, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> tech experts also highlighted how there's a good chance that NVIDIA DLSS on Nintendo Switch 2 comes with different modes, like on PC. The most common version seems to be a lightweight version that can easily upscale the resolution to 1080p in handheld mode and to 1440p or 4K in docked mode, but that doesn't do a great job of reconstructing the image in motion. The most glaring example is in Fast Fusion, where NVIDIA DLSS is used to upscale to 4K resolution in docked mode. Image quality is fine in still shots, but in motion, things are much different. Hogwarts Legacy seems to use this lightweight version of DLSS as well, only that the much slower pace of the game, and the higher base resolution deliver much better results, although different from what the upscaler delivers on PC. Besides this lightweight version, however, there seems to be at least another version of NVIDIA DLSS available to developers, as the implementation seen in Cyberpunk 2077 seems to be closer to the PC version, rather than the one seen in the other launch titles.</p>
<p><iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #218: MindsEye Launch Disaster, Next-Gen PS Handheld Specs, Switch 2 Sells 3.5m!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tWlnVVbtNwc?start=4663&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Besides supporting NVIDIA DLSS to deliver better image quality and performance upscaling from lower resolutions, the Nintendo Switch 2 offers plenty of unexpected benefits via its backward compatibility feature. Although updated games take better advantage of the increased system specs over the original system, several unpatched games can<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-backward-compatibility-better-original-system/"> brute-force better performance in several different titles.</a></p>

            <p>Gearbox's Randy Pitchford is "stoked" about Borderlands 4's price point, promising plenty of "awesome" DLC to come after the game's release.</p>
<p>There has been much discussion about how much Borderlands 4 will cost, even before the price was announced. It all kicked off when Pitchford made comments earlier in the year, saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/80-for-borderlands-4-too-costly-randy-pitchford-says-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen">if you were a "real fan" you would find a way to make a potentially more expensive purchase</a>.</p>

<p>Needless to say, this comment was met with backlash, so the Gearbox exec then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4s-randy-pitchford-seeks-to-justify-80-real-fans-comment">attempted to justify his comments with a video</a> shared on social media. Here, he admitted he did not know how much Borderlands 4 would cost. </p>
<p>Fast forward to earlier this week, when it was announced the Borderlands 4 standard edition will in fact retail for £59.99 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/borderlands-4">Epic</a>, or <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnMAk">£69.99 for the same version on Xbox Series X/S</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/aAgD0j">PS5</a>. In the US, it's $70.</p>
<p>After the price reveal, Pitchford took to social media to talk about how "stoked" he is about it all. He added the team has "a TON" of "awesome" DLC planned for Borderlands 4. This will be a mix of free and paid for content.</p>
<p>"Just as we aimed to outdo everything we've done before with the main game, we're pulling out all the stops on our end game and our post launch commitment for Borderlands 4," he wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1935092460536950936">subsequent social media post</a>, adding the team is "just getting started, baby!"</p>
<p>In Pitchford's words: "We're not holding anything back!" (though, Gearbox does need to "land" the game itself first).</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.playforum.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=503136">PlayForum</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ps5s-stellar-blade-is-reportedly-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/">VGC</a>), developer Shift Up has secured a dev kit for the Switch 2 and has begun intial work for a supposed port of the game. The team has also gifted a whole bunch of Switch 2 units to its employees.</p>
<p>Shift Up itself has told PlayForum that "nothing is confirmed" regarding a potential Switch 2 release, but that it is "reviewing various possibilities internally".</p><p><figure data-videoid="Vza2oSKedQs" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vza2oSKedQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vza2oSKedQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vza2oSKedQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4bcd6eqhotmy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vza2oSKedQs">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The biggest question mark with all of this is whether Sony Interactive Entertainment would handle publishing duties for the Switch 2. The company is no stranger to releasing games on Nintendo hardware, having notably launched <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_horizon_adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> simultaneously with its PS5 release in 2024.</p>
<p>A hypthetical launch on the Switch 2 isn't entirely out of the question, however, since Stellar Blade recently made its way to the Steam Deck to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawWWDl7FZM">positive critical reception</a>, despite its inability to maintain that 60fps sweet spot.</p>
<p>The Switch 2's vastly improved specs over its predecessor has meant that games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> run remarkably well. The former has been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/video-digital-foundry-delivers-its-cyberpunk-2077-tech-review-on-switch-2">praised by Digital Foundry</a>, with positive comparisons made to the game on Xbox Series S in particular.</p>
<p>We'll be keeping our eyes and ears open for a potential Stellar Blade launch on the Switch 2 in the coming months, and we'll let you know as soon as we hear more.</p>

			<p>Although Stellar Blade developer Shift Up recently acquired a Nintendo Switch 2 development kit, a port of their popular game is not currently in development.</p>
<p>A new report from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.playforum.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=503136" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayForum,</a>&nbsp;translated from Korean by&nbsp;<a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/stellar-blade-switch-2-port-not-confirmed-yet-shift-up-clarifies-in-response-to-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Automaton Media,</a> confirmed that Shift Up recently acquired a Nintendo Switch 2 development kit that will allow the studio to develop games for the console.&nbsp;Reportedly, the studio has begun designing content that reflects the console's specifications and unique features, using the experience gained developing Stellar Blade on PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>
<p>Though a port is quite likely, considering both the game's and the Nintendo Switch 2's success, a new version of Stellar Blade is not already in development. A Shift Up representative confirmed to PlayForum that they have nothing to confirm regarding a Switch 2 port, as the studio is currently reviewing various possibilities internally.</p>
<p>After being a PlayStation 5 exclusive for about one year, Stellar Blade finally made its debut on PC last week. The game has quickly become a smashing success on the platform, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-has-sold-1-million-units-on-pc-in-3-days-ceo-hopes-sequel-comes-out-in-2027/">selling 1 million units in only three days</a>, bringing the total number of units sold to over 3 million. This success on the market is wholly deserved, as it is an engaging action role-playing game, as highlighted by Kai in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">review</a> of the PlayStation 5 release.</p>
<p><em>No butts about it, Stellar Blade is a marvelous feast for the eyes and a technically impressive action RPG. Those who find the hyper-sexualized Eve offputting will find little redemption in finding some modesty for the playable heroine, but at the same time, those already accustomed to the years following Bayonetta’s release and 2Booty memes will find the character designs enjoyable, to say the least. Stellar Blade is a fantastic action title and one PlayStation exclusive you’ll have to play after the kids go to bed.</em></p>

I've leveled up, I've got lots of juice, and a cool sword, and stuff like that, and I just throw myself at them again, and again, and again, and again.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That was the technique I learned with Dark Souls," he continued. “It's not that you get better, it's more like monkeys and typewriters. You just keep doing it, and eventually, one day they're dead.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it turns out, Garland never had quite the trouble with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Starscourge_Radahn_Location_and_Boss_Fight_Guide">Starscourge Radahn</a>, instead offering his very own game help guide on how to take down the gravity magic-harnessing horseman.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Radahn's really easy”, stated Garland. “I thought Radahn was quite easy, because as long as you sort of activated the people who can assist you in that fight, they get on with fighting him, and they take off whatever it is, half his energy, and you finish him off. It's all about activating those little summon signs dotted around.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Can we expect either of these bosses to appear in A24's upcoming Elden Ring film adaptation? Well, as you may expect, Garland gave us no details on what he plans to do with the project. Indeed, we know next to nothing about the Elden Ring movie, which is in the works from Garland as writer and director, Elden Ring publisher Bandai Namco, and A24. Game of Thrones author George R. R. Martin, who helped create the original Elden Ring, is attached as a producer on the movie, as is Vince Gerardis. DNA’s Peter Rice will also produce, along with Andrew Macdonald and Allon Reich from DNA. There’s no word yet on how involved FromSoftware or game director Hidetaka Miyazaki will be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What do you think the story of the Elden Ring movie should be? I, for one, think it would be smart to tackle a prequel based on the events of The Shattering, rather than the story of the game itself. Got your own idea?

                <p>Everyone knew that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review-its-a-switch-too/1100-6532411/" data-ref-id="1100-6532411">Nintendo Switch 2</a> was going to be the hottest game console of 2025, but someone has provided an entirely different kind of heat. Earlier this month, thieves stole nearly 3,000 Nintendo Switch 2 consoles out of a truck without being detected until it was too late.</p><p>A semi-truck driver reported the theft on June 8 at a truck stop in Bennett, Colorado. The driver told police that he discovered the missing Switch 2 boxes while performing a pre-trip inspection. Police determined that 2,810 Switch 2 consoles were taken.</p><p>"They retail at $499. The cost to Nintendo is just over $410," said Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office public information officer Anders Nelson. "So either way you look at it, it's well over $1 million worth of merchandise stolen."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fp0MGCgz2Q" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-fp0MGCgz2Q" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As part of <a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/crime/nintendo-switch-theft-truck-colorado/73-27ca5808-6901-4229-b1b4-4862c73b300b" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">9NBC</a>'s report, MSU Denver computer science professor Steve Beaty noted that the thieves may use the Dark Web to sell the stolen consoles, but that doesn't mean the trail has gone entirely cold for Nintendo or the police. They can potentially identify the stolen consoles by their serial numbers when they go online.</p><p>"Nintendo does have the capability of what we call bricking the device and that is to make it nonfunctional," added Beaty.</p><p>In the past, Nintendo has gone to great lengths to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-had-to-play-detective-to-find-an-alleged-switch-pirate/1100-6527794/" data-ref-id="1100-6527794">track down and identify Switch 1 pirates</a>, so it's entirely plausible that the company will flag any stolen Switch 2 consoles that show up on its radar. But for now, the thieves behind this truck stop heist have yet to be caught.</p><p>Players in Japan have had such difficulty getting Switch 2 consoles because of resellers jacking up the price that they've been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/japan-is-getting-goofy-with-switch-2-marketplace-listings/1100-6532415/" data-ref-id="1100-6532415">posting parody listings for it on third-party marketplaces</a>.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> has received a fresh update for those playing in early access, as the studio finally approaches the final phase of development ahead of a full release.</p>
<p>Supergiant's sequel has been in early access for over a year, with its full release highly anticipated after both the success of the original game and positive praise for Hades 2. While many had expected an announcement as part of Summer Game Fest season (or the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a>'s release), alas that time has come to pass.</p>
<p>There's no date yet for the full release, but at least Hades 2 is approaching its final form. "We're heading into the final phase of Hades 2 development, which involves adding the story's true ending and other finishing touches," reads a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/512959549469100056">blog post from the developer</a>. "Please note we do not yet have a v1.0 launch date, though we'll share more as soon as we can."</p>

<p>It continues: "As we wind down our Early Access phase, our goal remains ensuring we've created our biggest, most replayable, most feature-rich game yet, and - most importantly - a worthy successor to the original Hades.</p>
<p>"We have a big game to wrap up! While we can't yet say when our v1.0 launch will be, we're very excited to be getting close, and to share the complete experience with you. This also means some of the most important work on Hades 2 is still to come, so may moonlight guide us! And to all our Early Access players, thank you for being here, and sharing your impressions of The Unseen Update with us."</p>
<p>As for The Unseen Update, it adds Hidden Aspects to the Nocturnal Arms, giving each weapon an all-new fighting style to unlock; new "stronger-than-ever" Guardians to beat; expanded magicks with Godsent Hexes; fresh optional story events to strengthen bonds with characters; and revamped Umbral Flames for a "snappier fighting style".</p>
<p>The update is available for free for those who have purchased the game in early access.</p>
<p>To finish Hades 2's development, Supergiant is adding: a true ending to conclude Melinoë's story, Achievements, and final touches of polish. Hopefully that means a launch date won't be too far off.</p>
<p>At the moment the game is only available in early access on Steam, but its full launch will include a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-is-coming-to-switch-1-2-as-a-timed-console-exclusive">release on Switch and Switch 2 as a timed console exclusive</a>, as confirmed by Supergiant in April.</p>
<p>The original Hades was first released on PC and Switch in full, before arriving on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and later iOS (via Netflix).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/obsidian-says-grounded-2-wont-have-lan-multiplayer-either-and-its-a-huge-shame.1221603/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/obsidian-says-grounded-2-wont-have-lan-multiplayer-either-and-its-a-huge-shame<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Grounded 2 won't have local multiplayer support, just as there wasn't - and still isn't - LAN support in the current Grounded game. "We can confirm that Grounded 2 will be consistent with the prior game and does not support LAN multiplayer," a spokesperson from Obsidian told Eurogamer. I asked for an explanation why but was told Obsidian had nothing further to share.</p>
<p>It's a shame. The sequel presents Obsidian with an opportunity to revisit areas of the teens-shrunk-in-a-backyard co-op game that could use revision, and LAN multiplayer is one of these, trivial though it might seem.</p>
<p>Currently, in order to play Grounded with someone in the same room or house as you - and it sounds like this will be the case for the sequel - you need to connect via the internet first. In other words, you need to send a signal out of your house so it can be sent back to your house to connect to the other person's machine. The result? Latency, or lag as it's more commonly called, which causes a delayed response in the game and rubber-banding - a term used to describe characters or creatures which fast-forward suddenly to different places in the game.</p>

<p>Lag is not only annoying to play with but in Grounded's case, deadly. Back at launch, in 2020, I spent a couple of days writing guides about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grounded-spiders-wolf-spiders-orb-weavers-7041">how to kill the spiders in Grounded</a>, because they're a menace, patrolling large areas of the back garden and attacking with speed and aggression if they catch you with eyesight of them. The wolf spiders in particular were ferocious. It was possible to defeat them if you learnt their attack patterns and had precise parry timing, but it was still hard to do.</p>
<p>However, confident I could deal with the spiders, I encouraged my partner to play the game with me, both of us playing on different machines in the same room. But I couldn't beat the spiders; the lag introduced by connecting via the internet meant I couldn't reliably perform the parry timings I'd learned. If I hosted the game, that changed, but one of us always suffered high latency as a result.</p>
<p>I couldn't understand why there was no LAN support in the game, given gaming's long history with LAN multiplayer: local networks were the preferred way to play together before broadband and stable internet connections came in. Plenty of other games - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> for example - offer LAN multiplayer as standard. So I went online to see if I was the only person having the problem. I was not.</p>

<p>"How difficult would it REALLY be for the devs to enable LAN support on multiplayer?" one poster <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GroundedGame/comments/yz3osb/how_difficult_would_it_really_be_for_the_devs_to/">on Reddit asked in 2022</a>, two years after the game's release. "The rubber banding is so bad it makes me not want to play on very decent internet connections..."</p>
<p>Meanwhile <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/128939-multiplayer-lan-latency-problem/">on the Obsidian forum</a>, again in 2022, a reply to a similar thread read: "This has been an issue from day one. I have posted about it here and on other forums. I have not ever seen the developers mention anything about fixes or work arounds for players attempting to plan LAN or from the same internet connection. It's pretty sad really. In my household we have 5 copies of this game, and we are unable to play it together because of the lag and terrible performance when trying to do so, from the same internet connection."</p>
<p>A lack of LAN support in Grounded is a prevalent enough problem for me and others that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/groundeds-inch-high-garden-survival-is-getting-a-sequel-and-its-out-very-soon">when Grounded 2 was announced a couple of weeks ago</a>, the main thing I was looking for was confirmation of LAN multiplayer support. But of course it never came, despite, again, Obsidian and Xbox underlining the game's focus on co-operative multiplayer.</p>
<p>My worry reading Obsidian's response to Eurogamer, about there being no LAN support in Grounded 2, is this has become the company's stance on the matter - that Grounded 1 and 2 will simply never have LAN support. But why? Is there a fundamental issue with the game's code that prevents LAN play, or is it something to do with Microsoft requiring an Xbox Live sign-in for security and validation reasons? Perhaps it's just a way to push Xbox Live. Even if it's all of those things, I still can't see why LAN support should be an impossibility. It would help if Obisidian would explain.</p>
<p>As it stands, this is disappointing and a missed opportunity. I enjoyed Grounded and I'm excited by the sequel, but I'm put off at the prospect of high latency ruining my co-operative experience again.</p>
<p>Grounded 2 releases 29th July on Steam Early Access and the Xbox Game Preview program.</p>

<p>Oh, boy... Look, we know folks are eager to get their hands on the Switch 2, but this ain't it.</p>
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YulZM-vmg7Q">9News</a>, over 2,800 Switch 2 consoles have been stolen from a semi-truck while it was en route to a GameStop in Texas. The theft was discovered while the driver was at a Love's truck stop in Bennett, Colorado on 8th June during a routine inspection.</p>
<p>It's not, however, currently known exactly when or where the heist actually took place.</p>
<p>The total value of the consoles has been estimated at $1.4 million. Investigations are naturally still ongoing at the time of writing, so we'll just have to keep an eye on this one and see how things shake out.</p>
<p>One GameStop store recently come under fire for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-one-gamestop-apparently-stapled-receipts-to-brand-new-switch-2-boxes-and-guess-what-happened">stapling receipts to Switch 2 console boxes</a>, penetrating the packaging and damaging the console's screen inside. The company <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-gamestop-tries-to-make-light-of-switch-2-staple-fiasco-but-lands-in-more-trouble">attempted to make light of the situation</a> with an amusing social media post, but again drew criticism for having allegedly used a photo that rightly belongs to the outlet Bloomberg.</p>

            <p>The best thing about Steam's Next Fests nowadays is that there are so many games. The most terrifying thing about Steam's Next Fests nowadays is that there are so damn many games. It's no surprise then, that according to calculations by developer Chris Hanney and the GameDiscoverCo newsletter, the latest summer Next Fest continued a trend of substantial year-on-year demo number growth.</p>
<p>Hanney, a dev on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-pirate-trainer">Space Pirate Trainer</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shredders">Shredders</a> among others, has had a go at pulling the numbers on the numbers of demos uploaded to Steam during each next fest running back to 2019's Game Awards-adjacent first edition.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hanney.bsky.social/post/3lrrxxznsis2m">Hanney's findings</a>, that December 2019 Steam Game Festival saw just 44 demos go live, whereas the latest June 2025 Next Fest included 1994 of them, all vying for your eyeballs, keyboards, mice, and firstborn children. On the other hand, GameDiscoverCo's <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/who-won-june-2025s-steam-next-fest">latest newsletter</a> cites the latter number as being in the region of 2,600 demos. As GameDiscover's Simon Carless points out: "It’s difficult to get an exact demo count, because lots of games drop out late or don’t submit valid demos and have to be culled."</p>
<p>Hanney's graph cites the numbers as being pretty stable between 160-ish on the low end to 300 demos on the higher end per fest throughout most of 2020 to 2022, with some fluctuation up and down. Then, things hit June 2023, which had 344 demos, and haven't stopped increasing since then. The biggest jump it cites is from 1079 demos in 2024's October Next Fest to 1710 in this February's edition.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, GameDiscoverCo's data has October 2024's Next Fest at an even higher number of demos than June '25, putting it at 3,008. The thing both sources have in common is pointing to a general year-on-year increase in demo numbers from June 2023 to this month, aligning with the idea that Next Fests are generally getting more crowded as time goes on.</p>
<p>So, what kind of boost did the top performers get out of this latest Next Fest, with all of that competition? Well, taking <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> out of the equation as GameDiscoverCo cites it as a bit of an outlier since it fully launched during this June's Next Fest, two games are cited as <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZFAPcHkdkjZppOxWHlU6sq3qNqWBe3ExLXrDNyzEVpU/edit?gid=479676648#gid=479676648">having gained over 100,000 wishlists</a>. ARPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vindictus-defying-fate">Vindictus: Defying Fate</a> was the best non-SB performer, adding 151,605 wishlists to push its pre-fest total of 592,569 up to 744,174. Meanwhile, third place Dispatch gained 110,239 to go from 434,671 to 544,910.</p>
<p>Most of the top titles saw their wishlists multiply by similar factor in proportion to their pre-fest total. The biggest growers, and the exceptions to that trend, were the likes of Mr. Billion: Idle Rich Tycoon - which went from 864 pre-fest wishlists to 22,788, multiplying its wishlist total by 26 in the process. Topping that growth was bullet hell roguelike <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terratech">TerraTech</a> Legion, which the data cites as having grown from one solitary wishlist to 20,715, multiplying its total by, er, 20,715.</p>
<p>I looked at the <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/revealed-the-top-announcements-of">publication's data</a> on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T__AlDt9BDFsKutObeaijwp7oI9Z4Def8sGNO8GMT_Y/edit?gid=0#gid=0">'Not-E3' showcase season wishlist bumps</a>, and Next Fests are still lagging a bit behind those numbers at this point, though it is worth noting Vindictus: Defying Fate's Next Fest wishlist increase would have put it just inside the top 10 of that ranking of 'Not-E3' games' wishlists in the five days after they made their showcase appearances. Just behind Grounded 2 at 168,409 and ahead of the likes of Nioh 3 and Final Fantasy Tactics, though all of those games' totals were stating from zero.</p>
<p>GameDiscoverCo noted in its <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/which-games-hit-big-in-steams-feb?open=false#%C2%A7which-games-hit-big-in-the-feb-next-fest">February 2025 Next Fest analysis</a> that comparing that iteration to February 2024's Fest illustrated the top demos benefitting by a tiny bit more, while there was much more interest in the games further down the publication top 100 rankings, with the caveat that the substantial year-on-year growth in the total number of demos in the Next Fest arena is likely making it a lot tougher to get close to the top 100 spots.</p>
<p>This is the point that inspired Hanney's post, with the growth of Next Fests changing what they represent from the perspectives of game makers looking to use them to get eyes on their works. "The best worst part of this is always - every GDC talk [on launching games via Steam and gaining traction] is already out of date by the time it is given," wrote former Left 4 Dead writer Chet Faliszek in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chetsucks.com/post/3lrryp4swvc2g">a reply</a> to the post, "You have to be always moving, always trying new things."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Speaking to IGN, publisher Reef Entertainment explained why, and in the process lifted the lid on how licenses like these tend to work for video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reef, with the Terminator 2 license to play with, has the rights to use the characters from the movie such as Sarah and John Connor, and on top of that, it has image rights for certain actors who have provided those rights to Studio Canal, which owns the rights to the first two Terminator films, as part of the agreement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the rights to use the Terminator itself does not include the rights to use Arnie's likeness. That’s why Terminator 2D: No Fate uses the endoskeleton for character artwork, rather than Arnie’s likeness.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/18/gettyimages-1203004081-1750236768610.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Michael Edwards as Old John Connor.

Terminator 2D: No Fate includes gameplay that sees the player control future war John Connor in a fight against the machines, fleshing out that brief opening scene in the movie into an entire section of the video game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the movie, you only see Edwards’ John Connor for a few seconds, but those seconds are memorable indeed; his heavily scarred face and steely gaze looking out over the battlefield tell us he’s seen and done all sorts in humanity’s desperate struggle for survival against the machines. So Reef reached out separately to the 80-year-old actor to do a deal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(It turns out that in 2021, Edwards reprised the role of John Connor in a fan-made Terminator film called <a href="https://youtu.be/tF89pdWxaZw?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skynet</a>.)</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/18/screenshot-2025-06-18-095636-1750237011381.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Michael Edwards reprised the role of John Connor in 2021 fan film Skynet.

After all, Mortal Kombat developer NetherRealm has managed it multiple times, most recently for Mortal Kombat 1’s DLC character Conan the Barbarian. Before that, NetherRealm managed to get Arnie for the Terminator T-800 DLC character in Mortal Kombat 11. But there’s a gulf between the scope of a game like Terminator 2D: No Fate and the Warner Bros.-backed Mortal Kombat series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it’s worth noting that while NetherRealm’s Arnie likeness is in, a soundalike voice actor (Chris Cox) was used for his lines. It doesn’t look like the 77-year-old Schwarzenegger is in the business of doing video game voice work.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s Reed Entertainment’s comment to IGN on how all this works in full:</p><blockquote>Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't in the game it’s just a T800. We didn't have his license, unfortunately. But for the rest, you have to ask each actor individually to use his portrait.</blockquote><blockquote>What we have is the right to use the characters. So like Sarah, John, T1000, T800, and then certain actors will also provide image rights to Studio Canal, which is included in the agreement. For example; Linda Hamilton is Sarah Connor, which is why you can see Linda at the beginning of the trailer. Whereas our right to use the Terminator itself, it doesn't include Arnold. When you see the character artwork for that, you'll see it's like the Terminator itself rather than Arnold. It's basically the endoskeleton that we have the right to use.</blockquote><blockquote>Michael Edwards played the future war version of John in the opening of T2. You see him, he lowers his binoculars, he's looking over the battlefield. Someone like that, we reached out separately to him to include his likeness. There's a definite difference between signing the T2 license and having the agreement to use the characters compared to the actor's likeness, which is separate.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by CBS via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

There is also, as it turns out, a limit on just how many you can have stored up in your hideaway.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1ldjmds/you_cant_play_if_you_have_too_many_relics/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One user on the r/Nightreign subreddit</a> posted an image from their Elden Ring Nightreign game today, with a special message appearing over their attempts to start an expedition. "Cannot launch expedition: Too many relics in possession," read the message. "Please use the relic rite menu to sell off spares."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The user u/Scufozzover1 didn't specify exactly how many they had, only <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1ldjmds/you_cant_play_if_you_have_too_many_relics/my8yo5m/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ball-parking an estimate</a> of "upwards of 1000 maybe." It's easy to theorize this might be related to a general 999 item limit, but unless you'd like to grind out that many relics, it's unclear where the limit actually is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of reasons to clear out your relic storage, mostly for resources. Though if you're just playing run after run of Elden Ring Nightreign I could see losing track of just how many you've accrued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Comments in the thread have brought up an old critique of Elden Ring Nightreign: the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1ld2tlg/this_game_is_in_dire_need_of_a_better_relic/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">need for relic management</a>. As more relics flood in, it can become a little difficult to keep track of what's what, or adding additional filters that could better sift through the pile.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's already a bit of a hassle for me now, as I've built up a decent stockpile of basic relics, so I can't imagine what it's like for this Redditor and their apparent hundreds upon hundreds of relics. Maybe this won't be an issue for most players now, but as the weeks and months of Nightreign roll on, it might be worth keeping an eye on. At the very least, it's a good reminder to clean out your unused relics every now and then.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
