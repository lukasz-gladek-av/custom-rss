He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.</span></span></span></p><p><time datetime="2024-06-20T18:19:06.457Z"> <!-- -->Jun 20, 2024, 6:19 PM UTC</time></p><div><h2>Share this story</h2></div></div></div><div><div><p><em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</em> was Ubisoft’s breakout hit of 2003, but the company’s cult classic <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em>, released just two weeks later, will beat it to an upgraded rerelease. Ubisoft has released a trailer for <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition </em>that confirms it’ll arrive next Tuesday, June 25th — just five days after I write these words. </p><p>I hope it stands up because I remember it as a phenomenal game. Jade and her pig buddy Pey’j were memorable characters with a remarkably lived-in sci-fi world, where you wield a camera and a mean stick rather than resorting to gunplay. It struck enough of a chord that gamers have been clamoring for a sequel ever since — but <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em> has now been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/16/23557146/beyond-good-and-evil-2-not-canceled-development-hell">stuck in development hell</a> for 15 years, longer than even the infamous <em>Duke Nukem Forever.</em></p><div><figcaption><em>The camera is your most important tool in BG&amp;E.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Ubisoft</cite></p></div><p>Here’s how Ubisoft’s trailer description describes the <em>20th Anniversary Edition</em> remaster:</p><div><blockquote><p>Embark on this epic adventure in up to 4K, 60fps with improved graphics, controls and audio. Explore the anniversary gallery, and discover more about Jade’s childhood in the new treasure hunt! </p></blockquote></div><p>The trailer also mentions a “reorchestrated soundtrack.” Last year, we were also told it would have autosave and cross-save features, which could make it a good bit more pick up and play than the original, since 2003 was the still the era of save points in video games. I’ll probably play it handheld! </p><p>We knew the remaster was coming — Ubisoft even accidentally released an unfinished version of the game last November and was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/29/23980960/beyond-good-and-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-2024">forced to confirm its existence early</a>! And earlier today, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-officially-unveiled-in-since-deleted-ubisoft-tweet">it deleted a tweet</a> that accidentally revealed the June 25th release date, too. <a href="https://www.exophase.com/game/beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-psn/trophies/">The game’s trophies leaked</a> earlier this month. And Ubisoft also appears to have <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/beyond-good-evil-delisted-ahead-of-20th-anniversary-editions-reveal-this-week/">delisted the original game from Steam</a>, though — as usual — existing owners like me can still download it just fine. Let me know if you see that change. </p><div><p>Meanwhile, the <em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</em>, which should be a ground-up redo rather than a remaster and has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/10/24126462/prince-of-persia-sands-remake-yuri-lowenthal">also seen its share of delays and even complete development reboots</a>, is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24175567/the-sands-of-time-is-still-alive">now coming in 2026</a>.</p></div></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24181027/netflix-house-retail-dallas-king-of-prussia-2025"><h2>Netflix House will fill the voids left by dead department stores</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/19/24181870/openai-former-chief-scientist-ilya-sutskever-ssi-safe-superintelligence"><h2>OpenAI’s former chief scientist is starting a new AI company</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180615/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-nintendo-direct"><h2>Zelda is finally getting her own game</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/17/24180340/apple-pay-later-shutting-down-months-after-launch"><h2>Apple is shutting down Apple Pay Later just months after launch</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/19/24181214/eu-chat-control-law-propose-scanning-encrypted-messages-csam"><h2>EU chat control law proposes scanning your messages — even encrypted ones</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24182478/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-fan-art-memes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="CR8mSd">Nintendo has revealed that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24181064/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-nintendo-switch-princess-peach">Princess Zelda will lead as the playable protagonist</a> in the newly announced game, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24180883/legend-of-zelda-echoes-wisdom-nintendo-switch-release-date"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a>. Instead of swinging the iconic Master Sword, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24181059/legend-of-zelda-echoes-wisdom-why-no-sword-gameplay-nintendo-link">Zelda wields the Tri Rod</a>, a magical tool that can allow her to replicate items and creatures from the larger environment. Now, anything from a wooden table to a monster can be summoned by Zelda to explore the world, solve puzzles, and fight. </p>
<p id="lra3Nv">Using materials in unexpected ways isn’t exactly anything new for The Legend of Zelda fans.    If anything, the sandbox elements of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23718684/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-switch-totk"><em>Tears of Kingdom</em></a><em> </em>already pushed this way of playing to the max. Anything from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/legend-zelda-tears-kingdom/23723279/totk-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-bridge-totk">a pile of logs</a> to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tearsofthekingdom/comments/13xxxjs/did_you_know_that_you_can_attach_icy_meat_to_your/">frozen slab of meat</a> could be viable materials for building zany contraptions. However, <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>revives the charm and humor of using unconventional tools to save Hyrule. Mainly, it’s just great to think about the princess aggressively saving Link from his death by wielding nothing but a chair and a kitchen table. </p>
<p id="5GzQpy">Now fans have filled X with posts and fan art celebrating the protagonist and her newfound set of magical powers. This first piece of art portrays the enormous potential of “table power,” but you can scroll on to see more. </p>







<p id="UP0fqi">Based on the gameplay demonstration shown on Tuesday, Zelda needs to be able to see and scan an item first with her rod before she can replicate it. I don’t think there are any guns in Hyrule, but that hasn’t stopped fans from fans imagining what could happen if she were able to create one.</p>


<p id="y6EiHs">Part of the trailer showed Zelda carrying a hefty rock, so a lot of the art reimagines the moment where the tiny princess picks up the large boulder. </p>


<p id="FyK1QV">And then if good old goofs and memes are your game, well there are already plenty of those too. Here are two of the funniest ones we found. </p>


<p id="i23voC"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> is coming out on Nintendo Switch on Sept. 26.  </p>

<h3 id="KnYvBD"><strong>Challenge Updates</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li id="nzz8Mb">All past incomplete Weekly Challenges can be completed at any time in a given season.</li>

</ul>
<p id="TLcYth"><strong>Weekly Milestones</strong></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="Qn6gA1"><strong>Competitive Play Updates</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li id="MIMa9T">Rank Percentage is now displayed on the Competitive Progress page allowing you to check your exact percentage without playing another match.</li>
<li id="TWx4dP">Renamed the Modifiers “Win Streak” and “Loss Streak” to “Win Trend” and “Loss Trend” to more accurately convey that these modifiers are calculated by weighing the most recent games more heavily, but that they are not true streaks.</li>
<li id="HwbENL">Added more parameters for how the matchmaker handles wide groups, so that it can ensure better queue times.</li>
<li id="G5qnyN">A button that allows you to view the match’s final Scoreboard has been added to each page during the end-of-game flow.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="qE696k"><strong>Hero Updates</strong></h3>
<h4 id="TRTQzC"><strong>General</strong></h4>
<ul><li id="EriyHW">Knockdown time when two charging abilities collide reduced from 2 to 1.7 seconds.</li></ul>
<p id="uFBbKH"><em>Developer Comments: This stun time reduction applies to the knockdown that happens when two charging abilities collide and result in a tie (with Reinhardt, Doomfist, Brigitte, Mauga, Bob). The counterplay and interaction of two charging abilities impacting each other is great, but it took both players out of the fight a little too long.</em></p>
<h4 id="tpA2h9"><strong>Tank</strong></h4>
<p id="U1cObz"><strong>D.Va</strong></p>
<p id="gpCgp5">Boosters</p>
<ul><li id="1QARct">Impact damage increased from 15 to 25.</li></ul>
<p id="EitHDk">Fusion Cannons</p>
<ul><li id="wG2PLp">Weapon spread reduced from 3.75 to 3.375 degrees.</li></ul>
<p id="tZBRsO"><em>Developer Comments: These changes will improve D.Va’s effectiveness against smaller targets as she became less effective against armored enemies in the previous patch.</em></p>
<p id="73GHwc"><strong>Junker Queen</strong></p>
<p id="7jbpS2">Rampage</p>
<ul><li id="UeNGlR">Startup time reduced from 0.75 to 0.5 seconds.</li></ul>
<p id="Ni6H4N">Jagged Blade</p>
<ul><li id="5BuGAO">Now pulls tanks further.</li></ul>
<p id="cnBI6z"><em>Developer Comments: The Tank knockback resistance passive was affecting Junker Queen’s pull effect more than intended. The distance can be affected by their movement, but Tanks are now pulled in about 5-6 meters instead of only 3 meters or so.</em></p>
<p id="CX6CAN"><strong>Orisa</strong></p>
<p id="pVz6FB">Javelin Spin</p>
<ul><li id="7I8uEW">Cooldown reduced from 9 to 8 seconds.</li></ul>
<p id="SJpIuH"><em>Developer Comments: Orisa’s survivability was reduced more than necessary in her last round of changes so we’re partially reverting the cooldown increase to Javelin Spin.</em></p>
<p id="FFPpVy"><strong>Roadhog</strong></p>
<ul><li id="SNTbMk">Base health reduced from 650 to 600.</li></ul>
<p id="2I5VMq">Take a Breather</p>
<ul><li id="nPO7KB">Damage reduction reduced from 50% to 40%.</li></ul>
<p id="Y84hNM"><em>Developer Comments: Roadhog’s already-powerful survivability increased significantly with the headshot damage reduction from the tank role passive so these changes are to help bring that back in line.</em></p>
<h4 id="XnAMqM">Damage</h4>
<p id="kqLp3Q"><strong>Cassidy</strong></p>
<p id="jaGoRR">Flashbang</p>
<ul>
<li id="c0ZJKk">Magnetic Grenade ability is now Flashbang.</li>
<li id="wA7PFn">Hinders enemies instead of Stunning them for 1.2 seconds.</li>
<li id="NdsMNL">Movement speed reduction increased from 30% to 50%.</li>
<li id="0WYdRD">Hinder now prevents crouching movement.</li>
<li id="J5rhVX">45 explosive damage.</li>
<li id="AviSwm">12 second cooldown.</li>
</ul>
<p id="Va7LOZ">Deadeye</p>
<ul>
<li id="BfpfLN">Movement speed penalty now scales down over time, from 70% to 35%.</li>
<li id="G1dPqd">Damage reduction now scales down over time, from 40% to 0%.</li>
</ul>
<p id="zlSSfz">Combat Roll</p>
<ul><li id="qo9HaG">Damage reduction reduced from 75% to 50%.</li></ul>
<p id="NFtYP1">Peacekeeper</p>
<ul><li id="BWmTYT">Secondary fire “Fan the Hammer” damage reduced from 50 to 45.</li></ul>
<p id="IuKmiM"><em>Developer Comments: We’re reverting the Magnetic Grenade ability to be deployed like Cassidy’s previous Flashbang ability, but it will keep the Hinder effect instead of a full stun. We’ve heard feedback surrounding the Magnetic Grenade ability and agree that while the fantasy of a homing grenade was fun, the moment-to-moment gameplay of it often felt too unpredictable as to whether it would land or not. The Hinder effect has been a useful tool to act as a counter to highly mobile heroes without going back to a full stun and the enemy player losing the ability to fight back.</em></p>
<p id="UaPTCS"><em>The Deadeye ultimate is getting an adjustment to increase its flexibility toward the end of its duration, enabling it to get value outside of buying time for Cassidy or his allies, though it may be riskier to hold it for a long time as the damage reduction will fade away along with the movement speed penalty.</em></p>
<p id="d662B5"><strong>Mei</strong></p>
<p id="vYfCU4">Endothermic Blaster</p>
<ul>
<li id="xK0Bvf">Secondary fire base projectile size reduced from 0.15 to 0.12 meters.</li>
<li id="pGItN3">Secondary fire damage increased from 75 to 85.</li>
</ul>
<p id="KPItKb"><em>Developer Comments: Mei’s damage output over time is intended to be on the low end for a Damage hero, as she offers strong utility and survivability through her ability kit, but we would like to make the secondary fire icicle more rewarding by increasing the damage and slightly more difficult to land consistently.</em></p>
<p id="aOAH0a"><strong>Reaper</strong></p>
<p id="v1LhpF">Hellfire Shotguns</p>
<ul><li id="Q9pD3p">Weapon spread reduced from 6.5 to 6 degrees.</li></ul>
<p id="WDruLK">Shadow Step</p>
<ul><li id="azKZOP">Cast time reduced from 1.5 to 1.2 seconds.</li></ul>
<p id="X5sCSK"><em>Developer Comments: With the previous patch change to how armor reduces damage, shotgun weapon heroes like Reaper lost some value since much of their game plan revolved around pressuring large tank heroes. To help shift Reaper toward being more effective against smaller targets we’re tightening the weapon spread on the Hellfire Shotguns and reducing the amount of time enemies have to react to his Shadow Step teleport.</em></p>
<p id="fujuZW"><strong>Sojourn</strong></p>
<p id="rveKNz">Railgun</p>
<ul>
<li id="MQjuKd">Secondary fire damage scaling reduced from 30-130 damage down to 1-100 damage.</li>
<li id="IvJHGh">Secondary fire projectile no longer requires Overclock to pierce enemy players.</li>
<li id="hyxEIo">Primary fire shots per second increased from 14 to 16.</li>
</ul>
<p id="OA2rK1">Overclock</p>
<ul><li id="cJu1Ay">Energy charge rate increased from 100 to 120 per second.</li></ul>
<p id="2clk2t"><em>Developer Comments: This change is reducing the burst damage potential of the secondary fire Railgun shot to both lessen frustration from playing against that burst damage, and to shift power into her sustained primary fire damage. This should smooth out the feast-or-famine nature of Sojourn consistently hitting the secondary fire shots.</em></p>
<p id="jTlZYW"><strong>Symmetra</strong></p>
<ul><li id="Li3Pci">Base health increased from 100 to 125 (Total health increased from 250 to 275).</li></ul>
<p id="KrPQx0">Photon Projector</p>
<ul><li id="3UQHpH">Primary fire charge rate increased 25%.</li></ul>
<p id="d7hNzQ"><em>Developer Comments: To help solidify Symmetra as a close-range threat, we’re increasing her health to better survive in that range, along with how quickly her primary fire beam damage ramps up.</em></p>
<h4 id="eEaDYb"><strong>Support</strong></h4>
<p id="kdqss0"><strong>Illari</strong></p>
<p id="VFDsRg">Healing Pylon</p>
<ul>
<li id="9aaoZ2">Healing per projectile increased from 30 to 40.</li>
<li id="sGCiC4">Pylon healing is now only half as effective when targeting Illari.</li>
<li id="isicGW">Max health increased from 100 to 125.</li>
</ul>
<p id="QgJySW">Outburst</p>
<ul><li id="Iv0Jpk">Damage increased from 10 to 25.</li></ul>
<p id="1nEHMS"><em>Developer Comments: Illari’s Healing Pylon is intended to be useful for healing her team in relatively safe positions without much focus required, which enables her to either apply pressure with her primary fire or spot heal in bursts from her more limited secondary fire healing beam. To encourage this, it now has improved health and healing output, but is less effective when Illari uses it to heal herself.</em></p>
<p id="8V5eR0"><strong>Kiriko</strong></p>
<p id="qZrvHT">Protection Suzu</p>
<ul><li id="nlK4lY">No longer cleanses hard knockdown stuns.</li></ul>
<p id="cieNGT">Swift Step</p>
<ul><li id="fCdWcV">Cooldown increased from 7 to 8 seconds.</li></ul>
<p id="TsNH1X"><em>Developer Comments: “Hard knockdown stuns” refer to most all of the existing knockdowns where the player is stunned and laying on the ground (such as Reinhardt’s Earthshatter), with the exception of Ana’s Sleep Dart effect, which is removed upon taking damage or Protection Suzu’s cleanse.</em></p>
<h3 id="hKTg2i"><strong>Map Updates</strong></h3>
<p id="BtQQcF"><strong>Colosseo</strong></p>
<ul>
<li id="Sd7HGU">Removed the glass and added stairs at first checkpoint for additional pathing and combat opportunities.</li>
<li id="1Rq0vp">Extended the map with a new lowered section and mega health pack behind the second checkpoint for flank/rotational strategies</li>
<li id="8BRFUa">Added a route through a building that connects spawn/final point to second checkpoint.</li>
<li id="C6z2DG">The initial spawn building has been pulled back to give players more room to smoothly navigate the area out front. There is no added run back time with this change.</li>
<li id="jph9o8">The stairs and cover surrounding the final point have been adjusted to improve the flow of the space and to help teams safely defend the final point.</li>
</ul>
<p id="Aij2Zm"><strong>Push Game Mode</strong></p>
<ul>
<li id="qEydHw">Reduced the match time from 10 minutes to 8 minutes in Quick Play.</li>
<li id="ipWozc">Increased push robot speed by 10% when pushing the barricade for both Quick Play and Competitive.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6xg75k"><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h3>
<h4 id="eDMCZz"><strong>Maps</strong></h4>
<p id="yMb4A2"><strong>Numbani</strong></p>
<ul><li id="XfwAPZ">Fixed pieces of the environment that allowed abilities to pass through it.</li></ul>
<p id="Mj7qZa"><strong>New Junk City</strong></p>
<ul><li id="4x4Hn6">Fixed lighting in some areas of the map.</li></ul>
<p id="gB2UWc"><strong>Hollywood</strong></p>
<ul><li id="PIFKvD">Fixed areas of the map that could cause players to become temporarily stuck.</li></ul>

<p id="cjFIdO"><strong>Reinhardt</strong></p>
<ul><li id="AB93bB">Charge now correctly damages Ice Wall and Tree of Life.</li></ul>
<p id="pTXE4Y"><strong>Venture</strong></p>
<ul>
<li id="XFUvN1">Fixed an interaction that allowed Venture to stay burrowed indefinitely.• Fixed the description of Drill Dash to match its functionality.</li>
<li id="PDs82p">Fixed a bug with Tectonic Shock that could allow it to charge Venture’s Ultimate Meter some situations.</li>

<p>Green Hell was first released back in 2019, joining an ever-growing line-up of open-world survival titles that pitted players against the elements. Green Hell’s draw was that it was more realistic than its competitors, boasting unique elements that required players to manage both their mental and physical health while they navigated a massive jungle and fought to survive. </p>



<p>It was just revealed by the game’s developer, Creepy Jar, that the title has surpassed six million sales since being released in 2018, averaging a cool 1.2 million sales per year.</p>

<h2 id="h-learn-to-survive">Learn to Survive</h2>



<p>Green Hell was well-reviewed when it dropped in 2019, and since then, it landed on a few more platforms, coming to Nintendo Switch in 2020 and then winding up on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in 2021. The staggered release pattern served the game well, with the player count remaining relatively consistent as free updates were deployed by Creepy Jar.</p>



<p>In April, the team pushed out the twentieth free update for the game, introducing new animals, survival mechanics, and construction blueprints. In the years that have followed since the game’s launch, the developers have introduced controller support, a cooperative story mode, an achievements system, farming, countless building features, and new enemies. That’s not bad considering the game always seems to be on sale somewhere for just a few dollars.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Survival games like Green Hell have blown up in recent years. Titles like Sons of the Forest, Valheim, ARK, Subnautica, Raft, SCUM, and V Rising all found popularity in the market for their intense levels of freedom, base-building mechanics, and at times challenging combat sequences.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">What wasn't previously detailed was the ability for players to now ride their spectral steed during the game's final boss battle, or the myriad of weapon and skill balance changes listed in the full patch notes.</p><p dir="ltr">The full list of changes can be read below, but there are a few specific changes worth noting. In PvP, a number of powerful skills, like Ancient Lightning Spear, Flaming Strike, Cursed-Blood Slash, and Transient Moonlight, now deal less damage. Also on the PvP front, a number of weapon types have had their poise damage increased or decreased depending on what the opponent is using, and the poise damage of various dual-wielded weapons has also been decreased.</p><p dir="ltr">On PvE and PvP side of the equation, a number of weapons, like the Troll Knight's Sword, Zamor Curved Sword, and Forked Hatchet, now deal more damage. A number of staves and Seals have had their attribute scaling increased as well. Weapon types like axes, greataxes, hammers, flails, and reapers have had their attack speed increased, while axes, greataxes, and some colossal weapons now deal more damage with their charged attacks. Whips (the Ulmi whip being an exception) have also seen a damage increase. Consecutive attacks made with light bows and longbows are faster, too.</p><p dir="ltr">The update enables support for Shadow of the Erdtree, but the DLC itself is not required to receive the free Elden Ring update. For those wondering precisely when the DLC becomes available in each region, publisher Bandai Namco has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-launch-times-revealed/1100-6524289/" data-ref-id="1100-6524289">revealed Shadow of the Erdtree's specific launch times</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review-kill-them-with-kindness/1900-6418243/" data-ref-id="1900-6418243">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review</a>, we called From Software's ambitious expansion a "victory lap" for the developer, and "an unmissable tour de force that is every bit as brilliant as the original game."</p><h2 dir="ltr">Elden Ring Patch 1.12 Notes</h2><h2>New feature</h2><ul><li>Added support for the SHADOW OF THE ERDTREE DLC.</li><li>Five new hairstyles have been added to the game.

You can also use powers like High Roller to temporarily increase your maximum dice roll limit, allowing you to maximize your points if you get lucky with your rolls.

            <p>
After a bit of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-and-evil-remaster-news-teased-for-showcase-tomorrow">teasing</a> and some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-and-evil-delisting-prompts-speculation-of-imminent-remaster-release">original edition delisting</a>, Ubisoft has - slightly prematurely, it would seem - announced a release date for its Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition remaster. According to a now-deleted social media post, it's coming to PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Switch next Tuesday, 25th June - with new in-game content and more.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/people-are-now-playing-ubisofts-still-unannounced-beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition">confirmed</a> it was working on a remaster of its much-loved 2003 action-adventure Beyond Good and Evil last November, after a "technical error" inadvertently granted some Ubisoft+ subscribers access to an early development build. And now, somewhat sooner than expected (Ubisoft had originally told fans to keep an eye out for news during tonight's Limited Run Games showcase), fresh details have emerged.
</p>
<p>
Alongside a 25th June release date on PC and consoles, Ubisoft's social media post confirmed its new Beyond Good and Evil remaster will feature (thanks <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/06/beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-launches-june-25-for-ps5-xbox-series-ps4-xbox-one-switch-and-pc?s=31">Gematsu</a>) a bunch of presentational upgrades and some new in-game content too. For starters, there's 4K support at 60fps - as well as the more nebulous promise of "improved graphics, controls, and audio" - and the game is getting autosave and cross-save features too.

<p>
Additionally, Beyond Good and Evil's original adventure - which follows reporter Jade as she investigates a terrible government conspiracy with some help from her pig pal Pey'j - now features new treasure hunts revealing more about Jade's past, plus "new rewards" to find while exploring. There's also a new speedrun mode, updated achievements, and a gallery featuring behind-the-scenes details.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft also briefly shared a trailer showcasing Beyond Good and Evil's remaster, but that's now been pulled too. Expect it to resurface during tonight's Limited Run Games showcase - airing at 7pm BST/11am PT/2pm ET - which will hopefully include pricing details too. The price point should be particularly interesting given Ubisoft's decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-and-evil-delisting-prompts-speculation-of-imminent-remaster-release">delist the relatively inexpensive earlier version</a> from Steam and the Xbox Store this week - although PC players can <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/beyond_good_and_evil">currently pick it up via GOG for £1.29</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24182462/tips-for-starting-shadow-of-the-erdtree-elden-ring<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Before <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> finally goes live, Bandai Namco has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178537/great-haircut-tarnished">implemented a patch</a> that adds a couple of small features and updates just in time for the DLC’s launch in a few short hours. FromSoftware also shared a new launch trailer to herald the DLC’s arrival, but it’s chockful of spoilers, so beware. The update isn’t particularly earth-shattering, but it does include some things worth keeping in mind before all you Tarnished <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc">get your head beat in by the vicious monsters patrolling the Shadow Lands</a>.</p><p>Firstly, we get new hair options! I was pretty down on <em>Elden Ring</em>’s character creator <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/25/22951205/elden-rings-character-creator-black-hairstyles">for its lack of Black hairstyles</a>. It just didn’t make sense that the character creator was so robust and detailed but lacked hairstyles that represent a good chunk of the human population. There are five new styles to choose from, with two of them being dreadlocks. I chose the loose loc option so my Tarnished can finally get rid of her abhorrent pigtails. I’m not sure if the “white hairs” option was present in the base game or a new addition with this patch, but I really like how it adds gray to my locs, reminding me of when I started picking out errant gray hairs when I had locs.</p><div><figcaption><em>Hooray! New hair options!</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: FromSoftware</cite></p></div><p>To change your appearance, all you have to do is visit <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fia">Fia, Deathbed Companion</a>’s room at the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Roundtable+Hold">Roundtable Hold</a>. She should have a mirror you can interact with that will let you change your appearance. However! If you’re like me and have completed Fia’s questline, neither she nor her mirror will be present at the Roundtable Hold. Instead, travel to the Raya Lucaria Grand Library site of grace and talk to Rennala. You’ll be able to change your appearance through her.</p><p>Secondly — and this is arguably the best little housekeeping update the game has had — the new patch lets you see all your recently acquired items. From now on, new items you pick up either in the Lands Between or the DLC’s Shadow Lands will be marked with a little exclamation point. The game will even collect those new items under their own tab, though that “new items” tab isn’t enabled by default. You have to go into the game’s settings and select the “Show recent items tab” option.</p><div><p><strong>Tarnished note:</strong> remember, you cannot apply weapon greases to enchanted weapons like the Moonveil Katana. Carry around a high-powered but basic weapon to use them.</p></div><p>It was extremely helpful in my journey to see the new items and equipment I picked up so I could compare them to the stuff I’d been carrying around for the last 100 hours. Without it, I would have missed the new “Festive Grease” item that increases the number of runes you earn every time you land an attack and the little notes I picked in my travels that hint at where to go next. The “new items” feature makes choosing the right gear and weapons to tackle all the new threats in <em>Shadows of the Erdtree</em> so much easier. Enable it right away.</p><p>Beyond that, the patch adds a bunch of weapon balance changes and helpfully tweaks the summoning pool feature for folks who need help taking down Mohg, Lord of Blood, in order to access the DLC. The new patch will also let you summon your faithful horse-goat Torrent during the Elden Beast fight, which will undoubtedly make that final encounter loads easier.

Turns out it’s a move taken from one of the mini-bosses in <em>Sekiro</em>.

According to Bandai Namco <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-107">on the game’s website</a>, the patch intends to “encourage more versatility in terms of gameplay” — if “encourage” also means “make you a nigh unkillable god in single player.” A lot of weapons and spells were buffed, very few things were nerfed, and it seems like it’s going to get a lot harder to kill your friends in PVP. The patch notes are indeed massive, but I’ve picked out a few highlights.</p><p><strong>Glintstone Pebble / Shard Spiral: </strong>increased attack power </p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/13/23402616/elden-ring-dlc-patch-notes-update">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-25f0b8ed-7cd2-4ce1-a29e-5c990e2b8e10"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/4/23009950/elden-ring-giant-map-game-design-from-software">All hail Elden Ring’s ever-growing map</a></h2><p>One of <em>Elden Ring’s</em> most polarizing features is its willingness to withhold information. While it’s less arcane than earlier FromSoftware titles like <em>Dark Souls</em>, the game constantly hands you items, quests, and mechanics <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/28/22954823/elden-ring-open-world-guide">with very little explanation</a>. But after 130 hours and counting in the Lands Between, I’m in love with how well it sometimes deploys that obscurity. And there’s no better example than <em>Elden Ring’s</em> map, which has transcended a simple open-world convention to become one of my very favorite pieces of the game.</p><p>If you’re still in the early areas of <em>Elden Ring</em>, you might want to skip this post because I’m going to talk about a mechanic that relies on mystery. But if you’ve played a bit of the game, you might know what I’m talking about. <em>Elden Ring’s </em>map offers a constant give-and-take of showing players new spaces to explore, then pulling back a curtain to more places that they didn’t even realize could <em>exist. </em>It withholds information only to reveal it in a way that’s delightful, satisfying, and entirely in keeping with the world’s vast scope. It’s not just an interface element — it’s a meta-game in its own right.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/4/23009950/elden-ring-giant-map-game-design-from-software">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-1f35292d-22d9-439f-860e-b2081da09671"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/15/22979436/elden-ring-speedrunners-world-record-race-30-minutes">Elden Ring speedrunners race to the bottom</a></h2><p><em>Elden Ring</em> is just so massive and its bosses are so tough that the average player will probably take over 60 hours to beat it. But speedrunners, assisted by some traditional speedrunning tricks and the game’s own open design, have somehow managed to beat the sprawling game in under 30 minutes.</p><p>For a speedrunning enthusiast, the first days of a game’s release are extremely exciting. New techniques and optimizations are constantly being discovered, as boss behaviors and the runner’s own luck work with or against them, making almost every run a possible world record. While every runner is ostensibly competing against the clock, two runners have emerged in the <em>Elden Ring</em> speed community, each racing to post lower and lower times.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/15/22979436/elden-ring-speedrunners-world-record-race-30-minutes">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-09122418-f13d-437e-b87d-28b971708154"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/11/22973032/elden-ring-easy-rune-farm-dragon-caelid">I’ve made a huge mistake in Elden Ring</a></h2><p>In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>, it’s killed or be killed — brutally. The game is designed to put you ever on the defensive, ready to lash out before you yourself can be lashed. But that shoot first, ask questions later mindset led to an event I truly and deeply regret. I killed a dragon, and I feel really awful about it.</p><p>In <em>Elden Ring</em>, even the damn flowers are dangerous, but contrary to the game’s reputation, not everything in the Lands Between wants to kill you. There are those cute rodents that scurry about and delightful little donut-rolling sheep that exist only to bleat at you as you zip by them on Torrent. I’ve had so many peaceful moments sitting on the edge of a cliff, gazing in wondrous awe at the golden Erdtree with a convocation of eagles for company. I’d never think to kill any of these creatures because, for one, they’re worth a pitiful amount of runes, and secondly, they’re harmless.&nbsp;(Editor’s note: <a href="https://twitter.com/A_Webster/status/1500278513567469568">killing the calm, wise old tortoises</a> should be punished by a full game restart, even if it’s an accident.)</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/11/22973032/elden-ring-easy-rune-farm-dragon-caelid">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-fbb524f6-1d69-4ae1-b31e-14edb14ee6c0"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/28/22954823/elden-ring-open-world-guide">Elden Ring’s world is full of mystery, but I’d rather wait for a guide</a></h2><p>It seems like everyone, even people who don’t usually partake in FromSoftware games, is playing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>.

Though the many classes present a paralyzing wealth of options, it’s not the question of what class to play that has me stuck. It’s the character creator.

I was too young to read these tales of sex and violence, but those hand-painted covers, full of dragons and swords and ancient ruins, held a promise of adventure that captivated me.

            <p>Picture a himbo tent. Now, see if you can get your mind around the concept of a flirtatious windmill. What exactly are the key architectural qualities of dwellings you might wish to go to bed with? Actually, don’t bother stretching your grey matter – you can just play Building Relationships, which is sort of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-short-hike">A Short Hike</a> but also, Love Island for anthropomorphic toy houses. There are demos on <a href="https://tanatb.itch.io/building-relationships-beginnings">Itch</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2666920/Building_Relationships/">Steam</a>.

<p>I played a bit of Building Relationships at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/everything-announced-and-featured-at-day-of-the-devs-2024-in-one-place">Day Of The Devs</a> booth at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/summer-game-fest">Summer Game Fest</a> last week. That particular booth is a smear of half-memories, because the organisers asked us to play five games inside an hour, and this being Day Of The Devs, it was a regular cornucopia of concepts, styles and subject matters. I went from playing While Waiting, a game about occupying your mind while you’re waiting, to After Love EP, a game about death, grief and rock music, to UFO50, which is 50 games that together form a mosaic of meta-gaming mystery. Also Phoenix Springs, a dystopian adventure notable for a clipped English voiceover so dispassionate I stepped away feeling dehydrated. Write-ups for those to follow once I've worked out where one game ended and the next began.</p>
<p>Building Relationships stands out the most in hindsight because it felt the most at ease in its own skin and also, because it's not every day you get to chat up a small apartment building. (I personally wouldn't date an apartment building because all the ones I've lived in had mold, but this one had a certain forlorn charisma, reminiscent of that friend who's too busy pairing off everybody else to find love himself.) It's a pocket open worlder with boisterous katamari physics in which you bounce about fluttering your curtains at bungalows and completing very simple quests, such as fishing (in this case, for cars). It is a game wholly invested in the act of enjoying a pun, which is surely the definition of a promising first date. It has pleasantly daft writing, blossoming biomes that remind me of Proteus a bit, and some amusing camera angle choices during conversation.</p>
<p>Building Relationships is the debut Steam release of Tanat Boozayaangool, who is also the creator of <a href="https://tanatb.itch.io/to-remember-a-massacre">sinister trivia games</a> and <a href="https://tanatb.itch.io/in-bed-cant-sleep">visual novels about not being able to sleep</a>. Here is a little excerpt from <a href="https://tanatb.carrd.co/">the developer’s web page</a>: "There's a joy in absurdity, suspending all levels of disbelief and immersing yourself in the wildest world. And there you'll find the most human story, anchoring the most ridiculous narrative."</p>

			<p>Today, publisher Focus Home Interactive and developer Saber Interactive released a 6-minute gameplay overview of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2. Creative Director Oliver Hollis-Leick explained:</p>
<p><em>The game's campaign mode allows you to experience this epic story either solo or with up to three players in co-op. The story of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 begins centuries after the events of the first game. Captain Dimitrian Titus is a genetically enhanced supersoldier and a hero of the Ultramarines. Titus has returned to the Ultramarines, where is demoted to Lieutenant and forced to prove his loyalty to the Imperium in the heat of battle. On a distant world, he must face one of humanity's most fearsome adversaries - the Tyranids. As you take control of Titus and his battle-brothers, you will be thrown into the thick of a war of galactic proportions. Thanks to our unique Swarm engine, allowing to render hundreds of real enemies on screen at the same time. You'll face seemingly endless waves of enemies, crawling and swarming as far as the eye can see. You must repel the Tyranid invasion and rid the system of the Xenos threat, battling in claustrophobic jungles, majestic planet-spanning metropolises, and other epic locations. After each successful mission, you'll return to the Battle Barge, a space fortress serving as the Ultramarines' orbital HQ. Here, you can gain crucial intel by interacting with onboard personnel. Review your next targets and tailor your loadout to the upcoming mission. Whether you prefer close combat or ranged warfare, the Ultramarines' wide range of equipment offers an array of devastating weapons and unique special abilities. A balanced approach is certainly wise since performing the brutal melee finisher replenishes your armor and keeps you in the fight for longer. </em></p>
<p><em>Beyond the story campaign of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2, you'll find <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-maine-2-co-op-operations-mode-6v6-pvp-pre-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Operations mode</a>. Here, the focus is on cooperation and replayability. Play as one of six classes with unique skills and abilities. Then, develop and customize them to make them your own. Whether you prefer the Sniper, the Vanguard, or the Bulwark, your Space Marine specialty, along those of your squadmates, will be decisive on the battlefield. The more missions you play, the more you'll unlock cosmetics for your Space Marine. Also, XP and Armory Data can be spent on the Battle Barge's armory to unlock new class perks and improve your armament's performance. </em></p>
<p><em>If you're into more competitive challenges, enter the fray in the Eternal War mode, where you'll be able to pit yourself against other players. Six Space Marines clash against six of their sworn Chaos adversaries. Choose your preferred ruleset and engage in adrenaline-pumping matches that will test your skills against players from across the world. Each Skirmish offers you the chance to earn more XP and add more weapons to your arsenal as you prove your valor on the battlefield.</em></p>

<p>Warhammer 40 Space Marine 2 will be released for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on September 9. We also know that the third-person shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-wont-have-any-in-game-mtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won't have any in-game microtransactions</a>.</p>

I took one for the team and watched it, and I can confirm that it provides a hefty look at a lot of what awaits you in <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. “Well, what exactly constitutes a spoiler?” you may ask. Everything! At this point, anything you see about the expansion before you get your hands on it is, arguably, a potential spoiler. FromSoft games are narratively and mechanically dense, with both aspects serving as sources of delight and frustration for players to discover on their own. Knowing any more hints about the story or seeing any new enemies feels like losing out on a special moment you could have experienced unspoiled.</p><p>Of course, if you have read reviews or seen some of the early trailers for <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, you might not think it’s that big of a deal. I will say that reviews and early footage only hint at the larger reveals of the expansion and typically only offer details on early sections. According to a post on social media from the YouTube channel <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/writingongames/status/1803729352900673587&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/writingongames/status/1803729352900673587" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Writing on Games</a></span>, the launch trailer includes content they did not see until forty hours into the expansion.</p><hr><p>Ahead of <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s release (which is so very close), all you need to know is that the expansion is very good. If you like <em>Elden Ring</em> you will like what FromSoftware has cooked up for you. Just make it through the next day without looking up stuff about the game and make liberal use of the mute features on social media.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a surprising turn of events, the official Fortnite Competitive account has relayed some intriguing information about existing and growing Fortnite Esports competitors. According to the latest <a href="https://x.com/FNCompetitive/status/1802784145510150607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement</a>, apart from FNCS competition, all other tournaments will remove the region lock feature. The new change will allow players to change their region for the season’s current and upcoming tournaments.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨 Attention competitors!</p><p>Effective now (apart from FNCS) we will be removing region lock from all tournaments. </p><p>This also applies to this season's ongoing tournaments. If you previously played in one region for an event, you can now play in other regions in that event.</p></div>— Fortnite Competitive (@FNCompetitive) <a href="https://twitter.com/FNCompetitive/status/1802784145510150607?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 17, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>This change is a game-changer for the Fortnite esports community, and the palpable excitement of the fans in the comment section is a testament to that. Previously, players in Europe, North America, or other regions were confined to competitions limited to their area. Now, they are empowered to participate in their region’s competitions and beyond. </p>



<p>This decision is set to bolster Epic’s player count for Fortnite, with a surge of streamers and content creators joining the competitions across multiple regions. It’s a thrilling opportunity for existing Fortnite Pros to expand their field of competition and for the burgeoning players scattered across different areas worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other Fortnite news, Epic dropped a bombshell earlier this month with a massive update featuring the iconic British heavy metal band <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metallica-comes-to-fortnite-festival-alongside-new-game-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metallica</a>. The update introduced a new game mode, fresh cosmetics, and a playlist of headbanging tracks for the Fortnite Festival. On a different note, Epic recently addressed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-epic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issue of pay-to-win cars in Fortnite</a>, acknowledging their existence.&nbsp;</p>

Some of these bosses are aimed at players who've completed most of the base Elden Ring, meaning FromSoftware has "kind of really pushed the envelope in terms of what we think can be withstood by the player," he added.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>"Some bosses are a necessary part of the story development and arc, but some are not.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-will-go-to-drastic-lengths-to-make-its-sandstorms-matter<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Go on vacation and you’ll come back to a brand-new game world.</h2></div><section><p>During an extremely short behind-closed-doors demo for Dune Awakening, I was given my first glimpse at what the team at Funcom is expecting from this open-world survival MMO: A huge time investment from players, a compelling take on the Dune story, and several factions you can choose to learn new skills and abilities from for your journeys into Arrakis. It’s clear that the developers who gave the demo are excited about the concepts at play, boasting that the desert section of the map alone is the size of all of Conan Exiles, and that they imagine you’ll spend 30-50 hours of the game leveling there. But that just seems to scratch the surface of what you’ll be able to do.</p><p>What makes Dune Awakening different and interesting is the fact that every single week, the sections of this world not protected by a shield will be hit by a sandstorm, wiping out all the buildings you and your opponents have constructed in the seven days leading up to this weekly event. The official website describes them as “cataclysmic Coriolis storms [that] regularly alter the landscape, uncovering new valuable resources and sweeping away player-built outposts. When the dust settles, the race is on. Scout the fresh new land and uncover the secrets of the sands.” This was demonstrated to us as a player journeyed into a radioactive crash site and showcased the ability to climb any geometry in the world while teasing secrets that can be found at the highest peaks.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Dune Awakening June Preview</h3></div></output><p>But the one aspect they kept going back to was Survival. This aspect of Dune Awakening became clear during our hands-off demonstration when a Sandworm erupted from the ground and chased down the player we were following. Death is devastating, and you cannot fight a Sandworm. You can only survive or lose everything you’ve acquired to that point if you get eaten. The same will be true should you lose in PVP and become a refreshing beverage for your opponent, or fail to take cover during a world-changing event. Even becoming dehydrated in the desert if you don’t pay attention to your heat meter and get heatstroke will put you at a severe disadvantage. Surviving will be a key part of your journey.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Death is devastating, and you cannot fight a Sandworm. You can only survive or lose everything you’ve acquired to that point if you get eaten.</p></div><p>It’s also clear that Dune Awakening has a lot of ambitious gameplay elements the team is trying to tie together. For instance, a fictional story where the assassination of Paul Atreides doesn’t take place because he was never born – because his father survived. And because his mother had a daughter as she was instructed to, instead of a son. With these overarching story elements used as a jumping-off point, the team gets to play with a unique future and a new outcome for the factions, and key players of the Dune Universe interact in a way you wouldn’t see in the novels. There is a political system that pits players against each other in a battle for territory. Sandworms will eat you if you’re caught in their path and take all of the gear you had with them. And sweeping sandstorms that will obliterate any structure you’ve built on the map and create an entirely new landscape every week. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>All of these systems are doing their best to craft a template that will keep the world of Dune Awakening fresh and interesting for players. During our demonstration, the team estimated that you would spend your first 30-50 hours of the game in the starting location alone, and that was one of several on the map that we were shown as explorable. On the one hand, I do like the idea that the game world will be kept fresh via sandstorms that destroy all you’ve built up and unlock an entirely new overworld to explore. On the other hand, I am wondering what each new week will look like as teams scramble to utilize their building templates to prop up a new structure and claim a zone as their own to defend against combatants as each week begins. Here’s hoping it’s absolute pandemonium.</p><p>While there are story changes you should expect, the need for water and even more importantly alliances are intact. Eventually, you’ll be able to choose an NPC to train you. We were shown five skill trees that can be unlocked by doing said training, which will then allow you the option of three techniques you can mix and match as your main attacks. That’s in addition to the three passive skills you can also equip. To unlock all of the options available will take a significant amount of time, but getting the right build using different attacks from each will give you access to interesting abilities. The main ability I’ve seen as an example would be a scanner that shows more information about a location you plan to explore, including enemy NPC locations.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In my demo, the team promised two maps to start with and more to come. We got to peek at the Deep Desert, where most of the conflict will happen and hundreds of players will focus on collecting resources and fighting over key locations each week. There's the Hagga Basin which will have a 40-plus player cap. And two social hub locations Arrakeen and the Harko Village. There is, of course, a plan to add even more to the world as time goes by. </p><p>So far Dune Awakening seems incredibly ambitious. Abilities can be unlocked by the Mentats and Bene Gesserit. There will be cool gear to collect like Holtzman gadgets and templates of interesting firearms to unlock. There’s a heat system that will require you to stay hydrated by any means necessary. And giant sandworms that will eat entire convoys if you’re not careful. One speed-run demonstration from Funcom wasn’t enough to scratch the surface of the various systems and how they’ll interplay with one another, but I’m excited to see more.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="272" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Ubisoft has announced that the <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition</em> remaster will arrive on PC and Consoles on June 25th. If it sounds familiar, news of this <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked back in November</a>, along with an early build. But now it has an officially official release date.</p> <p data-characters="331" data-current-count="331" data-injectable="false">Alongside the announcement is a new trailer showing off all the upgrades. It looks similar to how I remember it but with fancier lighting effects and other touch-ups. Pretty nice. It’s being improved to run at 60FPS and 4K resolution. It will also have some new additions such as a “Treasure Hunt” and an anniversary gallery.</p> <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="590" data-injectable="true">I played <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em> on GameCube around the time it was released in 2003. It had an interesting narrative for its time and good variety to its gameplay. It kind of fell into the era’s forced stealth section pitfall, but was otherwise solid.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true">Despite not having played it in about 20 years, I still have a pretty solid memory of it, which says a lot. I mainly remember it for its exceptional soundtrack and phrases like “A box of K-bups will completely restore your energy.” However, I also remember the feel of the hover craft and various scenes from the game. If nothing else, it’s a stellar example of the early ‘00s period of games.</p>
 <p data-characters="37" data-current-count="37" data-injectable="false">I’ll probably pick up the remaster.</p> <p data-characters="132" data-current-count="169" data-injectable="false"><em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition</em> will arrive on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC on June 25, 2024.</p>

		<p>When Warren Spector was a producer at Origin Systems in the 1990s, he had a business model. “I would start up four projects, two internal and two external, and I’d kill two projects every year that weren’t going well,” he says in Jason Schreier’s book <em>Press Start: Ruin and Recovery in the Video Game Industry</em>. “I would tell people that’s what I was going to do. ‘Be one of the projects that’s going really well.’”</p><p>Victorious in Spector’s system were <em>Ultima Underworld</em> and <em>System Shock, </em>the forerunners of what became known as the immersive sim. Games in this genre present an obstacle and allow the player to surmount it in multiple ways: climb over it, blow it up, tell it to move, swim underneath it, whichever way they choose. Over time, the tools got more inventive: possess rats and squeeze through a sewer grate, hack a robot to destroy something, transform into a coffee cup and roll underneath an obstacle.</p><p>Spector repeated his approach for the 2000 title <em>Deus Ex</em>, still the apotheosis of the immersive sim, by constituting two design teams and pitting them in conflict, which he later called “<a href="https://mcvuk.com/business-news/history-lesson-the-story-of-deus-ex/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>probably the stupidest thing I’ve ever done</u></a>.” In that contest, designer Harvey Smith triumphed; he headed up <em>Deus Ex</em>’s sequel and, in 2012, moved onto <em>Dishonored</em>, with the studio Arkane Austin. “<em>Dishonored</em>,”<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/3/2/14798096/deus-ex-warren-spector-vr-virtual-reality-dumb-down-games?ref=remapradio.com"> <u>said Spector</u></a>, “is the series that best captures the spirit of <em>Deus Ex</em> now.”</p><p>Arkane, which at one point operated out of studios in Lyon, France, as well as Austin, Texas, has spent most of its life iterating on the immersive sim, as has Smith, becoming the foremost developer in this genre. So it’s no surprise that Arkane Austin’s latest and last game, <em>Redfall</em> — a multiplayer vampire shooter either a conscious departure from the immersive sim or an attempt to graft it upon a more commercial business model — evidently <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda?ref=remapradio.com"><u>performed poorly enough to shutter the studio</u></a> earlier this year.</p><p>Immersive sims, despite their flexibility of approach, train players to be specialists. They can become a walking weapons platform, the queen of the shadows, the rat god who rides the wind. A studio of immersive sim experts can’t easily switch tracks and deliver a larger, more commercial title. But then, it’s not like they had a choice.</p><p>While Arkane had become better at making immersive sims through iteration, the games weren’t doing the business they once had. The <em>Dishonored </em>sequel from Arkane Lyon and Arkane Austin’s <em>Prey</em> underperformed. Whether or not it contributed directly, the quality that once made an immersive sim special — the ability to “play your own way” — has been absorbed pretty wholly into the broad open world playgrounds of <em>Skyrim, Fallout</em> and <em>Breath of the Wild. </em>“Most of the things that made immersive sims kind of cutting edge are everywhere in games [now],” <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/boss-level-2022-harvey-smith-arkane-studios-3312368?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Smith noted</u></a> before <em>Redfall</em>’s release.</p><p>If those games that drew so directly upon the values of the immersive sim could be huge hits, then perhaps the people best in the world at making immersive sims could play in that space, too. Well, we don’t know, because although Arkane went into the open world for <em>Redfall</em>, its ambitions were more lucrative. Not only were they chasing open-world trends, it was also creating an online-only co-op games-as-a-service shooter in the vein of <em>Borderlands</em>, <em>Destiny, </em>and <em>Overwatch</em>. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-01/arcane-s-redfall-misfire-for-xbox-panned-after-7-5-billion-microsoft-deal?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTY4NTYxODIzNywiZXhwIjoxNjg2MjIzMDM3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJSVktNS1VEV1gyUFMwMSIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.eeX5BYdsJhqgSi3aqDZTZUVYmm92ZItcoOCXfP7-j8Q&amp;embedded-checkout=true&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>In Schreier’s account at Bloomberg</u></a>, owner ZeniMax Media fancied the project would make itself a more attractive acquisition target for Microsoft, even as the change in direction confounded Arkane Austin hires old and new, who had signed up to work on single-player immersive sims. (Schreier estimates that during <em>Redfall’s</em> development, Arkane Austin lost 70% of the staff that had worked on its previous game, <em>Prey.</em>)&nbsp;</p><p>That is a different, though compatible, explanation than the one<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/big-in-2023-redfall-preview-interview-exclusive/?ref=remapradio.com"> <u>Smith gave</u></a>: “If you work on the same thing for long enough you eventually want to clear your head and stretch a little.” It makes sense for Smith since he has been working on these games since 1994. Though he added, “I think we will eventually go back to the very sealed immersive sim-like environments,” suggesting that “a little” might really be the extent of his interest.</p><p>But whether he was making immersive sims or not, there is the lure of getting back to a hit. “<em>Dishonored</em> was important to me because I was like, well, maybe I just got lucky that one time [with <em>Deus Ex</em>]?” <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/boss-level-2022-harvey-smith-arkane-studios-3312368?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Smith said in 2022</u></a>. “<em>Dishonored</em> was like, boom, the whole world paid attention. When that happens to you once it’s awesome. When it happens to you a second time, it validates all the bad moments.” <em>Redfall </em>was a commercial play for a studio that was out of power and wanted it back, if not for the glory, then just to survive.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Redfall</em> feels (and is) a termination of the story Arkane has been telling across all of its games since <em>Dishonored</em>, not just with immersive sims but where power is the central theme. In the <em>Dishonored </em>series, the player is a powerful character — an empress or her protector temporarily embarrassed by a coup — but the game is less interested in the power accorded to them by their positions at the head of empire than the toys they get to play with.&nbsp;</p><p>The true power, in so far as it is interesting to the designers, is supernatural, such as possession, teleportation, or slowing time. And it’s bestowed by a character called the Outsider. As a force, the Outsider is so enigmatic and grim that it’s logical to wonder if his powers are given at a price. What is the cost of a deal with dark forces, struck to advance your quest for the throne?&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing much, as it happens. “There are many myths about how if you want power there is something to trade,” <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120909031200/http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/dishonoreds-two-lead-designers-talk-about-magic-breaking-the-game-and-amora"><u>observed Raphaël Colantonio</u></a>, who directed the first game with Smith. “When we started to design [<em>Dishonored</em>], we thought it would be interesting to tempt the player with powers, and if they decide to use them the world grows darker. Because it’s an interesting dilemma…. [But] we don’t want to punish players for having fun.” Though the Outsider cuts a brooding figure, he only a spokesman for the freeplay pleasures of the immersive sim: “How you will use what I have given you falls upon you… I will be watching you with great interest.”</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo: Bethesda Softworks</span></figcaption></figure><p>Fun wins, as it usually does in game development, but the original <em>Dishonored</em> was the last time Arkane was so indifferent to the narrative cost of power. <em>Prey</em>, directed by Colantonio, was built around the idea that the player should be tested on whether they deserve the extragenic powers they have been given. If they were found to have used them irresponsibly, they were destroyed. <em>Prey</em>, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/video-game-video-game-review-prey-sci-fi-legacy-gaming-gamers-595970?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Colantonio told</u></a> Newsweek<em> </em>in 2017, dealt with “identity, empathy and who you are…. What does it mean to be human?” (Hedging, designer Ricardo Bare added: “You can play it as a science- fiction action game. It’s super fun; the aliens are super deadly.”)</p><p>Not coincidentally, perhaps, as the games embraced nuance the studio’s commercial fortunes declined. Colantonio later said <em>Prey</em> sold horribly <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/bethesda-forced-arkane-to-call-its-game-prey-which-studio-founder-says-was-very-very-hurtful/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>and he left Arkane</u></a> in part over a corporate directive to title the game <em>Prey </em>— in reference to an unrelated IP owned by the parent company — over his objections. “I’m grateful that a company will give me the means to make a game and trust my ability with so many millions of dollars… but there is a bit of the artistic, creative side that is insulted when you tell this artist, ‘Your game is going to be called <em>Prey</em>,’” he said. “I’m not in control of my own boat at this point.”</p><p>In <em>Dishonored</em>, power was fun for its own sake, and when you got your characters back on the throne, a glossy if hazy golden age followed. But everything Arkane has made since <em>Prey </em>has been concerned with the idea of destroying power at its source, even though power is the thing that gives the player means and trusts in their ability.</p><p>The change is best observed with <em>Dishonored</em>’s Outsider, who at the peak of Arkane’s success was an esoteric but in practical terms benevolent stand-in for the game designer: here are your tools, go have fun, as power is play there should be no punishment for it. After <em>Prey </em>and <em>Dishonored 2 </em>didn’t sell up to expectations, the Outsider found himself on trial for his life in the latter game’s DLC: <em>Death of the Outsider</em>. The case for his murder is not well prosecuted, only that he represents a great wellspring of power, and that some of the individuals he chooses to let draw from it might inflict harm upon the world. “The Outsider’s gifts come with a price,” grumbled a character, which has been historically untrue.</p><p>But there <em>was</em> a price, the DLC reveals, one heretofore not glimpsed by the player: The Outsider, far from being a happy champion of play, was forced into his position as a child by a cult of wealthy weirdos. So power never came at a price <em>for the player</em>, but for the game designer figure, there were strings attached. There is a purity to the push-and-pull of the designer-player relationship, but the designer does not often get to be in that position without giving something up. The Outsider does not have to die at the end of the game, but in any event, he is removed from his role as a human transformer of supernatural power. Nobody should have that power, is the final message of the <em>Dishonored</em> series; nobody should make games.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo: Bethesda Softworks</span></figcaption></figure><p>The wealthy weirdos, a favorite archetype for this sort of thing, returned in Arkane Lyon’s <em>Deathloop</em>, where the power they had cultivated was of immortality on an island where a single day repeats itself eternally. The point of it is that there are no consequences to the free exercise of power — the design philosophy of the first <em>Dishonored</em>, in other words. But in the world of <em>Deathloop</em>, this philosophy reveals itself as grotesque and hedonistic. The player takes on the role of Colt, who is given a share in this power, but as we learn, we were complicit in its creation. His moral imperative is to master the power only for the purpose of destroying it — or revel in it, which is perceived as part of the same deadened hedonism that animates the game’s enemies.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, a player should play a game only for the sake of ending it, which is quite the opposite philosophy to, say, a game-as-a-service hero shooter. But in <em>Redfall</em>, with its always-online vision of Massachusetts as populated by immortal vampires, the object once again is to end power by killing vampires, not to celebrate it. Though the player possesses certain special abilities, the<em> </em>power — the advancement in human evolution that players spent <em>Dishonored, Deus Ex, Prey</em>,<em> </em>and <em>BioShock </em>cultivating in themselves — is now in others, and it codes them as enemies. “Come out,” some roaming goon mocks the player, shortly before they are shot in the head. “Don’t you want to be something better?” Yes! In fact, that used to be the whole point.</p><p><em>Redfall</em> is existentially mixed-up, a narrative about the rejection of power while also simultaneously a gambit by Arkane to get their power back. It’s easy to chalk <em>Redfall</em> up as a wrong turn in the evolution of the immersive sim, an attempt to extrapolate its principles to a demonstrably more popular genre. Except that Microsoft, which acquired Arkane’s parent company ZeniMax in 2021, packaged the announcement of Arkane Austin’s closure with three other studios, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24157264/hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-studio-closure?ref=remapradio.com"><u>at least one of which had recently delivered a critical hit</u></a>. The message was muddled, as if to say that the success or failure of a studio ultimately weighs little on its survival. Or rather, the message was muddled so as to say nothing at all, for the prerogative of power is not having to explain itself.</p><p>Arkane’s games have always been about power, not power bestowed by weapons or equipment, but concentrated in the individual. Killing the Outsider — and for that matter, spinning up a studio-saving hit in a buzzy, profitable genre — was a kind of fantasy that in the wake of Arkane Austin’s closure looks even more fantastically remote. “Could we kill God?” they ask in <em>Death of the Outsider.</em> “You found a way to kill God?” Can the individual become empowered enough to transcend and escape the systems that could kill it?&nbsp;</p><p>Arkane Austin made great games, on the whole, but it makes for a bad story of its own. Its lights were turned on and then off, in such a way as to emphasize how far out of its control Arkane's own fate had become. The end gave the lie to the premise of the immersive sim: Ultimately, it did not matter how they played it. The player is dead and the Outsider exists eternal, unknowable.</p>

Let’s start with that one: The new(ish) Dialogue Camera toggle.</p><h2 id="h10868"><a id=""></a>The best new option: Dialogue Camera toggle</h2><p>Tired of how <em>Starfield</em> zooms in and frames the NPC you’re talking to in a very rigid, tired sort of way? You can shut that off, and honestly, it’s kinda wild to me what a difference this makes. You’ll find this option in Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Dialogue Camera (on/off).</p><figure id="" data-id="e62125cc797e1574e28372925e02b6c5" data-recommend-id="image://e62125cc797e1574e28372925e02b6c5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An animated gif shows the protagonist of Starfield talking to shop owners." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An animated gif shows the protagonist of Starfield talking to shop owners." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e62125cc797e1574e28372925e02b6c5" data-recommend-id="image://e62125cc797e1574e28372925e02b6c5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An animated gif shows the protagonist of Starfield talking to shop owners." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-mods-creations-paid-worth-it-steam-review-1851541215&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-mods-creations-paid-worth-it-steam-review-1851541215"><em>Starfield</em>’s Paid Mods Ignite A Review Bombing On Steam</a></span></p><p>When you shut the Dialogue Camera off, the result is a more seamless transition from gameplay/exploration to NPC chats. It also keeps your character visible in third-person mode during dialogue as well.</p><h2 id="h10869"><a id=""></a>Environmental damage and survival mechanics</h2><p>These options are likely to be a little divisive as survival mechanics aren’t everyone’s cup of tea. But hey, when nearly all of these darn planets are virtually empty, adding survival mechanics like hunger, thirst, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-afflictions-environmental-hazard-healing-1850853815&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-afflictions-environmental-hazard-healing-1850853815">the effects of environmental hazards</a></span> to basic traversal can be a fun way to challenge yourself as you chart out across the stars. </p><figure id="" data-id="57fd35db4c7cda4dc0b03d05473404c2" data-recommend-id="image://57fd35db4c7cda4dc0b03d05473404c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the menus of Starfield shows a variety of difficulty options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the menus of Starfield shows a variety of difficulty options." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="57fd35db4c7cda4dc0b03d05473404c2" data-recommend-id="image://57fd35db4c7cda4dc0b03d05473404c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the menus of Starfield shows a variety of difficulty options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll also earn more XP for the more challenging settings. And if you really don’t want any of these mechanics, even the ones that appeared in vanilla <em>Starfield</em>, you can also turn off environmental damage and afflictions entirely.</p><h3 id="h10870"><a id=""></a>Sustenance</h3><p>“Sustenance” is one of the new options and, as you might’ve guessed, it challenges you to maintain hunger and thirst levels in two different ways. In “Positive Only,” you won’t suffer for not eating or drinking, but doing so will still give you two new statuses, Fed and Hydrated. They work as follows: </p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Fed: Gained from eating food. Increases health by 30%, melee damage by 15%, and adds 25% additional carrying capacity.</li><li>Hydrated: Gained from drinking. Increases O2 recovery by 30%, sneak attack damage by 15%, and lets you reload guns 25% faster. </li></ul><p>That’s not all Sustenance has to offer. If you want a greater challenge, you can also select “Positive &amp; Negative” which will punish you for not consuming food and water. With this setting on, you’re at risk of the following: </p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Malnourished: Gained from not eating food. Decreases health by 30%, reduces melee damage by 15%, and docks your carrying capacity by 25%.</li><li>Dehydrated: Gained from not drinking. Decreases O2 recovery by 30%, lowers sneak attack damage by 15%, and reduces reload speed of guns by 25%.</li></ul><p>Bethesda’s vanilla survival options via Sustenance are very simple. You can be in Fed and Hydrated status for just 30 minutes at a time. This means you’re likely to hit Malnourished and Dehydrated fairly often. I like mapping food and water to the left side of the Favorites quick menu to easily snack on something or grab a drink when needed, bypassing the need to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-release-menu-ui-starmap-inventory-xbox-review-1850797661&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-release-menu-ui-starmap-inventory-xbox-review-1850797661">dive into <em>Starfield</em>’s clunky menus</a></span>.</p><h3 id="h10871"><a id=""></a>Environmental damage and afflictions</h3><p>Not only can you entirely shut off environmental damage in these settings, you can also make things a little harder for yourself. If you change Environmental Damage &amp; Afflictions to Advanced, you’ll have to manage impacts to your health in addition to status afflictions. When you take on an affliction from the environment, you’ll also start losing health. A portion of your health meter will turn orange, blocking the amount of health you can heal up until your affliction is removed. </p><p>If you’re at all familiar with how radiation works in <em>Fallout</em>, this will sound very familiar. </p><p>There are also a collection of other affliction options that affect how treatment and prognosis works. You can disable whether or not you gain afflictions from combat and can adjust how easily they heal over time.</p><h2 id="h10872"><a id=""></a>Other cool difficulty tweaks</h2><p><em>Starfield</em> now has four difficulty options, spread out across how much damage Enemies output on foot and on ship, and how much damage you output on foot and on ship. These options list how they modify the game in the Gameplay Options menu.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-showcase-starfield-shattered-space-1851528944&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-showcase-starfield-shattered-space-1851528944"><em>Shattered Space </em>Looks Like The Dose Of Personality <em>Starfield</em> Needs</a></span></p><p>But that’s not all. You can also tweak settings that influence your overall carry capacity, how you heal, and alterations to the in-game economy.</p><h2 id="h10873"><a id=""></a>Carry capacity, vendor credits, healing, and more</h2><p>While these settings can enhance a survival experience, they can also just amplify <em>Starfield</em>’s original gameplay loop (or, if you prefer, attenuate certain aspects of it).</p><h3 id="h10874"><a id=""></a>Changes to item management, carrying capacity, and vendor credits.</h3><p>There are two handy settings to change up how much you can carry and how best you can manage it. Carry Capacity (found under Gameplay Options) lets you either reduce how much you can carry or allow you far more room to spare (sadly, you cannot turn off limitations on carry capacity entirely from this setting, but there might be some mods to help you out with that).</p><figure id="" data-id="0edfea85fc42b29679df59dbc9367cdb" data-recommend-id="image://0edfea85fc42b29679df59dbc9367cdb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Starfield's menus shows options for carrying capacity." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Starfield's menus shows options for carrying capacity." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0edfea85fc42b29679df59dbc9367cdb" data-recommend-id="image://0edfea85fc42b29679df59dbc9367cdb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Starfield's menus shows options for carrying capacity." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You may also choose to switch on ammo weight.

While your cargo capacity will still be limited by the size of your ship’s cargo hold, you can choose to restrict cargo access to only when you’re actively inside your ship, or allow unlimited access to your ship’s cargo no matter where you are. Another setting allows you cargo access only while in outposts in settlements.</p><p>In Gameplay Options, you’ll also find a setting to either increase or reduce the amount of credits that vendors have on hand.</p><h3 id="h10875"><a id=""></a>Healing settings</h3><p><em>Starfield</em> now offers you influence over three sources of healing: Medical Items, Food, and Sleep. For the first two options, you can influence how much or how little Med Packs, other healing-specific items, and food heals you. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-creations-mods-best-immersive-1851536437&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-creations-mods-best-immersive-1851536437"><em>Starfield</em>: 6 Free Mods For A More Immersive Experience</a></span></p><p>You can also adjust how much sleeping restores your health, and base it on where you sleep.

Her name has popped up many times in the story, but she makes her official debut in the chapter during Phase 2.<br></p><p>Firefly is out now. She launched with the start of the 2.3 update on June 18. Jade launches in the later half of the update on July 10. Ruan Mei (Ice, Harmony) and Argenti (Erudition, Physical) will run alongside Firefly and Jade respectively.<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Honkai: Star Rail 2.3 Phase 1 (June 18-July 10): Firefly (Fire, Destruction), Ruan Mei (Ice, Harmony)</li><li><em>Boosted 4-Stars: Gallagher (Fire, Abundance), Misha (Ice, Destruction), Xueyi (Quantum, Destruction)</em></li><li>Honkai: Star Rail 2.3 Phase 2 (July 10-July 30): Jade (Quantum, Erudition), Argenti (Physical, Erudition)</li><li><em>Boosted 4-Stars: Serval (Lightning, Erudition), Natasha (Physical, Abundance), Asta (Fire, Harmony)</em></li></ul><figure id="" data-id="849440a12a0fbce99cfbb235b796664e" data-recommend-id="image://849440a12a0fbce99cfbb235b796664e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Some promo art for Firefly." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Some promo art for Firefly." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->miHoYo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="849440a12a0fbce99cfbb235b796664e" data-recommend-id="image://849440a12a0fbce99cfbb235b796664e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Some promo art for Firefly." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h8410"><a id=""></a>Should I pull for Firefly or Jade?</h2><p>If you like the look or personality of one character over the other, and only need a little bit of convincing based on their kit, seriously, just go for the one you want. Both Firefly and Jade both have enough strengths to keep you happy if you decide to pull for them.<br></p><p>That said, here are a few reasons why you might consider one or the other, and a few pros and cons for each.<br></p><h3 id="h8411"><a id=""></a>Firefly</h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Works well with F2P-friendly characters </li><li>Ultimate immediately makes her take action</li><li>Enhanced Skill and Talent implant Fire weakness</li><li>Takes less damage the lower her HP</li></ul><p>Firefly was already expected to be one of the strongest DPSes in the game upon launch. Now that she’s out and about, we’ve easily concluded that those suspicions are true. All her skills work together to restore health, regenerate energy, push her forward in the turn economy, and even implant weaknesses to enable her Break Effect. These skills make it easier to enable her without the help of popular support characters like Tingyun, Bronya, and Huohuo.<br></p><p>Her Skill increases power and charges her Ultimate, which is where she deals the most damage with enhanced attacks. These attacks don’t require you to use Skill Points, either. She also applies Fire weakness to enemies herself, eliminating the need to implant weaknesses with a character like Silver Wolf. Like many Destruction characters, she consumes HP to increase her attack power, but that isn’t much of an issue when she heals herself, and reduces damage the lower her health is.<br></p><p>She’s also easier to invest in for newer players because of how well she works with easy-to-obtain characters. Harmony Trailblazer is her best teammate thanks to how well she can utilize their Super Break effect. If that wasn’t enough to make you pull for her, Harmony Trailblazer is available for free right now through the “When Charmony Rings Out…” permanent event in the Travel Log section of Star Rail’s phone dashboard. That way, you don’t even need to catch up to Penacony if you just started to unlock Harmony Trailblazer.</p><p>Besides Trailblazer, you can use whichever healer you want and another Harmony or Nihility character to help with skill point management or maximize damage. Firefly notably works well with Ruan Mei, the other five-star running alongside her and a popular support in the Break Effect meta. Gallagher is the best healer because his outgoing healing and debuffs scale based with Break Effect. His Fire element ensures that he can help break Toughness because of Firefly’s implant ability, too.<br></p><p>Many other characters besides Ruan Mei and Gallagher can enable her, even if they won’t work as well. Maybe you raised Asta or still only have Natasha as a healer. Those two would work. I’d still say Ruan Mei is the second best teammate after Harmony Trailblazer, but she’s a five-star. In short, pull for Firefly if you want a strong, self-sufficient hypercarry DPS that leans into the Break Effect meta.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="568f7a82cdd4de010f54ddb36088bbf0" data-recommend-id="image://568f7a82cdd4de010f54ddb36088bbf0" data-format="jpg" data-width="2532" data-height="1170" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A busy character screen in Honkai." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A busy character screen in Honkai." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->miHoYo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="568f7a82cdd4de010f54ddb36088bbf0" data-recommend-id="image://568f7a82cdd4de010f54ddb36088bbf0" data-format="jpg" data-width="2532" data-height="1170" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A busy character screen in Honkai." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h8412"><a id=""></a>Jade</h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Can fit into more teams than Firefly</li><li>Buffs teammate with skill that increases speed and offers coordinated attack</li><li>Ultimate that buffs follow-up attack</li><li>Follow-up attack raises Crit DMG</li><li>Skill point friendly</li></ul><p>Jade might not be able to defeat loads of enemies on her own, but adding her to a well-equipped team can make taking down waves of foes easier than without. She fills an entirely different role than Firefly as a sub DPS and enabler. Even though she’s an Erudition character (multi-target-focused), she has Harmony-like traits and self-buffing that gives her more utility than the average.<br></p><p>Jade’s Skill significantly increases the speed of your ally of choice and turns them into a “Debt Collector.” The Debt Collector benefits from a hefty speed boost and coordinated attacks while this buff is active. As this is happening, Jade collects stacks (similar to Adventurine) from each attack, which eventually triggers a heavy-hitting follow-up attack. She works best when paired with Erudition or follow-up-focused teammates that can help build her stacks.<br></p><p>Unfortunately, Jade’s best teammates will be hard-hitting five-star characters like Blade or Argenti. Blade in particular works well because Jade can trigger his buffs with her Skill, which consumes HP from the target. Jingliu and Blade are one example of a popular pair that use the same mechanic. Jingliu eats Blade’s HP, which then triggers his heavy-hitting follow-up attack between turns. Jade fits a similar role for Blade.<br></p><p>Herta in particular is worth highlighting as a F2P teammate because she’s free, and you can earn her Eidolons from the Simulated Universe. Both Herta and Himeko benefit from Break Effect to trigger their follow-up attacks. Meanwhile, Argenti and Blade just do a lot of damage, but can be an expensive investment for newer players who don’t have enough resources to get them.<br></p><p>On the bright side, because Jade is a sub DPS or support, you might get more use out of her in the long run because she’ll fit into more teams. Many Erudition characters work well in double DPS teams that excel in clearing waves of enemies, and it’s just a matter of mix and matching depending on type weaknesses. In a Firefly team, Firefly is the star. She doesn’t have the means to support; her kit is mostly for her benefit rather than enabling others.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="f3b4f8ed386bd5082775e08b1ab73883" data-recommend-id="image://f3b4f8ed386bd5082775e08b1ab73883" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jumpy fighty blade-wielding action." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jumpy fighty blade-wielding action." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->miHoYo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f3b4f8ed386bd5082775e08b1ab73883" data-recommend-id="image://f3b4f8ed386bd5082775e08b1ab73883" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jumpy fighty blade-wielding action." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h8413"><a id=""></a>Who is better: Firefly or Jade?</h2><p>If you can only pull for one, I’d suggest going for <strong>Firefly</strong>. She can deal much more damage on her own, and can break Toughness on virtually any enemy. She doesn’t need other DPSes to enable her, and her best teammate is a free one that you’ve technically had since the beginning (therefore, have probably already raised). Firefly also has a lot of built in utility, like recharging her own Ultimate and implanting Fire weaknesses to enable her Break Effect abilities. While strong, Jade works best as part of a double DPS comp and still doesn’t offer as much utility as Firefly. </p><p>Again, this is just based on damage and investment. Jade is still a good choice if you don’t particularly want Firefly. I’d argue that you should still pull for Ruan Mei over her, but that’s besides the point. For a new player, Firefly is better value because her best teammates are easy to get. Therefore, investments will be cheaper. Jade requires other strong characters around her to be strong herself. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>All the details from Dune: Awakening Direct Episode 2.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Funcom [77 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/funcom">Funcom</a> has released a new set of trailers and screenshots for <a title="Genres > Open-World [434 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world</a> survival <a title="Genres > Massively Multiplayer Online [40 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/mmo">massively multiplayer online game</a> <em><a title="Games > Dune: Awakening [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a></em> as part of the game’s second <em>Dune: Awakening</em> Direct showcase. <span id="more-894315"></span></p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p>The showcase offers 30 minutes of in-depth interviews and game footage showing character creation, the MMO-like server structure, the narrative ramifications of a world where Paul Atreides was never born, and the spiritual journey the player will undergo in the game, following in the footsteps of the Fremen.</p><p><em>Dune: Awakening</em>, which recently shot past one million wishlists on Steam, draws on the visual and aural identity created by Denis Villeneuve and Legendary’s recent blockbuster movies and is deeply rooted in the original masterpiece by Frank Herbert. The game unleashes you on a vast and open Arrakis torn by war, where you must survive and strive for control of the spice alongside hundreds of other players.</p><p>Premiered at Summer Game Fest, the story cinematic—<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/06/dune-awakening-the-vision-of-paul-atreides-cinematic-trailer">The Vision of Paul Atreides</a>—revealed the alternate timeline that Jessica Atreides creates by choosing to give birth to a daughter instead of Paul, beginning a cascading chain of events. Paul’s absence leads to a huge power vacuum into which players will venture, creating their own story.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_894305"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>“Expression and customization” is one of the core pillars of <em>Dune: Awakening</em>. To showcase a part of that, the Direct shows off the robust in-game character creation tool. Choose every detail of your appearance, then your home planet, and even your mentor’s specialization, such as Mentat, Swordmaster, or Bene Gesserit, which determines your starting abilities.</p><p>Creative director Joel Bylos also dived into the server structure and the Overland Map, which connects various massive sandbox maps, allowing for a larger number of players in each, both of which set <em>Dune: Awakening</em> apart from many other <a title="Genres > Survival [292 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival games</a>.</p><p>“Making the world feel seamless and connected has always been one of our goals on <em>Dune: Awakening</em>,” said creative director Joel Bylos. “We built this structure with the idea of making the game expandable, which is difficult with a single map. The idea with the overland map is that it allows us to just keep building the world and giving players new spaces to explore. Who knows what it will look like five years from now?”</p><p><em>Dune: Awakening</em> has recently entered its persistent closed Beta, giving access to the full breadth of the game, from the Hagga Basin starting area to the Deep Desert endgame. Sign up for a chance to join on the official website, and wishlist the game on Steam.</p><p>With Gamescom coming up in August, Funcom now prepares for an epic Dune: Awakening gameplay reveal.</p></blockquote><p><em>Dune: Awakening</em> is in development for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,336 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,608 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [20,514 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>).

                <p>Sony has revealed that it will be ending the Sony Rewards program offered through its Sony- and PlayStation-branded credit cards at the end of 2024.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.rewards.sony.com/faq" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">updated FAQ page</a>, the Sony Rewards website and mobile application will shut down on December 31, 2024. Users have until then to redeem any points and access their account, as well as submit any bonus points and purchase credit request forms through the app. However, after July 21, users will no longer be able to mail in physical bonus points or purchase credit request forms.</p><p>The rewards program isn't to be confused with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-stars-is-now-live-in-north-america/1100-6508039/" data-ref-id="1100-6508039">PlayStation Stars program</a>, which is PlayStation's loyalty and digital collectibles program.</p><p>The Sony Rewards program involves using the Sony and PlayStation Visa credit cards to accrue points in order to redeem items such as electronics, gift cards, and PSN Store codes.</p><p>The PlayStation credit card was first introduced in 2017. Microsoft recently introduced the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-credit-card-is-now-available-to-everyone-with-new-perks/1100-6522783/" data-ref-id="1100-6522783">Xbox credit card last year with Mastercard</a>, which recently became available to everyone outside of Xbox's insider program.
