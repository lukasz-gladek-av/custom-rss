			<p>After <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2025-a-year-of-frights/">a great 2025</a></strong>, which saw the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/"><strong>return of the beloved <em>Silent Hill</em></strong></a> and the launch of several excellent horror games, <strong>2026 is poised to be a landmark year</strong>, and not only for the launch of the new entry of the series, which effectively established the survival-horror genre. With a popular horror franchise finally making its video game debut, and some welcome returns, <strong>2026 will be yet another year of frights</strong>.</p>



<p>Here are our <strong>five most anticipated horror games</strong> launching in 2026, alongside a few other titles worth mentioning that are launching in the coming 12 months.</p>

<p>From <strong>Tarsier Studios</strong>, the twisted minds behind the first two <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/little-nightmares-ship-of-horrors/">Little Nightmares</a></em></strong> titles, comes <strong><em>Reanimal</em></strong>, a spiritual successor to the series, sporting a new setting and a <strong>co-op focus</strong> that aims to make the experience more engaging.</p>



<p>This horror adventure follows a brother and sister on a harrowing journey through a <strong>hellish, grotesque landscape</strong> to rescue their missing friends. <a href="https://wccftech.com/reanimal-gamescom-preview-a-nightmare-of-a-different-kind/"><strong>Retaining the signature "grotesque beauty" of Tarsier’s previous work</strong></a>, <strong><em>Reanimal</em></strong> takes everything up to eleven in terms of scale and creature designs, offering an experience that promises to be as <strong>unnerving</strong> as it will be to play.</p>

<p>Although fairly niche compared to series like <strong><em>Resident Evil</em></strong> and <strong><em>Silent Hill</em></strong>, the <strong><em>Fatal Frame</em></strong> franchise is widely appreciated by survival horror fans thanks to its <strong>marked Japanese feel</strong>. And in <strong>2026</strong>, both newcomers and veterans of the franchise will be able to experience the <strong>second entry in the series like never before</strong>.</p>



<p>Developed with involvement from <strong>Team NINJA</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-the-culmination-of-every-team-ninja-action-rpg-hands-on-preview/"><strong>which is also launching <em>Nioh 3</em> this year</strong></a>), <em>Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly Remake</em> brings the tragic story of twin sisters <strong>Mio and Mayu</strong> to <a href="https://wccftech.com/fatal-frame-2-crimson-butterfly-remake-release-date-march-2026-ps5/"><strong>modern hardware</strong></a> with <strong>improved visuals</strong>, <strong>overhauled lighting</strong> and <strong>new gameplay features</strong>, such as the <strong>"Hold Hands"</strong> mechanics that use the sisters' bond to restore health and spirit power, adding a <strong>tactile layer</strong> to the exploration of the cursed <strong>Minakami Village</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>IllFonic</strong>, the masters of the asymmetric horror genre, have adapted <a href="https://wccftech.com/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-the-game-hands-on-preview-laugh-or-die/"><strong>countless horror franchises</strong></a> as video games, but all these games are set to pale in comparison to <em>Halloween: The Game.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Are you looking forward to first-party PlayStation games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2026-martial-artists-spies-super-heroes-and-criminals/">Marvel's Wolverine</a>? Ever wanted a game to just play itself, while you put the controller down and just watch the trophies roll in? If you hear that and wonder, 'Well, what's the point of playing the game in the first place?' then you're having the same reaction to Sony's new 'AI-generated Ghost Player' patent that most of the internet seems to be having. If you think that sounds like a great way to enjoy a game, then this patent seems to be made specifically for you.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-ai-patent-will-see-playstation-games-play-themselves-when-players-are-stuck/">VGC</a>, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025080356">published the filing publicly this week</a> after it was initially filed by Sony back in September 2024. The patent describes a "<em>ghost player</em>" appearing as an "<em>overlay</em>" to show the player how to complete a section of the game they're having trouble with. </p>



<p>"<em>During live gameplay by a player, game state data is analyzed in order to identify a scenario occurring in the context of the gameplay of the player. The scenario occurring during the live gameplay can then be processed by the Al model and an assistance Al engine in order to provide a ghost character with control inputs for animation/control to guiding the player in relevant interactivity of the game</em>," the filing reads. "<em>The relevant interactivity is for the context of the gameplay of the player, not just some prior gameplay of another player. The ghost character can therefore be controlled by the assistance Al engine during gameplay and provide the player with visual illustrations of how certain game scenarios are played in order for the character controlled by the player to be able to achieve progress in the game.</em>"</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sony-AI-Generated-Ghost-Player-Patent.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: WIPO</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The filing also describes different modes for players to pick from. The 'Guide Mode' would show you the solution to whatever is troubling you in the game you're playing, like a puzzle in Uncharted or God of War. Whereas 'Complete Mode' would just do it for you, so you can move progress further in the game and not have to deal with that section.</p>



<p>Sony already has help systems built into the PS5's console software, with its Tips and Game Help system that lets players get increasingly more detailed hints as to how they complete a section of the game, with the most detailed hint simply telling the player what they need to do. It only works when developers opt into including those hints, but when they're there, they can be helpful to players who don't want to reach for their phone or laptop to look up a guide.</p>



<p>Players already complain when NPC allies give you the answer to a puzzle before you've had the chance to solve it yourself. It doesn't sound like this AI-generated Ghost Player would jump the gun and show you a solution before you ask for one, but going as far as to beat the section for you seems like a stretch too far for anyone who actually wants to enjoy the games they buy.</p>



<p>Of course, it is just a patent, so we may never see this actually implemented. But based on the reaction players had to <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-launches-copilot-for-gaming-beta-on-mobile-devices/">Microsoft's Gaming Copilot</a> introduction last year, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-training-gaming-copilot-ai-watching-you-play-games-unless-you-turn-it-off/">even the idea that an AI is helping you and watching you play</a>, this doesn't seem like the kind of thing players want to have available to them.</p>



<p>You can always <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/">look up a handy guide</a>, or, of course, just try and figure it out for yourself. No one likes getting frustrated when playing a game, and getting stuck is not a good feeling. Sometimes that frustration is what makes you stop playing a game entirely. But where's the fun in watching the game play itself?</p>

<p>Thankfully, it looks like if you do want to run <em>007 First Light </em>at 1080p and maintain a stable 60fps, you won't need too beefy a rig to do so. Here are the two presets IO has announced for the game. Both require 64-bit installations of either Windows 10 or 11.</p><h3>Minimum (1080p at 30fps)</h3><ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i5-9500K or AMD Ryzen 5 3500</li><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660, AMD Radeon RX 5700, or Intel equivalent</li><li>RAM: 16GB</li><li>VRAM: 8GB</li><li>Storage: 80GB minimum</li></ul><h3>Recommended (1080p at 60fps)</h3><ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i5-13500 or AMD Ryzen 5 7600</li><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT, or Intel equivalent</li><li>RAM: 32GB</li><li>VRAM: 12GB</li><li>Storage: 80GB minimum</li></ul>

                <p>A lot of interesting technology has been revealed at the Consumer Electronics Show 2026 this week, but one of the strangest might be Razer's Project Ava, an AI-powered desktop companion. Razer envisions the device as a "dynamic personality" that can interact with its owners as a 3D hologram, and it'll have several animated personalities to choose from, including one based on the prominent League of Legends esports player, Faker.</p><p>Razer claims that Ava uses human-like vision and audio-sensing for full contextual awareness, and that it can converse with people, consult on work tasks, and motivate you to engage in self-care routines. The company says it can also assist you in your work with "two-way conversation" features, and for gaming, it can fulfill multiple roles and deliver real-time hype.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QDthx_WjwE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_QDthx_WjwE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As for the other personalities, Ava's default personality is a fusion of HAL 9000 and the original Xbox boot-up screen, Kira is an anime waifu, Zane is designed to be your gaming wingman, and Sao looks like she's ready for a day at the office. Razer says these characters are rendered in real time on a 5.5-inch holographic display and feature "high-fidelity motion, eye-tracking, and facial expressions" to help them engage with users.</p><p>Project Ava currently uses xAI's controversial Grok engine, but Razer says it will be compatible with other leading AI platforms in the future. The physical design incorporates multiple technologies, such as dual Far-Field array mics, an HD camera with an ambient light sensor, and RGB lighting, since this is a Razer product.</p><p>Project Ava is designed for Windows users and requires a direct connection to a PC via a USB-C cable to ensure high-bandwidth data transfers. Razer is aiming to launch Project Ava in the second half of 2026, but pricing has not yet been revealed.</p><p>For more from CES 2026, you can also check out the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-rog-enters-extended-reality-with-240hz-gaming-glasses/1100-6537195/">240Hz XR gaming glasses from Asus</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hyperx-reveals-non-invasive-neurotech-gaming-headset-whatever-that-means/1100-6537201/">"non-invasive" brain-scanning headset concept</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-ultimate-3e-modular-xbox-pc-controller-revealed-releases-this-summer/1100-6537181/">8BitDo's high-end Ultimate 3E gaming controller</a>.</p>

                <p>CES 2026 has officially begun, and Razer is using this year's showcase to reveal a slew of AI-powered gadgets. One of the most intriguing debuts is <a href="https://www.razer.com/concepts/project-motoko" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Project Motoko</a>, an AI headset powered by Snapdragon. Equipped with a pair of cameras near each earcup, it's capable of analyzing your surroundings and giving you audio feedback on what it sees.</p><p>Razer says Project Motoko can provide all sorts of feedback to users. For example, it can be used while gaming to get feedback about a boss fight, detecting what's on the screen and giving you immediate tips. It can translate street signs when traveling abroad, summarize documents, or handle tasks as simple as counting your reps at the gym. Equipped with dual far- and near-field microphones, it can both pick up your voice commands and listen to your surroundings for environmental cues, ensuring it gives you as accurate a response as possible.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4630479-razer_motoko_kv-2048x1152%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630479" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4630479-razer_motoko_kv-2048x1152%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630479"></a><figcaption>Razer Motoko Headset</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4630479-razer_motoko_kv-2048x1152%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>Motoko is built to connect seamlessly with most AI platforms, including OpenAI, Grok, and Gemini. It can also be used for machine learning, passively gathering data to improve the technology as the device is worn.</p><p>It's worth noting, however, that this is a fully auditory system for the user. Unlike smart glasses, which sometimes offer in-lens visual feedback, Motoko looks like your standard headset. So while it has the size to pack in impressive audio and could potentially offer a longer battery life, you won't get any visual responses from the AI.</p><p>Project Motoko does not yet have a release date. Razer says this is currently a "concept," offering folks a "glimpse into the future of AI-driven wearables."

            <p>The top five games played on the PlayStation in 2025 by US players were exactly the same as in 2024, according to Circana's Player Engagement Tracker.</p>
<p>This information, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mbraw2dcfc2s">published on social media by senior director at Circana Mat Piscatella</a>, states that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> took the top spot in 2025, followed by Call of Duty, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto V</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a>, then Minecraft. This is interesting as this list is an exact replication of the top five games played on US PlayStations in 2024.</p>
<p>Looking at the top five games played on US Xbox's in 2025, there's a slight different in the order of the games which take the top five spots, but the games themselves remain the same. In 2025, Fortnite took the number one spot, followed by Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto V, Minecraft, and Roblox. Whereas in 2024, Call of Duty was number one, followed by Fortnite, Minecraft, Grand Theft Auto V, then Roblox at number five.</p>

<p>It's safe to say that, judging by these stats, the upper echelon of popular games right now are somewhat cemented in place right now. With the biggest live service games bringing in absurd profit and player engagement metrics, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-on-earth-do-you-find-lasting-meaningful-success-with-a-live-service-game-developers-answer-the-billion-dollar-question">it's a tricky task to break into the space and survive</a> let alone thrive. A year after its launch, <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/20696836/epic-apple-trial-epic-games-exhibit.pdf">Fortnite made over $5bn,</a> and has shown little sign of slowing down ever since.</p><p>That should provide some context as to why developers keep attempting to make big live service hits, as if they can catch on the potential profits are staggering. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-12-million-sales">Arc Raiders would be an example of this going well</a>, while examples of these sorts of games not catching on are far more numerous. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/free-to-play-big-team-pvp-warhaven-announces-closure-just-4-months-after-its-early-access-launch">Just look at Warhaven</a>, which shut down only four months after its early access release.</p><p>

Will 2026's top five list be different? Even with Call of Duty <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">having hit a bit of a roadbump with Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> performing exceptionally well, it's likely the top five list itself will stay very similar. If <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-gta-6-is-delayed-again-by-half-a-year-to-november-2026-take-two-stock-immediately-begins-to-drop">Grand Theft Auto VI wasn't delayed to November</a> perhaps we'd have seen a passing of the torch to the sequel, but oh well.

<p>Pre-orders open this week</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="d9f185e3e0605"><a title="Capcom Arcade Stadium LRG Physical" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d9f185e3e0605/capcom-arcade-stadium-lrg-physical.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Back in its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/round-up-limited-run-games-10th-anniversary-special-every-switch-announcement-and-physical">10th anniversary special presentation</a>, Limited Run Games announced that it was teaming up with Capcom on a line of physical releases. One of the titles falling in this physical line-up was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/capcom_arcade_stadium">Capcom Arcade Stadium</a>, which had a vague '2026' release date attached. Well, with the new year finally upon us, we've got some more information on what the physical will have in store.</p>
<p>Pre-orders for the collection will go live on the <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all-games/products/switch-limited-run-300-capcom-arcade-stadium-vol-1">Limited Run website</a> on <strong>9th January 2026</strong> for <strong>$59.99</strong>, but all those who want to get their hands on a copy will have a big decision to make: which cover do you want to see on your shelf?</p>
<p>Limited Run Games is showcasing a whopping <em>five</em> different covers for this physical release. There's one with all of the standard collection key art, but the other four feature new pieces of artwork for individual games featured in the collection: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/ghouls_n_ghosts">Ghouls 'n Ghosts</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/captain_commando">Captain Commando</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/final_fight">Final Fight</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/strider">Strider</a>.</p>
<p>The actual boxed contents remain the same, obviously, and each cover will sell for the same price, but it's a pretty tough decision. Here's a closer look at each design, so you can see for yourself:</p>


<p>Pre-orders will be sticking around until 8th February at 11:59pm PT / 2:59am ET (9th Feb) / 7:59am GMT (9th Feb), with copies expected to ship between 1st July and 30th September.</p>
<p>We had a great time with Capcom Arcade Stadium when it first launched on the Switch eShop back in 2021, and while the emulation wasn't always up to scratch, we called it "well worth the price, warts and all" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/capcom_arcade_stadium">our 8/10 review</a>.</p>

Winston, meanwhile, will be played by Bill Paterson, who you may know as <em>House of the Dragon</em>'s Lyman Beesbury or the father in <em>Fleabag</em>.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>A plethora of famous faces will be joining Amazon's <em>Tomb Raider </em>TV show.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>They're joined by screen legend Sigourney Weaver, who will be portraying "mysterious, high-flying woman" Evelyn Wallis, ostensibly a new character created for the show. Since Weaver is playing her, though, you can expect her to be a major player, and I'd be shocked if she wasn't the main antagonist of the series.</p><p>Another British icon joining <em>Tomb Raider </em>is Celia Imrie, who will play the British Museum's "Head of Advancement" Francine. She, according to Amazon, is "focused solely on raising funds and glasses of champagne".</p><p>Sadly, we still don't have a release date for the <em>Tomb Raider </em>TV show, but we do know it'll be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e3656d82-1a10-44f8-b35b-c2f90b2993db" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">headed up by <em>Fleabag</em>'s Phoebe Waller-Bridge</a> and that <em>Game of Thrones </em>star Sophie Turner <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-tomb-raider-lara-croft" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8353268c-a5b7-45ad-b3ba-18b83eaad069" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">will be portraying Lara Croft</a>. Production for the show will begin on January 19th.</p><p>It's been all go in the world of <em>Tomb Raider </em>recently; not only is the show moving ahead at full pelt, but two - yes, two - new <em>Tomb Raider </em>games were announced during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-game-awards-2025-recap" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7f71e644-2289-45c0-a1c9-dc56c3797e8a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">this year's Game Awards</a>. One's a remake of the original <em>Tomb Raider</em> and the other is an all-new title.</p>
<p>We'll likely get more information about the <em>Tomb Raider </em>TV show, including a release date, later this year, and more details about the two aforementioned games will probably be forthcoming as well. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <p>Ah, hello, Prince Arthur. This is King Dutch. Long time no see. We thought today would be a good day for rolling. The katamari. The gunslinger suffering from tuberculosis. Where the first rolls the second follows. Roll, roll, roll.</p>
<p>That, essentially, is the ethos behind a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> mod which streamer Blurbs created late last year, and has since shown off in a video that's heavy on large masses of horses and pardners being rolled into rootin' tootin' chaos balls.</p>

<p>Arthur Morgan runs around and objects nearby suddenly stick to him, forming a growing mass of limbs and wagon wheels that rotates and floats as a big glitchy mass. While the mod doesn't stick stringently to the Katamari series' strictly enforced size rules which dictate that you must start by rolling little things your size and can only roll up buildings or giant kaiju once you're sufficiently girthy, it looks like great fun.</p><p>Great fun that'll totally wreck your playthrough, but as a lover of those videos in which someone's turned <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-iv">GTA 4</a>'s NPC car speeds <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn04UwfKk9o">up to a million miles per hour</a>, that's something I can get behind. So, I reached out to Blurbs via Discord to ask whether there are any plans to release this mod publicly in future.</p>
<p>Sadly, it's very much looking like I'll never get my hands on it. One member of the server was quick to reply that, while I should certainly wait for the streamer themselves to answer, to their knowledge the mod getting a public release is "highly unlikely", citing Blurbs going about making his mods in a way that's focused on ensuring they work for him specifically as one of the reasons that's the case. Blurbs himself then responded, pointing to that answer and saying "basically this".</p>
<p>It makes sense. After all, making mods in a form you're happy to mess around with on your own hardware and pulling them together into a tight and polished enough package you're comfortable letting others give them a go are vastly two different propositions. Especially when it's a creation as chaotic and likely with potential to cause crashes or otherwise mess things up as this Katamari mod.</p>
<p>Thankfully, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/once-upon-a-katamari">Once Upon a Katamari</a> has a whole wild west themed zone, so I guess I'll head back there and blast <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK2PyG-UZhw">this video</a> on repeat.</p>

              <p>It can be such a pain to run out of battery, whether that’s on your phone, computer, or otherwise. If you find yourself in that predicament more often than is practical, you should have a portable charger to help make sure you’re juiced up whenever you need to be.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5984/">The Anker Prime Charger, 160W is up for grabs at Amazon for a limited time at a discounted price of $105.99 compared to its original retail price of $150.</a> That’s a discount of $44.01, or about 29% off.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5984/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A powerful yet compact portable charger</h2>
<p>This is a powerful and compact portable charger that lets you charge several electronic devices simultaneously. That makes it a great pick for cell phones, tablets, game consoles, and more. It provides up to 160W of power through each of its USB-C ports, so it can safely and rapidly fast-charge a USB-C laptop while charging two additional devices (phone and/or tablet) at the same time.</p>
<p>The USB-C ports are ideal for providing high-power charging to newer laptops, tablets and smartphones, while the USB-A ports are ideal for charging older phones, Bluetooth speakers and/or other smaller electronic devices. Additionally, the Anker Prime Charger has Power Delivery (PD) capability, enabling it to supply power to your electronic devices at the fastest possible rate, allowing you to charge your devices quicker and more efficiently.</p>



<p>Although the Anker Prime Charger has the potential to deliver a significant amount of power, it’s still super small. You can put it on a desktop surface, nightstand, or kitchen counter without taking up too much valuable real estate. It’s also super lightweight and easily storable in a backpack or travel case, making it ideal for use during business trips, vacations, or work-from-home/coworking days, when users would prefer a single charger to replace a tangled mess of individual chargers and cables.</p>
<p>Built-in safety features enable you to feel confident when connecting expensive electronic devices. The Anker Prime Charger constantly monitors temperature and power consumption to ensure that it protects against heat damage (overheating), excessive voltage, and/or electrical shock due to short circuit conditions. Although these protective mechanisms operate transparently, they offer considerable peace-of-mind benefits when you need to charge multiple high-value devices at the same time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5984/">This Anker Prime Charger is absolutely perfect for its size, capacity, and performance.</a> It eliminates clutter, enables fast-charging capabilities for newer devices, and is compatible with both home and travel-based environments. Bottom line? You should get one and keep it in your bag, car, or somewhere else that you use often in case of emergencies. You never know when you might get struck with a charging emergency.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[I’m Begging For A Sequel After Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles Ships 1 Million Copies]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-remaster-sales-sequel-2000657141</link>
            <guid>1398481</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>How many more copies does <em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> need to sell before Square Enix greenlights a new grid-based strategy RPG? Almost three years later, physical versions of<em> Hi-Fi Rush</em> are finally up for pre-order. And how long will it take for Netflix to turn <em>Arc Raiders</em> into its next streaming hit?</p> <p>It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Depending on what you’re into, January will probably feel like a slow month for big new game releases, at least compared to last year. But I’m getting lowkey hyped for <a href="https://kotaku.com/code-vein-is-the-chillest-dark-souls-clone-1838481190"><em>Code Vein 2</em></a>, the follow-up to the messy 2019 action-RPG anime soulslike. This one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJLfjZd78hw">has a motorcycle</a>.</p>

 <h2>Even<em> Final Fantasy Tactics</em>‘ original director can’t believe how well the remaster is selling</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I underestimated the sales figures by too much.😂😂😂</p> <p>— 松野泰己🐈‍⬛ (@YasumiMatsuno) <a href="https://twitter.com/YasumiMatsuno/status/2008464271731257715?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Square Enix revealed that<em> Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> has sold over 1 million copies. That might be “below expectations” for the infamously disappointed Japanese publisher, but it was enough to take Yasumi Matsuno by surprise. It also prompted a fresh message to fans from the remaster’s director.</p>

 <p>“The entire development team is not only grateful to you, but, in order to spread the joy, create a better experience, and encourage more people to play, we are looking at updating the game in the future!” Kazutoyo Maehiro wrote, according to a translation <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/strategy/og-final-fantasy-tactics-director-admits-he-underestimated-how-popular-the-ivalice-chronicles-would-be-as-it-passes-1-million-copies-sold-with-the-remakes-lead-teasing-future-updates/">from <em>Gamesradar</em></a>. What does updating the game in the future entail, exactly? Could the missing War of the Lions content be officially restored? Could we get fresh end-game modes?</p>

 <p>“Our first and foremost goal here really was to recreate the original game,” Maehiro&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-remaster-cloud-wiegraf-cid-sequel-2000622717">told<em>&nbsp;Wired</em></a> last year. “If [<em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em>] were to become a success,” he continued, “I do feel that that would then lead to discussions around potentially bringing out sequels, for example, or newer tactical RPGs.”</p>

 <p>Let the <em>Final Fantasy Tactics 2</em> summoning circle commence.</p> <h2>You can finally pre-order a physical copy of <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em></h2> <p>The 2023 GOTY contender from Tango Gameworks, a studio that Microsoft closed in 2024 but which was later re-opened under Krafton, is finally getting a physical version that you can start pre-ordering <a href="https://x.com/LimitedRunGames/status/2008192175138299918">from Limited Run Games on January 23</a>. That includes a PS5 version. This is one game everyone should have in their collection, even if it could still be a year before it actually starts shipping.</p>

 <h2>We could end up getting an<em> Arc Raiders</em> TV show</h2> <p>Embark studio head Patrick Söderlund <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY3u7wOmm4w">told <em>GamesBeat</em></a> that Hollywood is interested and so is he. “We [wouldn’t] mind doing that. It would be fun, but it needs to be done in the right way. I hope that we will do that. I think the IP fits quite well with something like that.” Nothing is set in stone yet, however, and Embark doesn’t “have anyone working on a TV or film adaptation yet.” Maybe we’ll see it on Netflix in time for <em>Arc Raiders 2</em>.</p>

 <h2><em>Game of Thrones</em> star Sophie Turner was fine with her ending</h2> <p>She acknowledges that the rest of the cast was disappointed with their characters’ fates. “But I feel that I was very happy with the way Sansa ended her story in <em>Game of Thrones</em>, and no one else was really happy with their ending,” Turner <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/sophie-turner-game-of-thrones-sequel-return">told <em>The Direct</em></a><em>.</em> “I feel like I got a good one, and so I don’t know if I could revisit it.” Would she come back to do more <em>Game of Thrones</em>? “Show me the money,” she joked. She might be <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-lara-croft-amazon-sophie-turner-2000623124">too busy with</a>&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em> anyway.</p> <h2><em>Final Fantasy 9</em>‘s character artist says goodbye</h2> <p>Toshiyuki Itahana left Square Enix at the end of last year. “Last year marked a major milestone with the 25th anniversary of FINAL FANTASY IX, a truly significant event, and I was deeply grateful to see so many people celebrating FFIX,” he <a href="https://note.com/itahana/n/n277aa9cc7148?sub_rt=share_pb">wrote</a> in a message to fans. He’ll continue to produce art as a freelance illustrator.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/mudang-two-hearts-splinter-cell-layoffs-shut-down-release-date-2000656736">The Korean <em>Splinter Cell</em> revealed at last year’s Xbox summer showcase could be in trouble</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/guy-behind-viral-focus-m-gaming-meme-never-expected-it-to-spread-so-fast-2000656706">The guy behind the viral AAA <em>Mario</em> meme is as surprised as you are</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-secret-finale-conformity-gate-explained-2000656704"><em>Stranger Things</em> fans need to let go</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

                <p>Neurable and HyperX are teaming up to develop a gaming headset designed to help you play better. How will it do this? With an "industry-first neurotechnology-powered" headset that can potentially improve focus and accuracy in competitive games. It's also designed to use "non-invasive" neurotechnology, so you don't have to worry about getting a few cybernetic upgrades to be compatible with the device.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4630426-neurable-headset.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630426" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4630426-neurable-headset.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630426"></a><figcaption>HyperX and Neurable's headset concept</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4630426-neurable-headset.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4630470-headset-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4630471-headset-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630470,1300-4630471" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4630470-headset-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4630471-headset-3.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4630470-headset-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4630471-headset-3.jpg"></figure><p>Neurable and HyperX claim that testing with the in-development headset has resulted in faster reaction times of up to 38 milliseconds, improved accuracy by 3%, and a higher number of targets were hit during FPS training tasks when tested on esports players. The headset uses neural-sensing technology to track metrics like cognitive load and stress from a user's brainwaves.</p><p>The AI-powered earpad sensors monitor EEG signals from your head, but it's worth noting that this isn't a magic bullet that will instantly improve your performance. You'll need to use the data from your sessions and training exercises to improve your ability to focus better during games.</p><p>Don't expect the headset to be out anytime soon, as it's still in a very early stage of development.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Amazon has announced more cast members joining its live-action <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a>.</p>
<p>Renowned actress, beloved Faithful and nervous farter from last year's Celebrity Traitors Celia Imrie has joined already announced Tomb Raider cast members Sophie Turner, Jason Isaacs, Sigourney Weaver and Martin Bobb-Semple.</p>
<p>Other newly announced cast members include Jack Bannon, John Heffernan, Bill Paterson and August Wittgenstein, to name just four.</p>
<!-- code from Primis - Eurogamer.net - eurogamer.net -->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span> </p>
</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>So, who is playing who? Well, along with Turner as Lara Croft, the following cast are confirmed in canon roles from the Tomb Raider video games:</p>
<ul>
<li>Martin Bobb-Semple is <strong>Zip</strong>, Lara Croft's long-standing tech support and friend (many suspected this is who Bobb-Semple would be playing) </li>
<li>Jason Isaacs is <strong>Atlas DeMornay</strong>, Lara's uncle</li>
<li>Bill Paterson is <strong>Winston</strong>, the long-standing Croft family butler</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, the following roles are new to the Tomb Raider universe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jack Bannon is <strong>Gerry</strong>, Lara's personal pilot and snack collector</li>
<li>John Heffernan is <strong>David</strong>, an exhausted government official who finds himself tangled up in Lara's unusual world</li>
<li>Celia Imrie is <strong>Francine</strong>, the Head of Advancement at the British Museum, focused solely on raising funds and glasses of champagne</li>
<li>Paterson Joseph is <strong>Thomas Warner</strong>, a senior government official brought in to clean up an almighty mess</li>
<li>Sasha Luss is <strong>Sasha</strong>, a fierce, deeply competitive new adversary of Lara's</li>
<li>Juliette Motamed is <strong>Georgia</strong>, a devoted, by-the-books curator at the British Museum, dedicated to the "proper" preservation of history</li>
<li>Sigourney Weaver is <strong>Evelyn Wallis</strong>, a mysterious, high-flying woman who is keen to exploit Lara's talents</li>
<li>August Wittgenstein is <strong>Lukas</strong>, an illegal raider who shares history with Lara in more ways than one</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these descriptions, I am going to say Lukas is a love interest in a similar vein to Daniel Craig's Alex West from the first Angelina Jolie-fronted Tomb Raider film.</p>
<p>I am curious to see what Isaacs' Uncle Atlus will be like. The last time I remember hearing his name pop up was in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rise-of-the-tomb-raider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a>: Blood Ties DLC, when he was trying to get Croft Manor from Lara. It didn't sound like he and Lara exactly saw eye to eye. Also, I hope we don't get too bogged down in any Daddy issues, as I am going to assume Lara is once again an orphan in the upcoming series.</p>

<p>"Tomb Raider has always been defined by bold storytelling and unforgettable characters, and these new cast members bring incredible depth and gravitas to the series,"  <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/tomb-raider-prime-video-phoebe-waller-bridge-sophie-turner">said Peter Friedlander</a>, head of Amazon MGM Studios. "With talents like Sigourney Weaver and Jason Isaacs joining the ensemble, we're elevating this world in exciting new ways, and can't wait for our global Prime Video audience to experience this next chapter of Tomb Raider."</p><p>Weaver previously stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-scripts-are-incredible-and-very-funny-sigourney-weaver-confirms-she-will-play-wallace-in-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Tomb Raider scripts are "incredible, and very funny, very charming, very witty"</a>. Meanwhile, Phoebe Waller-Bridge - who along with Fleabag is also known for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Killing Eve and Crashing - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">will serve as the Tomb Raider series' creator</a>, writer, executive producer and co-showrunner. Jonathan Van Tulleken will be director and executive producer, along with Chad Hodge as co-showrunner and executive producer.</p>
<p>Filming for Tomb Raider is expected to kick off later this month, on 19th January.</p>

<p>As well as Amazon's show, the game side of the business is currently collaborating with Crystal Dynamics on an all-new Tomb Raider known as Catalyst.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The first batch of Xbox Game Pass games for 2026 <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/06/xbox-game-pass-january-2026-wave-1/">has been revealed</a>, with a strong lineup of seven games joining the service, including Resident Evil Village and Star Wars: Outlaws, and three titles already included in the service at the Ultimate tier now available at the second-rung, Premium tier.</p>



<p>One user on ResetEra called this batch a "<em>damn good month</em>," and it's no surprise considering how many big names are included in the first dump of Game Pass games to start off 2026. It even has at least one day-one release with MIO: Memories in Orbit, a new metroidvania from publisher Focus Entertainment and developer Douze Dixièmes.</p>



<p>Arguably, the biggest additions to the subscription service this month are the aforementioned Resident Evil Village and Star Wars: Outlaws, along with <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-showcase-announces-little-nightmares-iii-release-date-little-nightmares-enhanced-edition-a-little-nightmares-vr-game-and-more/">Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition, the new remaster of the original Little Nightmares</a> that was released last year and included in any player's pre-order of Little Nightmares III.</p>



<p>As for what's being made available to Premium tier subscribers, players at the second tier will be able to play <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atomfall-shadow-of-cumbria/">Atomfall</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">Rematch</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lost-in-random-the-eternal-die/">Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</a>, and Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition without having to jump up to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of what's coming to Game Pass this month:</p>



<ul>
<li>Brews &amp; Bastards - January 6 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition - January 6 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>

<li>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition - January 7 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Final Fantasy - January 8 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Star Wars: Outlaws - January 13 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>

<li>MIO: Memories in Orbit - January 20 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, there are always games leaving the service, with new games entering. This month sees five titles exit the service, one of them being one of the best 3D platformers mixed with a deck-building shooter in Neon White.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games leaving the service on January 15, 2026:</p>



<ul>
<li>Neon White</li>

<li>Road 96</li>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-practically-gives-away-the-kindle-colorsoft-to-clear-out-last-years-remaining-e-reader-stock-2000657124</link>
            <guid>1398442</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Looking to get back into reading in 2026, or just read more? Welcome to the club.</p>
<p>I love my paperbacks, but over time, I have realized how much more convenient digital copies are for reading on the go. You also get more variety, instead of feeling stuck with that one book you grabbed in a hurry and aren’t really in the mood for anymore – coming from someone who often picks a classic when all that the brain needs is some Murakami.</p>
<p>If you’re not a fan of reading on your phone or tablet, a Kindle can be an excellent investment. There are multiple versions available, but right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5794/">Amazon is offering a chance to pick the latest Kindle Colorsoft at a nice 20% discount, for just $200.</a> You’re saving a sweet $50 on a reading solution that makes it easy to have all your favorite titles accessible at all times, wherever you go. Note that this deal ends soon, so it’s best to get your orders in as soon as you can.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5794/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Keep All Your Favorite Titles Close</h2>
<p>For $200, you’re getting a modest 7-inch, high-contrast Colorsoft display that’s easy on the eyes. Unlike the Kindle Paperwhite display, which is optimized for black and white reading, this version brings all the colors to life. It’s great for stories that include illustrations and maps – think The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Wheel of Time – plus comics where color really enhances the overall experience. You can even highlight your favorite scenes in yellow, orange, blue, or pink, and come back to revisit the moments later.</p>
<p>The brightness is adjustable. You can tweak the display from white to amber, depending on your environment. Switch to white light when you’re catching up on the latest Arundhati Roy book while soaking up some sun, and move to a warmer setting for bedtime reading. Even better, the Page Color feature inverts the black text and white background of pages of the books for an even more comfortable experience. It’s different from Dark Mode, and still offers colorful images and covers.</p>



<p>Kindle Colorsoft is also waterproof, which means you can take your favorite titles with you by the pool and to the beach, and even in the bathroom! The battery life is another strong selling point, as a single charge via USB-C gets you up to 8 weeks of reading – you read that right. That means you go up to two months without worrying about plugging the device in. This makes it great to take with you on your off-road adventures and long trips.</p>
<p>The Kindle Store lets you browse through more than 15 million titles from authors around the world, while the Kindle Unlimited subscription offers an all-you-can-read access to a wide catalog that includes best sellers. Prime members can read from a selection of eBooks, magazines, comics, manga, and audiobooks with their Prime membership. If you have young readers at home, you can even create a kid’s profile for unlimited access to a kid-friendly library with an Amazon Kids+ subscription.</p>
<p>All things considered, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5794/">we highly recommend the latest Kindle Colorsoft to anyone looking to read more in 2026, especially at its current price of $200.</a> This deal saves you a nice $50 on this device, plus there are no delivery charges to worry about, either. Grab the deal before the price goes back up to $250.</p>

            <p>Troy Baker, one of the most well known actors working in video games, believes generative AI could have a positive effect overall on performing arts. Baker thinks it'll cause a reaction whereby people will seek out "authentic" experiences more - live shows, live theatre - and turn away from "gruel that gets distilled to me through a black mirror".</p>
<p>"AI can create content but it cannot create art," <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-troy-baker-could-we">Baker told The Game Business</a> in an interview. "And the reason why is because that invariably requires the human experience.</p>
<p>"There's a fundamental premise to making art that people are not remembering right now, and it's that it requires artists. People go, 'look what AI can do.' It's like, 'yeah, okay. I see what it's capable of doing. It doesn't matter.' And we don't need to diminish it, we don't need to denigrate it, we don't need to demonise it. We need to just go, 'okay, it's there'.</p>
<p>"For the last 2,500 years since we first set foot out onto a stage, humans have been doing this. So maybe we trust that. Maybe we trust that this will be part of the process."</p>
<p>The fear comes from looking at AI from a business point of view, he said. From that perspective, yes, AI is threatening. "There is no doubt that AI can make content way better than humans," Baker said. "By far, it can crank it out no problem." But that's where the adverse reaction will come from.</p><p>"What I see happening is that this birth of AI, and this burgeoning industry of it, is actually going to drive people to the authentic. And we're going to see opportunities of, 'I want to go and watch this person sing this song live.' 'I want to see theater'. 'I want to read books'. 'I want to have this first-hand experience as opposed to the gruel that gets distilled to me through a black mirror'.</p>
<p>"I think that it's a good thing. It's a revolution."</p>
<p>Troy Baker, whose performances in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> last year and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> earned him award nominations, is no stranger to dabbling in controversial new tech. In 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-voice-actor-troy-baker-is-now-promoting-nfts">Baker partnered with an NFT company</a> that was making what it claimed were the world's first voice <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFTs</a> - voices you'd own to create content with. Baker's provocative marketing resulted in a fierce backlash and he backed off a bit, but the idea itself doesn't sound far removed from <a href="https://artlist.io/voice-over?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=21312164614&amp;utm_content=181685845406&amp;utm_term=elevenlabs&amp;keyword=elevenlabs&amp;ad=774546804639&amp;matchtype=e&amp;device=c&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21312164614&amp;gbraid=0AAAAACuwFJ3tEZLqB63gRxh9YtijrhqoX&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAgvPKBhCxARIsAOlK_EoMuf-EoB1zrFJuepfrM3VN8tZh-XFA7o1IZyYg_5eyStbfw5zRM8kaAtihEALw_wcB">companies like Elevenlabs that are training gen-AIs on actors' voices</a> now.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Troy Baker will also star in the vintage Disney noir shooter Mouse: PI for Hire, which is due this year, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s new game Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.</p>

            <p>No, I'm not busy. Ignore the very famous actor acting moody in the corner, he'll be quiet if you pay him no mind. Also, do like I am and just pretend my holo-phone doesn't have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/extending-cyberpunk-2077s-pre-heist-rise-through-the-ranks-would-risk-a-meandering-unfocused-experience-argues-cyberpunk-2-director">a million urgent messages</a> about some relic sitting in its inbox. Just sit here on the sofa, in this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> flat, and watch as the big flying thing with Dogtown's military dictator's face on it floats between my futuristic kitchen and lounge, thanks to a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-cyberpunk-2077-mods">mod</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As someone who digs chilling in Cyberpunk, prolific modder Deceptious' latest creation is about the best late new year present I could have asked for. Dubbed '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/26674">Apartment Toys</a>', it takes a bunch of flying craft used by Night City's various factions - from Militch choppers to Arasaka AVs - and shrinks them down to serve as interactive models which can fly around a bunch of V's flats.</p>
<p>It grew out of the model Trauma Team AV the base game sticks in V's default flat for beating the Trauma Drama arcade game's high score and the modder's desire to have a <a href="https://x.com/DeceptiousPhil/status/2002256774007521640">Christmas-themed SleighV</a> fly around each of the game's more specious abodes. Not one of those rare creations that'll turn your playthrough of a game upside down, but I think it's a neat little addition all the same.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Almost done... going all out, &amp; making sure to justify this as a whole new mod I publish tomorrow!🆕<br>Fixed the landing pad (it had some jank)<br>Added decals + lighting variants to match the chosen AV<br>Applied it all to the apartments (after testing in Corpo)<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Modding?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Modding</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cyberpunk2077?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Cyberpunk2077</a> <a href="https://t.co/h3HQ7OqSHR">pic.twitter.com/h3HQ7OqSHR</a></p>— Deceptious - Phil (@DeceptiousPhil) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeceptiousPhil/status/2008023548301058422?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Specifically, I think the fact one of the 13 different craft options its currently boasts is the converted ship which flies around over Dogtown reminding you who's boss via some spotlights and an intimidating  passport snap of the person running the district. Or, as I prefer to call it, the Barghest blimp. Now, with a simple button press, it can patrol the unruly streets of your posh corporate plaza digs.</p><p>No more worries about the clutter you've amassed getting any bright ideas about overthrowing tyrants. Kurt's floaty face is on the case, gently jetting around to make sure everything's in order. Make sure you salute him every time he completes one of his laps. Or, delve into the mod's settings and toggle the looping flight option on. Then he'll patrol until the synthetic cows come home.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving this mod a go, you'll need a small pile of typical Cybermodding frameworks. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/107">Cyber Engine Tweaks</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2380">RED4ext</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4198?tab=description">ArchiveXL</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4197">TweakXL</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/3518?tab=description">Native Settings UI</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/7831">Deceptious Quest Core</a>. The Phantom Liberty DLC's also a must-have. Also, for more ways to waste time not thinking about your impending doom in Cyberpunk, another modder created the means for it to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-can-now-serve-daily-word-puzzles-thanks-to-a-mod-called-gonkle-and-the-answers-probably-choom">serve you Night City lingo-heavy word puzzles</a> last year.</p>

              <p>“I want to get this card graded,” my kid said to me yesterday about a full-art Furret he particularly loves. I looked at it closely, and pointing to a white fleck about half a millimeter in diameter on the top border I said, “It’s probably not worth it.” Such is the ridiculous standard required for grading Pokémon cards to a level that makes them valuable. Which makes it all the more surprising that someone just paid $550 for a Gold Star Charizard (thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wargamer.com/pokemon-trading-card-game/charizard-gold-star-sale"><em>WarGamer</em></a>!) in such bad condition that it looks like it spent most of its last 19 years lying in a puddle.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.serebii.net/card/exdragonfrontiers/100.shtml">Gold Star Charizard</a> is a legendary card that appeared in 2006’s EX Dragon Frontiers set, and one of the reasons that <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/98533/pokemon-dragon-frontiers-dragon-frontiers-booster-pack?page=1&amp;Language=English">buying a sealed pack from that set</a> will cost you around $1,000. A sealed booster box containing 36 packs <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/397369701976">could set you back $135,000</a>. (Even the empty cardboard box that once contained the cards <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/315985404998">goes for over $200!</a>) And the reason why is that a Gold Star Charizard in <em>perfect</em> condition, such that it receives a PSA grading of 10, is <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/pokemon-dragon-frontiers/charizard-gold-star-100">currently valued at over $58,000</a>. Just loose out of the pack it will fetch you nearly $2k, and cards graded with the second-worst possible PSA rating, a 1, are priced at around $1,700. And that’s just the Zard. The Gold Star Mew in the same set fetches $7,500 in a PSA 10, and the Rayquaza ex gets as high as $3,700. There’s a lot of value to be found in those packs…if you’re fantastically lucky.</p>

 <p>Or, if you’ve been collecting for a while, you could go through your own collection and discover you pulled the card in 2006 without even knowing what it was, maybe played a few games with it, used it to practice flicking cards at your sister, then eventually dropped it in a pile on the floor which your mom picked up and put in a shoe box and then stored in a damp corner at the back of the attic. If so, you could have a cool $550 on your hands!</p>

 <p>It’s impossible to overstate <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/116964127279?nordt=true&amp;siteid=0&amp;customid&amp;toolid=10001">just how terrible the card sold by eBay seller roye_richa is</a>. It looks like it was somehow set on fire and drowned at the same time. Listed as the “WORLDS WORST CHARIZARD GOLD STAR EX Dragon Frontiers 100/101,” and originally priced at a somewhat optimistic $911, the entry made no bones about the state of it.</p>

 <p>“Ladies and Gentleman up for grabs is the worlds WORST Charizard Good Star,” begins the item description on eBay. “This is a card I have had since my childhood—technically. I found it on the playground after a rainy day—short to say this card is TRASHED. It barely constitutes as a card anymore it’s in such poor shape. The back of the card is ruined. The front is intact albeit again—severely worn.”</p>

 <p>And then again for emphasis:</p> <blockquote><p>“Again you are NOT purchasing a card of decent condition in any sense of the word. This is for the collector that needs this legendary card in hilariously awful condition—it’s truly one of a kind.”</p></blockquote> <p>It’s not clear where <em>WarGamer</em> got the detail of the card’s $550 sale price from, but the card definitely did sell to one bold collector. And, admittedly, this is the cheapest possible way to become the owner of such a card, even if it’s the most bedraggled one imaginable.</p>
