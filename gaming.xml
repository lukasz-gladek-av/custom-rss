		<p>It seems someone over at Microsoft has a pressed a button rather earlier than they should have as the Game Pass app has just announced that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be coming to the service on day one of launch.<br>
</p>
<p>This is the latest leak in regards to Call of Duty and game Pass,&nbsp; Jez Corden confirmed the news <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1795324954084528632?t=CJxBNvGUwOfKfkFLvmCGIw&amp;s=19">over of Twitter&nbsp;</a> and last week The Wall Street Journal also&nbsp; reported that Microsoft had made up their mind and would bring the next Call of Duty game straight into Game Pass when it launches later this year.</p>


<p>This year’s COD has been confirmed to be Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, as Activision follow up on a teaser site and leaked newspaper advertising with a formal announcement. The game will debut during the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/30/xbox-games-showcase-and-a-redacted-direct-confirmed-for-june-9th/">Xbox Showcase on 9th June</a> with a Black Ops 6 Direct to follow immediately afterwards.</p>
<p><iframe title="wake up (rushmore) #thetruthlies" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RxIHyfwUrTg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The advertising came with copies of USA Today in a promotional supplement that show’s the game’s logo, title and some in-universe news stories. In particular there’s the defacing of Mount Rushmore, which also appeared on <a href="https://thetruthlies.com/6/">the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 teaser website</a> yesterday.</p>

<p>That teaser site features an analogue TV which you can scroll through six channels, some of which give static, but the first of which shows Mount Rushmore’s defacement, and the sixth of which tunes in to News 6, with faux reporting of monuments around the world also being defaced.</p>
<p>The hope is that this will be a major boost to Xbox Game Pass subscriber counts, across both Xbox and PC, and since COD will not be a platform exclusive for a long, long time, should preserve a lot of the overall profitability of the franchise with the majority of gamers still happy to buy the games outright on PlayStation in particular. A large portion of the money that Call of Duty makes also comes from the free-to-play Warzone game mode.</p>

            <p>
Sega initially "flat out rejected" the first proposal for Yakuza, as it wouldn't attract the masses.
</p>
<p>
That's according to series creator Toshihiro Nagoshi on the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxz5fP2iaeY">News Picks video</a>, in which he discusses the origins of the series (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/like-a-dragon-creator-talks-about-sega-flat-out-rejecting-the-first-yakuza-game-thinking-it-wouldnt-sell/">Automaton</a>).

</p>
<p>
The Like A Dragon series (Yakuza in the West) debuted in 2015, but initially wasn't seen as a profitable idea.

</figure>
<p>

At this time in the industry, Japanese games no longer dominated sales. "This led to a mindset of making games that would appeal to the masses, games that could sell anywhere and to anyone. Many producers, including myself, thought this way," said Nagoshi.  
</p>
<p>
"But this mindset wasn't really leading to a solution, and I saw many game proposals gradually become watered down as producers bent over to change things the way management instructed them to."
</p>
<p>
However, when Nagoshi pitched the concept of Like a Dragon to Sega, "it was flat out rejected," he said. "After all, it was completely contrary to what I mentioned earlier about attracting the masses. Children wouldn't be able to play it, and it wasn't catered to women nor overseas audiences. In this sense, there was no way for it to be approved without resistance."
</p>
<p>
Nagoshi believed the game's strong identity would make it a commercial success, though admitted the route to approval was "quite forceful".
</p>
<p>
He also did not want the game to affirm violence, despite its Yakuza subject. "I wanted it to be a game that makes you want to do your best to live another day," he said. "I remember reminding people of this frequently."
</p>
<p>
It's perhaps surprising Sega was initially reluctant to green light the game, considering it's now one of its top franchises alongside Sonic and the Persona series. Nagoshi was clearly right that its strong Japanese identity would result in global appeal.
</p>
<p>
The latest in the series, Infinite Wealth, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-hits-1m-sales-in-first-week">sold 1m units in its first week</a> and was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-is-series-biggest-steam-launch-to-date">series' biggest Steam launch ever</a>.


</p>
<p>
As a whole, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-sammy-reports-best-financial-performance-for-a-decade-despite-european-studio-disappointment">series has sold 21.3m units</a> (as per November 2023).

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> will be the first Call Of Duty to launch on Microsoft Game Pass, according to a notification that went out this morning via the Xbox Game Pass app for iPhone and Android. "Just announced: Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is coming to Game Pass on day one later this year!" it reads. Sounds like a solid confirmation from me, though Microsoft and Activision have yet to start bellowing the news from any of Call of Duty’s official pulpits.</p><!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1795385251306324292">Tom Warren</a> of the Verge, the notification links to a currently unpublished blog, which suggests that it has gone out early by accident. Look at me go, joining the dots. The addition of COD to Game Pass has been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-call-of-duty-will-launch-on-game-pass-on-day-one-reports-say">much rumoured</a>, with one former Microsoft senior PR describing it as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game-passs-only-outside-shot-for-sustainability-is-to-get-gta-6-or-call-of-duty-says-former-microsoft-senior-pr-lead">vital if the subscription service is to ever become "sustainable"</a>.</p>
<p>It all follows the more-deliberate release of a Black Ops 6 teaser trailer, below, which is certainly very Black Operational in being a woozy smear of period newsreel footage, close-ups of eyes, and vocodery voices urging you to discover the truth, although please bear in mind that the truth is a lie. By logical extension, are lies truth? In that case, let me swiftly add that Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 is actually a double-A immersive sim with an emphasis on dialogue puzzles, set in a pastel-coloured Soulslike dystopia under the friendly regard of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-2024-revealed-as-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-a-dark-new-chapter">a Capitol-wearing giga-wolf</a>. </p>

<p>The trailer seemingly confirms that this year’s codpiece is indeed strapped to the groin of the first Gulf War, as per <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-call-of-duty-is-a-black-ops-game-set-during-the-first-gulf-war-according-to-reports">a report last November</a>. There are fleeting glimpses of Margaret Thatcher, Saddam Hussein and OG George Bush, together with a shot of Glowering Silhouette Man from the first Black Ops. Doubtless there will be shooting of some kind, though my dream of lopping Thatcher’s head off and using it to petrify people like the Medusa’s head in GOW remains a few kilometres over the horizon of probability.</p>
<p>Still, remember that lies are truths, and as such, that this year’s Call Of Duty is definitely a pen-and-paper journalling game that’s only available in Malta. Roll with it, you apes! Anything’s possible! Look, they’re <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-is-getting-in-the-gundam-robot">putting Call Of Duty in Gundam now</a>!</p>
<p>There’s a big Black Ops 6 segment coming at Microsoft’s Summer Games Fest showcase on June 9th. Hopefully it'll clear a few things up, or at least give us some nicely remastered period music to hum along to.</p>

			<p>This morning, CAPCOM <a href="https://x.com/DragonsDogma/status/1795387174453395631?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced </a>through Twitter/X that Dragon's Dogma 2 has now sold over three million units across all platforms. The game had reached the 2.5 million units milestone <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in early April</a>.</p>
<p>According to Circana, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-npd-circana-march-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it outsold every game in North America this past March</a>. Moreover, it has already managed to outsell the combined sales of previous franchise entries. Such great sales performance from Dragon's Dogma 2 (and other titles) <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-announces-upward-revision-for-earnings-forecast-following-favorable-dragons-dogma-2-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allowed CAPCOM to revise upward its earnings forecast</a>:</p>
<p><em>In our core Digital Contents business, in addition to Street Fighter 6, the latest title in the Street Fighter series, being met with broad acclaim globally, Dragons Dogma 2 was released in the fourth quarter and has performed favorably. Further, sales grew for catalog titles consisting primarily of past titles from major series due to their steady popularity. Altogether, this has led us to expect earnings for this business to exceed our plan.</em></p>
<p>Users can now <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-mod-adds-path-tracing-and-other-rt-options-including-performance-boost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add built-in path tracing to the game on PC</a>. However, the lack of a proper denoiser makes it less than ideal. Here's what I wrote about Dragon's Dogma 2 in my review:</p>
<p><em>The original game was an amazing foundation to build upon, and yet CAPCOM seemed content with keeping the same strengths without improving much on the weaknesses. Twelve years later, though, the effect cannot be the same. Still, make no mistake: Dragon's Dogma 2 is a highly enjoyable fantasy action/adventure with RPG elements that will provide you with about 40 hours of pure fun. Its peerless sense of exploration, meaty combat system, and stunning visuals will motivate you throughout the entire playthrough. Just don't expect to find a fantasy world simulator or, indeed, a narrative worth remembering.</em></p>
<p>Following this sales performance, it is highly likely that CAPCOM will release some DLC for Dragon's Dogma 2, although no plan has been shared as of yet.</p>

        <p>Lawsuit claims gunman bought gun after using it in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Parents and victims of the 2022 Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas are suing Activision and its parent company Microsoft.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/24/us/uvalde-gun-instagram-activision-lawsuit.html">The New York Times</a>, dual <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000018f-acc4-d34e-afcf-bdd6a4660000">lawsuits were filed</a> in California and Texas last Friday, which marked the second anniversary of the shooting where 19 children and two teachers were killed by an 18-year-old gunman.</p>
<p>Instagram and its parent company Meta were also included in the suit, in addition to gun manufacturer Daniel Defense, for their alleged role in "grooming" the teenager into becoming a shooter.</p>
<p>Activision was described as being "the most prolific and effective marketer of assault weapons in the United States," referring to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/activision-made-a-secret-deal-for-gun-product-placement-in-call-of-duty">alleged gun product placement</a> in the Call of Duty games.</p>
<p>The suit claimed that within a week of the gunman downloading Call of Duty: Modern Warfare in 2021, he bought a gun that had been featured in the game and used in promotional material.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Activision said (via <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uvalde-shooting-families-wrongful-death-lawsuit-meta-activision-daniel-defense/">CBS News</a>): "The Uvalde shooting was horrendous and heartbreaking in every way, and we express our deepest sympathies to the families and communities who remain impacted by this senseless act of violence. Millions of people around the world enjoy video games without turning to horrific acts."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uvalde-school-shooting-victims-sue-activision-claiming-its-the-most-prolific-marketer-of-weapons-in-the-us">ESA also issued a statement</a> in which the organisation said the claims of the lawsuit were "baseless."</p>
<p>"We are saddened and outraged by senseless acts of violence," it said. "At the same time, we discourage baseless accusations linking these tragedies to video gameplay, which detract from efforts to focus on the root issues in question and safeguard against future tragedies.</p>
<p>"Many other countries have similar rates of video gameplay to the United States, yet do not see similar rates of gun violence."</p>

Now, Xbox may have accidentally revealed that <em>Black Ops 6 </em>will be on Game Pass from release day. </p> <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="277" data-injectable="false">Teasers for the next installment of the <em>Call of Duty </em>franchise dropped throughout last week, eventually leading to the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/call-of-dutys-black-ops-6-logo-has-been-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official <em>Black Ops 6</em> reveal</a> on May 23. While we expect it to drop in Autumn 2024, we weren’t sure if it would be available on Game Pass on release day. </p> <p data-characters="224" data-current-count="501" data-injectable="true">It appears that will be the case; however, after a notification from the Xbox Game Pass mobile app appeared, it said: “Just announced: <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> is coming to Game Pass on day one later this year!”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>A nice notification to receive. Image via Quelanight2324 on Reddit. </figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="247" data-current-count="547" data-injectable="true">Microsoft insider JezCorden moved quickly to throw support behind the news, writing that he expects to see the official announcement of <em>BO6</em> on Game Pass “sometime this week,” but wasn’t able to give an exact date for the reveal. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think you can expect to see the official announcement from Xbox / Microsoft that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is going to Xbox Game Pass from day one some time this week. <a href="https://t.co/EXqTZfelQu">https://t.co/EXqTZfelQu</a></p>— Jez (@JezCorden) <a href="https://twitter.com/JezCorden/status/1795325273875038238?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="429" data-current-count="729" data-injectable="true">While Microsoft president Sarah Bond had previously stated that all titles from their developers would appear on Game Pass, there was still some uncertainty around <em>Call of Duty</em>. While it was expected that older titles would be added to the platform, the decision to release this year’s game on the service on launch day is huge, especially considering that <em>CoD</em> games regularly dominate the year’s best-seller charts. </p>
 <p data-characters="383" data-current-count="383" data-injectable="false">How this will affect sales of the FPS title remains to be seen, but it marks a seismic shift for the franchise and could help to boost player count when people don’t have to drop $70 to try the game out. With the success of <em>CoD</em>‘s free-to-play battle royale <em>Warzone</em> already bringing players back to the franchise, it feels like a golden age of <em>CoD</em> could be upon us again. </p>

            <p>Konami has announced a second Silent Hill Transmission show.</p>
<p>This show will cover game updates, another look at the Return to Silent Hill film adaptation, and merch, Konami said.</p>

<p>While Konami has kept further specifics for the show under wraps, I have a few ideas for what we can expect. First of all, I am sure we will see more of the Silent Hill 2 Remake, and perhaps even get a release date. Back in January, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-gives-2024-release-window-to-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-and-silent-hill-2-remake">promotional video from PlayStation</a> appeared to suggest the remake would be released at some point this year.</p>
<p>As for gameplay, the Silent Hill 2 Remake team may want to redeem itself after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloobers-silent-hill-2-remake-gets-fresh-airing-in-combat-focused-trailer">an earlier combat-focused trailer</a> failed to wow audiences. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-bloober-team-wasnt-a-fan-of-silent-hill-2-remakes-combat-focused-trailer">developer Bloober said this previous teaser failed to "capture the spirit of the game"</a>, adding Konami was responsible for marketing. Then, just last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-developer-is-excited-and-very-confident">Bloober stated it was "very confident" and "excited" about Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>.</p>
<p>Another game I expect we may see on Thursday is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-announced-from-resident-evil-reverse-developer">Silent Hill: f</a>, which was first announced in 2022 during the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-konamis-silent-hill-october-2022-showcase">first Silent Hill Transmission show</a>. It was revealed with a goosebump-inducing trailer that made my skin crawl, and it is making my skin crawl again just thinking about it. This particular release will be the first new mainline game for the series in over a decade. </p>
<p>We may also see more of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-townfall-is-a-new-entry-to-the-series-from-stories-untold-developer-no-code">Silent Hill: Townfall</a>, which was announced at the same time as f.</p>
<p>Film-wise, I am also expecting a release date for Return to Silent Hill, along with a cinematic trailer. Last year, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-casts-war-horses-jeremy-irvine-as-james">War Horse's Jeremy Irvine had been cast as James</a> in the upcoming release, with Hannah Emily Anderson playing his "true love", presumably Mary.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-film-leak-suggests-plot-changes-new-character-and-cast-update">leaked film synopsis for Return to Silent Hill</a> previously stated James will return to Silent Hill looking for "his lost love Mary Crane" (in the game, James returns to Silent Hill in search of his wife Mary Shepherd-Sunderland, suggesting the characters may not be married in this adaptation).</p> <div>

            <p>
Square Enix has teased a HD-2D remake of Dragon Quest 3.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, 27th May, was Dragon Quest day, celebrating the release of the original Dragon Quest game in Japan in 1986.
</p>
<p>
The short tease was shared on social media platform X featuring the Dragon Quest 3 logo with the words "The legacy begins". The post reads "The legend of Erdrick draws near", Erdrick being the most common name to refer to the third game's protagonist - chronologically the first in the series, though some fans are hoping for remakes of the first three games together.

<p>

In the corner of the video is a HD-2D logo, while platforms listed are Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Steam and Windows.

<p>
So while this isn't yet a full announcement, it's easy to deduce what game this is.
</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-12-takes-the-long-running-rpg-series-down-a-darker-path">HD-2D remake of Dragon Quest 3 was first revealed on Dragon Quest day in 2021</a>, with a video of the game in motion (see below) developed by Team Asano (Octopath Traveler, Triangle Strategy). This latest tease, then, is the first we've heard of the game since.

<p>
It's unknown when the full reveal will be as there's no date in the tease, but perhaps it'll appear in a showcase during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">Summer Game Fest</a>? Leaker <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1795062186391273783">Midori</a> believes it'll be seen at the next Nintendo Direct.
</p>
<p>Dragon Quest 3 first released on the NES in 1988 and has seen a number of re-releases since then, including on SNES and Game Boy.</p>
<p>
Series creator Yuji Horii also shared a post with a brief update on Dragon Quest 12, the next major game in the series, stating he wants to make something worthy of the posthumous work of the two people who passed away.
</p>
<p>
That would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tributes-shared-as-dragon-ball-creator-akira-toriyama-passes-away">artist Akira Toriyama</a> who passed away earlier this year, and composer Koichi Sugiyama who passed away in 2021 at the age of 90.

A number of Dragon Quest spin-off games have been released in recent years, but the next game in the series is highly-anticipated.

            <p>In the vast <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wuthering-waves-release-date">Wuthering Waves</a>-shaped shadow that has descended across gaming comes an announcement from HoYoverse, publishers of quite large gacha gubbins 'em up, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/genshin-impact-3-7-release-time">Genshin Impact</a>. The studio's follow-up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenless-zone-zeros-closed-beta-has-started-offering-glimpses-of-its-genshin-impact-style-combat">Zenless Zone Zero</a> is now set to release on July 4th. For anyone who hasn't yet heard of the bright cyberpunk character action game, I guess now's your chance to look at the slick anime visuals in the new trailer below and go "hmmm", with either a songful note of eye-widening interest or the suspicious rumble of a free-to-play skeptic.  Your choice.</p>

<p>That housekeeping wolf has got legs. Zenless Zone Zero is set in the futuristic city of New Eridu, an urban cybertopia under threat from the interdimensional beasts that erupt from invasive gateways called Hollows. As the hero conscripted in the city's hour of need, you have to navigate the Hollows and wreck the baddies. What this looks like from trailers, betas and marketing material is a sorta-roguelike jaunt through a grid of CRT television screens, with a lot of flashy combat and big boss battles along the way. Jeremy has a more thorough <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenless-zone-zero-release-date-details-everything-we-know">summary of what you do in Zenless Zone Zero</a>, for anyone interested. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/news/123831">release date announcement</a> comes quite soon after the release of Wuthering Waves, a Genshin-esque adventure about (as far as I can tell) a gaggle of anime stereotypes all tattooed with their favourite .wav file. Considering how widely played Genshin Impact appears to have been, the release of similar games chasing its sparkly coattails feels inevitable. Whether these new contenders appeal with the same forcefulness remains to be seen. I've been playing Wuthering Waves a bit and it's not capturing me a whole lot. Zenless Zone Zero looks more my style of hack-the-planet nonsense but we'll have to wait until July to see if its jet-legged lycanthropes are enough to keep things lively. Meanwhile, total keeners can <a href="https://act.hoyoverse.com/zzz/event/e20240528landing-2byyms">pre-register with HoYoverse</a>, we're told.</p>

			<p>Dragon Quest III HD-2D won't take much longer to release, and it will be accompanied by a rather welcome surprise, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking on X/Twitter, Midori, who proved to be an extremely reliable insider in the past few months, revealed that the game will be released by the <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1795158319201440033?t=Rp2_AO2_VycztqA91P3iuQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">end of the current fiscal year</a>, so by the end of March 2025. Additionally, it seems like Square Enix is remastering in 2D-HD the entirety of the <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1795163362344472878" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Loto trilogy</a>, which comprises the first three entries in the series. <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-3-hd-is-coming-to-switch-ps5-xbox-series-and-pc/">Yesterday's teaser</a> kind of gives it away, as it mentioned the legend of Erdrick, which is the main focus of the Loto trilogy.</p>
<p>If Dragon Quest III HD-2D will indeed be accompanied by the remasters of its predecessors, playing these games will be a great way to prepare for the release of<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-xii-the-flames-of-fate-is-being-co-developed-by-orca-dev-is-recruiting-unreal-engine-5-staff/"> Dragon Quest XII: The Flames of Fate</a>. Very little is currently known about the game besides the fact that it will be powered by Unreal Engine 5 and will feature an overhaul of the series' classic turn-based combat system.</p>
<p>Dragon Quest III HD-2D will launch on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch. We will keep you updated on the game and the other rumored remasters as soon as more information becomes available, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-game-pass-day-one/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Earlier today, people woke up to a new notification from Xbox that Black Ops 6 will be coming to Xbox Game Pass Day One.</p>



<p>The message read, “Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is coming to Game Pass on day one later this year!” Which diverted people to this link on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/28/play-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a>. As pointed out by the URL, the announcement is expected to be made today, May 28th, 2024. </p>



<p>Later today, Black Ops 6 will reveal its live-action trailer for Black Ops 6, which will presumably coincide with the announcement of Day One Game Pass. </p>



<p>Following the rumours on Black Ops 6 going to Game Pass last week, new rumours began to emerge that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-to-make-changes-to-xbox-game-pass-tiers-because-of-call-of-duty-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">move will result in changing to Game Pass tiers</a>, which could imply increases are soon on their way. Currently, there’s Xbox Game Pass Core for console that replaced Xbox Live Gold for $9.99/month, Game Pass PC for $9.99/month, and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate that covers both console and PC for $16.99/month.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming understands that Call of Duty Black Ops 6 is expected to launch on October 25, 2024. The game will be fully revealed during the Xbox Games Showcase on June 9th, 2024. Immediately after, it will be given an exclusive Black Ops 6 direct, during which the developers are expected to discuss some of the game’s features and story in more depth.</p>



<p>What do you think of Black Ops 6 coming to Game Pass Day One? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be a day one launch via Xbox Game Pass, a Microsoft notification has now seemingly confirmed. 
</p>
<p>
Users of the Xbox Game Pass app for iPhone and Android have this morning received a notification that states: "Just announced: Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is coming to Game Pass on day one later this year!"
</p>
<p>
As first reported by <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1795385251306324292">Tom Warren</a>, the notification includes a link to a currently-unpublished blog post on Xbox.com, likely set to go live in the near future.

<p>
News that Black Ops 6 will launch via Xbox Game Pass isn't a huge surprise - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-2024-will-launch-into-xbox-game-pass-microsoft-has-reportedly-decided">The Wall St Journal previously reported that Microsoft had now made the decision earlier this month</a>.
</p>
<p>
But the question remains whether <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/there-will-be-changes-to-xbox-game-pass-when-call-of-duty-is-added-says-industry-insider">Microsoft will take advantage of Black Ops 6's status to change Xbox Game Pass' pricing or tier structure somehow</a> - which would also help recoup some of the money that players would otherwise have spent on $70 copies.

Microsoft will fully show off Black Ops 6 in a dedicated hour-long presentation after its June Xbox Showcase event, which will once again take place alongside other events from Ubisoft and (its expected) Nintendo during the old E3 conference week.
</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Microsoft for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-classic-board-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Board gaming is great in part because of the variety of new options available nowadays. You'll find plenty to choose from, whether you're interested in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family board games</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy board games</a>, or just about any other genre. But just because modern games are the best they've ever been doesn't mean older games are bad. There's a good reason why the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">best board games</a> have been popular choices for both <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-beginner-board-games">beginners</a> and veteran players for such a long time.</p><p>Modern games are mostly the product of a design trend that dates back to the mid-nineties. So it's of particular interest to go digging for gold in the years prior to that explosion. Here, presented in reverse chronological order, are some of the best classic board games that stand the test of time. Some of these will likely also be on sale during <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday 2024</a>.</p><h3>TL;DR: The Best Classic Board Games</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Mj0Ym" target="_blank">Azul</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/YBy5d" target="_blank">Pandemic</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Mg8qg" target="_blank">Ticket to Ride</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/pPl0o" target="_blank">Settlers of Catan</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/w2lqq" target="_blank">Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/2m8pl" target="_blank">Can't Stop</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/EDX4G" target="_blank">Acquire</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/jPy3q" target="_blank">Diplomacy</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/gdR7D" target="_blank">Yahtzee</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/XZbMW" target="_blank">Scrabble</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/DMJ6g" target="_blank">Othello</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/MgpE0" target="_blank">Crokinole</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/NwKND" target="_blank">Liar's Dice</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/3wjnw" target="_blank">Chess</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/ZXmYR" target="_blank">Playing Cards</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/mLl43" target="_blank">Go</a></li></ul><p>Don't have time to sift through the blurbs below? Here's a cheatsheet for what games are included, from most recent to earliest.</p><h2>Azul (2017)</h2><div id="157144"><p><h3>Azul Board Game</h3></p></div><p>Despite only having been released in 2017, and an abstract to boot, a genre that’s notoriously hard to sell, Azul has all the makings of a modern classic. It’s a delight to look at, featuring a huge bag of bright, chunky, sweet-sized tiles. The gameplay is easy: you take all the matching tiles from one of several pools each turn and fit them in rows on your board, which have room for between one and five tiles. Fill a row and goes onto your scoring mat, where you get points for neighbouring tiles and completing rows, columns and matching sets. Simple, right? Except a single play will leave you astonished at the variety, depth and subtle interaction this straightforward formula supports. </p><h2>Pandemic (2008)</h2><div id="198687"><p><h3>Pandemic</h3></p></div><p>How can the game that launched the entire, now hugely popular, genre of cooperative games not rate as a classic? It wasn’t the first title that had all the players working together to defeat the game scenario, but its mix of clever mechanisms and easy rules helped it conquer the world. Which is ironic, since you’re trying to save the world. New diseases are threatening the globe, represented by cubes in major cities on the map. If too many accumulate, the infection will spread to neighbouring spaces which can, in turn, cause further outbreaks. Players need to accumulate card sets and use special powers to find the cures, but with the city cards that control disease spread going back on top of the deck, it’s a race against time before this pressure cooker explodes.</p><h2>Ticket to Ride (2004)</h2><div id="161110"><p><h3>Ticket to Ride</h3></p></div><p>Developed by legendary game designer Alan R. Moon, Ticket to Ride and its many spinoffs trade on the widely-known set collection card game Rummy, making it super accessible and easy to learn. You’re picking up coloured cards that match train routes on the board, trying to connect cities that correspond to your ticket cards for bonus points. But the maps are super-tight, and other players are always watchful for a chance to block your plans, making it an incredibly exciting and tense experience. Especially so when failed tickets lose you the bonus points instead of gaining them. Fast, furious and fun, this is a franchise that’s made it into the mass market and is here to stay.</p><h2>Settlers of Catan (1996)</h2><div id="159921"><p><h3>Catan</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://bonsai.to/eoy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Also at Target</a></li></ul><p>A modern classic, now known simply as Catan, this game has fallen a little out of favor. But we shouldn't forget what a revolution it was in its time. Its mix of clever dice mechanics, trading and route planning as players competed to colonize an island was like nothing we'd seen before. In its native Germany, games like this weren't quite so novel, but its import in English kickstarted the whole modern gaming scene. It's worth playing for its historical value alone. Luckily, it remains worth playing to recall how addictive its sweet blend of luck and strategy can be.</p><h2>Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective (1981)</h2><div id="157800"><p><h3>Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective</h3></p></div><p>A bizarre blend of board game, whodunnit, and choose your own adventure, this sleuthing title was years ahead of its time. Pick a scenario and head out onto the foggy streets of Victorian London as the agents of fictions' most famous detective. Players must work together to uncover clues, solve riddles and try and piece a solution together as efficiently as they can. Do it better than Holmes himself and your group wins. Atmospheric writing elevates these scenarios into an engrossing fiction in its own right. And if you manage to solve them all, there are loads of expansion packs to puzzle through.</p><h2>Can't Stop (1980)</h2><div id="159920"><p><h3>Can't Stop</h3></p></div><p>A second Sackson classic, Can't Stop is an easier and more raucous game. It's a race to reach the top of three of the eleven columns on the board. Each column matches a possible roll of two dice and the more likely the result, the longer the column. You roll four dice, make two pairs and move two markers. Then comes the kicker: you can keep rolling, or end your turn. If you carry on and fail to roll a match, you lose your progress. It's a constant, agonizing temptation to balance luck and skill. Play it as a board game, or try the excellent mobile version.</p><h2>Acquire (1964)</h2><div id="159919"><p><h3>Acquire</h3></p></div><p>Some credit this game, by virtuoso designer Sid Sackson, as the progenitor of much of modern gaming. In an era where there were only mass-market titles and war games, Acquire was something new.  It's a game about creating, merging and investing in companies. On your turn, you place a tile onto the grid, representing a company stock. If your placement joins two existing companies, the larger absorbs the smaller. Then, you can buy shares in any of the companies which you'll sell later for a profit, depending on the size. The result is a masterful mix of fiendish spatial challenges and economic wiles that remains fresh and thrilling to this day.</p><h2>Diplomacy (1959)</h2><div id="159918"><p><h3>Diplomacy</h3></p></div><p>Wrecking friendships for over 50 years, Diplomacy is divisive in a way few other games are. Designed by a historian to examine the political geography of 19th century Europe, the game has no randomness. Players struggle to conquer the continent, with one unit simply eliminating another in combat. It's designed so that you can't win alone: you need allies to prosper. Yet only one player can claim victory, so betrayal and backstabbing is inevitable. Its clever catch is that movement is simultaneous. You write orders down in advance, and all players reveal them at the same time. So you don't know who's kept their promises and who's turned against you until it's too late.</p><h2>Yahtzee (1956)</h2><div id="159917"><p><h3>Yahtzee</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://bonsai.to/r3y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Also at Target</a></li></ul><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-roll-and-write-board-games">Roll and write games</a>, where you scribble in the results of dice or card draws, are very much in vogue right now. But let's not forget their mass-market progenitor, Yahtzee, which is far more fun than you may remember. Sure, you're in the hands of fate when you're rolling the bones. But filling in the grid takes a lot more skill and statistics than many realize. There's nothing worse than crossing in a blank and then getting the right rolls down the line. Fast, furious and family-friendly, get the pencils out and take this classic for a roll.</p><h2>Scrabble (1948)</h2><div id="159916"><p><h3>Scrabble</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://bonsai.to/8lo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Also at Target</a></li></ul><p>Yes, this well-known word game does take a bit too long between turns, especially with more players. But it's a fascinating and brilliant balance between vocabulary and spatial play. Sure it helps to know a lot of words when you're finding ways to lay out your seven random letters. But a player that can sneak a ten-point letter into an awkward bonus space will scoop the prize every time.  And it's so well-known it's easy to find people willing to play. Grab your phone between turns, and get gaming.</p><h2>Othello / Reversi (1883)</h2><div id="159915"><p><h3>Othello</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://bonsai.to/4r4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Also at Target</a></li></ul><p>This is often presumed to be a classic two-player ancient abstract like Chess and Checkers. In fact, it's much more recent and, bizarrely, two different men took credit, each rubbishing the other's claim. On your turn you place a disk of your color, black or white, onto a grid space. The aim is to fill the grid with your color. But the disks are reversible. If you can bookend a line or diagonal of your opponent's color with yours, all the disks flip to your side. Cue a fiendish battle of wits that can suddenly swing, even late in the game.</p><h2>Crokinole (1876)</h2><div id="159922"><p><h3>Crokinole</h3></p></div><p>Of all the many and varied dexterity games in the world, Canada’s Crokinole holds the crown. Boards aren’t cheap but they’re lovely objects in their own right. Particularly nice specimens can be mounted on the wall as a talking point. And when you get it down to play, you’ll find out what all the fuss is about as you navigate its treacherous mix of flicking skill and tactical positioning. Your goal is to get your disks into the highest scoring zones possible, but the catch is you have to flick them off existing disks to count. It’s all about trying to rack up the points while also hiding your disks behind the board pegs or other disks.</p><h2>Perudo / Liar's Dice (1800)</h2><div id="159914"><p><h3>Liar's Dice</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://bonsai.to/bgk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Also at Target</a></li></ul><p>You'll see this sold under various branded names, but the game is always the same. Everyone shakes some dice in secret, under a cup. Then they have to bid a certain number of a particular value they think the combined dice hold: seven fours, for example. Next player either ups the bid or calls their bluff. This straightforward setup disguises a wealth of statistics, guesswork and outright chicanery. Making a bid high enough to put the next player in a quandary is a wonderful moment. Being in a quandary, calling the bluff and finding the fates have rolled in your favor is better.</p><h2>Chess (16th Century)</h2><div id="198685"><p><h3>Anzid Wooden Magnetic Chess Set</h3></p></div><p>Chess is one of the most well-known strategy games, but the Chess you know has origins all the way back to 600 AD. Modern Chess was born from an Indian game called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaturanga#:~:text=The%20Sanskrit%20word%20chaturanga%20means,been%20a%20puzzle%20for%20centuries." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaturanga</a> in which the pieces, board, all look very similar. One of the first true masters of Chess didn't appear until that 16th century after the game had spread and evolved throughout Asia and Europe. Nowadays, the game of Chess is huge across the globe and there are a ton of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-chess-sets">great Chess sets</a> worth adding to your board game collection.</p><h2>Playing Cards (~900 AD)</h2><div id="159913"><p><h3>Bicycle Playing Cards</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://bonsai.to/hf1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Also at Target</a></li></ul><p>These also originated in China, and are also a game you can play for the rest of your life. Because, of course, it's not one game but thousands. Many you'll already know: Poker, Bridge and other popular titles constitute hobbies in their own right. But there are equally fun games played with slightly different decks across the world. You can play them fine with a standard 52 card deck: Jass, Scopa and dozens more. There are modern designers working with the deck to create new, strategically rich games like Ambition. Get a deck, get to <a href="https://www.pagat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pagat.com</a>, and it might be the only gaming equipment you ever buy.</p><h2>Go (~2200 BC)</h2><div id="159912"><p><h3>Go - Magnetic Board Game Set</h3></p></div><p>We're not including well-worn abstracts like Chess on this list. Go is huge in Japan and China, where it originated, but it's a little more obscure in the West. And that's a shame because Go is a thing of staggering genius. On your turn, you place a stone of your color atop an intersection on a grid of lines. If you can cut off all four adjoining spaces for a stone of the opposite color, it's removed. That's pretty much the entire game, yet the strategy beneath is so deep that only very recently has an AI challenged a top human player. Place one stone and you could be playing for a lifetime.</p><h2>What makes a board game a “classic”?</h2><p>In common with pretty much every use of that word, the real answer is that “it depends”. There are no cast iron rules to tell us when a game has crossed over that magical barrier into semi-mythical status. But two of the key things that guided us in compiling this list were units sold, influence and brand familiarity. For an example of the former, take Ticket to Ride. It borrows liberally from older designs, and it’s not a name that’s on the lips of any average person if they’re talking about board games. Indeed, relatively few people probably realise it’s an entire franchise of titles. But the original has sold over 10 million copies and is on supermarket shelves the world over, and something that popular has definitely made the leap, especially considering it started out in the hobby market. </p><p>Influence is a trickier thing to measure, but some games contain concepts so revolutionary that those in the know will cite them often, even if they never caught on more widely. Our poster child on this list is Sid Sackson’s Acquire, which anticipated the revelatory mathematical design concepts of games like Hoity Toity and Settlers of Catan by decades, yet has been frequently out of print in the years since its release and is almost unknown outside of enthusiast circles.</p><p>Finally, brand familiarity are the games that everyone instantly thinks of when talk turns to tabletop titles. Unfortunately, a lot of these games are simply not very good, and that really disqualifies them from being classics in the same way that recognisable and popular film and TV is often pretty forgettable in the long run. The best examples on the list are the ancient abstracts like Chess, but you could also make an argument that Diplomacy falls in this category. Far more people have heard of its infamous friendship-breaking reputation than have played it as an intensive, multi-hour marathon game.</p><p><em>For more board game suggestions, check out our roundups of the </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-adults"><em>best board games for adults</em></a><em> or the </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games"><em>best two-player board games</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelancer for IGN, specializing in tabletop games.

            <p>Resident Evils Code Veronica and 0 will be the next entries in the survival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> series to get the remake treatment, according to rumours. “A remake of Resident Evil Zero &amp; Code Veronica in development right now,” <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1795075373727613065">claimed user</a> Dusk Golem on Le Epic Musk Zone. The claim was <a href="https://x.com/Andy_VGC/status/1795144763382853937">casually corroborated</a> by trustworthy sort Andy Robinson of VGC. Note the wording here, which suggests a bundle package of sorts, similar to the rumoured original plan for the remakes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-2-remake">Resident Evil 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-3-remake">Resident Evil 3</a>.</p>

<p>So, there’s the facts, such as they are. But what do I, the discerning muncher of herbs found growing from the putrified innards of unholy kill dogs, think of such fanciful speculation? I’m glad I asked! If we take for granted that Capcom are going to have some form of Resi remake cooking from now until the great fraying of Shinji Mikami’s baseball caps, then….sure? Resident Evil 0 never struck me as an especially well-regarded entry, but Code Veronica seems as sensible a candidate as any. After the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resident Evil 4 Remake</a>’s post-credit happenings, I had assumed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-5">Resident Evil 5</a> would be up next. Still, Veronica does offer some context for marauding beefster Chris Redfield’s journey, years before he would shoot Ethan Winters' wife in the face and refuse to elaborate for absolutely no reason.</p>
<p>My high-level take here is that, awful terrible no-good Resident Evil 3 remake aside, I would trust Capcom with my heart medication, accepting the irony that I only require such medication because of how heartbreakingly shite the Resident Evil 3 remake was. </p>
<p>If you’ve already gorged yourself on the available Resident Evil back catalogue, fear not! It’s been a bumper few years for indie survival horror titles. Most recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crow-country">Crow Country</a>, which Alice Bee <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crow-country-review">reckons</a> is “a well-observed love letter to the genre with great attention to detail all over the place.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-coming-day-one-to-xbox-game-pass-new-mobile-app-notification-reveals.882606/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-xbox-game-pass/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is coming day one to Xbox Game Pass later this year, according to a new Game Pass mobile app notification that was pushed to users today.</p>
<p>As reported by multiple users, including The Verge's <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1795385251306324292" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Warren</a>, the notification essentially confirms that the next entry in the series, and the first one to be released after Activision Blizzard was acquired by Microsoft, will be available to Xbox Game Pass subscribers on day one. According to some users, clicking on the notification links to a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/28/play-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently unavailable web page</a> on the Xbox official website dated today, so an official announcement will be coming in the next few hours.</p>
<p>As it was being rumored that having Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and future entries in the series on Xbox Game Pass on day one would lead to some <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-tier-changes-cod/">changes to the service</a>, it will be interesting to see if a new subscription tier is introduced to include the series or any other high-profile game launching in the future.</p>
<p>Very little is currently known about Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. A recent teaser trailer seems to hint at a <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-teaser-90s-gulf-war-confirmed-frank-woods/">Gulf War setting</a>, which will likely be the focus of today's live-action trailer. A full reveal of the game will be coming in a dedicated presentation airing after this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-call-of-duty-direct-dated-june/">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, set for June 9th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-players-claim-ridiculously-overpowered-weapon-is-ruining-the-game/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xdefiant-players-claim-ridiculously-overpowered-weapon-is-ruining-the-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="194" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>XDefiant</em> has breathed new life into the FPS genre, but for some players who have jumped into the game, one weapon is ruining the game and making it difficult to enjoy the action: Sniper rifles. </p> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false">While reviews for the game have generally been positive, like any new game, there have been complaints. While the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiants-weapon-progression-is-criminally-slow-and-fans-want-changes/">slow weapon progression</a> is probably the most frustrating issue right now, if you’ve been playing <em>XDefiant</em>, the odds are pretty high that you’ve been demolished by a sniper rifle. </p> <p data-characters="225" data-current-count="530" data-injectable="true">That’s certainly been the case for me, and now players have gone to Reddit to complain about the snipers, calling them “ridiculously overpowered,” while also suggesting what Ubisoft needs to do to fix them. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Getting sniped at close range isn’t fun. Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="272" data-current-count="572" data-injectable="true">“Snipers are ridiculously overpowered,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XDefiant/comments/1d1yqx5/snipers_are_ridiculously_overpowered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> The_Stiffmeister. “Even at close range they can scope in and shoot while getting drilled in the face with an [assault rifle]. Zero flinch or movement punishment. The sniper lobbies make the game unfun.”</p>
 <p data-characters="301" data-current-count="301" data-injectable="false">This sentiment was echoed by many, with Snooperal saying their “only gripe with snipers is the fact that they’re better shotguns than shotguns,” while More_Tackle9491 said they “would do anything for a no sniping lobby,” as it’s “impossible to compete.”</p> <p data-characters="306" data-current-count="607" data-injectable="true">As for what’s causing the issue, the majority of players agree that the lack of flinch on sniper rifles is problematic. Flinch makes your recoil increase when you’re being shot, but as snipers don’t have it, you can shoot them while they are scoped in and their aim isn’t affected. </p>
 <p data-characters="723" data-current-count="723" data-injectable="true">“They 100% need more flinch. They’re already pretty close to being well-balanced with their slow reloads and slow ADS times, and I don’t mind being quickscoped either. If they got the drop on me, I think they rightfully earned it. I also don’t mind their one-hit kill,” wrote Ggun_14. “However, with the lack of flinch, I lost count of how many times I have dumped 4 to 5 rounds into a person and they still one tap me with zero consequence. If I’m the one that initiates the fight and I’m landing accurate multiple shots faster than they can? I’m the one that should have the upper hand, not them. This isn’t a skill issue. It’s a clear design flaw.”</p>
 <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="249" data-injectable="false">There’s definitely room for snipers in <em>XDefiant</em>, but the fact that they are more potent at short-range than an SMG like the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-best-p90-loadout-attachments-faction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">P90</a> is problematic. With plenty of patches coming down the line, we can only hope that Ubisoft will address this soon. </p>

            <p>
At intervals in our relentless battles with the Maw, we lose people. Sometimes, it's because those people have succeeded in levelling up out of games journalism, or found their way into another echelon of the craft. Other times, the losses are more abrupt and arbitrary. In each case, one short term response is <em>intensification</em>. Those of us who remain must be rockier, paperier and more shotgun than ever before. With that in mind, here are this (four-day) week's new PC games of note.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
28th May brings a welcome dose of calm in the shape of Populousy god sim <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1875060/Reus_2/">Reus 2</a>, in which you are a bunch of feelgood chthonic monsters tending to a 2D planet. On the 29th May, there's a couple of turn-based tactics games - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2081080/Capes/">Capes</a>, which features superheroes, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2450400/Trash_of_the_Titans/">Trash Of The Titans</a>, which features racoons (Nic: "pop this in ur maw roundup it looks exquisite"). They're joined by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1809540/Nine_Sols/">Nine Sols</a>, a Sekiro-inspired metroidvania from the developers of horror game all-timer Devotion. </p>
<p>On the 30th, we've got <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1069160/SKALD_Against_the_Black_Priory/">Skald: Against The Black Priory</a>, a party-based CRPG which has been recommended to me by both journalists and developers, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1558000/ECHOSTASIS/">[ECHOSTASIS]</a>, a mind-diving sci-fi FPS puzzle extravaganza with a corroded CRT aesthetic so swish I'm willing to forgive the dizzy parenthetical all-caps title. Closing us out on the 31st, there's the early access release of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/">Selaco</a>, an original shooter created in GZDoom, which has won the enthusiasm of no less a sinful icon than John Romero. 
</p>
<p>
As ever, you can follow our efforts to report the news and appease the Maw in the below weeklong liveblog, and recommend games or topics for coverage in the comments thread that dangles from this post like a Barnacle's tongue. Have a good week all and best of luck to James Gournalists everywhere.

    <p>Black Ops 6 is very much a Black Ops game, going by this hectic conspiracy theorist trailer, which lends credence to the rumour that the new shooter is set during the first Gulf War. CW for Thatcher cameo.</p>

        <p>The Destiny developer was awarded $63,210 in damages</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Bungie has won its lawsuit against cheats provider AimJunkies.</p>
<p>As reported by GameFile's Stephen Totilo on <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1794154042190700617">social media</a>, the Destiny developer was awarded $63,210 in damages, with the jury agreeing that the cheats did infringe on Bungie's copyright.</p>
<p>The founder of AimJunkies' parent company Phoenix Digital, David Schaefer, plans to make a move to have the verdict dismissed, and appeal if that's unsuccessful, Totilo further reported.</p>
<p>Bungie's lawyer James Barker commented: "We are grateful for the diligence, professionalism, and care exercised by the judge, his staff, and the jury. We're committed to our players and will continue to protect them against cheats, including taking this and future cases all the way to trial."</p>
<p>The case between Bungie and AimJunkies has been going on for a few years. In 2022, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/court-dismisses-bungie-copyright-infringement-claim-against-aimjunkies">Bungie's initial copyright infringement claim was dismissed</a>, as it failed to prove how the cheat seller infringed on its trademarks.</p>
<p>The case moved forward, with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/aimjunkies-subpoenas-valve-to-fight-bungie-copyright-accusations">Phoenix Digital issuing several subpoenas</a> later that year, claiming that someone at Bungie violated AimJunkies' terms of service by purchasing the software and giving it to their employer.</p>
<p>A judge denied <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/judge-rejects-aimjunkies-request-to-dismiss-bungie-lawsuit">AimJunkies' request to dismiss Bungie's lawsuit</a> soon after, and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/cheat-provider-aimjunkies-countersues-bungie">Phoenix Digital ended up counter-suing</a>. The <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/aimjunkies-countersuit-against-bungie-dismissed">countersuit was dismissed in November 2022</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/bungie-wins-43m-in-arbitration-case-against-aimjunkies">Bungie won $4.3 million in arbitration in February 2023</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/what-is-the-wuthering-waves-xbox-and-playstation-release-date/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=what-is-the-wuthering-waves-xbox-and-playstation-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="168" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Wuthering Waves</em> has officially been released for PC and mobile devices, which means millions of players have already downloaded the game and taken on the role of Rover.</p> <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="282" data-injectable="false">While there may have been some wrinkles in the launch, it looks like Kuro Games are getting everything ironed out, and people are enjoying their time with the combat-focused action RPG. What about the console players, however? When will Xbox and PlayStation fans be able to dive in?</p> <h2 id="h-what-is-the-wuthering-waves-xbox-and-playstation-release-date" data-injectable="false">What is the <em>Wuthering Waves</em> Xbox and PlayStation release date?</h2> <p data-characters="418" data-current-count="700" data-injectable="true">Sadly, there is no official release date for <em>Wuthering Waves</em> on Xbox or PlayStation at this point in time. This is likely due to a much higher focus on mobile and PC gaming in developer Kuro’s home market of China. I can only assume that a strong launch focused on those platforms and the home market would give the developer enough of an engaged userbase to very confidently move forward with console releases. </p>
 <p data-characters="211" data-current-count="211" data-injectable="false">There is also the fact that it is easier to be agile with PC releases, allowing developers to work out any bugs and playerbase issues before releasing on consoles where certification of updates can be an issue. </p> <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="668" data-injectable="false">For now, all console players can do is wait and hope for the best. While the developers have been very open in their desire to bring the title to consoles, that doesn’t mean that it will be happening anytime soon. We also don’t even know if the game is confirmed to be released on both consoles yet. These types of games seem to have some aversion to the Xbox at times, so it will be interesting to see if it is released on that platform at all.</p>

			<p>This morning, Chinese developer HoYoverse (previously known as miHoYo) <a href="https://x.com/ZZZ_EN/status/1795304091759047142" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that its next game, Zenless Zone Zero, will be released on July 4 on all platforms: <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009763" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;af_sub5=sns&amp;pid=CM_Twitter&amp;pli=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401?af_sub5=sns&amp;pid=CM_Twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a> devices.</p>
<p>The free-to-play urban fantasy action RPG was first <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenless-zone-zero-is-an-urban-fantasy-action-rpg-from-the-makers-of-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> just over two years ago. HoYoverse has since conducted multiple tests <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenless-zone-zero-beta-tuning-test-date-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on PC, mobile</a>, and, recently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenless-zone-zero-ps5-tech-test-sign-ups-pc-amplifying-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS5</a>. As usual for these games, a pre-registration milestone encourages users to pre-register so that everyone may get extra rewards at launch.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/?no_entry=true&amp;reserve=true&amp;utm_source=sns&amp;utm_medium=CM_Twitter&amp;af_sub5=sns&amp;pid=CM_Twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a>'s counter says 35.7 million users have already registered, unlocking 30K Denny coins, 8 Master Tapes, 5 Boopons, and 1 Agent Corin. The next milestone is at 40 million and would grant another 12 Master Tapes.</p>
<p>Here's the official overview provided by HoYoverse:</p>
<p><strong><em>Two identities, one unique experience</em></strong><br>
<em>In the near future, a mysterious natural disaster known as the "Hollows" has occurred. In this devastated world, a new kind of city has emerged - New Eridu. This last oasis has mastered the technology to coexist with the Hollows and is home to a variety of chaotic, boisterous, dangerous, and very active factions. As a professional Proxy, you play a vital role in connecting the city to the Hollows. Your story awaits.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Build your squad and fight fast-paced battles</em></strong><br>
<em>Zenless Zone Zero is an all-new 3D action game from HoYoverse that offers a thrilling combat experience. Create a squad of up to three players and launch your attack with basic and special attacks. Dodge and parry to neutralize your opponents' counterattacks, and when they're stunned, unleash a powerful combo of chain attacks to finish them off! Remember, different enemies have different characteristics, and it would be wise to use their weaknesses to your advantage.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Different Factions and Intertwined Stories</em></strong><br>
<em>Random Play can't operate without videotapes, and Proxies can't operate without agents. In New Eridu, clients from all walks of life will come knocking. So don't be fooled by their innocent and cute appearances, don't be afraid of those who tower over you and look dangerous, and don't turn away the fluffy ones who might shed fur all over your spotless floor. Talk to them, learn about their unique experiences, and allow them to become your friends and allies. After all, this is a long road, and only with companions will you be able to go far.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-launch-date-might-be-announced-in-2-days/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At long last, it seems like the launch date for the Silent Hill 2 remake could very well be announced in two days. Earlier today, KONAMI <a href="https://x.com/Konami/status/1795228491539005800" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed </a>a new Silent Hill transmission will be broadcast on YouTube on May 30 at 4 PM Pacific Time.</p>
<p>The Japanese publisher teased 'game updates, a deeper look at the film, and new merch.' However, Polish developer Bloober Team (Layers of Fear, Observer, Blair Witch, The Medium) shared its own tweet, telling fans they are thrilled to invite them to the transmission. It seems like an obvious hint that we'll get significant Silent Hill 2 remake news at the broadcast, which, at this point, could only be the launch date.</p>
<p>After all, we know that Bloober Team <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-polishing-phase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been focusing on other projects</a> since the beginning of the year. Moreover, CEO Piotr Babieno <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-marketing-begin-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said </a>the marketing campaign was forthcoming, signaling a launch in the not-too-far-off future.</p>
<p>Following several rumors, the Silent Hill 2 remake was finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-announced-will-come-to-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in October 2022 to be heading to PC and PlayStation 5. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, it will reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-will-faithfully-stick-to-the-traditional-story-canon-certain-areas-will-be-adjusted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stick faithfully to the original's story</a> while improving the game in other areas, such as visuals, camera view, and combat. The latter will benefit from <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-enemy-ai-is-fully-overhauled-to-improve-combat-devs-its-a-more-interesting-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fully remade enemy AI</a> to make encounters more interesting.</p>
<p>We already have the system requirements for the Silent Hill 2 remake:</p>

<p data-characters="258" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>, the upcoming action RPG from <em>Genshin Impact</em> and <em>Honkai</em> developers Hoyoverse, is officially launch on July 4. The “urban action” game will be free to play, and shall be available on PlayStation 5, PC, and mobile on the same day.</p> <p data-characters="186" data-current-count="186" data-injectable="false">To accompany the happy news, we also got a new trailer for badass wolfman Lycaon. The one-eyed lupine is featured kicking a bunch of ass while accompanied by some very sweet guitar work.</p> <figure data-current-count="486" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Lycaon Character Demo - &quot;Wolfishly Charming&quot; | Zenless Zone Zero" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8OqyvAXbgiQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">Zenless Zone Zero is set in a post-apocalyptic world where all manner of weird supernatural events have occurred. These events, known as Hollows, have destroyed much of modern society, turning some areas into unlivable zones. The last city, New Eridu, is a place of relative calm and peace, but only because Proxies, like the player character, work so hard to keep it that way.</p> <p data-characters="530" data-current-count="907" data-injectable="true">The combat is my personal favorite from Hoyoverse so far, leaning hard into quick swaps between characters that play off each other through aggressive skill rotations. During technical tests I had a lot of fun with the slightly goofy worldbuilding and puzzle-based exploration as well. The game also has a fun and colorful aesthetic that pulls heavily from the modern world but with a pleasant blend of inspirations from past fashion and future tech. All in all, I’m excited about this one and am eager to dive in on July 4.</p>
 <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false">If you like, you can pre-register at the official <a href="https://act.hoyoverse.com/zzz/event/e20240528landing-2byyms"><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> website</a> to inch the community one step closer to a bunch of free loot. 36 million players have pre-registered to date, so there will be plenty of people to play with. There is also the <a href="https://act.hoyoverse.com/zzz/event/e20240510predraw-ko7gnx/index.html?game_biz=nap_global&amp;hyl_presentation_style=fullscreen&amp;hyl_auth_required=true&amp;hyl_landscape=true&amp;hyl_hide_status_bar=true&amp;h5_appid=845&amp;utm_source=web&amp;utm_medium=oblanding_mission&amp;utm_campaign=go" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free Stock Up web-based event</a> for folks to take part in, should they wish.</p>

<p>This weekend, during the BLAST R6 Manchester Major, Ubisoft revealed the roadmap and plans for Y9S2 – Operation New Blood. During this short showcase, the team uncovered R6 Membership, a premium, paid-for offering that’ll reward players with exclusive benefits and bonuses in exchange for a monthly, recurring payment. I was on-site at the Manchester Major and can confirm that the jeering and booing that rippled through the building were indicative of the community’s response to the R6 Membership reveal.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-way-to-go">Way to Go</h2>



<p>For the most part, the twenty-something-minute reveal went down quite well. Ubisoft’s team expanded on new Operators – Striker and Sentry – and broke down balancing changes, quality-of-life improvements, and the global release of the peer-to-peer Marketplace in Rainbow Six Siege. They talked at length about improvements to the player protection systems, and anti-cheat mechanics, and revealed more about the Operators that are going to be ‘nerfed’ slightly going into Operation New Blood.</p>



<p>When the talk turned to the R6 Membership, the crowd started grumbling. Despite the showcase talking positively (of course) about the R6 Membership, the crowd united in their opposition to the introduction. </p>



<p>For $10 a month (recurring), Rainbow Six Siege players will be able to access a ‘premium’ battle pass, exclusive content drops, and other unique cosmetic items like animated skins that are only available to those <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/50c0MbM9IoHbgjV8MeoiA3/r6-membership-brings-animated-skins-full-battle-pass-access#:~:text=Join%20the%20R6%20Membership%20starting,drop%20begins%20June%2028th" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with an R6 Membership</a>. It was also confirmed that the R6 Membership will include a monthly allotment of R6 Credits, slotted neatly into the player’s in-game account to save or spend as they see fit.</p>



<p>It’s nothing that’ll make the R6 Membership a pay-to-win subscription, but there’s enough meat on the bones to make non-paying fans angry at Ubisoft for locking content behind a paywall. Ultimately, it’s the way of the world right now – this operating model is replicated in Fortnite, Fallout 76, Call of Duty, and Elder Scrolls Online, to name a few games.</p>

<p>Konami has announced ‘Silent Hill Transmission’, a showcase planned for May 30 at 4 PM PDT (1 AM CEST on May 31). The company has confirmed that it’ll share ‘game updates, a deeper look at the film, and new merch.’ Fans instantly took to social media platforms to share their predictions for the event, with the most common theme being that we’ll get an in-depth look at the Silent Hill 2 remake.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-revealing-transmission">Revealing Transmission</h2>



<p>Several Silent Hill projects are in the works, and we can expect any number of them to be revealed or expanded on during this showcase. For instance, the Silent Hill 2 remake will likely get a) a longer gameplay trailer, and b) a release date – or better window. There’s also Return to Silent Hill, Silent Hill Townfall, and Silent Hill f – any of these titles could be touched upon during the Silent Hill Transmission showcase.</p>



<p>Some fans are expecting the reveal of a grand collector’s edition of the Silent Hill 2 remake, but there hasn’t been any news on that topic thus far. With Konami teasing an update regarding merchandise, that’s certainly possible – but elsewhere, we could probably expect some kind of statue or figure-based offering. There are more than enough terrifying, iconic characters from the Silent Hill universe to keep fans guessing until the reveal takes place on May 30.</p>



<p>We’ll have all the latest news from the Silent Hill Transmission showcase as soon as it drops – stay tuned.</p>

<p id="7e50o5">Mareanie’s shiny form first became available during the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/2024/5/23/24163304/ultra-space-wonders-event-timed-research-stakataka-blacephalon-shiny-mareanie">“Ultra Space Wonders”</a> event. Toxapex (Mareanie’s evolution) actually does see some use in lower PvP leagues, so it may be worth having one around if you like PvP.</p>
<h2 id="wepEXU"><strong>What is the shiny rate for Mareanie in Pokémon Go?</strong></h2>
<p id="NElmhN">As per old research by the now-defunct website The Silph Road (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230423103325/https://thesilphroad.com/shiny-pokemon">Wayback Machine</a>), the shiny rate for Pokémon on a regular day is approximately one in 500. Mareanie is not a confirmed Pokémon that gets a “permaboost” (meaning that it’s a rare spawn and thus gets a boosted shiny rate).</p>
<h3 id="TZ4GJv"><strong>What can I do to attract more shiny Pokémon?</strong></h3>
<p id="r3MqkW">Not much, unfortunately. It appears to be random chance. Shiny Pokémon catch rates are set by developer Niantic, and they are typically only boosted during special events like Community Days or Safari Zones, or in Legendary Raids. There are no consumable items that boost shiny Pokémon rates.</p>
<h3 id="thj8sX"><strong>Where can I find a list of available shiny Pokémon?</strong></h3>
<p id="WRj9xa">LeekDuck keeps <a href="https://leekduck.com/shiny/">a list of currently available shiny Pokémon</a>. It’s a helpful visual guide that illustrates what all of the existing shiny Pokémon look like.</p>

			<p>Most long-running live service games eventually try to test the waters with a subscription service, even if the game was really set up for that initially. GTA Online did it, Fallout 76 did it, and now, it seems <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/rainbow-six-siege/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rainbow Six Siege</a> is doing it. For $10 a month, you can purchase an “R6 Membership,” which will get you access to all premium battle passes with 10 levels unlocked, time-limited legendary items, and more. You can <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/50c0MbM9IoHbgjV8MeoiA3/r6-membership-brings-animated-skins-full-battle-pass-access" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out the full rundown</a>, below.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFrainbowsixsiege89.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><em>“Unlock the ultimate Rainbow Six Siege experience with the R6 Membership! This offer delivers an exclusive drop of content every month, including a time-limited Legendary item (sometimes animated for extra flair), an Epic operator bundle, full access to the premium Battle Pass, 10x Battle levels, and a Bravo pack totaling over 4500 credits of value monthly.”</em></p>
<p><em>Reward Delivery Schedule:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Upon enrolling you get: Instant Battle Pass access, 10 Battle levels, and 1 Bravo pack</em></li>
<li><em>Then get a new cosmetic drop containing 1 Legendary item and 1 Epic bundle on the 28th of each month (first drop begins June 28th)</em></li>
<li><em>On your monthly renewal date, you'll receive another 10 Battle levels and 1 Bravo pack.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Unsurprisingly, this R6 Membership, which isn’t particularly generous compared to some other live service subscriptions, has not been all that well received. Perhaps most embarrassing, during the Blast R6 Major Manchester 2024 esports event, an announcement video for the R6 Membership was played, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/rainbow-six-siege-fans-roundly-boo-the-announcement-of-a-new-monthly-subscription-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inciting widespread boos</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rainbow Six Siege Membership Crowd Reaction" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ouBGbKKq1KQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Despite the booing, there’s still a pretty good chance people sign up and the R6 Membership becomes a quiet success for Ubisoft. Publishers don't do this kind of stuff for no reason. Of course, usual seasonal updates for Rainbow Six Siege will also be continuing, with <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/2L0bFvjA80swkS4EvawujB/y9s2-designers-notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Year 9, Season 2, “Operation New Blood”</a> coming up. This season will see Ubisoft Montreal begin the process of remastering individual Operators, starting with the OG, Striker.</p>
<p>Rainbow Six Siege can be played on PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PS5. You’ll be able to sign up for an R6 Membership starting June 11 and Y9S2 should kick off around the same time.</p>

This deal only applies to the Nintendo Switch version. The compilation released last October. Solid deals up until now dropped the price to $40 (list price is $60). However, it's worth noting that the Switch version runs at 30fps, while other platforms offer 60fps. Otherwise, the included content and bonus materials are identical between all versions. <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fmetal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1-nintendo-switch%2F-%2FA-89511462&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmetal-gear-solid-master-collection-is-only-20-for-switch-at-amazon%2F1100-6519091%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Target already sold out of the $20 deal</a>, so we wouldn't be surprised if Amazon sold out, too.</p><p>Heads up for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X owners: Amazon-owned retailer <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fmetal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1z&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmetal-gear-solid-master-collection-is-only-20-for-switch-at-amazon%2F1100-6519091%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Woot is selling the compilation for $25</a>.

"There are other ways to play these games, but I think we often undersell the appeal of convenience. Being able to easily access them all on a modern console is a major selling point." While some of these titles might show their age mechanically, the overarching Metal Gear Solid narrative holds up remarkably, and many of its themes like digital surveillance, artificial intelligence, and weaponized misinformation feel more relevant than ever.

			<p>When Studio Wildcard released <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-first-ue5-gameplay-cross-platform-modding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ARK: Survival Ascended</a>, its Unreal Engine 5 remaster of the highly successful open world survival game ARK: Survival Evolved, the studio bet heavily on the power of modding and user-generated content.</p>
<p>Studio Wildcard partnered with Overwolf's CurseForge to deliver these mods not just on Steam but everywhere, from PC to consoles. In addition to the <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/ark-survival-ascended" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dedicated webpage</a>, there's an in-game browser where users can check out the over 1900 mods available in ARK: Survival Ascended, which range from new weapons to new armor, creatures, and even fully-fledged game modes and high-quality maps.</p>
<p>Studio Wildcard and Overwolf did not stop there, though. They allowed the development of Premium Mods, and now nine of these paid mods are also available on Xbox Series S|X, with PlayStation 5 following soon.&nbsp;I've spoken with Studio Wildcard's Lead Designer and Co-Creative Director Jeremy Stieglitz and Overwolf's Chief Marketing Officer Shahar Sorek to discuss the importance of this landmark release and the role that user-generated content will play in the future of the games industry.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Mods are a great benefit. They don't eliminate the need for official content, but they definitely help make the game feel fresh on a daily basis' - Jeremy Stieglitz</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>First, let's talk about this partnership between Overwolf and Studio Wildcard for ARK: Survival Ascended mods. How did it come about?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> When we looked at doing a new version of ARK, we knew by looking at the original game that modding was very important for that game's success. But we asked ourselves the question, how can we make modding more of a core pillar of the game that will benefit all players for all versions of the game, not just the PC version, not just the Steam version?</p>
<p>In ARK: Survival Evolved, it wasn't even just that mods were limited to PC. They were limited to Steam. We had versions of the game on Epic Games Store and the Microsoft Store, and those versions wouldn't even work with the Steam mods.</p>
<p>We were looking at the limitations of Steam Workshop and really getting the sense that Valve had no plans to evolve it beyond that. Also, it was not just about making mods more available to a wider audience, but how we could make an ecosystem by which people could discover them more naturally, like in the game and really kind of relate it more to game logic and game categories and game flow, UI and so forth. But also, is there a way to make a financial ecosystem, not really for our benefit, but for the creators themselves so they can actually have an incentive to create higher quality mods, more ambitious mods, which benefits us in a fundamental way of increasing player engagement? Making more things for people to play in the game, higher quality things, especially because we know a key challenge with these live service games is the content treadmill as developers struggle to keep up with the amount of playable content that gamers reasonably expect on&nbsp;a weekly basis for these online service games, and that is very challenging for a small developer to do.</p>
<p>Mods are a great benefit. They don't eliminate the need for official content, but they definitely help make the game feel fresh on a daily basis. When content is created by end users, it's exciting.</p>
<p>So, all of that was so important to us, but here's the thing. We had no experience in any of that, so we knew that it was not in our capability to build anything like that. We looked around and it turned out that Overwolf and CurseForge had already been working on systems very much in line with those goals. At this point, I'll turn it over to them, and they can describe kind of what they have been building and how that relates to ARK: Survival Ascended.</p>
<p><strong>Shahar Sorek: </strong>Thank you, Jeremy. I'll start from the top with Overwolf and Curseforge. We see a massive shift happening in the world of gaming, with the demand for in-game content and user-generated content on a massive rise. That's due to players wanting to play more experiences, but also to all sorts of other demands, the rise of user acquisition, which makes it very tough for developers to attract players, and the extreme costs of developing extra content. So we see a world in which by the end of this decade, the time players spend on user generated content and mods is way bigger than the time spent on actually playing the core experience of the game. We are on a mission to create an ecosystem and a marketplace to support that because at the core of what we're trying to do is say that modders are really developers and they should get paid for that, hence premium mods right now.</p>
<p>It's like when YouTube came along, people put up videos, and suddenly, there was this new world called streamers. With Overwolf, we call modders and app and private server developers in-game creators, and the number one stat in our company that we measure is how much money in a year we managed to facilitate and help these creators earn.</p>
<p>In 2023, it was $201 million. Our goal by the end of the decade is to hit 1 billion. Studio Wildcard is probably the number one studio that we found so committed to the creator economy. They share the same view with us. We think that each game or worthwhile deep AAA experience is a content hub.</p>
<p>We're on a mission to detoxify each of those games and to allow for tools, from the tech tools to the moderating tools, to discoverability tools, to help those games enlist what I call the creator Legion to help build within them and also for some mods to monetize them.</p>
<p>We need to remember that the core of the modding experience is free and will always stay free. Within that, we've decided to work with Studio Wildcard on opening a new creator category: the premium mod creator, DLC-level mod creator. This category can then be opened up to small game studios and really talented teams that could build DLC-level content.</p>
<p>It's a big win for the studio because they're getting a velocity of content on a whole other level; it's a big win for the creators because we can make money. It's a big win for the players who can discover in-game all sorts of new content. What's happening right now is that there are a few firsts in terms of tech. Getting modders to deploy on consoles, for instance, was nearly impossible because the consoles needed to approve the mod.</p>
<p>Together with Studio Wildcard, we built auto-cooking, which means ARK: Survival Ascended modders can submit the mods to us, and our tech takes care of the cooking. Now, deployment on all platforms is much easier because they have a mod that can be distributed or cooked at the same time for all these platforms, which wasn't possible before.</p>
<p>There's also cross-play, so if I download an ARK: Survival Ascended mod on PC and Jeremy plays it on Xbox, we can play the same mod at the same instance. These things are a first in the world of modding. We're going to see many more, I think, games adopt this and try to go for it. But this is all innovation within the UGC world.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz: </strong>A small asterisk there. I do think the Unreal Fortnite Editor has a similar capability for cross-platform through Epic's systems. But I think what we and Overwolf have built together is more flexible in many ways.</p>
<p>Fortnite does allow people to use these PC based tools to create content that then goes on to the three main platforms (PC, Xbox, and PlayStation), but what you can do with the mods is currently much more limited. Epic hobbles various capabilities of the engine deliberately for quality control reasons. For example, they disallow access to the lower-level blueprint logic of the engine, favoring only a higher-level text scripting language called the Verse, which is kind of like JavaScript. There are lots of limitations with Verse, both functionally and performance-wise, like writing a game in JavaScript, which is not exactly what you want to be doing if you want to write a deep, high-performance experience.</p>
<p>The second thing is currently they don't allow mods to be directly sold. They only have an engagement-based compensation system, which I think is maybe appropriate for super creators, but not very appropriate for non-super creators. And then thirdly, just from a technical standpoint, they don't allow mods to interoperate. Every mod experience in Fortnite is its own self-contained thing, whereas the way it's designed in ARK: Survival Ascended is that the end user can mix and match mods in many cases to create their own customized game experience.</p>
<p>Some mods are standalone, but many of them are designed to interoperate. That allows more of a user-centric experience of exactly how you want to kind of customize your gameplay and what you want to add or remove from it. These are maybe fine-grained distinctions, but I do think fundamentally, Overwolf's and Studio Wildcard's approach is more traditionally mod-centric.</p>
<p>It's like what modding has been to PCs for many years, translating that to other platforms and also making an automatic compensation mechanism for the creators themselves. I think Epic has made many strides, and it's probably the most similar with Fortnite, but it is different and, in many ways, not as featureful.</p>
<p>Roblox, of course, is another example. Uh, mentioned earlier. What fundamentally distinguishes what we have done with ARK: Survival Ascended from Roblox is that Roblox is just a set of tools in the game to allow you to build environments and simple scripting within the game.</p>
<p>Ultimately, that is cool for learning basic game development principles and for younger creators who are maybe just starting out and understanding what it means to create game content. But it's not really like game development end-to-end. The tools to make our content are located in a full-fledged, no-limits Unreal editor. That's full end-to-end game development. It's exactly the same tools and code that we use to make our own content, our own full-size expansion packs.</p>
<p>Modders can even literally create games that are entirely different from ours. We uploaded a steamboat Willy platformer as an example of something that has no gameplay relation to ARK: Survival Ascended. If they want, they can kind of wipe away all of our functionality and build something new, taking it all the way down to the foundational classes and building a new experience up from those foundational Unreal classes. With respect to Roblox, it's much less like actual game development and more like map-making within their existing game. People creating content for Roblox come up against the hard wall of like, I want to do this thing, but I can't because the tools aren't letting me.</p>
<p>That's just not really the case with what's provided here. We're excited to see and I think we've seen already that people have made more and more ambitious content over these weeks since the launch of premium mods earlier this year. It's getting a little bit more advanced, a little bit more ambitious, and that's going to continue to occur, I think, over the coming weeks and months.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'I think content creation for games can be a job as this economy continues to grow. But if you did want to go work at a traditional development studio, if you know how to make Unreal Engine content, that is a fundamentally marketable and transferable skill' - Jeremy Stieglitz</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>The flip side is that you will need to be proficient in Unreal Engine development to make mods for ARK: Survival Ascended, which is not something every modder is familiar with.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz: </strong>Yes, admittedly, it's not great if you've never dabbled in game development before. You'd have to learn a lot. Your first step is learning Unreal, then. It is a more advanced thing. I mean, a lot of hobbyists are capable of that or interested in that. One nice principle, though, is if you do learn how to make Unreal content with the ARK development kit, you now know how to make Unreal content, which is a skill transferable to innumerable games or even a full-fledged industry job. However, I think content creation for games can be a job as this economy continues to grow. But if you did want to go work at a traditional development studio, if you know how to make Unreal Engine content, that is a fundamentally marketable and transferable skill.</p>
<p>If you know how to make Roblox content, congratulations, but that's only useful inside Roblox. I think this is a very important distinction for people who actually want to learn more about making game content with Unreal, as they can do that inside of ARK.</p>
<p><strong>I guess Microsoft and Sony still want their usual 30% cut, as they do with all regular DLCs, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Shahar Sorek: </strong>This is still all in the works. It's a new model, and this is the first time premium mods are sold inside. And yes, everybody gets their cut here. I still can't go into the numbers. It's all happening as we speak. I could just say that numbers-wise, it's done much better than we thought initially it should do. If it continues like this, we're talking about a new section in the industry as a whole because we'll see many studios adapt.</p>
<p>I can say that on ARK: Survival Ascended alone, we had close to 160 million mod downloads since we opened it up, of which I think around 65 percent have been on Xbox. In terms of how this splits, well, the platform gets something, the creator gets something, and then Studio Wildcard and Overwolf get something. You could think of it as a broad split right now until we're ready to reveal more of the numbers. But I want to tie it in a little bit to what you guys spoke about before, which is that this is opening up a new creator category. So now you can see serious small studios that, instead of pursuing a triple-A game that might take three to four years to make, can now create a DLC-level experience for a premium price in a much shorter time, meaning there's new revenue and new ways for them to exist. We're going to see many more small studios say, I'm going to upload a mod to ARK, and then maybe six months to a year later, I'll upload a mod to Fortnite or another of the games we're opening up later this year. It becomes a whole new way to survive and kind of redefine what a creator is in the world of games, which is shrinking as it did in this last year, so we're going to see new sources of revenue and opportunities for developers to find a way to make a living.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz: </strong>On the subject of consoles specifically, I think it's important to remember that this is so new on consoles. I think Roblox took a step in that direction. Fortnite took a much bigger step, given how their tools work and the power of Unreal. But then this is kind of a third step of direct selling these kinds of premium Unreal contents onto consoles.</p>
<p>Previously those platforms, Xbox and PlayStation, were so locked down. User generated content was almost unheard of on those devices up until a couple of years ago in a serious way. I would say this is one of the last taboos to really fall with respect to the kind of experience or content people can get or play on traditional video game consoles.</p>
<p>What I think is really interesting about it is for hobbyists. People who may not have any console development experience or have not fully committed themselves yet to a career in the game industry. This is a great way to get experienced in console game development because effectively, what you're able to do is use a regular retail console unit like an Xbox or PlayStation that you buy off the store shelves and Develop your Unreal content on pc as normal using the toolset that we've provided. Then you're able to put that content onto your console and test it out, play it with your friends, and then even release it and sell it on the console without ever having to get development hardware, which costs many thousands of dollars, or become a specialized capitalized business registered with Microsoft and Sony. Going through all those steps requires six figures of capitalization, essentially.</p>
<p><strong>Shahar Sorek: </strong>I wanted to add to what Jeremy was saying now and talk about compliance. There's a reason these platforms haven't opened up until now. This is another pillar; it's not a sexy pillar, but it's something we take care of. There's a lot of issues in compliance that would shut down UGC and have shut down UGC in the past. Moderation and curation for safety, what goes up, what can be exposed, because once you upload this mod, it gets distributed to all the players immediately.</p>
<p>Some things have to do with how that piece of content is handled from a compliance standpoint, which is moderation, legal, and safety. But also, with modding there's another layer of creation protection. There are situations where a modder will upload a mod, and that mod can be used to create other mods. So all these issues have been solved for the platforms by us. This is a whole other layer of procedural compliance innovation that had to come hand in hand with the stuff Jeremy spoke about regarding the technology and what it allows creators to do.</p>
<p><strong>That's definitely something I wanted to talk about. Curation is always an issue with user-generated content and certainly even more so on consoles. How do you handle that for ARK: Survival Ascended?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Shahar Sorek: </strong>Overwolf was built on deploying UGC about a decade ago. We have vast experience and a unique three-tier system of moderation and curation. First, we have an in-house team that manually checks every piece of content, and then we have AI and automation tools to check it. Then, we're in touch with the community, which also does this last test on it.</p>
<p>We've been able to tell and come to studios and take full legal responsibility for content being vetted and curated, which for Studio Wildcard and all the serious studios that have a massive UGC community and model community is a game changer because the studio needs to focus on making the best possible game experience for the gamers, and we take the responsibility of taking full ownership of allowing the creator economy and a creator community to engage with the game.</p>
<p>That's moderation, curation, safety, and market activities. That's monetization. All of that, zero to hero so that the studio can focus on the game. We enabled the legion of creators and everybody works with everybody. We standardize creation and monetization for everybody. Again, I want to stress that with everything we're doing, free mods are the core experience of the gamers.</p>
<p>There will always be free mods. We also vet the fidelity of content. You can't just upload something and put a price tag on it. It needs to be vetted and uphold certain standards before it goes live with a price tag.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz: </strong>There's one thing that I would say is unique in this respect: as a creator, you are able to essentially get the tools, create your content, upload it, and test it out yourself and among a few white-listed testers without any roadblocks put in your place, without any speed bumps or gates, and that's very useful because it does allow creators to have an iterative pipeline where they're able to immediately start testing and playing their content on all the devices and refining it before they present to the public for, uh, before they present it for release review. Otherwise, if there was a gate at every step, it would be too slow. This actually internally allows a creator to just go make stuff, and then when it's ready, they're even able to test it on the console devices themselves. Being able to do that is such an essential bullet point feature that is highly reliant on the backend technology that Overwolf put together to make it possible to test out. You can essentially deliver the content to your own console via the system that Overwolf has created. It's really cool.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'There aren't any hard lines on what to price what. Maybe there will be a mod that justifies $30, but it will be something that we'll all shake hands on it before we put it up' - Shahar Sorek</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>I've read in your press release that ARK: Survival Ascended currently supports $2 to $10 premium mods. Is there a hard limit, or could someone make a $30 mod?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Shahar Sorek: </strong>We're all testing this in real time and live. There are mods for $2, $5, there's $10, and there's maybe $15. I think we need to see how the market behaves and how it makes sense. There aren't any hard lines on what to price what. I would say that when we come to pricing these mods, we work closely with the studio on what makes sense. This is not something the modder can just put up and say, oh, I want this and that. This whole system needs to reek of transparency and trust and that's kind of what we're trying to do. So, to your question, maybe there will be a mod that will justify that level of price, but it will be something that we'll all shake hands on it before we put it up.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz: </strong>One last thing I want to mention is obviously one important thing to traditional modding on PC is that it's as open as possible. Notably, you can actually flag a mod when you create one in ARK: Survival Ascended as a PC-only mod, and if you flag the mod as PC-only non-premium, it just automatically goes up.</p>
<p>It can have after the fact review if it's offensive or breaks copyright infringing rules and so forth. But if you create a PC-only non-premium mod, then it behaves just like any open traditional modding platform, where you create something and it's immediately available to the extent you, as the creator, decide to publish it.</p>
<p>That is important so that people don't feel like modding in the traditional sense is now slowed down to a crawl. The speed bumps and gates are in place for the console releases, so if you flag it as cross-platform and you want to release it cross-platform, that's when it has to go through the internal review process at Overwolf. Thankfully, they're very fast and effective on that, but it is a necessary legal step for the platform to allow the release on consoles.</p>
<p><strong>I've also read that Premium Mods still aren't available on the PS5 of ARK: Survival Ascended. Any ETA you can share on that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz: </strong>Yeah, hopefully in the next week or so. They are actively working on buttoning up the last few things with that platform.</p>
<p><strong>Premium mods aren't exactly a novel concept. Bethesda, arguably one of the biggest developers when it comes to modding, has already tried that a few times and <a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesda-pete-hines-defends-creation-club-fallout-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">encountered a fair amount of resistance from the community</a>. How do you feel about that? Do you reckon most modders will continue to be against this opportunity?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz: </strong>I'll give my own developer thoughts on that, and then Shahar can provide his insight on it as well. I feel that that controversy, in particular, which has bubbled up every now and then, as you said, is usually around Bethesda. It's like every five years or so, there's a little thing involving it, but the last time I remember they attempted it was almost like five or six years ago, if not longer, on Steam Workshop, and I do think that player habits, consumer habits, and the whole industry have changed a lot in that time.</p>
<p><strong>They actually <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-special-edition-new-update-despised/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reintroduced that in Skyrim a few months ago</a> under Creations, which includes both free and paid mods.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz: </strong>Okay. Good to know. I had read they had actually reintroduced the kit. I wasn't sure if they had made the decision to enable premium capability on it. I think, ultimately, this speaks to the broader point that the taboo has shifted over that five or six-year time frame.&nbsp;People accept the fact more generally now that these mods and creators are getting so good, so in-depth, they are basically taking all of people's time to make them, and they can become a full-time job in terms of dedication to create something really great. It's ultimately a personal decision for the creator as to whether they want to put all that time in and then release it to the world for nothing except, you know, acclaim, which is great.</p>
<p>People love that. That's one of the reasons we make stuff: so that people can play it, say they liked it, give us feedback, and so forth. But if they really want to be able to support themselves and make it a full-time job where they don't have to do anything else for the rest of their days, that's just not possible unless they have some method of compensation. Epic has decided on an engagement-based compensation for now. there's also the idea of direct sales based compensation. I believe that players themselves, as they've experienced higher and higher quality content, know how much value it adds to their experiences, especially as the whole industry has shifted towards live service titles.</p>
<p>I believe very strongly that there's more acceptance on the part of the creator of players that this is a valid part of the video game ecosystem as long, and I think this is the critical point that Shahar was making earlier, as long as it doesn't displace that there's also free content. It's a personal decision really on the part of the creator whether the content should be free or premium. There'll be great free content. There'll be great premium content. If it was all premium, then yeah, what's the point in that scenario? You gotta have a good, healthy mix of both. I do think the premium mod taboo has essentially fallen. I also think it's fallen, especially for online service games.</p>
<p>I think if you have an offline single-player-only game that's oriented around a fixed set of content and doesn't evolve much over time, premium mods are a bit of a harder sell because, at that point, you kind of say, well, this is the game that I played start to finish and that's that. Why should I be compelled to play any further, especially at a price point? It's a little different when the game is constantly evolving in an online space and there's a constant need for more content and new experiences. That's my view on it, and the trends all have been pointing in that direction for a while, but now they're all fully oriented in that way.</p>
<p><strong>Shahar Sorek: </strong>There are a few core differences, I think. Also, in terms of the experience itself, discovering mods in ARK: Survival Ascended within the context of the game lobby is a very different experience than going to a website and downloading a mod.</p>
<p>That allows us to create a lot more transparency in what is a premium mod and what is a free mod. It allows the ARK user to distinguish way more healthily the value of a premium mod. And that, on top of everything Jeremy said about the shifts in the industry, creates a valid opportunity for all parties involved.</p>
<p>Also, we need to remember that many of these creators are influencers. They have a whole community of players ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand that follow and want to create them in this space. This allows them a very specific in-game native in-world environment to deal with those who follow and love what they're doing. So, it's an ecosystem. It's not just that you're getting paid. You're getting another tool for your relationship with those who consume your content.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'I think the taboo has shifted over that 5-6 years timeframe since Bethesda first tried. People accept the fact that these mods are getting so good, so in-depth, they are taking all of people's time to make them, and they can become a full-time job in terms of dedication to create something really great' - Jeremy Stieglitz</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What was the reaction of ARK: Survival Ascended modders to the premium mod news?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz: </strong>Generally, it was quite positive. There was some initial reaction where they were like, that's a bridge we're not sure if we want to cross. I think that overall, especially as they've seen it work and other modders have now released their content using the premium channel, they appreciate if they do want to make money with the hard work they're putting into the process of making this stuff, that that option is there.</p>
<p>That's the best way to view it: it's an option. It's not like you have to do this. If you really feel that this is how you want to try to make money and spend your time, make a possibly even a career out of this, that that's now an avenue you can take, or if you just want to kind of keep it as a casual hobby. Though I would argue, of course, that many free creators spend all their time on it anyway if they can support themselves and how, you know, it's possible. But the option to actually make a living off of doing it is something that creators, on the whole now, have appreciated. I think it's a very positive outcome.</p>
<p>I know that players appreciate it as well. I'll tell you on a personal note that before I became a professional game developer, I was a modder way back. I started with Duke Nukem 3D, Quake, and Jedi Knight Dark Forces 2. Those were my three big ones.</p>
<p>It was around that time after Jedi Knight Dark Forces 2, which had a very advanced scripting language, that I decided maybe I could learn a little bit deeper how to make a game from scratch and try and make something commercial with the skills I had built up. But I will tell you, if I had been able to make any money to support myself creating mods, I would have been thrilled.</p>
<p>It was always interesting to spend countless hours. Thankfully, I was in high school at the time, so I didn't have to support myself with a job, but I did have a job doing web programming in addition to making mods. It would have been nice not to have to have an additional job on top of creating and just being able to spend all my time doing that and using that as an onboarding mechanism to more advanced game development.</p>
<p>I think it created a challenge of how you transition from creating mods to actually supporting yourself, kind of getting a professional job in the game industry. Frankly, eliminating that distinction is to the benefit of creators. Eliminating the distinction between professional job holders versus mod creators and saying, look, if people are willing to pay for your content, then there is no distinction.</p>
<p>That creates a much smoother, less binary on-ramp. You're either creating stuff for free, and that's all you can ever do, and you can make no money, or you have a desk job somewhere in a traditional studio. Creating such a spectrum of options between those two extremes is a wonderful thing.</p>
<p><strong>Some ARK: Survival Ascended fans may be wary of this initiative and fear it could take much time off your schedule to make official content. How would you respond to that concern?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz: </strong>The good news is that we have a very large team that cannot all be oriented around mods. The content team, at the end of the day, is there to make internal content for ARK. The team associated with the support of mods is primarily technical. All these artists, all these level designers, and&nbsp;animators are here to make internal official content, so to speak. That's what we're doing. We have a big map release coming out in a couple of weeks. That includes new creatures and some new gameplay. We have a few surprises related to that down the official channel.</p>
<p>We still have to make official content in a very regular clip, but these premium mods keep the game fresh at an interval that would otherwise be impossible to meet or degrade the quality of our official content, meaning people can log into ARK: Survival Ascended every single day and find something new on the mod system and in the mod tab, they go in the mod browser in the game and they check the new releases every single day.</p>
<p>There's always some new cool stuff that serves as a daily refresher for players who want to vary their experience. We would never be able to achieve that internally, as our releases are tempo releases, with more monthly or multi-monthly instead of daily content.</p>
<p>It kind of creates almost two different categories or tiers where people can find new content in ARK: Survival Ascended, but I don't think either would work well without the other. There's got to be those major tentpole official releases, and there's also got to be these much more rapid creator releases. Both, I think, fulfill different expectations and needs on the part of players.</p>
<p><strong>Shahar Sorek: </strong>I'll add that 66 games take 80 percent of gamers' time playing them. Gamers demand a constant output of content. It really helps a studio that there's a constant stream of content going into the game, keeping the gamers in the game, not letting them drift towards other games and allowing for this very thriving ecosystem of content that keeps them engaged constantly. We're in a very competitive landscape, with over 14,000 games released each year. You want to retain each gamer inside your game. This is probably the best way to do it.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'I believe for these kinds of live online service games, modding is essential. I wouldn't make a game without this capability going forward if I had any choice in the matter because I think that otherwise, you're setting yourself up for an impossible task of creating content at a pace that almost no developer can truly achieve' - Jeremy Stieglitz</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Studio Wildcard is also working on ARK II, which, as far as we know, is still <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-2-delayed-until-late-2024-ue5-remaster-of-ark-coming-this-august-with-rtx-direct-illumination-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned to launch late this year.</a> Are you also going to allow these features, including premium mods, for the sequel?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz: </strong>As a developer, I believe for these kinds of live online service games, modding is essential. I wouldn't make a game without this capability going forward if I had any choice in the matter because I think that otherwise, you're setting yourself up for an impossible task of creating content at a pace that almost no developer can truly achieve and you're stifling the creativity of your players. Not to mention, if you don't give them this capability, they will mod your game anyway. They're just going to have to do it with hacks and kind of reverse engineering, which is how a number of games get modded. But then you're not going to have any way to actually capture that enthusiasm within the game and present it to the average player.</p>
<p>It'll all just be like, go here, download the zip file, extract it, pray to God it works, hope there's no viruses inside, etc. That's not good for anybody. Either way, your game's going to get modded; you might as well make it accessible to the casual user to experience those mods and be able to kind of capture that enthusiasm more within the game ecosystem and just have it exist externally.</p>
<p>If you're not doing it for a live online game, then you are ignoring a huge potential magnet for players to continue playing and to stay in your game, as Shahar indicated. So, anything future that I do, we really need to have this as far as I'm concerned if it is an online game.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, I wanted to step a bit away from the topic of premium mods and discuss the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-the-animated-series-to-feature-voice-cast-full-of-hollywood-stars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ARK animated series</a> that launched a couple of months ago. Was the reaction to it as good as you had hoped?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz: </strong>I'm happy to talk about it. I love the animated series. I worked very hard on it. We came out with that in March, and it was critically very well received. IGN gave it eight out of 10. They said it's the Jurassic World reboot; we need their quote. It was a lot of fun to do.</p>
<p>It expanded the world and lore of ARK and gave players a new way to get into it and feel immersed in that kind of story and setting. We do have plans to release part two of it soon, hopefully very soon. That is being wrapped up, part two, which kind of completes the current narrative that we had set out. It is in post-production, and then we'll see. As far as the critical and fan response, it was great, and it was nice to finally get the first look at it. Hopefully, we'll get to tell more stories like that in the ARK universe going forward, but I do think people will really like what they see with Part Two; it kind of pays everything off and really takes it to where it needs to go in terms of action and drama. So thank you for asking about that.</p>
<p><strong>I've always wondered how you managed to get so much Hollywood talent on board. There's Vin Diesel, David Tennant, Michelle Yeoh, Karl Urban, Jeffrey Wright, Russell Crowe, Elliot Page, Malcolm McDowell, Ragga Ragnars, Gerard Butler, Madeleine Madden, Alan Tudyk...</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz: </strong>I'll keep this one very short and simple. Everybody was stuck at home during the pandemic and they had nothing else to do. They were very bored, and they liked the scripts. We got the scripts to them and I think they were going a bit stir crazy at the time. Lucky us!</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

                <p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth has maintained its $70 retail price since launching in February--until now. You can finally <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-VII-Rebirth-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CGXZQ4CD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">save on the PS5 exclusive at Amazon</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Ffinal-fantasy-vii-rebirth---playstation-5%2F404626.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffinal-fantasy-7-rebirth-gets-first-big-discount%2F1100-6523738%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameStop</a>, with both retailers dropping the price to $55 for a limited time. As this is the first discount since release, we wouldn't be surprised to see stock sell out--especially at Amazon, considering the online retailer is still giving away Final Fantasy-themed DualSense controller skins with the game.</p><hr><p>Depending on your location, you can get free same- or one-day delivery at Amazon with a <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fprime%2Fpipeline%2Fsignup%3Ftag%3Dgamespot-promos-20%26tag%3Dgamespot-buybutton-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffinal-fantasy-7-rebirth-gets-first-big-discount%2F1100-6523738%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Prime membership</a>. It's worth noting that while free shipping is available for everyone at Amazon, ordering from GameStop will require you to spend $79 or more to get free shipping. That said, you could order online and pick it up at your local GameStop store. GameStop is selling preowned copies of Rebirth for $50, in case you want to save a little bit more and don't mind used games.</p><p>Rebirth, the sequel to Final Fantasy 7 Remake, earned in 8/10 in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-destinys-child/1900-6418187/" data-ref-id="1900-6418187">our review</a>. "Thankfully, what Final Fantasy Rebirth succeeds at eclipses what it fumbles," critic Tamoor Hussain wrote. "It's a superbly designed gameplay experience that instills a sense of freedom while also making exploration rewarding in a meaningful way. Refined gameplay that makes character synergy a focal point breathes new life into the slick and satisfying combat, and all the while it reinforces the underlying themes of the story. As a game that has the unenviable task of living up to one of the strongest legacies in the medium, it is a worthy second chapter."</p><p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth isn't the only Square Enix game on sale for its best price yet. Fans of Square Enix's best-known series can also grab <strong>Final Fantasy 16, the latest mainline entry, for only $35</strong> at <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFinal-Fantasy-XVI-PlayStation-5%2Fdp%2FB0BPMTJJ6D%3Ftag%3Dgamespot-promos-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffinal-fantasy-7-rebirth-gets-first-big-discount%2F1100-6523738%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Ffinal-fantasy-xvi---playstation-5%2F395062.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffinal-fantasy-7-rebirth-gets-first-big-discount%2F1100-6523738%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameStop</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, <strong>Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince</strong>, a Nintendo Switch exclusive that has been largely unavailable at major retailers since its release last December, is back in stock and discounted to <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C8VZXQYW%3Ftag%3Dgamespot-promos-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffinal-fantasy-7-rebirth-gets-first-big-discount%2F1100-6523738%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$40 at Amazon</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fdragon-quest-monsters-the-dark-prince---nintendo-switch%2F402991.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffinal-fantasy-7-rebirth-gets-first-big-discount%2F1100-6523738%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameStop</a>.
