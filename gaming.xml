            <p>An unannounced "PvE Action RPG" set in one of Games Workshop's fantasy properties was apparently in development until being cancelled late last year, according to a new report from <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/unannounced-warhammer-rpg-cancelled-games-workshop">mp1st</a>.</p>
<p>News of the project was pieced together by mp1st from several LinkedIn profiles belonging to former employees of studio Thought Pennies. Different sources alternately describe the project as a “multiplatform, social role-playing game" and a "fantasy live-service RPG", although it's possible these refer to different projects from the same time period.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The report speculates that the cancellation was due to Games Workshop themselves deciding to "withdraw funding", although to my knowledge GW don't fund games so much as rent out their license for residuals. The project's publisher isn't named in any of the materials shared, though CCO Daniel Erickson does mention another company's change of "strategic direction" in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/daniel-aidan-erickson_over-the-last-three-years-at-thought-pennies-activity-7264324075357941760-nQCJ/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">LinkedIn post</a> made last November in the wake of layoffs at the studio:</p>
<p>"Over the last three years at Thought Pennies we built something amazing. We never missed a milestone, our feedback was great, our partnerships strong. We went from two people and a PowerPoint to a team of almost sixty heavily-vetted, incredibly independent, passionate professionals," wrote Erickon. "Our publisher changed strategic direction, however, and our previous project is now without funding. Last week we had to shrink the size of the studio."</p><p>The "three years" Erickson mentions does line up with the resume dates from the report, two of which list 2022 start dates on the project. Here are the relevant bits from the report, which I've verified with my own RPS nose and eyes and fingers.</p>

<p>Exactly which of Games Workshop's universes the Warhammer game took place in is unclear. The 'fantasy' setting mentioned in one of the posts could suggest either Age Of Sigmar, or Warhammer Fantasy in either its classic or newer incarnation, The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/old-world">Old World</a>. In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-company-looking-for-the-next-one-after-big-success-of-space-marine-2">a recent money-me-doo</a>, Games Workshop CEO Kevin Rountree made it clear the company is "looking for the next one", "one" here referring to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a>. I love business, man. You can just get up in front of a bunch of people and tell them that your strategy is to find another thing that makes you a lot of money. There was a bit more, to be fair. "We recognize that successes like these for Warhammer are not a given in the world of video games," spoke big daddy plastic. "We remain cautious when forecasting royalty income".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the final season, the show introduced a confusing parallel timeline where the stranded characters live normal lives, only to find out it wasn’t a parallel timeline but some sort of purgatory-like afterlife where they can all reunite. We never find out why all that weird stuff happens on the island, what the deal was with all of those numbers, or where Jacob (Mark Pellegrino) got the powers to grant immortality and leave whenever he wanted. </p><p>Erickson promises <em>Severance</em> won’t turn into <em>Lost</em>, but dances around fully committing to answering all of the show’s mysteries. “I promise the show will not literally turn into <em>Lost</em>. We won’t put them on an island and have Sawyer show up. No—we’re very conscious of that fact that we need to know where we’re going, and we need to reward people’s patience and faith.”</p><p>That <em>Severance </em>fan theories multiplying quicker than Apple can pump out episodes almost guarantees there will be questions unanswered, mainly because they were questions Erickson never posed. The series can have a satisfying ending without explaining how many departments there are in the Lumon building that houses the main cast, or why there is a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/miss-huang-severance-season-2-apple-tv-1851738787&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/miss-huang-severance-season-2-apple-tv-1851738787">child working on the Severed Floor</a></span><em>. </em>Those mysteries are ancillary and not central to the drama of the show. But, there remain quite a few mysteries they’ll need to clear up by the end of the series if they want to avoid <em>Lost</em> levels of ignominy. </p><p>We need to know what these severed workers are actually working on, and what Lumon’s ultimate plan is. The whereabouts of Ms. Casey (Dichen Lachman) seem to be a focal point of the current season, but we also need to know if and how Lumon faked her death given the facts Mark S (Adam Scott) says he identified her body. Under no circumstance can this series end without explaining what the fuck is the deal with the goats. </p><div><p>Those are just a few of the core mysteries that need to be resolved but the time the show wraps up. Lucky for us <em>Severance </em>fans, Erickson says Season 3 shouldn’t have the nearly three-year wait Season 2 had. Let’s just hope this whole series isn’t all just happening in Kier’s comatose mind in some Lumon nursing home. </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I’m ready for a grind. I want to lose many hours this week, to forget about the winter storm and all of life’s other challenges rearing their ugly heads daily, and that grind comes from Diablo 4 for the foreseeable future.

            <p>Concept art for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> film has been released, revealing cut content and a look at secret characters from the post-credits scene.</p>
<p>The images are from Chinese designers at Tian He Yan Studio, shared earlier today on <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/status/5124957166633153">Weibo</a> (some <strong>film spoilers ahead</strong>!).</p>

<p>"This time we are mainly responsible for the drawing of some keyframes and some character modeling," reads the post from Tian He Yan Studio. "The keyframe concept map helps to establish the tone style of the film, and can also assist in guiding the work of visual effects."</p>
<p>Most of the images depict key events from the film. There's Shadow and Maria meeting, Eggman watching a telenovela, Super Sonic and Super Shadow battling in space, and that adorable Chao Garden restaurant scene.</p>
<p>But there's more. Knuckles and Tails are seen riding a motorbike through the streets of London chased by a giant ball of debris, like something out of the Katamari games, in what I presume was a cut action sequence. Another image shows the three Sonic heroes in flight as they escape some sort of sand explosion, with Knuckles covered in scorpions.</p>

<p>Two images are most interesting of all, though, showing both Amy Rose and Metal Sonic. Both of these characters are teased in the film's post-credit scene - it's unclear from this artwork if they were originally intended for this film instead, or if this artwork was created solely for their reveals.</p><p>Either way, this could be an indication of what to expect in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-film-sequel-on-the-way">confirmed film sequel Sonic 4</a>. Amy, for instance, is seen standing over Sonic just as she does in her reveal, though there's a large destroyed robot that's not the Metal Sonic we see in Sonic 3. What's going on in the background?</p>

This was certainly not part of Sonic 3, with fans suggesting it could be some sort of bad future.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/code-violet-pc-vulgar-mods<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>TeamKill Media, the developer of upcoming dino horror game <i>Code Violet</i>, has revealed that the game won't be coming to PC, and it's all to do with what the studio thinks modders will do with its characters.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/TeamKillMedia/status/1880780993813987541" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the studio confirms that its game, which looks rather like a mixture of Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>and EA's&nbsp;<em>Dead Space</em>, will remain a console exclusive because it doesn't want modders creating "vulgar versions of the main character" or any other characters.</p>

<p>TeamKill goes on to say it holds its "voice actresses and actors with high regard", as well as its "artistic vision for the game and story", and that modders creating "sexual mods" would make "a joke out of [the studio's] art" and possibly tarnish&nbsp;<em>Code Violet</em>'s actors' "reputation".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/code-violet-not-coming-to-pc-dino-chase.jpg?itok=kx07jV1m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/code-violet-not-coming-to-pc-dino-chase.jpg?itok=CdJo8erV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Code Violet&nbsp;</em>isn't coming to PC anytime soon.</figcaption></figure><p>When asked whether the game will be coming to Xbox or not, TeamKill <a href="https://x.com/TeamKillMedia/status/1880816290572718525" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a> it will "be exclusive to PS5", and in response to a suggestion that&nbsp;<em>Code Violet&nbsp;</em>is Sony-funded, the developer <a href="https://x.com/TeamKillMedia/status/1881075725786394847" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">clarifies</a>&nbsp;it is "100% independent" and has "no investment or support from anyone but ourselves".</p>

<p>The game apparently won't be coming to Xbox because TeamKill doesn't "have the time or expertise" to devote to creating an Xbox port, and that doing so would "need additional manpower".</p>

<p>Given <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-xbox-port-series-s" rel="nofollow">how difficult an Xbox port would apparently have been</a> for&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, another PlayStation 5 exclusive, perhaps TeamKill is right not to commit to leaving the PS5 exclusivity den anytime soon.</p>

<p>You can take a look at the (rather enigmatic) debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Code Violet</em>&nbsp;right here.</p>




<p>Given that Capcom doesn't seem immediately interested in reviving&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>(and that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shinji-mikami-dino-crisis-monster-hunter-comments" rel="nofollow">original creator Shinji Mikami certainly isn't</a>),&nbsp;<em>Code Violet&nbsp;</em>might be the best you'll get on that front, so it's a bit of a shame it won't be coming to PC.</p>

<p>At any rate, the game is set to launch for <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012908" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a> sometime in July this year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

What happens when supernatural and unstoppable forces take over the place that is meant to be your sanctuary? How can you escape when this is where you are meant to stay? These spectres–often ghosts or something demonic—are mostly unseen, appearing only when they need to drive others out, typically seeking revenge. </p><p>Horror movies tap into the unsettling idea that something evil can lurk within our walls.They turn everyday objects and environments, like creaking floorboards or long hallways, into sources of fear. Any tragic events that occur within these confines can have ripple effects on all future residents. Let’s step inside some of the best haunted houses ever to be put on screen.</p></div></div><div><p>The visionary Guillermo del Toro helms this sumptuous Gothic melodrama with haunted house themes. The newly wed Edith Cushing moves into her husband Sir Thomas Sharpe’s mammoth yet crumbling estate, Allerdale Hall, along with his sister, Lucille. Edith warily navigates the mansion, drenched in midnight blues, where the only light comes from flickering candelabras. As she moves through the hallways, she searches for the source of the unsettling whispers and creaking floors. The ghosts are unlike any you’ve seen before—spindly creatures with red skin stretched taut over their bones, bent limbs, and dark, hollow eyes. The slow-moving, moaning creatures hold the key to the nefarious Sharpe family history. </p></div><div><p>At first, <em>Insidious </em>feels familiar, another story about a married couple (Rose Byrne and scream king Patrick Wilson) and their young children moving into a new home, only to experience unusual, supernatural occurrences—randomly blaring alarms, bloody handprints on the children’s bed, and eerie noises. James Wan meticulously crafts his horror scenes with subtlety. In one memorable scene, the camera follows Renai as she goes about the house doing mundane chores, like taking out the garbage, while the unsettling children’s song “Tiptoe Through the Tulips” warbles on a record player. </p><p>Through the window from a distance, she catches a barely noticeable shadow of a little boy in period clothing, dancing to the song. It’s little moments like these that make <em>Insidious </em>so frightening. There’s plenty of jump scares, as well, like the sudden appearance of a red-faced demon that will leave your heart in your throat. The most inventive and chilling part of <em>Insidious </em>is The Further, a dark, foggy dimension where lost souls and demonic entities wait for the living. </p></div><div><p>While director Takashi Shimizu’s Japanese original is arguably superior, he also directs the American version of <em>The Grudge</em>, and both are well worth watching. The English version follows Sarah Michelle Gellar as an American nurse who encounters a haunted house in Tokyo. The way Japanese horror depicts ghosts gives you goosebumps—long-haired, pale figures with wide, black eyes that stare at you with a laser focus, appearing out of nowhere. </p><p>One of the scariest scenes is when a ghost crawls down the stairs, its limbs contorted into jagged angles and making a god-awful croaking noise. Another appears directly on top of someone beneath the covers. <em>The Grudge</em> transforms the emotional pain of a person’s life on Earth into a curse that claims all those who enter the space where these traumas occurred—creating an endless cycle of torment.</p></div><div><p>There’s some 1970s-era cheese in <em>The Amityville Horror</em>, but it’s still one of the OG haunted house movies and a must-see. Based on a true story, the Lutz family moves into a New York home where Ronald DeFeo Jr. slaughtered his entire family. The famous arched windows truly look like eyes, as if the house is sizing up its next victims. </p><p>Satanic occurrences plague the new residents, such as being swarmed by flies, waking up at the same early hour that the DeFeos were murdered, and seeing the piercing eyes of a pig outside the second-story window. <em>The Amityville Horror</em> makes the menacing assertion that the dark events tied to the land where our homes are built, as well as the history within a house’s walls, can manifest in evil ways.</p></div><div><p>Despite being championed by Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese as one of the scariest movies of all time, <em>The Haunting</em> doesn’t rely on jump scares or terrifying monster reveals, unlike the hokey 1999 remake. Instead, Robert Wise’s film takes its time and revels in ambiguity, never allowing the viewer to truly know what’s behind the swaying chandeliers, the loud banging, or the sounds of a girl crying. We learn that the stately mansion does have a tragic backstory when a group is brought there for a paranormal study, including a psychic (Claire Bloom) and a lonely woman who claims to have personal experience with the supernatural (Julie Harris). </p><p>What<em> The Haunting </em>lacks in traditional frights makes up for in atmosphere: ominous low angles, a sharp monochromatic palette, and the ornate Gothic surroundings of the sprawling manor. The camera itself has a ghostly presence, observing the characters from afar with a curious tension, using widescreen to capture the lopsided rooms, always leaving us uncertain whether something strange will appear.</p></div><div><p><em>Paranormal Activity </em>became a cinematic sensation thanks to its viral marketing that included trailers with night vision clips of terrified audience members and a campaign urging people to demand the film be shown in their theaters. Similar to <em>The Blair Witch Project</em>, the identities of the actors were kept hidden, making it feel as though this footage was truly found. <em>Paranormal Activity </em>is one of the best haunted house movies because of its simplicity; most of the film is observing the couple Katie and Micah (Katie Featherson and Micah Sloat) sleeping in their new home, unaware that an invisible demonic presence is also watching them and waiting to strike. </p><p>It makes you wonder what happens in your own home while you’re fast asleep. We are filled with dread every time the video camera time clock reaches 3AM, when the vengeful supernatural forces pull comforters, slam doors, or drag someone into a pitch-black hallway. The lo-fi aesthetic and practical special effects make the scares feel more personal and tangible, culminating in a cruel and devastating ending. </p></div><div><p>Nicole Kidman delivers yet another arresting performance as Grace, a buttoned-up, devout mother who will do anything to protect her pale, delicate children with a rare condition that makes exposure to the sunlight painful. This means that the inside of the stately Gothic estate on the English countryside is cloaked in shadow and lit by candlelight throughout the film, which only heightens the tension of the ghostly happenings such as a piano playing by itself or doorknobs randomly jiggling. </p><p>One of the most terrifying scenes is when Grace finds an elderly woman wearing her daughter’s communion dress and playing with puppets but speaking in her little voice. There’s an antiquated eeriness to <em>The Others</em> in the depictions of seances and nineteenth-century photographs of corpses, all building to a surprising twist ending that completely turns the haunted house genre on its head.</p></div><div><p>Tobe Hooper, who directed the grimy <em>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em>, and producer Steven Spielberg, the king of suspenseful blockbusters, join forces for Poltergeist, which follows the Freeling family living in a suburban California home. The film is filled with bold and unforgettable visuals: a knotted tree that comes to life and bursts into a child’s bedroom, a creepy clown doll, a face melting into bone, a little girl sucked into a television set, and a pool filled with skeletons. </p><p>The family enlists a team of paranormal experts, including a psychic, to try to rescue Carol Anne (Heather O’Rourke) and exorcise the sinister and restless spirits that haunt their home. They eventually discover a macabre truth about the land their home was built on. While <em>Poltergeist </em>is certainly scary, it also has a playful side, offering a thrill ride that gleefully drags its characters through a chaotic, rollercoaster-like experience.</p></div><div><p><em>The Orphanage</em> blends a traditional haunted house ghost story with a missing persons thriller, set in a decaying estate that was once an orphanage. After living there as a child, Laura Rodríguez (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=1deeb23685599852&amp;rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1096US1097&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWIL9cBdHiD0DdNNVZq1Pt-tN934XMA:1737143797822&amp;q=Bel%C3%A9n+Rueda&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLSz9U3MCorMk6vUuIEsS2yq5KytISyk6300zJzcsGEVXJicckiVh6n1JzDK_MUgkpTUxIB3Jb3aTwAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi5tfj3xP2KAxW2E1kFHRENFrkQ9OUBegQIEhAE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=1deeb23685599852&amp;rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1096US1097&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWIL9cBdHiD0DdNNVZq1Pt-tN934XMA:1737143797822&amp;q=Bel%C3%A9n+Rueda&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLSz9U3MCorMk6vUuIEsS2yq5KytISyk6300zJzcsGEVXJicckiVh6n1JzDK_MUgkpTUxIB3Jb3aTwAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi5tfj3xP2KAxW2E1kFHRENFrkQ9OUBegQIEhAE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belén Rueda</a></span>) returns to the orphanage with her husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) and their seven-year-old son Simón (Roger Princep), planning to transform it into a haven for children with disabilities. </p><p>Soon, Simón claims to have befriended a boy named Tomás, who wears a disturbing sack with a painted-on smile. Laura also sees him appear throughout the grounds. Shot in muted colors, <em>The Orphanage</em> carries a deep sense of melancholy. After Simón mysteriously goes missing, the film moves toward a tragic and shocking ending that reveals the creepy children cliché is more than it seems. </p></div><div><p>James Wan is a master of horror because he knows exactly how to carefully and slowly form heart-jumping, inventive scares with haunting images. They often strike you when you least expect it, like the sudden appearance of a foot dangling from a ghastly pale body hanging from a tree, or a craggy, snarling witch perched on top of a dresser. <em>The Conjuring</em> is one of his best films, based on the true story of the Perron family, who move into a house where strange occurrences begin—waking up at 3:07AM every morning, bruises appearing on the mother Carolyn’s (Lili Taylor) body, and an unseen figure lurking in a pitch-black bedroom corner. </p><p>The way Wan reveals the ghosts—slow and steady, yet quick and lacerating—is truly terrifying. <em>The Conjuring</em> also turns the real-life demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren, who also worked on the Amityville Horror case, into compelling protagonists with a romantic love story. It also gives them a connection to the film’s surprisingly moving themes of motherhood. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<h2 id="h-the-games-everyone-plays">The Games Everyone Plays</h2>



<p>Sometimes, you don’t know what to play. It happens to all of us. Once we finally have some free time, we sit at our computers, staring at our Steam libraries, with no clue how to proceed. But if you want a multiplayer game with a massive community to immerse yourself in, these games continuously retain players monthly!</p>



<p>It’s important to note that these player numbers change frequently. You’ll find that looking at the charts one minute provides a very different result from within the next five minutes. That said, we can still focus on ballpark numbers to give us an idea of what everyone around the world is playing regularly, as the top most played games on Steam rarely change:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Counter-Strike 2</strong> – 1.4 Million</li>



<li><strong>PUBG: Battlegrounds</strong> – 707,500</li>



<li><strong>Dota 2</strong> – 702,000</li>



<li><strong>Marvel Rivals</strong> – 466,000</li>

<p>A reliable leaker has claimed that Xbox is working on a Red Cipher Wireless Controller.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/une-nouvelle-manette-xbox-en-edition-speciale-bientot-disponible-59870" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a>, Xbox’s next wireless controller is the Red Cipher, the latest instalment to the Cipher series. Previously, the manufacturers released the Sky Cipher and Ghost Cipher controllers. The Red Cipher announcement is expected to be announced in January 2025 and will be available only through the Microsoft store.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-red-cipher-controller-price-nbsp">Xbox Red Cipher Controller Price&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The exact release date for the Xbox Red Cipher controller is currently unknown. However, the pricing details have been revealed. The upcoming controller is expected to cost the same as the other controllers in the series, €69.99 / $69.99 / GBP 64.99.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from the pricing, we also know the colour palette for the Xbox Red Cipher Controller. The controller will feature a translucent design, similar to the Sky and Ghost instalments. The buttons will be bright red, and the back will be garnet red.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from the red controller, the report also mentioned the Xbox <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-could-be-bringing-haptic-motors-to-xbox-controllers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sebile</a> controller, which was leaked through FTC documents some time ago. The controller is said to feature haptic feedback tech similar to Sony’s DualSense controllers, and <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/microsoft-patents-movable-haptic-controller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tech4Gamers</a> recently spotted a patent for it. However, no new information has been revealed about the Sebile controller.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-6-xbox-series-s-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ESRB rating suggests</a> that Resident Evil 6 is coming to Xbox Series X/S. Also, a report claims that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-purchase-hasnt-helped-xbox-game-pass-report-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision’s purchase hasn’t helped</a> Xbox Game Pass.

            <p>TeamKill Media is resisting calls to release its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dino-crisis">Dino Crisis</a>-like Code Violet on PC as it doesn't want anyone modding "vulgar versions" of its characters.</p>
<p>Addressing players on social media, the team said it held its voice actresses and actors "with high regard" and "making a joke out of our art and possibly tarnishing the reputation of our voice actresses and actors is not worth the extra money we can make".</p>

<p>Code Violet is expected to release in July 2025, exclusively on PS5.</p>
<p>TeamKill's statement is reminiscent of Koei Tecmo's position, which recently revealed it had taken "strict action" against thousands of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/koei-tecmos-protective-about-its-dead-or-alive-ip-because-the-characters-are-like-daughters">provocative Dead or Alive fanart images because the characters are "like daughters" to their creators</a>.</p>
<p>Koei Tecmo's legal affairs lead, Tomotoshi Nishimura, recently addressed a copyright conference in which he revealed that whilst the company was pragmatic and even supportive of "<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/otaku">otaku</a>" fan culture, it had no choice but to issue copyright strikes against amateur images that are created for, uh, "adult purposes".</p>
<p>Naoki Hamaguchi, the director of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-asks-pc-players-to-avoid-offensive-or-inappropriate-mods">also recently asked PC players not to install any "offensive or inappropriate" mods</a> once the game is released.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/malediction-preview-mtg-meets-warhammer.1086984/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/malediction-preview-mtg-meets-warhammer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After checking out the upcoming <i>Malediction</i> at <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/best-new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024" rel="nofollow">PAX Unplugged this winter</a>, creators of the game Loot Studios sent us home with some starter sets to check out ahead of the game’s launch on <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/loot-studios/malediction" rel="nofollow">GameFound</a>. Now that we’ve played a suite of matches, we’ve got first impression thoughts!</p>

<h2><i>Malediction - What Is It?</i></h2>

<p><i>Malediction</i> is a unique blend of a few different genres of tabletop gaming. It takes the skirmish tabletop warfare of a Games Workshop <i>Warhammer</i> game like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-warcry-guide" rel="nofollow"><i>Warcry</i></a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-brutal-and-cunning-review" rel="nofollow"><i>Kill Team</i></a> but adds a unique card draw element.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/malediction-combat-on-blood-pool.jpeg?itok=aYw14SyX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/malediction-combat-on-blood-pool.jpeg?itok=1owfaJ0o 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>When I met with the team at PAX Unplugged, their one sentence elevator pitch put it succinctly: it’s like Commander<i> </i>meets <i>Warhammer</i>. After having played a few test games of <i>Malediction</i>, I have to agree!</p>

<p>Want to try the game out for yourself? They’ve got <a href="https://malediction.gg/print-and-play/" rel="nofollow">a free print-and-play version of the game</a> ready to download now!</p>

<h2>Building A Deck And Army In <i>Malediction</i></h2>

<p>In <i>Malediction</i>, when you construct your force, you’re not just going to bring together a collection of miniatures. You’ll also be building a deck of cards centered around a leader. Choosing cards within that leader’s faction, you’ll build a deck that includes unit cards, gear, slower channel spells, and quick swift spells.</p>

<p>This is one of my favorite twists on the wargaming genre. To bring a miniature out onto the battlefield, you have to play the card from your hand and spend Echo (your mana-like resource in the game) to put it on the battlefield.</p>

<p>Spells you have in hand may let you spend Echo to heal a unit, perform an extra attack, move for free, and myriad other special abilities. In this way, you’re customizing both your forces and the ways you can upgrade or augment them.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/malediction-cards.jpeg?itok=ixzVLmPU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/malediction-cards.jpeg?itok=_kViWyu3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Gameplay Is Fast In <i>Malediction</i></h2>

<p>One of the things I liked most about my playthroughs of <i>Malediction</i> is just how quickly the game goes. We tried it with two players and as a free-for-all three person game (which the rules don’t account for so we homebrewed a little bit), and both where snappy - finishing up in less than an hour.</p>

<p>Part of this comes from what it takes to win the game. It’s a rush to a set amount of victory points - in our games we played to 25. You gain victory points equal to the cost of enemies you defeat, <i>and</i> you get points for securing powerful artifacts strewn about the board.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/malediction-combat-moment.jpeg?itok=pEjXAraD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/malediction-combat-moment.jpeg?itok=C_G-v2y1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Combat here clustered around a Husk (black-based miniature toward the back) where a powerful artifact waits to be claimed!</figcaption></figure><p>The other reason this game zips along is the way you field units. At the start of the game, you can field units from the corner of your battlefield. But after that, you can bring a unit in next to a unit of yours already on the board - no matter where they are - provided you’re not engaged with an enemy unit. This removes the slog of having to slowly advance your models across the battlefield.</p>

<h2>The Forces of <i>Malediction </i>All Feel <i>Very</i> Different</h2>

<p>We were sent home with copies of all four of the forces made for the premiere of the game - Primal Blood, Order of the Shattered Throne, Legion of the Fallen, and&nbsp; and each has its own distinct play style.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Primal Blood faction is all about aggression - they willing sacrifice both accuracy and health to gain bonuses to attack, and many of their units can make reckless charges and extra moves across the battlefield.</p>

<p>The Order of the Shattered Throne are angelic guardians, who guard each other well. Many of the figures in this faction can absorb damage intended for nearby enemies, and their spell cards involve a lot of healing and damage negation.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/malediction-soulwhisperer-by-guilherme-motta-large.jpeg?itok=16EQH8aV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/malediction-soulwhisperer-by-guilherme-motta-large.jpeg?itok=Kf2Iotr1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Soulwhisperer, a unit in the Legion of the Fallen, shows off the macabre aesthetic of the faction. Art by Guilherme Motta. Image: Loot Studios.</figcaption></figure><p>The Legion of the Fallen are comprised of the walking dead (or nearly dead) in many iterations, and focus on damage through swarming enemies with low cost minions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, there’s the Conclave of the Spheres faction, who dabble most heavily in magic and are willing to sacrifice their minions to achieve their goals.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/malediction-units-and-cards.jpeg?itok=nUKm8hV5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/malediction-units-and-cards.jpeg?itok=erqUXfd7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Units from the Order of the Shattered Throne (Gold bases) and Primal Blood (Red Base) with their unit cards.</figcaption></figure><p>It’s easiest, perhaps, to think of these four factions as colors on the <i>Magic: The Gathering </i>wheel. Primal Blood is like Red cards with their aggression, Order of the Shattered Throne, with its life gain and defense, is like White cards. Legion of the Fallen, full of undead and devastatingly deadly, is like Black MTG cards. And Conclave of the Spheres, with its mana-manipulation and spell-focused trickery, is very MTG Blue.</p>

<h2>STL Files in <i>Malediction</i></h2>

<p>In closing, one of the more interesting aspects to this skirmish wargame is the fact that the box itself contains no plastic miniatures. Instead, you’ll receive cardboard standees (as pictured throughout) to represent your models and the terrain. But when you crowdfund the game, you’ll receive the STL files to print their gorgeous 3D minis.</p>

<p>If you don’t have a 3D printer of your own, they have a list of recommended 3D print-on-demand vendors they’ll recommend.</p>

<p>All in all, this is one of the more unique approaches to tabletop wargaming I’ve played in a long time. You’ll need some table space - but no more than a normal wargame would expect from you - and there are elements here that are direct references to other games (you “exhaust” or tap your models’ cards once they’ve activated, you can cast spells ala <i>MTG</i> with sorcery or instants), but the culmination of how <i>Malediction </i>brings it all together is pretty incredible.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-version-12-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Infold Games has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>Version 1.2, which will bring new outfits, new activities and minigames, and much more later this week.</p>

<p>The official release date for Version 1.2 is January 23rd, which means that&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>will have to compete with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-announced" rel="nofollow">the upcoming Xbox Developer Direct</a> for your time. I'm sure you've already figured out which of the two you'll be checking out come Thursday, though.</p>

<p>Following on from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-version-1-1" rel="nofollow">excitement of Version 1.1</a>, Version 1.2 - also known as "Firework Season" - will introduce the Firework Isles. There, you'll find the "stunning" Songbreeze Highland, the "serene" Crescent Shoal, and the "lively" Camp Kaboom.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-nikki-version-1.2-firework-season.jpg?itok=Ea-HO4LH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-nikki-version-1.2-firework-season.jpg?itok=jFuFqwuF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Infinity Nikki</em>'s next update brings new areas, new activities, and, of course, beautiful fireworks.</figcaption></figure><p>New story content will take Nikki and Momo to the Firework Isles in order to prepare for an event called the Carnival of Fireworks. Of course, complications quickly arise, and before long, Nikki and Momo will be facing off against a new boss known as The Dark Bouquet.</p>

<p>The new update will also bring "an array of dazzling new outfits", just as you'd expect from an&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>update, as well as new activities and minigames.</p>

<p>You'll get the chance to enjoy the New Bloom Festival, which will bring a "festive celebration full of music, lanterns, and even firecrackers". What's more, you can participate in a range of events to win rewards including free pulls, Diamonds, and "two exclusive outfits".</p>

<p>If you've been clamoring to listen to&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki</em>'s music, then you'll be pleased to know the game's soundtrack will soon launch on "all major music platforms" and will include tracks like "Find My Way" and "Nikki Nikki", as well as many other pieces.</p>




<p><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Nikki&nbsp;</em>series. It's a cozy open-world adventure that emphasizes platforming, minigames, and collecting outfits over traditional combat (although it does have that too, albeit in its own rather quirky way).</p>

<p>Released in December, the free-to-play game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-downloads-10m" rel="nofollow">quickly notched up 10 million downloads</a>, and according to a press release, it's now passed the 20 million mark as well. Impressive stuff!</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>. Version 1.2 launches on January 23rd, and Firework Season runs until February 25th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-will-let-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-and-warzone-ranked-console-players-disable-crossplay-with-pc-as-cheating-complaints-ramp-up<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision has addressed Call of Duty community complaints about cheating in Black Ops 6 and Warzone, and confirmed plans to let console Ranked players disable crossplay with PC players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cheating has become the hottest topic among hardcore Call of Duty fans following the release of Ranked Play in Black Ops 6 and Warzone with the launch of Season 1 last year. The apparent prevalence of cheaters is considered by some to be ruining competitive multiplayer, and Activision had come under fire for failing to address the problem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, Activision’s Team Ricochet, the division responsible for its Call of Duty anti-cheat tech, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-admits-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-anti-cheat-did-not-hit-the-mark-at-the-launch-of-season-1">admitted not enough had been done to prevent cheating with the launch of Season 1</a>. “After a series of updates our systems are in a better place today across all modes; however, we did not hit the mark for the integration of Ricochet Anti-Cheat at the launch of Season 01 — particularly for Ranked Play,” Activision said at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-community-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new blog post</a>, Activision outlined its plan to tackle cheating in Call of Duty in 2025, revealing it had issued over 136,000 Ranked Play account bans since the mode launched. Season 2, which begins soon, includes new and improved client and server-side detections and systems as well as a major kernel-level driver update, Activision said. The company promised “a multitude of new tech” for Season 3 and beyond, including a brand-new system to authenticate legit players and target cheaters. It didn’t want to go into detail on that now, however, so as not to give cheat developers “a peek behind the curtain.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the shorter term, with the launch of Season 2, Activision will enable the ability to disable crossplay for console players who want to compete only against other console players in Black Ops 6 and Warzone Ranked Play. It is believed that the majority of cheating in video games is on the PC side, and indeed Call of Duty players on console have for years now disabled crossplay as a matter of course for standard Multiplayer. Now, Ranked players will get the chance, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We'll be monitoring closely and will consider further changes to prioritize the integrity of the ecosystem, and we’ll have more details to share as we get closer to the launch of this feature,” Activision said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most Activision anti-cheat updates are met with a healthy dose of scepticism from hardcore fans, and this latest one is no different. Cheating is not unique to Call of Duty of course, but it has become a significant reputation issue for Activision ever since the free-to-download battle royale Warzone exploded in popularity back in 2020. The mega publisher has spent millions of dollars developing its anti-cheat technology as well as pursuing cheat makers in the courts, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-cheat-maker-ordered-to-pay-activision-over-14-million-in-damages-and-hand-over-domain-name"><u>a number of recent high-profile successes</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In October, ahead of the launch of Black Ops 6, Activision said that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-says-it-wants-to-catch-and-remove-call-of-duty-cheaters-within-1-hour-of-them-being-in-their-first-match"><u>it aimed to kick cheaters out of the game within one hour of them being in their first match</u></a>. Black Ops 6 launched with an updated version of Ricochet's kernel-level driver (this also applied to Warzone), with new machine-learning behavioral systems focused on speed of detection and the analysis of gameplay to combat aim bots in place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The people behind cheats are organized, illegal groups that pick apart every piece of data within our games to look for some way to make cheating possible," Activision said at the time. "These bad guys are not just some script kiddies poking around with code they found online. They are a collective who profit from exploiting the hard work of game developers across the industry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But cheat developers are flawed (clearly — they have to pretend to be good at video games). Every time they cheat, they leave breadcrumbs behind. We’re always looking for those breadcrumbs to find the bad actors and get them out of the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-trailer-for-firework-season-in-infinity-nikki-drops-update-out-on-january-24/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>For those who love a gacha game or like the idea of collecting outfits and customizing your character to look how you want them to, then Infinity Nikki is certainly a great game for that. Infinity Nikki has been taking the world by storm since its release, and version 1.2 is set to release very soon. This is the second major update for Infinity Nikki, the hit title by Infold Games. To celebrate the upcoming launch of the update, <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Infold Games</a> has officially released a trailer to showcase the magic of Firework Season.</p>
<p>Version 1.2 will be available in Infinity Nikki on PlayStation 5, PC, iOS, and Android on January 24, where you can step into the New Bloom Festival and travel to a brand-new location called the Firework Isles, which is a collection of islands with panoramic views, serene areas to take pictures in, a natural cave and Camp Kaboom. If you want to see what you can get up to in Infinity Nikki's upcoming update, make sure to check out the brand-new trailer below for glimpses into the gameplay.</p>
<p><iframe title="Infinity Nikki Version 1.2 [Firework Season] Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1VZjad44Bpg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to these new locations, Nikki and Momo will be able to undertake a new storyline called Glowing Fireworks, which will take you to the Firework Isles to prepare for the Carnival of Fireworks. Of course, it doesn't all go to plan and there will be trouble along the way for Nikki and Momo to resolve together.</p>
<p>With this new update comes new outfits, with both free and paid options, as well as new mini-games to participate in and new activities to get stuck into. The main feature of this new Infinity Nikki update is the New Bloom Festival, which sees the Linlang Empire's traditions come to Florawish, where players will get to have fun with music, lanterns, and firecrackers for the festive season. This whole season will run from January 23 to February 25.</p>
<p>As a reward for participating in the season's events, players will be able to get their hands on rewards such as 20 free pulls, 3,500 diamonds, and two exclusive outfits. There will also be nine free outfits to get from the Heartfelt Gifts Store.</p>
<p>For a game that was released at the end of 2024, it has already done incredibly well, with the game being downloaded well over 20 million times and receiving critical acclaim across the globe. <a href="https://wccftech.com/infinity-nikkis-shooting-star-season-update-releases-december-30/">Continuous updates</a> are being released to make the game a smoother, more accessible experience.</p>
<p>Will you be playing the upcoming update for Infinity Nikki?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/smite-2-new-gods-august-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hi-Rez Studios has revealed that it intends to release a new god for action MOBA&nbsp;<em>Smite 2&nbsp;</em>every week between now and "at least August 2025".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/SMITEGame/status/1881059855307313664" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform X, the studio says that the schedule is part of "keeping up with a steady pace of god releases in&nbsp;<em>Smite 2</em>". The "at least" in the post also seems to indicate that this schedule may well continue beyond August, which is exciting.</p>

<p>It is worth pointing out that the term "new" might be doing a lot of heavy lifting here; as pointed out by Hi-Rez QA analyst <a href="https://x.com/Kitten0fDoom/status/1881065342778434015" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">KD</a>, many of these gods will be ported over from the original&nbsp;<em>Smite</em>, with four entirely new gods set to debut in the next 32 weeks.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/smite-2-new-god-every-week-cabrakan.jpg?itok=WZCNkdfd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/smite-2-new-god-every-week-cabrakan.jpg?itok=k0hHo_9i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Smite 2</em>'s Cabrakan is available to play right now.</figcaption></figure><p>Several new gods were also introduced as part of the&nbsp;<em>Smite&nbsp;</em>World Championship event, which aired over the weekend. Two of those gods, Vulcan and Hun Batz, will be arriving in the game's next update, while the third, Cabrakan, is available to try out right now.</p>

<p>In case you need a mythology refresher, Vulcan is the Roman god of fire. He's analogous to the Greek god Hephaestus. Hun Batz and Cabrakan are both Mayan gods; the former is a howler monkey god, while the latter is the god of earthquakes.</p>

<p>Hi-Rez also introduced the <a href="http://smite2.com/news/wandering-market/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wandering Market</a> during the event. It's essentially a seasonal battle pass system with free and premium tiers, and you can unlock all kinds of goodies through the pass, just as you'd expect.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/smite-2-new-god-every-week-wandering-market.jpg?itok=gupkbVfd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/smite-2-new-god-every-week-wandering-market.jpg?itok=7T8xdahd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Smite 2</em>'s Wandering Market is a new seasonal battle pass system that lets you unlock new skins and more.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Smite 2&nbsp;</em>is, it's the sequel to Hi-Rez's action MOBA&nbsp;<em>Smite</em>.</p>

<p>Originally, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/smite-2-revealed" rel="nofollow">the plan</a> was to support both&nbsp;<em>Smite&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Smite 2&nbsp;</em>simultaneously, but after layoffs back in October, the studio decided to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/smite-2-hi-rez-layoffs" rel="nofollow">shift its focus</a> mainly to&nbsp;<em>Smite 2</em>, with "light updates" continuing for the original game.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Smite 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2437170/SMITE_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/smite-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/smite-2/9NV8W1KJSQLL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

However, developer Second Dinner has let it be known that it is doing all it can to get <em>Marvel Snap </em>back online, and they’re hoping that’s at some point this Martin Luther King Day.</p><p>Late Sunday night, the company put out a statement on X acknowledging the situation, and the intention to “have it back online within 24 hours.”</p><p>Exactly why <em>Marvel Snap</em> got taken down at the same time as the TikTok ban came into force is unclear, and it certainly wasn’t expected by Second Dinner. On January 19, when the game suddenly went dark in the U.S., <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880861537981944300&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880861537981944300" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the developer posted</a></span>, “Unfortunately MARVEL SNAP is temporarily unavailable in U.S. app stores and is unavailable to play in the U.S. This outage is a surprise to us and wasn’t planned.”</p><p>At the same time, Second Dinner let affected players know it is aware that the downtime screws with a bunch of “time-based content, rewards, and missions,” but promised to all would be “compensated for their lost time.” </p><p>However, despite TikTok already being back online, <em>Marvel Snap </em>is still down Monday morning. Trump immediately declared his plan to intervene as soon as the ban was enacted (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/briantylercohen.bsky.social/post/3lg4augymnk2c&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/briantylercohen.bsky.social/post/3lg4augymnk2c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a ban which, of course, he himself announced in 2020</a></span>), which gave TikTok the confidence to come back online. However, it seems ByteDance’s <em>Marvel Snap</em> has gotten caught in the crossfire. TikTok boss Shou Zi Chew is attending Trumps inauguration, so perhaps someone could ask him to flick the switch back on for <em>Snap</em> while they’re there?</p><p><em>Marvel Snap</em> isn’t alone in being caught in all this. Other ByteDance apps like CapCut and Lark are also down, as the Chinese company presumably just yoinked everything at once to be safe from violating the ban. However, <em>Snap</em> is still available and working as normal in the rest of the world.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Marvel Snap developers are hard at work getting the game back online, and according to the latest developments, it may return within a day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marvel Snap was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-snap-taken-down-in-u-s-due-to-governments-tiktok-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">banned</a> along with TikTok yesterday and is currently unavailable to play in the United States. The game was banned because the company that developed TikTok also owns Marvel Snap publisher Nuverse. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-snap-gets-surprise-us-suspension-as-stateside-tiktok-ban-takes-effect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> spotted that the developers of Marvel Snap, Second Dinner recently took it to <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881154403333521795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> to reveal that they have been “working around the clock” to bring the game back and&nbsp;“hope to have it back online within 24 hours.”</p>



<p>Players who are missing out on content while waiting for Marvel Snap to return shouldn’t worry too much. The developers have <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881099521310269578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">assured</a> that they will compensate all players fairly for the lost time. They have also <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881135534548107414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">advised</a> players unable to play Marvel Snap to check out content creators.</p>



<p>Currently, the game isn’t available on the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store. If you try to log in to Marvel Rivals through any device in the United States, you are met with a message stating, “A law banning Marvel Snap has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use Marvel Snap for now.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals will receive a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-comic-book-april-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comic book in April 2025</a>. Also, Rivals will receive a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-red-hulk-mystery-skin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mystery skin</a> to celebrate the release of Captain America: Brave New World. Do you think Marvel Snap will return within 24 hours?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments below or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-rumors-director<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>director&nbsp;Daniel Vávra has taken to social media in order to address what he calls "wild claims" surrounding the game, including a ban in Saudi Arabia, unskippable cutscenes, and more.</p>

<p>In a lengthy <a href="https://x.com/DanielVavra/status/1881081082612944935" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">thread</a> on social media platform X,&nbsp;Vávra points to claims that have been circulating in recent days. He says these claims are "based just on one screenshot and a poorly translated tweet", likely pointing to <a href="https://x.com/VGA4A/status/1879150290680893691" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this post</a> from Saudi Arabian outlet VGA4A.</p>

<p>When machine translated, the post seems to say that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>has been banned in Saudi Arabia due to "unskippable gay scenes in story mode", and it's likely that this is the claim&nbsp;Vávra wants to address.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-ban-rumors-battle.jpg?itok=QI1P_6G4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-ban-rumors-battle.jpg?itok=wLFVadf6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Recent rumors surrounding&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>are, according to its director, unfounded.</figcaption></figure><p>According to&nbsp;Vávra,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>will feature "NO unskippable cutscenes", a claim he extends to the entirety of his studio Warhorse's output.</p>

<p>He then says that his studio's game is not, nor ever was, banned in any country, "at least not that we know of". It is, of course, possible that the game was banned in Saudi Arabia without&nbsp;Vávra's knowledge, but since he's the head of Warhorse, that seems unlikely.</p>

<p>Vávra then goes on to say that while he doesn't like "forced diversity", he and his team were not forced to do anything, nor are they "forcing anyone to do certain things".</p>

<p>Again pointing to the rumors of "unskippable gay scenes" propagated by the aforementioned post,&nbsp;Vávra says gay characters were already present in&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>, and that "you are responsible for your decisions".</p>

<p>He says that if you want Henry to have a "same-sex adventure", you can, but "if you don't want to, you don't have to".</p>




<p>The rest of&nbsp;Vávra's thread contains some story details for&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, as well as historical context explaining some of the creative decisions behind the game.</p>

<p>Vávra says, for instance, that the city in which the game takes place was "one of the richest" in Europe and was "besieged by a massive foreign army", which is why it's "more diverse than the life in the villages which were featured in the first game".</p>

<p>He closes by saying that he doesn't want his game to "be used as clickbait by people who didn't even play it yet", and that some followers have been "turned into exactly the same narrative they pretend to be fighting against".</p>

<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is set to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/9N4W31HSMVVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-moved-forward" rel="nofollow">February 4th</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-first-look-at-nvidia%E2%80%99s-flagship-rtx-5090-compared-to-the-rtx-4090.1086924/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24347693/nvidia-rtx-5090-vs-rtx-4090-design-fans-hardware<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition graphics card is arriving later this month, and we’ve managed to unbox one and compare its design to the RTX 4090. Just like our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24339760/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-photos">first look at the RTX 5090</a>, this isn’t a review. Performance figures, benchmarks, and impressions beyond the hardware are coming later.</p><p>The first thing that’s notable about the RTX 5090 is the packaging design has totally changed since the Founders Edition RTX 40-series. Nvidia has switched to housing the RTX 5090 inside a smaller bone-shaped gray cardboard shell that sits inside a much larger brown cardboard box.</p><div><figcaption><em>A dog and his RTX 5090 bone.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>The outer box — which reads “Inspired by gamers. Enhanced by AI. Built by Nvidia.” —  holds a new power adapter cable for the RTX 5090 that includes an updated version of the regular 12VHPWR connector. You’ll need to use four regular PCIe eight-pin power connectors with this adapter, or a new 12V-2x6 cable. The 12V-2x6 is almost identical to the existing 12VHPWR, as the new connector has shorter sensing pins and slightly longer conductor terminals. The slight variation means that existing 12VHPWR cables will work with the RTX 5090 just fine.</p><p>The RTX 5090 itself is the same width and length as an RTX 4090, but it’s a lot slimmer now because it’s just a two-slot card. Compared to the three-slot RTX 4090, it’s impressive to see that Nvidia has managed to shrink its latest flagship GPU into this smaller form factor.</p><div><figcaption><em>The RTX 4090 is a lot thicker than the RTX 5090.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>These exterior design changes also mean Nvidia has overhauled its cooling for the RTX 5090. It has moved to double flow-through fans that suck cooler air from below and exhaust it above the RTX 5090 into the rest of the case. There’s no rear exhaust on the RTX 5090 like there is on the RTX 40-series Founders Edition cards, but there are two little slots on either side to create an airflow boundary of sorts so that the warm air that’s exhausting out the top doesn’t recirculate below.</p><p>The PCB of the RTX 5090 is now located in the middle of the GPU, surrounded by big heat pipes that get cool air from the dual flow-through fans. This allows Nvidia to make the RTX 5090 Founders Edition small form factor certified, so it can fit into a variety of small cases. Nvidia has also relocated the power connector to be angled at the side, so it should be easier to fit into cases where the side panel comes close to touching the power cable.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->11</p><div><figcaption><em>The RTX 5090 inside its packaging.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge</cite></p></div></div><p>At the rear there are three DisplayPort 2.1b ports and a single HDMI 2.1b port. Interestingly, Nvidia has flipped the ports upside down, so if you’re used to plugging your cables in a particular way or you have some tight cable management at the rear of your PC you’ll need to flip your cables accordingly.</p><p>Much like previous Founders Edition cards, the RTX 5090 also has LEDs that light up at the top and side of the card in white. Nvidia has also picked a slightly darker gray for the metal housing of the RTX 5090. It’s not as light as the regular RTX 40-series Founders Edition cards, but it’s also nowhere near as black as the RTX 40-series Super variants. It’s a refined color between the two.</p><p>We aren’t allowed to show the RTX 5090 inside a PC or powered on with its LED lights blazing just yet, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkc9E726K3I">Jayztwocents got</a> “special permission” to do a small form factor build if you’re interested in seeing how it squeezes into a small case. We’ll be back soon with a full review of the RTX 5090 to see exactly how it compares to the RTX 4090.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Avowed Release Date & Platforms]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-release-date-platforms/</link>

<p>Avowed is a new IP from the big brains at Obsidian Entertainment. The ARPG is a diverse experience taking the best bits from action games and the depth of role-playing titles. It comes in a busy year for the company, so let’s check out Avowed’s release date, and where you can find the release.</p>



<p>Obsidian Entertainment is all hands on deck in 2025. The developer is preparing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds 2 sequel</a>—another ARPG—whereas Avowed takes on a more magical feel. It’s fresh, looks exciting, and it’s the sort of magical fun the world needs. Spells, weapons, swords, and axes are part and parcel of this jaw-dropping, semi-open-world release. </p>



<p>There are big expectations, and rightly so, and we’re here to see what Obsidian is cooking up for launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-avowed-s-release-date">When is Avowed’s Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The big, bad bear. Credit to Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Avowed launches on February 18, meaning the full release date is almost here.</strong></p>



<p>February and March are always a competitive period for gaming. Companies are keen to capitalize on the quieter January and post-Xmas lull. If you check your calendar, you’ll notice Avowed is only a few days after Valentine’s Day, making it a perfect late present. </p>



<p>Keep the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-delay-confirmed-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed release date</a> in mind if you need gift ideas!</p>



<h2 id="h-avowed-release-time">Avowed Release Time</h2>



<p><strong>Avowed doesn’t have a special launch time yet, meaning a midnight launch is likely.</strong></p>



<p>Very few games come with unique launch windows. Avowed also looks to be heading this way—unless Obsidian intervenes and ruins my theory—so you can ready yourself for midnight in your region. </p>



<p>New Zealand users get their usual benefit of first access due to the time difference. Make sure to keep off of social media until Avowed is installed and ready to go on your format.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-avowed-platforms">All Avowed Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Xbox Series X|S and PC are the only platforms you can find Avowed for now.</strong></p>



<p>Avowed is published by Xbox Game Studios, meaning it’s a <strong>Microsoft-exclusive title</strong>. So bizarre is the gaming landscape in 2025 that I wouldn’t rule out Avowed coming to PS5. Exclusivity means a lot less than it used to—with Sony publishing exclusive games on PC too—and the PlayStation and Xbox crossover is only getting stronger.</p>



<p>Reports are abound that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hellblade-2-and-gears-of-war-are-also-reportedly-coming-to-playstation-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hellblade 2 and Gears of War are coming to PS5</a>. There are rumors about Halo dropping too. If this is all possible, an Avowed PlayStation port doesn’t seem beyond the realms of possibility.</p>



<hr>



<p>Does Avowed catch your eye in 2025? Or is it a standalone interest, is The Outer Worlds 2 also sending you to space? Let us know your thoughts on both games.</p>

        <blockquote><p><strong>Detailed Overview</strong></p><p>Gird your loins and sharpen your steel because, a full quarter century since the studio’s inception, Firefly is ecstatic to announce <em>Stronghold Crusader: Definitive Edition</em>! Following <em><a title="Games > Stronghold: Definitive Edition [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/stronghold-definitive-edition">Stronghold: Definitive Edition</a></em> in 2023, which has sold over half a million copies, Firefly can now reveal their best-selling <em>Crusader</em> title will return with a new definitive edition releasing this year on July 15, 2025! This fan-favorite entry in the BAFTA-nominated <em>Stronghold</em> series has been rebuilt with the game’s original developers adding brand new content, elevated graphics, and extensive player-requested features.</p><p>Command war-honed Crusader warriors as they brave the merciless desert sands, then, as Saladin, lead a mighty army drawn from every corner of the Middle East and repel the invading zealots.</p><p>In <em>Stronghold Crusader: Definitive Edition</em>, players dominate the greatest frontier of the medieval age, waging brutal war across timeless battlefronts and sieging epic fortresses, to relive the glorious clashes that have shaped human history. Journey across the heart of the medieval world and take part in the legendary Crusades for the holy land. Witness the struggle of wills between Richard the Lionheart, King of England, and Sultan Saladin ibn Ayyub, spearhead of the Islamic domain and founder of the Ayyubid dynasty. Command war-honed Crusader warriors as they brave the merciless desert sands, then, as Saladin, lead a mighty army drawn from every corner of the Middle East and repel the invading zealots.</p><p>Rebuilt from the ground up as a testament to the collective talent of the veteran developers, artists, actors and series composer Robert L. Euvino, <em>Stronghold Crusader: Definitive Edition</em> enhances the old-school 2.5D isometric Stronghold gameplay with major new features, fixes and custom options.</p><p>Catapulting from its towering 23 year history, <em>Stronghold Crusader: Definitive Edition</em> expands on the original real-time strategy city builder. Four new AI opponents, eight Bedouin warrior units, two historical campaigns to learn how to command these soldiers and four “Sands of Time” skirmish trails to test your skill means there is plenty to look forward to. Skirmish mode lovers meanwhile will also be rewarded with larger map sizes and new maps to battle across, along with enhanced graphics and audio. Add to this a new <a title="Genres > Co-Op [227 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> skirmish trail, custom options and other player-requested changes, and it is clear that <em>Stronghold Crusader: Definitive Edition</em> aims to realize the full vision of the development talent behind the multi-million selling original “castle sim.”</p><p>In upgrading the old and leaving the gold, the core essence of <em>Crusader</em> has been both carefully rebuilt and expanded on.                                             </p><p>Interlacing fresh gameplay content, technical improvements, customizable conveniences and highly requested quality of life additions, <em>Stronghold Crusader: Definitive Edition</em> allows veterans and newcomers to rediscover a strategy classic and play it the way they want to.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-roadmap-january-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-roadmap-includes-co-op-new-pals-and-more.1086891/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-roadmap-january-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pocketpair has shared a brand new&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>roadmap to celebrate the game's first anniversary, and it includes some pretty major features, although it's not clear exactly when these features are set to debut.</p>

<p>In a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/596264277969469557" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Pocketpair celebrates&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s first birthday by announcing a number of initiatives related to the game, only one of which is the aforementioned roadmap. The studio will also be holding a "worldwide Pal popularity poll", and a soundtrack has been released for free, too.</p>

<p>The roadmap promises a number of new "future" features without committing to timeframes, including major new features and miscellaneous improvements alike.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-roadmap-2025-full.jpg?itok=4YxKjWvl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-roadmap-2025-full.jpg?itok=q5EYRdU4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lots of new features are coming to&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>this year.</figcaption></figure><p>The roadmap promises the likes of co-op crossplay between different platforms, as well as being able to transfer Pals between worlds and "further ways to strengthen and improve Pals". You can also look forward to new Pals and technologies, as well as a new "ending scenario".</p>

<p>Pocketpair also promises "game collaborations", including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-terraria-crossover-2025" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Terraria&nbsp;</em>collab</a>, so it sounds like there will be more&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>crossovers in the future. Just <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-lawsuit-patents-demands-nintendo" rel="nofollow">don't expect a&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>crossover</a> anytime soon.</p>

<p>Improvements coming to&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>in the future include tweaks for "world object placement", Pals, game optimization, and UX, so&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>should be a smoother experience overall once those have been applied.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this roadmap doesn't commit to even a vague time window for when we can expect these improvements to arrive. Pocketpair simply pledges to "continue updating <i>Palworld&nbsp;</i>as we prepare for the official release".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-roadmap-2025-1st-anniversary-artwork.jpg?itok=WVQPoUeA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-roadmap-2025-1st-anniversary-artwork.jpg?itok=JYUDmmg2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Pocketpair shared this cute artwork to celebrate&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s first anniversary.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not au fait with&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, it's a survival game that mashes up the creature collecting of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>with the base-building and exploration of games like&nbsp;<em>Ark: Survival Evolved</em>.</p>

<p>Often distilled (perhaps unfairly) down to "<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>with guns",&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>was a breakout hit when it was released, attracting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-25-million-players-matching-pokemon-scarlet-violet" rel="nofollow">tens of millions of players</a>&nbsp;during the first month or two of its release.</p>

<p>Those&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>comparisons might not be fair, but Nintendo clearly doesn't think so; the Japanese gaming giant is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">currently suing Pocketpair</a> over some rather arcane patents, a situation which led to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-ps5-release-japan" rel="nofollow">delay of the game's PS5 release</a> in Japan.</p>

While most POTUSes need to be rescued from evil terrorists or rivals, there are times when the Big Cheese takes matters into their own hands. You don’t get to win the Electoral College without making a few enemies, after all.</p><p>In Section 3 of the United States Constitution, which details a few critical duties of the President of the United States (POTUS), one passage reads: “He shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union.” What it doesn’t say is that, also from time to time, the president shall roll up their sleeves and open a can of whoop-ass. And we’ve seen people assume the role of president in movies and have to save the country by any means necessary.</p><p>As Donald Trump returns to office as the 47th President, it’s a good time to look at some cinematic chief executives to remember what responsibility, initiative, and cunning look like. From disaster epics to alien invasions, here are 13 of the most badass presidents in action movies.</p></div></div><div><p>Making the low end of this list is President Charlotte Field, played by the alluring Charlize Theron in the 2019 rom-com <em>Long Shot</em>. The low placement is purely a technicality: She doesn’t actually become president until the <em>end </em>of the movie.  But, president-elect Field deserves greater recognition, as only Theron could pull off a tense hostage negotiation while utterly zonked out on ecstasy. Remember: Never negotiate with terrorists, only with homies.</p></div><div><p>Before <em>Inception</em>, there was <em>Dreamscape</em>. Dennis Quaid leads this overlooked sci-fi movie from 1984 as a psychic and con artist who joins a study that allows him to enter people’s dreams. Halfway through the movie, Eddie Albert appears as a POTUS haunted by recurring nightmares—an Achilles’ heel the villains exploit to attempt his assassination. Oscar nominee Albert is more or less sleepwalking through his part, though in the climax, he stands up to a gnarly stop-motion snake monster until a knocked-out Quaid gets back on his feet.</p></div><div><p>Snake Plissken is tasked with saving President John Harker in John Carpenter’s dystopic sci-fi (and all-time great) movie <em>Escape from New York</em>. But the slimy Harker gets a moment to shine as he saves Snake’s ass by shooting up The Duke (Isaac Hayes) and taunting him in the process. Plissken is no fan of Harker, and by the end of the movie, it’s unlikely audiences would vote for him either. However, getting the final kill without upstaging Kurt Russell is kind of cool.</p></div><div><p>Danny Glover’s President Wilson isn’t a badass because he rushes before the enemy, guns blazing and dodging bullets. In Roland Emmerich’s disaster flick <em>2012</em>, which toys with the hoopla around the Mayan calendar, President Wilson is a badass because of how he commands a dignified aura as he soothes a hysterical nation bombarded by Mother Nature’s wrath. Not one to hide in a comfy bunker, Wilson provides additional comfort to everyone around him in the immediate vicinity of the White House—or at least, he tries to. You can imagine how hard it is to get things done when cataclysmic earthquakes tear up the North Lawn.</p></div><div><p>Jonathan Pryce returns as the unnamed Commander-in-Chief from 2009's <em>G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra</em> for the Jon M. Chu-directed sequel <em>Retaliation</em> (2013). Though Pryce has much more to do in <em>Retaliation</em>—with not one but two standout scenes, telling off world leaders at a G8 Summit in one and disavowing the G.I. Joes in another—he’s actually not the president at all. He’s Zartan in disguise, continuing a plot thread left at the end of <em>Rise of Cobra</em>. But as far as the world of <em>G.I. Joe</em> is concerned, their president has suddenly turned into a stone-cold badass.</p></div><div><p>On paper, having Sam Jackson playing the role should instantly make his president, William Alan Moore, the most badass movie president of all time. But Jalmari Helander’s cartoonish buddy adventure <em>Big Game</em>—in which Air Force One is shot down over the wilds of Finland—has Jackson step aside to let Onni Tommila, a 13-year-old deer hunter, soak up most of the movie’s crowning moments. But President Moore isn’t made of glass, and he survives a steep fall into a ravine inside an ice cooler and wins a knife fight with a terrorist. He may not be a bad motherfucker, but he’s no lame duck either.</p></div><div><p>On one hand, President Tom Beck of <em>Deep Impact</em> fulfills his job description to a T: he leads America with solemnity and grace. But it’s an entirely different matter to lead the nation through an extinction-level catastrophe. While Morgan Freeman is a distinguished president, his first meeting with an ambitious MSNBC journalist (Téa Leoni)—who suspects the big secret around “Ellie” is some garden-variety extramarital affair—paints Beck more like a mafia boss than a democratically elected leader of the free world. If you think Freeman can only play stately gentlemen and wise elders, his introduction in <em>Deep Impact</em> will make you see him in a new light.</p></div><div><p>The ...<em>Has Fallen</em> movies are all about Gerard Butler’s Secret Service agent Mike Banning breathlessly racing to protect the President of the United States or going on the run after being framed for trying to assassinate the president. In the first two films, Butler puts himself in front of many, many bullets for President Benjamin Asher, played by Aaron Eckhart—a vanilla but not flavorless action-movie POTUS. Asher isn’t afraid of picking up a gun or headbutting a dude. But, like all good presidents, he delegates those duties to a capable agent.</p></div><div><p>“I want the people to know they still have two out of three branches of the government working for them. And that ain’t bad.” Jack Nicholson weaponizes his smarmy charm as President James Dale in Tim Burton’s ludicrous <em>Mars Attacks!</em> Though the Martians are ostensibly the villains, Burton’s film revels in the rotten core of humankind—a doomed species even without help from alien invaders. Look beyond Dale’s impassioned speech about brotherhood across boundaries to spot hints of self-serving motives; even the Martians know better than to trust a politician. Still, credit to President Dale for getting them to listen in the first place.</p></div><div><p>You’ve got to give it up to <em>Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter</em>. That title is upfront and unambiguous: it’s about Abraham Lincoln, who hunts vampires. (And frankly, he does it pretty well.) Both Seth Grahame-Smith’s original novel and Timur Bekmambetov’s film version are tongue-in-cheek farces that maintain a straight-faced facade, but star Benjamin Walker puts in an honest effort to give Honest Abe some action-hero swagger. Abe isn’t as cool as Blade or Buffy, but he’s got more chops as a vampire hunter than Hansel and Gretel do as witch hunters.</p></div><div><p>Jamie Foxx’s President Sawyer, from Roland Emmerich’s witty action-thriller <em>White House Down</em>, is an unsubtle Barack Obama analog, down to a minor—but circa 2013, timely—subplot involving the withdrawal of troops in the Middle East. But Obama never wore Jordans, not during his time in office, anyway. Nor did the 44th president aim a rocket launcher at the front gate of the White House. That’s all Sawyer, an eloquent statesman who takes questions from an 11-year-old YouTuber like she’s Anderson Cooper. While a sweaty Channing Tatum takes charge in most of the action in <em>White House Down</em>, Foxx isn’t afraid to get his presidential hands dirty.</p></div><div><p>President Thomas J. Whitmore, played by Bill Pullman in Roland Emmerich’s smash hit <em>Independence Day</em>, taught us all how to celebrate. Whitmore is such a badass that getting into the cockpit of a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet to fight aliens isn’t even the most memorable thing he does in the movie. After noticing that the eerily young pilots about to fight an invasive species are “a little nervous,” Whitmore grabs a loudspeaker to bid his brave soldiers a good morning—and then some. “Mankind—that word should have new meaning for all of us today,” he says. Go ahead. Finish it. You know the rest.</p></div><div><p>A thousand action movies revolve around protecting the President of the United States. So it’s a hell of a thing how Wolfgang Petersen’s <em>Air Force One</em> follows a hero’s journey in which the POTUS who has to save himself. Who else but Harrison Ford could play the ready-to-rumble Head of State? After <em>Air Force One</em> is sabotaged by neo-Soviet terrorists, President Ford—sorry, President Marshall—gets down and dirty at over 35,000 feet, knocking out goons and shooting up others before ordering Gary Oldman to “get off my plane.” Hail to the Chief, baby.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Netease’s latest hero-shooter, Marvel Rivals, has managed to wow fans worldwide in a very short time, so much so that it is receiving a comic book adaptation by Marvel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals is an original story woven by the game’s developers to create this hero-shooter. After seeing the numbers it has pulled off, Marvel has decided to adopt the game’s narrative in a comic book. Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/marvel-rivals-infinity-comic-physical-print-release-april-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, a new <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/new-marvel-rivals-comic-book-spins-out-of-the-hit-video-game-sensation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> on the Marvel website revealed that “MARVEL RIVALS #1, a special one-shot inspired by the game’s story,” is set to arrive in April 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Marvel Rivals comic book is written by Paul Allor and drawn by Luca Claretti. The comic will receive “all six issues of Marvel Unlimited’s Marvel Rivals Infinity Comic in print for the first time.” Players can grab a digital copy of the comic through the Marvel Unlimited App or purchase a physical copy from their local comic book store when it arrives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the story of Marvel Rivals #1 comic book, the events are set in Tokyo 2099, where a time rift has hampered the Web of Life and Destiny. Two groups have been formed with their own opinions on solving the problem. The first group is led by Peni Parker, who wishes to plug the Web into Cyberspace, and the second group is led by Spider-Man, who wants to use Chronovium to strengthen the Web so that it repairs itself.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals #1 comic book series will take us through “an epic battle between two squads” composed of characters from the game’s original roster. This means we will see heavy hitters like Spider-Man, Captain America, Wolverine, Jeff the Land Shark, Peni Parker, and more battle it out.&nbsp;Which group do you think will emerge victorious in this battle?</p>
