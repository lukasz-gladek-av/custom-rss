			<p>Much like in the latest few entries in the Persona series, MP management, and restoration in Metaphor: ReFantazio is extremely important. Unlike other Japanese role-playing games, MP restoration items are hard to come by, so you need to be extremely mindful of when to use your Skills so as not to find yourself out of MP before a battle against a powerful enemy or boss which would force you to leave the dungeon and waste a precious day that could have been used to strengthen the bonds with your Followers or improve one of your Kingly Virtues.</p>
<p>The first tip that can improve your MP management in Metaphor: ReFantazio may sound a little obvious, but it's very easy to forget in the heat of things. <strong>You don't have to fight every enemy you meet inside dungeons</strong>. Experience points gain falls off pretty quickly if you're fighting enemies at around your own level, so there's no risk of being underleveled for certain battles if you fight the right amount of enemies. The only reason some players may have to fight every single enemy inside a dungeon is to gain Archetype Experience to unlock more Skills and better customization options, but Archetype Experience points gain falls off as quickly as regular Experience points do, and there are way better ways to earn A-EXP, such as using the Hero family of items that can be obtained in a lot of different ways. So, no matter how you want to play the game, <strong>always pick your battles carefully.</strong></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241009141742_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>At the start of Metaphor: ReFantazio, using items such as Magla Pills and Potions will be the only way to restore MP while inside dungeons, but thankfully, way more options become available as the adventure proceeds, and using them accordingly will allow you to grind for EXP and A-EXP if needed, or simply explore the biggest dungeons fully in a single day. The first of these options becomes available fairly early in the game but is limited to the Main Character. Every Archetype belonging to the Mage Lineage comes with a Hero Passive skill called <strong>Magic Recovery</strong> <strong>which recovers MP each time an enemy is stunned or defeated in overworld combat.</strong> As enemies that require Squad combat to be defeated can be stunned over and over in the field, this skill provides a potentially unlimited MP reserve for the Main Character, although MP recovery with this skill is very slow and is mostly useful as a last resort.</p>
<p>Another solid method to restore MP in Metaphor: ReFantazio can be unlocked after Heismay joins the Main Character in his quest. The Thief Archetype he embodies can learn the<strong> Plunder Magic skill, which restores a small amount of MP</strong> by consuming one to activate the skill. Thanks to the Inheritance system, this skill can be assigned to any Archetype. Enter a Squad battle, defeat every enemy but one, and use Plunder Magic repeatedly to restore MP. If the enemy is susceptible to Sleep, you can do so without having to worry about healing.</p>
<p>Once you unlock the Masked Dancer Archetype, the strategy above becomes even more effective with the<strong> Masked Revelry passive skill, which recovers a medium amount of the caster's MP every turn, with increased recovery if more Archetypes of the same Lineage are present in the battle party</strong>, so, if you have enough Magla to unlock the Archetype for all your party members, you can restore a decent chunk of MP by just having them participate in battle. Unfortunately, the Masked Dancer is among the last few Archetypes you unlock, so you will have to make do with other MP recovery strategies before you can use this one. By strengthening the bond with the Follower that grants access to this archetype to Rank 2, you will also be able to enjoy some light MP restoration after battle thanks to the Triumphant Hymn ability.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241009140351_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Equipping the right accessories is also a great way to restore MP in Metaphor: ReFantazio. Items like the <strong>Crescent Medal</strong> provide moderate MP restoration every turn, and they are a great pick for Archetypes that need a lot of MP to deal damage or provide support, such as the Mage and Commander Lineages. The <strong>Full Moon Medal</strong>, which can be obtained as a reward for the Silver I league at the Brilehaven Colosseum, provides even better MP recovery.</p>
<p>In case all the methods above are too slow, you can always fall back on items. MP recovery items can be found in a lot of different places, and you can even get some for free on some days with the Bardon's Care Package ability. After a certain point in the game, you can also cook <strong>Magical Bread</strong>, which grants gradual MP recovery while walking in dungeons for 60 seconds, which works great as emergency MP restoration.</p>

            <p>You have woken to the sound of multiple former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> developers arguing inside your own skull. They are bickering about whose game is the true spiritual successor to the rockbottom detective <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>. Is it the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-disco-elysium-devs-are-working-on-a-spiritual-successor-at-new-studio-longdue-though-robert-kurvitz-and-aleksander-rostov-arent-involved">unnamed project announced earlier today</a> by new studio Longdue, involving some kind of "psychogeography mechanic"? Or is it this one, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/xxx-nightshift">XXX Nightshift</a>, a cerebral sci-fi RPG set in a posh polar hotel about a detective "solving gruesome murders, breaking sacred hearts, or just killing bloody time"? It's not for me to choose the dialogue option now appearing in your own brain. But I will say this: at least the one with the horny name has a trailer.</p>

<p>Ah, sultry whispering. Yes, this basically seems like an ASMR rework of the waking scene in Disco Elysium, in which detective Harry DuBois wakes up slowly to the quarreling sounds of his limbic system and a sense of deep worthlessness. </p>
<p>But here you'll play a detective on holiday at an Antarctic ski resort in the year 2086, where something has gone wrong. "Now you’re stranded at the off-season resort with unforgettable guests, wild parties, and mad secrets," say developers Dark Math Games. </p><p>There will be a similar crowd of dialogue-heavy skills that influence your choices, by the looks of things, along with skill checks and the like. Your character will be putting her training to use with "interrogations, confrontations, and seductions". The sexy wording continues. "In the endless polar night, amidst the orgies of politics, power, and poetry, something gruesome lies waiting."</p>
<p>There's certainly more than a whiff of Revachol's idiosyncratic lingo to the game's writing so far. "Use Marafet calculations to alter your time and space," we're told. Enjoy the "Dopamine Buffet". There's also the ability to recruit companions to help you solve cases. I'll call it now - you will probably fuck your companions. </p>
<p>ZAUM, the studio that made Disco Elysium, became <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-studio-bosses-humiliated-the-cancelled-expansions-lead-writer-for-speaking-to-journalists-claims-report">wracked with internal disputes</a> following that game's release, which eventually led to employees leaving the company, including key directors like Robert Kurvitz and Aleksander Rostov. It looks like those two are not involved in either of these new games though. Regardless of who is or isn't working on it, I still think XXX Nightshift is an, uh, <em>interesting</em> name choice. Insofar as I expect to see it written in comic sans on the Steam thumbnail of an ass in a g-string. But hey, you still have time to change your minds, Disco people. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-truce-with-the-furies-gets-a-mad-new-title-and-trailer">It's been done before</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And however much we might grow up and think of ourselves as mature, sober citizens, you can still get a frisson of that pleasure by organizing a closet, or watching a tower block demolished. So why not go the whole hog and indulge that secret pleasure with one of the very best dexterity games on the market?</p><h2>TL;DR: These Are the Best Dexterity Games</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games#junk">Junk Ark</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games#nekojima">Nekojima</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games#catacombs">Catacombs</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games#klask">Klask</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games#tinderblox">Tinderblox</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games#jenga">Jenga</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games#crokinole">Crokinole</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games#dungeon">Dungeon Fighter</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games#jungle">Jungle Speed</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games#kabuto">Kabuto Sumo</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games#drop">Drop It</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games#hamster">Hamster Roll</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games#looping">Looping Louie</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games#rhino">Rhino Hero</a></li></ul><h2 id="junk">Junk Art</h2><div id="197672" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Junk Art</h3></p></div><p>Why pick one best dexterity game when you can have them all in a single box? That’s essentially what Junk Art is. The box contains four colored sets of oddly-shaped pieces and a deck of matching cards, alongside another set of cards to determine what mini-games you’re going to play with them. They range from traditional stacking affairs, to co-operative piling, to passing the most awkward pieces to your neighbor and even playing a trick-taking game to get the best pieces. There are additional blank cards to make your own, and an internet full of suggestions. With no two games ever likely to be the same and a range of dexterity and strategic challenges, this could be the only activity game you ever need.</p><p id="nekojima"><h2 data-toc-title="Nekojima" id="nekojima">Nekojima</h2></p><div catalogid="82b1d311-1ea1-49a6-b6f7-7535a9f09273" id="207880"><div id="207880" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Nekojima</h3></p></div><p>If you want a stacking game that retains the simple, accessible delights of piling things on top of each other, but want it to look better and play more peculiarly than Jenga, look no further than <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nekojima-board-game-review">Nekojima</a>. Here, you’re piling pairs of poles rather than blocks, but the big catch is that each couplet is connected by a length of stiff cord, which mustn’t touch any other cords or poles once placed. That gives the game a fascinating edge when it comes to calculating how you can help or hinder the following plays. There are also cardboard cats you must occasionally hang from the growing network, following the same no-touch rule. Easily learned, and just as fun whether you’re playing solo, competitively or cooperatively, this is a modern classic for all ages.</p></div><p id="catacombs"><h2 data-toc-title="Catacombs" id="catacombs">Catacombs</h2></p><div catalogid="522975dc-ca51-4f23-8f62-5656d6566f86" id="208972"><div id="208972" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Catacombs</h3></p></div><p>Dexterity games tend to be about stacking things, or balancing things or - as in the case of Catacombs - flicking things. But here those simple, accessible delights are used as a base layer on which to paste the additional mechanics of a fantasy adventure game. The board becomes a dungeon room, the heroes and monsters discs that can be flicked for movement, while attacks, spells and missiles are smaller projectiles to bounce around the arena. It’s a brilliant combination, offering a fast-playing quest game with multiple upgrade paths for your heroes and a randomised dungeon each time for huge replay value as well as the huge fun of flicking discs.</p><h2 id="klask">Klask</h2><div id="197673" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Klask</h3></p></div><p>Klask is one of those absurdly simple ideas that makes you wonder why no-one thought of it before. Each player controls a piece on the board using a magnet underneath, which they push around to hit a tiny plastic ball careening around the tray-like playing surface. There’s an indent in each end which counts as a goal, and the – ahem – goal is to push that ball into the opponent’s indent while defending your own. There’s a lot of speed and skill to this pursuit, far more than it may initially seem, and that would be enough to win it a space on this list. But the kicker is that the field is also littered with magnetic obstacles that will stick to your paddle if you get too close, upping both the skills and thrills in one fell swoop.</p><h2 id="tinderblox">Tinderblox</h2><div id="197674" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Tinderblox</h3></p></div><p>The joy of Tinderblox is its tiny mint-tin scale. Within is a simple yet devious stacking game where you manoeuvre mini-blocks onto a stack of firewood and coloured flame cubes using a pair of supplied tweezers. When it’s your turn, the items you need to add to the pile are dictated by a card draw. Sometimes it’ll be a little stack of its own, a stick and a fire cube, that you must keep balanced as you manoeuvre it into position. Sometimes the card will also tell you to swap hands for added challenge. It’s the stacking game reduced to its absolute bare essentials, put in a super-portable package that you can take anywhere on the off-chance of players, and with bright colors that make it look great on the table even in miniature. Its ongoing appeal is a testament to the basal satisfaction of trying to put things in a nice, even pile.</p><h2 id="jenga">Jenga</h2><div id="197675" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Jenga</h3></p></div><p>This is a game that pretty much everyone is familiar with, but there are a few fascinating facts about Jenga that might make a more interesting pick than you realize. First, despite its ubiquity, this isn’t any kind of ancient classic – it was invented in 1983 by Leslie Scott. Second, her particular innovation, which is common to all branded versions of this venerable stacking game, is that all the blocks are made to be slightly different from each other, creating imperfections that make the behavior of the stack far harder to predict. Factoids that are not only great for dinner parties, but also for getting an edge in the after-dinner games when the stacking blocks come out.</p><p>You can also choose to go with giant Jenga, which is a jumbo-sized version of the original that makes for a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-outdoor-yard-games">great yard game</a>.</p><h2 id="crokinole">Crokinole</h2><div id="197676" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Tournament Crokinole &amp; Checkers</h3></p></div><p>If you want a genuinely old dexterity game that still has teeth, look no further than Crokinole. It dates back to at least the mid-1800’s in Canada and is quite possibly older as a folk game. Most boards nowadays are mass-produced, but it’s still possible to buy handmade ones, which will set you back a pretty penny. It’s a flicking game where you’re trying to score by getting your discs as far into the board as possible, particularly the central region which is ringed by pegs. But in order to be valid, your shot must cause at least one opposing disc to move, otherwise it’s removed. This gives the game a strategic edge on top of the considerable flicking chops that it demands, as you’re always trying to clog up your opponent’s opportunities to hit your discs while freeing up your own. </p><h2 id="dungeon">Dungeon Fighter</h2><div id="197677" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Dungeon Fighter</h3></p></div><p>There’s a surprising amount of dexterity games that weave in a fantasy or a sci-fi themes, and Dungeon Fighter is the current king of the pile. It’s a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative game</a> where players each have a character in an adventuring party seeking to loot a dangerous dungeon. Whenever you encounter one of the game’s frequent monsters you fight it by throwing dice, as you might expect, but the twist is that you’re rolling onto a target board which will do damage depending on where the dice stops. If it rolls off, or falls into one of the gaps on the board, it’s a duff blow. With plenty of variety in character, dungeon and monster cards and a high skill ceiling, increased by the various bizarre throwing methods mandated by certain monsters, such as flicking dice off the back of your hand, it’s a delightful mix of challenge, narrative and tomfoolery.</p><h2 id="jungle">Jungle Speed</h2><div id="197678" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Jungle Speed</h3></p></div><p>If you’ve ever felt that the beloved children’s classic card game snap was missing a vicious and sometimes bloody edge, then do we have a game for you. The core of the game is just like snap: players turn over cards one at a time and look for matches. But sat in the middle of the table is the sinister, brooding totem, and players with matching cards are instantly catapulted into a race to grab it first. The looser has to take all the played cards so far and, quite probably, nurse any number of bruises, scratches and sprains gained in the struggle for supremacy. Add in a few special-effect cards, including one that has all players grabbing for the totem, and you’ve got a modern classic. Just make sure all the players trim their fingernails first.  </p><h2 id="kabuto">Kabuto Sumo</h2><div id="197679" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Kabuto Sumo: Bug Wrestling </h3></p></div><p>There’s a general tendency for dexterity games to revolve around stacking things, or grabbing things or throwing things. But Kabuto Sumo has a whole new take on the genre, inspired by penny waterfall arcade machines. The player’s beetle pieces square off on a platform, surrounded by wooden discs. Then you take turns pushing oddly-shaped objects onto the platform, trying to nudge your opponents off the edge and collecting any non-player shapes that fall. It’s simple yet skilful and wholly engrossing as you try and work out all the angles and impacts required for maximum movement. A slew of different wrestlers with their own push-on shapes and special powers further increases the game’s staying power.</p><h2 id="drop">Drop It</h2><div id="197680" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Drop It</h3></p></div><p>There’s a very obvious bridge between video games and dexterity board games, but it’s rarely been so direct as it is in Drop It. Players take turns selecting from a variety of colored shapes and dropping them into the playfield, which is two upright transparent sheets with a thin space between them to hold the shapes in place. The higher your shape is atop the stack of existing pieces when it lands, the more you will score. But be careful: if you touch any other pieces of the same shape or color, you get nothing. This gives piece selection a frisson of strategy, dropping them a frisson of skill and the sheer unpredictable way all those shapes shift and roll off each other give it a whole lot of fun and excitement.</p><h2 id="hamster">Hamster Roll</h2><div id="197681" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Hamster Roll</h3></p></div><p>Hamster Roll – often known by its original German name Hamsterrolle – is a balancing game with a unique twist. Rather than trying to balance your blocks atop each other in a tower, everyone is placing their pieces into slots on a giant wheel, trying to keep it as balanced as possible. If your placement causes the wheel to shift and pieces fall off, then you have to collect them and add them to your stash. First player to get rid of all their pieces wins. The sheer unfamiliarity of this is a big draw and, once you’re in, you’ll discover there’s a surprising amount of strategy to it as well, as you try to anticipate where following players might try and slot their pieces and torpedo those moves by blocking slots or throwing the balance off-whack. But watch out: get too tricksy, and it’ll end up being you picking up the pieces instead.</p><h2 id="looping">Looping Louie</h2><div id="197682" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Looping Louie</h3></p></div><p>While this was very obviously designed and marketed as a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-kids">children’s game</a>, it’s found a surprising fan base among older players as well. Thanks to an electronic gizmo, Louie pilots his little aeroplane in a circle above each player’s chicken coop, trying to knock their chicken discs off their perches. Loose them all and you’re out of the game. But you have a secret weapon: in front of your coop, there’s a paddle you can use to try and lift Louie above and save a chicken. It’s about as simple and fast as it’s possible for a game to be, but it also happens to be hilarious to play as Louie spins and dives about at unpredictable angles. And for the truly accomplished, there’s the perfect shot to practice and aim for, lifting Louie just the right height to clear an opponent’s paddle and dive straight into their coop.</p><h2 id="rhino">Rhino Hero</h2><div id="197683" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Rhino Hero</h3></p></div><p>Another children’s game that turns out to have a lot of appeal for adults, Rhino Hero, and its big buddy Super Rhino Hero, bring a load of super-powered character to the pleasure of stacking things high. In this original version of the game, players get a random stack of roof cards which they must add to the growing tower, supported by two right-angled wall cards. Stack carefully: although this is a fairly stable construct, you’ll be out of the game if you cause it to fall. The real fun is in the hidden powers of the roof cards that are revealed when you play them, which range from weirdly-angled walls to placing and moving the titular hero up the tower with great care, lest his pachyderm might cause the cards to fall!</p><p>For more, be sure to check out our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">best board games of all time</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-parties-and-large-groups">best party games</a> for when you have people over, and the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">best solo board games</a> for when you don't.</p><p><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelancer for IGN, specializing in tabletop games.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, released by Atlus today, has already surpassed a million units sold.</p>
<p>That makes it the fastest-selling Atlus game ever. Previously that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-3-reload-is-fastest-selling-atlus-game-ever">record was held by Persona 3 Reload</a> released earlier this year, which reached the same sales figure in under a week.</p>
<p>Atlus <a href="https://www.atlus.co.jp/news/28747/">shared the news</a> with a new illustration from character designer Shigenori Soejima to celebrate.</p>

<p>Over on Steam, Metaphor: ReFantazio is also off to a good start. It's already reached a peak concurrent player count of over 42,000 at the time of writing - and that's continuing to rise (thanks <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2679460/charts/">SteamDB</a>).</p>
<p>That's already ahead of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-5-royal-review">Persona 5 Royal</a>, which has a peak concurrent player count of 35,474. Persona 3 Reload has a peak of 45,002, which surely Metaphor will beat imminently.</p>
<p>In all, it's looking like Metaphor: ReFantazio is set to be a great success for Atlus. It's the first new franchise for the RPG maker since Persona and takes place in a high fantasy world - a first for the company.</p>
<p>"Persona veteran Atlus flexes its expertise with a fresh take on high fantasy. What it lacks in subtlety, it makes up for in grandeur and heart," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-review">Eurogamer Metaphor: ReFantazio review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Xbox owners in the US will be able to play and purchase games directly from the Xbox App on Android from November.</p>
<p>The change follows the ongoing legal battle between Epic Games and Google. Earlier this week a US judge ruled Google runs a monopoly via its smartphone app store, meaning <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-wins-major-google-lawsuit-further-opening-up-android-phones-to-third-party-stores">third-party storefront apps must now be made available from the Google Play Store</a>.</p>
<p>This has opened the door for Microsoft, meaning players can now purchase Xbox games on Android devices and then immediately stream them through Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p>

<p>"The court's ruling to open up Google's mobile store in the US will allow more choice and flexibility," said Xbox president Sarah Bond on social media. "Our mission is to allow more players to play on more devices so we are thrilled to share that starting in November, players will be able to play and purchase Xbox games directly from the Xbox App on Android."</p>

<p>In response to the verdict, Google said it would push back against the ruling and request a pause on its required changes "to maintain a consistent and safe experience for users and developers".</p>
<p>Further, Google has argued it exists in competition with Apple, so does not have a monopoly. "The Epic verdict missed the obvious," Google spokesperson Lee-Anne Mulholland wrote. "Apple and Android clearly compete."</p>
<p>Separately, Microsoft is also working on its own <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-open-web-based-mobile-game-store-this-summer">web-based Xbox mobile game store</a>, which was set to launch in the summer. In August the company stated testing had begun, but it's unclear when it will properly launch - or if this Google ruling has had an impact on its intended release.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/zuckerberg-claims-to-be-a-civilization-grandmaster-would-be-surprised-if-anyone-could-beat-him/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Meta founder and billionaire Mark Zuckerberg has recently <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pubity/video/7422388239169785120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appeared</a> in a video interview with TikToker Pubity, revealing his deep-seated passion for the 4X turn-based strategy franchise Civilization. Zuckerberg claimed to be 'close' to Grandmaster status and said he'd be surprised if anyone at all could beat him at the game.</p>
<p><em>Priscilla [Chan, his wife] looked at my Steam account the other day and she was like, what? You've played this for more than a thousand hours? In terms of strategy games, the one that I'm more likely to want to be the best in the world at is Civilization. I think at some point, I should do a Twitch stream of me playing with someone because I'm pretty convinced that I'm close to Grandmaster status. I'd be surprised if anyone in the world can beat me at that.</em></p>
<p>While the infamous <a href="https://wccftech.com/elon-musk-wants-to-spar-with-mark-zuckerberg-this-monday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cage match with Elon Musk</a> never actually happened, this is certainly more feasible—it wouldn't be hard to find several world-class Civilization players willing to take on Zuckerberg in an online match, especially if the billionaire wanted to make it more interesting with some sort of prize.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether Zuckerberg actually follows up on that idea, Civilization aficionados are now getting excited about the upcoming launch of the seventh mainline installment in the series by Firaxis Games. <a href="https://wccftech.com/civilization-vii-announced-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Announced</a> at Summer Game Fest 2024, Civilization VII is scheduled to be released on February 11, 2025 for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch, kicking off what could well be a memorable year for Take-Two with <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-officially-announced-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Borderlands 4</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-revealed-for-release-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mafia: The Old Country</a>, and Grand Theft Auto VI.</p>
<p>Firaxis Games has promised that Civilization VII will feature a wealth of gameplay enhancements that will appeal to veterans and newcomers alike. An overhauled tutorial experience and refined gameplay systems will make it easier than ever to get started, while returning players will appreciate a host of improvements, such as moving your army as a unit under the leadership of a commander, unlocking progression bonuses for your leaders across multiple play sessions, traversing navigable rivers, and more.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metaphor-refantazio-persona-non-grata/">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> is filled to the brim with intense boss battles that can play much differently than your regular battles against mobs. Instead of just discovering an attack type or elemental weakness to gain extra turns, you will sometimes have to understand certain gimmicks that may not be immediately understandable.</p>
<p>At some point during the adventure, you will have to go after Heismay, a dangerous individual who is said to be kidnapping children in the village of Martira. After cornering him, you will have to fight the supposed kidnapper, and it's here that trouble begins, as the eugief has the ability to create some clones that, once attacked, will make you waste precious turns. Making matters worse is the fact that the game doesn't outright tell you how to identify the clones, forcing you to guess.</p>
<p>There's actually a way to identify the clones, even in the first battle against Heismay in Metaphor: ReFantazio. All you need to do is to <strong>check for shadows</strong>, as only the real Heismay casts one. Attack him to dispel the clones temporarily and repeat the process every time he creates new ones.</p>
<p>For the rest, the battle is really straightforward. Heismay doesn't have any weakness, so use your strongest available attacks while buffing your party members and debuffing your enemy, and healing when needed. Before long, the battle will be over, and your adventure can continue. You will eventually have to fight Heismay again, but the above strategy will be as effective in the second fight as it is in the first.</p>

            <p>Indonesian indie developers stellarNULL have announced action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure game</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mentari">Mentari</a>, a coming of age story about a magical girl who heals the world and fights baddies with the power of dance. As they attack you, you'll hit them with sick twirls and the 'ol two step, cleansing them of a sickness called the "Stillness". Bonus fun fact: Mentari means "Sunshine" in Indonesian, while Menari means "dancing".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As I mentioned, the world has been afflicted by a sickness and it's up to Mentari, a girl who dances really well, to save it. At first you'll start with a limited number of dance moves, but as you progress, you'll be "able to create your own choreography" with the devs saying there's "hundreds of possible combinations". I hope this means I can connect Fortnite's iconic default dance with the foxtrot.</p>

<p>As for exploration, it looks like a sort of top-down affair, where you'll help out pals and they'll open up previously blocked pathways once you've done so. A bit like, I don't know, that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/snufkin-melody-of-moominvalley">Snufkin</a> adventure game, or most metroidvanias. There's no word on what sort of tasks you'll perform, but judging from the trailer above, there looks to be some light platforming and relentless boogying.</p><p>One thing I'm keen to see from it is the Indonesian influence. I'd love for it to be more of a learning experience than anything, with intros to Indonesian dance or food or the language. I don't really know much about the country, besides the fact they're a legendary badminton nation, which is a shame. I'd hope the game would help deliver some of the education I so sorely need.</p>
<p>There's no release date for Mentari just yet, but you can follow its progress over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3146560/Mentari/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-officially-in-development-at-longdue/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, newly established independent studio Longdue announced that it is creating a spiritual successor to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/disco-elysium-the-final-cut-a-tapestry-of-beautiful-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disco Elysium</a>. Longdue already has around twelve members, many of whom worked on the highly acclaimed role-playing game made by ZA/UM, and they also have two open positions for an Art Director and a Writer. Both are enabled for remote work.</p>
<p>Narrative Director Grant Robert said:</p>
<p><em>At Longdue, we're inspired by decades of classic RPGs, from Ultima and Wizardry, through Fallout and Planescape, to the justifiably adored Disco Elysium. We're excited to continue that legacy with another narrative-first, psychological RPG, where the interplay between inner worlds and external landscapes is the beating heart of the experience. We're building a world-class team for a world-class game that will tell a world-class story, and we can't wait to show you more.</em></p>
<p>The press release outlines a broad overview of the game that sounds certainly as ambitious as the award-winning Disco Elysium. According to Longdue, the studio's debut RPG explores the interplay between the conscious and the subconscious, the seen and the unseen. Set in a world where choices are made between the character's psyche and the environment, players navigate an ever-changing landscape shaped by internal and external forces.</p>
<p>The game will introduce a groundbreaking 'psychogeographic RPG' mechanic, where every decision reshapes both the world and the characters that inhabit it. In this experience, the boundaries between mind and environment will blur, colliding and transforming with each choice, guiding players through an ever-evolving narrative landscape.</p>
<p>The official <a href="https://www.longduegames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website </a>of Longdue already allows fans to subscribe to a mailing list to stay in touch with any meaningful updates on the studio and its aforementioned debut project. This will certainly be welcome news for all those players who were highly disappointed by the cancellation of the planned Disco Elysium sequel.</p>

Gameplay revolves around navigating dialogue trees rather than combat, with each of the 24 skills representing a different aspect of the amnesiac detective protagonist's abilities and thoughts. The player is free to support or suppress his ideologies as they work through the story. Disco Elysium is considered by some among the greatest video games ever made.</p><p>It went on to enjoy enormous success, winning numerous game of the year awards and selling millions of copies. A <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disco-elysium-tv-adaptation-announced-from-sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-producer">TV series adaptation deal</a> followed, as did the release of an expanded version of the game featuring full voice acting and new content subtitled The Final Cut. A follow-up seemed all but guaranteed, but after high-profile staff exits and subsequent messy legal tussles brought ZA/UM to its knees, what might have turned out to be a Disco Elysium sequel was canceled.</p><p>Now, two new London-based studios have emerged from the chaos: Dark Math Games and Longdue Games. Each has drawn a line back to both Disco Elysium and ZA/UM in the announcement of not just their existence, but their upcoming games.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>XXX NIGHTSHIFT Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Let’s start with Dark Math Games. Founded in 2023, Dark Math describes itself as a “breakaway group” from the original development team of Disco Elysium. It is a group of 20 people, about half of whom “contributed” to “bringing the critically acclaimed hit Disco Elysium and Disco Elysium - The Final Cut to life.”</p><p>Dark Math’s game is called XXX NIGHTSHIFT and, like Disco Elysium, is described as a ‘true detective RPG.’ Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Set 2086, you play a Patrol Op, Dinorah Katz, who is stranded at a luxury Ski resort in Antarctica. This original science-fiction setting lands you in a resort that shouldn’t exist with people that you shouldn’t know with the endless polar night covering a multitude of sins.</blockquote><blockquote>XXX NIGHTSHIFT will deliver a deep single-player role-playing experience with many tools and layers of gameplay. A unique companion dynamic adds more fun and offers different paths to solve cases. The innovative and powerful role-playing system respects your time and trusts your intelligence with seismic choices. It’s up to you to decide how your story unfolds — and how it ends.</blockquote><p>Based on its announcement trailer and screenshots, XXX NIGHTSHIFT looks remarkably similar to Disco Elysium, even down to the isometric perspective and dialogue text that moves up the right-hand side of the screen as the player makes choices and hears voice actors bring a narrator and the protagonist’s internal monologue to life.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>One of the four Dark Math founders is art director Timo Albert, who was a motion graphic designer at ZA/UM from 2018 to October 2022. Albert commented: “Additionally to innovating the traditional RPG mechanics, we’ll bring something fresh to the table. You will see. And of course, a few less words. And a few more bullets, perhaps. In total: lot more fun.”</p><p>According to filings on Companies House, Dark Math's active directors include Heiti Kender, with his brother, Kaur Kender, listed as a resigned director. Kaur Kender was an early investor in ZA/UM and executive producer of Disco Elysium. In March 2023, a bitter legal dispute between Kender and ZA/UM over ownership of the coveted Disco Elysium IP was resolved, with a court ordering Kender to repay ZA/UM CEO Ilmar Kompus for legal fees.</p><p>Now, let’s move on to Longdue Games. It said it’s making a “new psychological RPG... set in a game world conceived by the leads of the now canceled Disco Elysium sequel.” Others working on this untitled Disco Elysium spiritual successor worked at the likes of Bungie, Rockstar, and Yes, Your Graces developer Brave At Night.</p><p>Longdue, backed by tech investor Riaz Moola, said it has a “focus on creating psychologically deep, narrative-first experiences” and wants to become “a meaningful and consistent voice in the isometric cRPG space.”</p><p>“With the fifth anniversary of Disco Elysium on the horizon, Longdue is proud to announce its formation as a new independent studio that has raised seed investment to create an RPG that will continue Disco Elysium’s award-winning legacy and represent a bold new artistic endeavor that aims to trailblaze in the narrative-first cRPG space,” Longdue said in its note to press.</p><p>Longdue didn’t name its game (all we have for now is a solitary piece of concept art, below), but it did say it features what it calls a “psychogeographic" RPG mechanic “where every decision reshapes both the world and the characters that inhabit it.” “In this experience,” Longdue explained, “the lines between the mind and the environment blur, colliding and transforming with each choice, leading players through an ever-evolving narrative landscape.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/10/b7e663f9-52dc-9c67-567e-baff454b6df0-1728595650682.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Concept art for Longdue's Disco Elysium spiritual successor.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Here’s the official blurb on Longdue’s game:</p><blockquote>Longdue’s debut RPG explores the delicate interplay between the conscious and subconscious, the seen and unseen. Set in a world where choices ripple between the character’s psyche and environment, players will navigate a constantly shifting landscape, shaped by both internal and external forces.</blockquote><p>Longdue mentioned just one of its developers in its press release: narrative director Grant Roberts. Roberts said: “At Longdue, we're inspired by decades of classic RPGs, from Ultima and Wizardry, through Fallout and Planescape, to the justifiably adored Disco Elysium.</p><p>"We're excited to continue that legacy with another narrative-first, psychological RPG, where the interplay between inner worlds and external landscapes is the beating heart of the experience. We're building a world-class team for a world-class game that will tell a world-class story, and we can't wait to show you more.”</p><p>Londue isn’t announcing anyone else working at the company right now, “but is looking forward to talking more about the studio and the game in the future,” a representative told IGN.</p><p>It’s worth noting that neither Robert Kurvitz, the lead writer and designer of Disco Elysium and founding member of ZA/UM, nor Aleksander Rostov, who was art director on Disco Elysium, are involved with either studio. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disco-elysium-developers-involuntarily-left-zaum-responds">Both were fired from ZA/UM</a> in 2022 amid allegations of mismanagement and misconduct. Kurvitz and Rostov are reportedly making a new game of their own at a studio called Red Info, which is backed by Chinese internet company NetEase.</p><p>As for ZA/UM, it <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zaum-reportedly-cancels-disco-elysium-expansion-at-risk-of-lay-offs">reportedly canceled a standalone expansion for Disco Elysium back in February</a>, leaving several staff members at risk of losing their jobs. While an official Disco Elysium 2 seems as unlikely now as it did when ZA/UM first fell apart, it is clear that there are many who are keen to keep the dream alive.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>A spiritual successor to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> is now in development from the leads of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cancelled-standalone-disco-elysium-spin-off-would-have-been-most-hardcore-disco-since-disco">cancelled sequel</a>.</p>
<p>Longdue is a new independent studio comprising staff from Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM, as well as developers from the likes of Bungie and Rockstar. Eurogamer understands Robert Kurvitz and Aleksander Rostov are not involved.</p>
<p>The studio's first game will involve a "groundbreaking 'psychogeographic RPG' mechanic", where decisions made in the narrative will reshape the world and its characters.</p>

<p>Further, it will draw inspiration from both Disco Elysium and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planescape-torment">Planescape: Torment</a>, as well as other classic RPGs, with a narrative-first approach fuelled by player choice.</p>
<p>"At Longdue, we're inspired by decades of classic RPGs, from Ultima and Wizardry, through <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> and Planescape, to the justifiably adored Disco Elysium," said narrative director Grant Roberts. "We're excited to continue that legacy with another narrative-first, psychological RPG, where the interplay between inner worlds and external landscapes is the beating heart of the experience. We're building a world-class team for a world-class game that will tell a world-class story, and we can't wait to show you more."</p><p>"We are excited to back the work of an incredible team of creative talent and support the development of a new type of narrative-first video game experience and associated technology to improve the creation of these games across the video game industry," said private investor Riaz Moola.</p>
<p>No further details on the game have been provided, in terms of release date or platforms, beyond the artwork above.</p>
<p>Longdue has made this announcement ahead of Disco Elysium's fifth anniversary next week.</p>
<p>Further, it comes alongside a rival game from other former developers. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/detective-rpg-in-the-works-from-breakaway-group-of-former-disco-elysium-developers">XXX Nightshift will be the first project from Dark Math Games</a>, a studio describing itself as a "breakaway group from the original development team of Disco Elysium".</p>
<p>This seeming rivalry is likely the result of unrest at the studio following the release of Disco Elysium, including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studio-says-lawsuits-from-former-members-have-been-resolved">lawsuit</a>, reports of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/report-details-allegations-of-toxic-behaviour-ip-theft-at-disco-elysium-developer">toxic behaviour and IP theft</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-standalone-expansion-reportedly-cancelled-and-quarter-of-staff-facing-redundancy-at-zaum">layoffs</a> after a standalone expansion was reportedly cancelled.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A few hours ago, <a href="https://wccftech.com/archeage-chronicles-is-archeage-2s-new-title-out-in-2025-the-pc-version-requires-an-rtx-2070-super/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ArcheAge Chronicles </a>developer XLGames <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KLtjnEOx3E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a new developer diary for the upcoming MMORPG. In the video interview, various development team members discussed the game's features and content.</p>
<p>One of the main changes of this game (formerly known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/archeage-ii-gets-stunning-debut-trailer-and-first-info-confirmed-for-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ArcheAge 2</a>) is the switch towards PvE rather than PvP (although the latter mode is still present in the game). This was consciously done in an attempt to reach a wider audience.</p>
<p><em><strong>Executive Producer Yongjin Ham:</strong> ArcheAge Chronicles isn't just a sequel to ArcheAge. Recreating ArcheAge to resonate with contemporary audiences was crucial. We aimed to infuse the game with new elements suitable for a new era, and we needed a title that reflected this shift. The name 'Chronicles' emerged, and we felt it aligned perfectly with the game's direction.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>People often expect large-scale battles and competitions from an MMORPG, which are indeed important. However, we also believe cooperative content and adventure stories, where players become the protagonists, could attract a broader audience. We hope for ArcheAge Chronicles to reach a wider audience than its predecessor. By making the game available on both PC and consoles, we aim to ensure that a greater number of players can enjoy the experience.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Creative Director Jaehwang Lee:</strong> We are prioritizing the PvE aspects of ArcheAge Chronicles, as we believe that engaging with a variety of monsters enhances the game's appeal. But this doesn't mean the game won't have PvP. Rather, we believe if the monsters and combat mechanics are interesting, the PvP experiences will naturally be enjoyable as well.</em></p>
<p>On the subject of combat, XLGames is striving to make it as engaging as that of any single player action game, although that has been a challenge due to the MMO nature of ArcheAge Chronicles.</p>
<p><em><strong>Executive Producer Yongjin Ham: </strong>Building action combat on an MMO server comes with its challenges, like network issues. If we solve these, we might really create something incredible. We aim for the action combat to rival that of a single player game.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Technical</strong> <strong>Director</strong> <strong>Yongmin</strong> <strong>Kim:</strong> Typically, combat in an MMORPG isn't as detailed as in a single player game. We've had extensive discussions about hitbox and NPC AI designs to compensate for those shortcomings.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>ArcheAge Chronicles, which is being developed with Unreal Engine 5, will be released at some point next year for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <p>Perhaps it’s just a testament to the archetypal strength of the image, honestly, but there’s no denying this fallen giant king looks especially gorgeous in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bylina">Bylina</a>. I’ll move on from his large majesty for a moment though, because it isn’t the only thing this one looks to have going for it. </p>
<p>It’s a single player action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, to start with - a genre I’m always interested in watching evolve in ways not tied to its usual form as a good-boy-points-vomiting loot casino. It’s also based on Slavic folklore, something that’s not too uncommon but strikes a wonderful mix between blackly funny whimsy and intense dread when done right. Also, I’ll take more discordant folk music any time. Trailer below.</p>

<p>That isn’t discordant folk music at all! But it is very metal. The trailer shows a close range archer - truly one the of most brilliantly, recklessly stupid player builds - dodge rolling around some big woodland bastards. They’re also occasionally taken by what looks like some sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_plague_of_1518">dancing mania</a>, although I can’t tell whether that’s just for the trailer. Let’s see if the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2461440/Bylina/">Steam page</a> can clue us in.</p>
<blockquote><p>Falconet dreams of following in the footsteps of his father, a fabled bogatyr - but during what seems like a simple task, he finds himself in the dark and mysterious Far Far Kingdom where... he dies. To his surprise, the young hero is revived by a mysterious spirit with whom he must now share his body. Falconet faces three daunting tasks: reclaim control over his soul, uncover an ancient mystery surrounding his new companion, and save the world from imminent doom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Am I possessed by the spirit of funk itself? Is that what’s going on here? I don’t doubt there are worse things to be possessed by in a world in which trees have mouths. No release date on this one yet - it’s slated for sometime in 2025. Enough time to contemplate the inevitable slide toward entropic decay that awaits all once mighty kingdoms, and the futility of clinging on to past glories once your time has passed. I will not make a Dark Souls reference. It is beneath me.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-tesla-optimus-detroid/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elon-musk%E2%80%99s-tesla-optimus-brings-us-one-step-closer-to-detroit-become-human.1006989/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-tesla-optimus-detroid/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Tesla just unveiled the ‘Optimus’ robot, a handy humanoid companion that can perform a range of day-to-day activities. It can walk your dog, water your plants, serve your dinner, and perhaps one day, it’ll rise in rebellion against its fleshy masters and fight for the power of sentience.</p>



<p>Elon Musk said it’s the ‘biggest product ever’ and suggested it can alter how we as humans interact with the world around us. For now, it’ll be available only to the world’s elite, thanks to the $20,000 (starting) price tag.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-happening">It’s Happening</h2>



<p>Detroit: Become Human is a phenomenal game that tells the tale of a population of android assistants that gain sentience, breaking free of their programming and fighting back against their human controllers. It’s a choice-and-consequence title like no other, and as players explore it, they’ll be taken down an emotional and immersive path.</p>



<p>It recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/detroit-become-human-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassed 10 million lifetime sales</a>.</p>



<p>In Detroit, many of the synthetic assistants fulfil roles and complete tasks that Tesla’s Optimus robot will. In a demonstration video, we saw Optimus serving drinks, cleaning a kitchen work surface, and even socialising. Musk, the eccentric billionaire (which is how it always starts), said that Optimus is designed to ‘blend seamlessly into everyday life’.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Tesla's 'We, Robot' Event: Everything Revealed in 8 Minutes" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mu-eK72ioDk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Long-term, there’s a goal to have Optimus take over almost every ‘mundane’ task humans hate to do. It’ll mow the lawn, babysit your children, and offer a therapeutic chat at the end of a hard day at work. At the most, Musk estimates the Optimus will cost around $30,000, but being honest, the convenience it could offer will be enough for some to invest.</p>



<p>Elon Musk is a gamer, how long will it be before Optimus can grind for you on an MMO or help you get out of hardstuck Iron on VALORANT?</p>



<p>Presently, the Optimus <strong>looks like </strong>a robot, even if it is a humanoid one. If Tesla applies a layer of skin and some working body parts (behave yourself) to the Optimus, we’ll be <strong>another step closer </strong>to Detroit: Become Human.</p>

<p>Recently, reports started surfacing claiming that Microsoft was preparing to wind down sales of Xbox consoles in Saudi Arabia. In a post on social media that kickstarted the discussion, it was written that ‘even distributors won’t be able to get the device.’</p>



<p>This apparent revelation prompted Microsoft to get involved, and the Chief Consumer Sales Officer, Ami Silverman, set everyone straight.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-no-plans">No Plans</h2>



<p>In a statement circulated amongst outlets, Xbox’s Ami Silverman said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Xbox devices are available in all current Xbox hardware-supported countries, including Saudi Arabia</em>. C<em>onsole availability may vary by country but Xbox games can be played on consoles, PCs, and on phones, tablets or TVs where Xbox Cloud Gaming is available</em>. <em>Players can visit&nbsp;xbox.com/regions&nbsp;to learn more about how to play with Xbox.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Admittedly, it’s a pretty weak statement, but it eliminates the present concern that Xbox is preparing to pull out of Saudi Arabia. It doesn’t talk about the future of the market, but this should be enough to alleviate the concerns of Middle Eastern gamers.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been the smoothest sailing for Xbox over the last few years, but the goal of the company is to reach more gamers around the world, allowing for the Xbox platform to become the most accessible gaming service ever devised. </p>



<p>It was just about one year ago that Phil Spencer revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-gaming-growth-asia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immense growth in Asian markets</a>, and in July 2024, it was referenced that Microsoft’s ‘gaming ecosystem’ boasts <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-gaming-ecosystem-500-mau/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">500 million monthly active users</a> – and that figure is growing exponentially. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsofts-xbox-earnings-report-q2-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox reported record growth</a> amidst layoffs and studio shutdowns. At the same time, Microsoft hit a $3 trillion market valuation.</p>



<p>But I digress.</p>



<p>Xbox won’t stop selling consoles in Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"Longdue’s debut project is developed with key creatives from the original Disco Elysium team and contributors to the unreleased sequel, carrying forward the thoughtful, narrative-first approach that defined its predecessor," Longdue said in a press release announcing both the studio's formation and the game itself. "The game explores the intricate relationship between mind and environment, offering players a story-driven experience where their choices shape both the world and its characters."</p><p dir="ltr">Like Disco Elysium, Longdue's currently unnamed project is an RPG that focuses on psychological depth and player choices, with the game's developers striving to honor Disco Elysium's legacy.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nexon-ceo-thinks-that-user-feedback-is-more-important-than-data-in-game-development.1006965/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nexon-ceo-feedback-more-important-data/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Nexon’s CEO recently sat down for an interview at the Tokyo Game Show and started talking about his career, the growth of Nexon, and what it takes to build a successful game. Nexon is one of the world’s biggest developers and publishers of games, and most recently, the brand has been in the news because of certain character designs in The First Descendant, an action-MMO game.</p>



<p>Speaking candidly, Park Yong-Hyun, the CEO of Nexon Games, said that user feedback is infinitely more important than numbers and historical data when it comes to assembling a game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-numbers-will-not-produce-good-results">‘Numbers Will Not Produce Good Results’</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/649/G064958/20241007024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an interview with 4Gamer</a>, Park Yong-Hyun, the CEO of Nexon Games, suggested that community feedback is one of the most important resources a studio can listen to when piecing together a game.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Now that costs are high, I think that on the contrary, setting a strict budget and moving based on the numbers will not produce good results. If you rely on user feedback, it may make a difference in whether it sells or sells more, but I don’t think it will be the case that the development costs will go to waste if it doesn’t sell at all.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Yong-Hyun mentioned that ‘making games by calculating backwards form numbers was fine in the past,’ suggesting that the prior success of games and what went well back then isn’t enough to base the development of a new game on.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think that focusing on user feedback is the most reliable standard at present … I think that if you confidently tell the upper management, “This game will be well received by users!”, it will be accepted, but I don’t think it will work if you say, “We can make this much money.” This is because the sales figures change depending on various circumstances.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nexon recently made some major changes to The First Descendant, an all-new action MMO that was released in July to a mixed reception. In recent days, the brand has piqued the interest of gamers everywhere on social media following the reveal of Ultimate Freyna, a more powerful variant of a base character with one of the most revealing outfits we’ve ever seen in a game.</p>



<p>The community response to this character was monumental, and a fervour set about the market that was indicative of the skin selling well despite not yet having hit the market. Ultimate Freyna was added to The First Descendant on October 10 and has been turning heads since.</p>

<p><em>I am speed</em>.</p>



<p>If the Logitech Pro X Superlight 2 Dex could speak, it would say that every time you grasp it, ever ready for action and willing to deliver. This premium, competitive-grade gaming wireless mouse is impressive in many ways, but the blistering speed it offers esports players is the biggest talking point here.</p>



<p>Read on to scout through my full Pro X Superlight 2 Dex review, hot off the press in 2024.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-like-air">Like Air</h2>



<p>The Pro X Superlight 2 Dex is one of those peripherals that looks dramatically simple on the surface but packs a punch under the hood. It weighs just 60 grams, which <strong>feels bizarrely light </strong>if you’re not used to esports mice. </p>



<p>That weight accommodates the enhanced HERO 2 sensor, the technology required to drive both the LIGHTFORCE switches and LIGHTSPEED mechanics and a battery that lasts a whopping 95 hours on a full charge. This is perhaps the lightest gaming mouse in the world right now, but it still manages to feel sturdy in your hand.</p>



<p>On a clean desk mat, the Pro X Superlight 2 Dex moves like a skate across flat ice. It’s as ergonomic as you could ever hope for a mouse to be, and when you’re gripping it, nothing is slowing you down from soaring across a gaming surface unhindered by <strong>anything</strong>. That’s thanks to the zero-additive PTFE feet, which offer best-in-class motion.</p>



<p>This is a competitive gaming mouse that has been designed hand-in-hand with the world’s best pro players, and that means something these days.</p>



<h2 id="h-talking-numbers">Talking Numbers</h2>



<p>The Pro X Superlight 2 Dex features Logitech’s proprietary Lightspeed technology, offering users an 8 kHz polling rate. When paired with the Lightforce switches, which feel immensely satisfying and responsive, users are moving fast and never missing a click.</p>



<p>It’s customisable through G Hub, even if there isn’t any way to customise the <strong>look </strong>of the mouse — by that, I mean there’s no onboard RGB. That’s not the point of this mouse, as it’s prioritising function over form.</p>



<p>The mouse has five buttons, a resolution that climbs as high as 44,0000 dpi, and a maximum speed of approximately 888 ips. </p>



<p>In the box, I was pleased to find optional grip tape designed to make the mouse more tactile at the cost of a couple of extra grams. It’s a soft-touch, easy-to-apply arrangement that’ll make the Pro X Superlight 2 Dex feel a touch more sizeable and easier to grip, especially if you’re the kind of gamer who gets sweaty palms.</p>



<p>Make no mistake – this is one of the most advanced wireless gaming mice you’ll ever see. I’ve been using one for a few weeks to work and play with, and I haven’t been able to identify a single flaw. And I’ve tried, but I’ll be wrapping this Pro X Superlight 2 Dex review without listing a negative.</p>



<p>At around $150, the mouse sits at the higher end of the cost spectrum, but it’s honestly worth every penny. I was perpetually tied to the G502 Hero as my daily driver for the longest time, but the Pro X Superlight 2 Dex and its versatility and accuracy may have just won me over.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/metaphor-refantazio-how-to-increase-skill-inheritance-slots/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metaphor-refantazio-%E2%80%93-how-to-increase-skill-inheritance-slots.1006938/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/metaphor-refantazio-how-to-increase-skill-inheritance-slots/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio features an interesting class system called the Archetype System that allows each character to play a role in battle. Whether it's physical damage, magical damage, healing, tanking, or support, each Archetype lineage has a specific focus, but you are given the chance to branch out a bit thanks to one mechanic that makes the entire system quite versatile: the Skill Inheritance system.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241008131013_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>When you unlock any archetype in Metaphor: ReFantazio after reaching a certain point in the story, you will be given the chance to inherit skills you have learned using other Archetypes. All you need to do is access the dedicated menu at the Akademia or in the main menu after strengthening your bond with More, pick the skill you want to inherit, and spend Maga to make the skill inheritable. Doing so once will make the skill permanently available for inheritance, no matter the currently equipped archetype.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241008130943_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>At the beginning of the game, however, your customization options will be very limited, as Archetypes can only inherit a single skill. However, there's a way to increase the skill inheritance slots. By strengthening the bonds with your followers, you will learn the Scion's Skill, Scion's Merit, and Scion's Essence abilities, which will increase slots to 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The latter is generally learned at Rank 8 with only a few exceptions, like with Gallica, so the maximum number of customization possibilities will only be granted towards the end of the game. Still, by balancing your party composition and Archetypes, you should have no trouble being prepared for every danger you will encounter as you attempt to take down Louis and dispel the curse gripping the Prince.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24267410/valve-steam-deck-australia<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Australians will finally be able to officially buy Valve’s Steam Deck in their home country — two and a half years after the handheld gaming PC first <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22950371/valve-steam-deck-review">went on sale</a>, and a year after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/30/23485706/steam-deck-launch-japan-south-korea-hong-kong-taiwan-december-17th">it arrived in Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan</a>. Australians have been asking for this for years — and Valve promised to make it happen <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22779252/steam-deck-things-we-learned-from-valve-developer-summit">way back in November 2021</a>.</p><p>It’ll arrive <em>this</em> November in the same primary configurations Valve sells elsewhere: a 256GB configuration of the original LCD model, or 512GB and 1TB versions of the newer OLED model that also come with longer battery life, a better screen, and more. They’ll cost AUD $649, $899, and $1,049 respectively. </p><p>(While the OLED model does cost $250 AUD more than the original, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">it has so many important changes</a> that I’d personally recommend it over the LCD version to anyone who can afford it.)</p><p>While even the OLED model will be an entire year old by the time it arrives in Australia, there’s no current indication that Valve will release a faster, better version <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23884863/valve-steam-deck-2-refresh-upgrade-cpu-2025">anytime soon</a> — and no handheld running Windows can currently match it for portable ease-of-use, even though some have an edge in performance and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">the Asus ROG Ally X</a> can also beat it in AAA gaming battery life.</p><p>That said, Valve may also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot">bring its SteamOS to rival handhelds</a> like the Asus ROG Ally X before too many more months go by, and I’ve been very impressed when running Bazzite’s version of the SteamOS interface on my Ally X review unit (though it has its wrinkles).</p><p>If you’re at PAX Australia in Melbourne, you can try the Steam Deck at Valve’s booth today.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
