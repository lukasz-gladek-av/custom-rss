<figure></figure>

<p>The Doro C300 Pro Ergonomic chair is ideal for users who greatly value a tailored and advanced adjustment system and offers features that make it truly stand out. We will take a quick look at some of its key features below, and you can also <a href="http://cutt.ly/ceNhnzsD" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">head over to the official store</a> for more detailed info.</p>
<h3>Self-adaptive Lumbar Support</h3>
<p>The Sihoo Doro C300 Pro comes with a Body Movement Tracking system that provides automatic lumbar support adjustment as you move or change positions so that it aligns perfectly with your spine without constantly having to make adjustments manually. This seamless comfort helps reduce the chances of feeling fatigued due to the consistent lower back support.</p>
<h3>Bigger Waterfall-Shaped Cushion with Seat Depth Adjustment<strong><br>
</strong></h3>
<p>The large waterfall-shaped cushion the chair is packed with helps users feel more comfortable, especially during longer sittings, due to the pressure it relieves from the thighs and improves overall circulation. The seat depth adjustment allows users to personalize their sitting experience by adjusting it to their body size and leg length, which also aids in maintaining proper posture.</p>
<h3>Complete Control in One Handle</h3>
<p>The Sihoo Doro C300 Pro comes with enhanced functionality as the operations can be controlled through one handle only, which is placed on the right-hand side of the chair. Real-life adjustments can give users a seamless experience through an interrupted workflow by effortlessly adapting to various needs. Providing a generous maximum recline angle of 135°, the Sihoo Doro C300 Pro enables you to relax in a more comfortable position when you require a brief break from your work.</p>
<h3>Flexible Seat Back-Contouring to Your Back</h3>
<p>The Sihoo Doro C300 Pro additionally comes with a flexible seat back that can automatically adapt to your spine for a more personalized sitting experience and also for more optimized ergonomic support. The design mimics the natural alignment of the spine, allowing for better posture and reduced pressure on the back.</p>
<p>Other than that, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CW1JKB4F?maas=maas_adg_1E9B97949F4826369505D" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">C300 Pro</a> comes with a 6D coordinated armrest, uses a breathable mesh fabric, and adheres to the quality standards by the regulations, including the BIFMA and SGS certifications.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Sihoo Doro C300 Ergonomic Office Chair</h2>
<p>Sihoo Doro C300 is the company's selling product, and if you look at the design, you will find the Doro C300 and the Doro C300 Pro chair to be almost identical, with minor differences only. The product is well received by users, especially those who seek good value for money. Some users who have shared their experience with the chair even went ahead and painted the Pro model as merely a refreshed version rather than offering some major Pro model upgrades. The Doro C300 is perfect for users who are looking for a chair that provides all-day support and helps with chronic back pain with effective lumbar support.</p>
<p>The listed price of the Doro C300 Ergonomic Chair on the<a href="https://sihoooffice.com/products/sihoo-doro-c300-ergonomic-office-chair" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener"> official website</a> is<b> $399.99</b> for the black model, but the promotional offer brings the price to only<b> $239.99</b>. Similarly, the white version's original price is <b>$409.99, </b>but with the ongoing promotion, it can be purchased for only <b>$249.99</b>. Just like with the Pro model, the Doro C300 chair's Christmas and New Year Special is available for only a limited time, so for users who have been wanting to upgrade, now is the time.</p>
<p>Similar to the C300 Pro model, the C300 offers self-adaptive lumbar support that automatically adapts itself according to the natural contour of your spine, allowing for continuous support and more comfort by reducing the strain on the back. Other features that make the model stand out include:</p>
<h3>Flexible Backrest</h3>
<p>The Sihoo Doro C300 has a streamlined design that supports movement, especially upper body support. Its triangular frame design ensures a continuous flexible backrest with a supportive structure.</p>
<h3>Wide Multi-Adjustable Headrest</h3>
<p>The Doro C300 chair is perfect for gaming sessions or even work that requires long sitting. It is equipped with a 3D mechanical headrest that provides support for your head and neck and reduces tension in the neck and shoulder that can be caused by extended use.</p>
<h3>Adaptable Mechanism and Comfortable Reclining</h3>
<p>The Sihoo Doro C300 comes with an advanced, adaptable mechanism and a comfortable reclining mechanism that can help tailor the seating experience according to users' preferences. The tilt angles are varied and can go up to 130 degrees for dynamic lumbar support.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers a 4D directional armrest with varied adjustment options, allowing you to comfortably rest your arms in different positions, whether at work or even when playing a game. The Doro C300 ensures comfort with its waterfall-shaped seat, which offers extensive seating support by optimally distributing the weight.</p>

It's unclear how many people the studio employed at the time of its closure.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Vancouver-based studio was established in 2006 by former Radical Entertainment staffers Steve Bocska, James Ceraldi and Joel DeYoung. Initially, Hothead focused on developing and publishing digital console and PC titles, but eventually pivoted to focus on creating free-to-play mobile games (with mixed results).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We threw all kinds of small, inexpensive games at the wall to see what stuck.&nbsp; Surprise surprise, surprise nothing stuck," wrote Wilkinson, looking back on that period.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"So, we went back to our roots and created sports games under the Big Win brand and shooting games under the Rivals at War (RAW) brand and eventually the Kill Shot brand.&nbsp;These series of games were very successful–we finally discovered lightning in a bottle.&nbsp;Those were the most successful years for Hothead."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over the past year, Hothead had been working on a playable prototype for a triple-A project. Wilkinson said the studio hoped to secure contracts with different publishers so it could develop mobile, PC, and console versions of the game, but explained that process took longer than expected.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Unfortunately, it took far longer than we expected to secure contracts for these versions of the game," he said. "They were both ready to close two weeks ago and then the mobile publisher pulled out due to a change in strategy. Two weeks later the console publisher also pulled out.&nbsp;At that point our only remaining option was bankruptcy."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Looking back on Hothead's legacy, Wilkinson said it wasn't the games that made the studio-but rather its people. "Hothead was chock full of incredibly, smart, talented, loyal, hardworking but mostly just really nice people.&nbsp;People that had your back at work and outside of work.&nbsp;Many of us made lifelong friends at Hothead," he continued.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We grew up together, we laughed, we cried, we celebrated, we grieved, we found partners, we started families.

We still believe we are destined to work together again and continue to do great things.&nbsp;But even if that doesn’t happen, I am a better person for working at Hothead and I consider myself blessed to have spent 16 years shoulder to shoulder with my fellow Hotheads."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/20/monster-hunter-wilds-pre-launch-update-addresses-open-beta-issues/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Capcom has hosted a pre-launch community update for Monster Hunter Wilds, responding to player feedback from the open beta. The update goes into the changes players can expect when Monster Hunter Wilds launches, including performance targets, weapon balancing, and equipping skills for your gear. The full community update is approximately one hour and 20 minutes long, so there is a summary after the video. Capcom has stated that things mentioned in the video could change in the future, and there are more things the developers are addressing that were not covered.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds - Pre-Launch Community Update" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tWqiYSA-t8E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Monster Hunter Wilds’ performance is the first topic that is touched upon in the video, particularly the Steam version. In the update, one of the big announcements is that the development team may be able to lower the recommended graphics board specs. On the console side the prioritise gameplay will be locked at 30fps while prioritising framerate will lock at 60fps. On the Xbox Series S however, it looks like the framerate will be 30fps.</p>
<p>The gameplay changes coming to Monster Hunter Wilds include making weapon hits feeling more weighty, especially when it comes to finishers and big moves. Friendly fire will also be mitigated further including for upswinging hammer attacks. The Shockproof Jewel will allow players to negate damage reactions too. Pop up camps and fast travel will be available in the full version, so you will not have to slog it all the way to a monster’s location. The rate at which monsters move between different locations will be brought in line with Monster Hunter World. In the Wilds beta, monsters were frequently moving between areas and this was a glitch that has been addressed.</p>
<p>Weapons have been adjusted for the main release as well, with Insect Glaive, Lance, Switch Axe and Sword &amp; Shield being the ones that players will notice most of the changes for. For the Insect Glaive the Vaulting Dance move will be back, increasing the power of aerial attacks. The Lance will be getting a a Charge Counter, which was previously Counter Thrust. Counter attacks can also be chosen for the Lance. The Switch Axe will be easier to use in the full release too by making it simpler to perform some of the weapon’s moves like Counter Rising Slash. For Sword and Shield the Rising Slash will be usable while guarding, and responsiveness of moves like Perfect Rush has been improved too.</p>

<p>There will be a change to how skills are equipped in Monster Hunter Wilds too. Previously, skills were only equipped to armour but in Wilds, skills will be available for weapons as well. Attack and Guard skills will be equipped to weapons, while other skills like speed eating will be for armour. Upgrading weapons will also provide the chance for skills to upgrade, more skill slots to be unlocked, or a combination of the two.</p>
<p>Another open beta for Monster Hunter Wilds is being considered, but it would be more for players who did not get to play it the first time, and there would likely only be a couple of additional options added. The changes that were discussed in the update would also not be likely to feature in another open beta, if one was to go ahead. Monster Hunter Wilds is set for 28th February 2025, and it is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft has quietly released a new game based on its Captain Laserhawk animated series, which features beloved mascot Rayman and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFTs</a>.</p>
<p>Captain Laserhawk: The G.A.M.E., as spotted by Game File's Stephen Totilo (via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/500114/ubisoft-nft-game-captain-laserhawk-game-file">Polygon</a>), is a PC top-down multiplayer shooter that uses cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Though it's technically in early access, Totilo described it as "the most basic top-down shooter imaginable".</p>
<p>Players require an NFT Niji Warrior ID card to play, which itself requires a crypto wallet to purchase (the NFT costs $25.63).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-wild-far-cry-blood-dragon-anime-captain-laserhawk-welcomes-rayman-in-new-trailer">Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix</a> was created by Ubisoft for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> and released last year. It's based on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-3-review">Far Cry 3</a> spin-off Blood Dragon and features multiple characters from across Ubisoft's games, including Rayman.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://edenonline.ubisoft.com/faq">FAQ</a> for this game based on the series, it's a "transmedia gaming adventure where the community drives the narrative through innovative governance".</p>
<p>It continues: "Eden Online is the layer which gives power to the community when it comes to decision making for the game updates each season.</p>
<p>"Eligibility to play the game in early access will be reflected by ownership of a Citizen ID Card. Eden Online has a limited capacity of 10,000 seats for citizenship."</p>
<p>Once an ID has been purchased, which Totilo stated is a convoluted process, it's customised with a cartoon headshot and further details to make it unique. Then, as a <a href="https://medium.com/@UBISOFT-CAPTAIN-LASERHAWK/the-niji-warrior-id-your-gateway-to-elite-gaming-privileges-in-captain-laserhawk-6fff29b24f23">Medium post</a> on the game reads, your "Niji Warrior NFT is dynamic", meaning it "evolves by capturing your in-game accomplishments, growing in uniqueness and value, and showcasing your dedication and skill".</p>
<p>You can then sell your ID as an NFT, though it's unclear why anyone would wish to.</p>
<p>Rayman, meanwhile, features as the announcer of the game's deathmatches.</p>
<p>Back in 2021, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-quartz-is-an-energy-efficient-nft-platform-for-aaa-games">Ubisoft announced Quartz</a>, its "energy-efficient" NFT platform for AAA games, though it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-appears-to-have-sold-a-grand-total-of-15-nfts">didn't appear to be a success</a>.</p>
<p>Despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-to-continue-with-nft-platform-quartz-despite-criticism">criticism</a>, Ubisoft has ploughed on. Back in October this year it quietly released its first-ever blockchain game,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-launches-first-ever-blockchain-game-with-nfts-costing-up-to-50k"> tactical NFT battler Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles</a> where players purchase NFT figurines to battle using cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Now it's added Captain Laserhawk: The G.A.M.E. to its growing NFT portfolio.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Catly developers SuperAuthenti have released gameplay of its game following allegations that the game used AI for its trailer that was shown during 2024’s The Game Awards.</p>



<p>Despite SuperAuthenti shooting down the allegations repeatedly, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/catly-devs-no-ai-used-in-the-trailer-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the developers seemingly couldn’t escape accusations</a> that the game had used AI and web3 technologies. A PR representative said, “We are very surprised by such speculations. We do not think there are any existing AI tools that can produce a video like that. Industry experts have echoed this opinion.”</p>



<p>The developers have since uploaded gameplay <span>to its&nbsp;</span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2987350/Catly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><span>St</span>eam page</a>, which shows that the game is real and uses Unreal Engine 5.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Catly - Steam Trailer - Unreal Engine 5 - Real-Time In-Game Footage" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4IHx_-Ghf3Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Catly’s game description reads, “An open-world adventure filled with surprises and joy, side by side with Cats! Build your dream island, meet various characters, and enjoy caring for your cats, dressing up, building, farming, racing, skiing, and much more! Explore freely and have endless fun with your furry companions!”</p>



<p>As for whether the original reveal trailer used AI or not remains to be seen, but the recent gameplay trailer release begs the question of why the developers didn’t release it in the first place. After all, there should have been some internal concerns that the original reveal trailer looked somewhat dodgy. </p>



<p>What do you think of Catly’s gameplay video? Have the developers regained trust with its recent trailer? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>A sequel to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> is being considered "positively" but studio Tango Gameworks is "considering various opportunities" before fully committing.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-director-i-want-to-cherish-this-ip">IGN</a>, studio head Colin Mack, Hi-Fi Rush director John Johanas, and Hi-Fi Rush project manager Kazuaki Egashira discussed the future of the franchise.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">Microsoft closed Tango Gameworks</a> it was acquired by Krafton. At the time of the acquisition a sequel to rhythm action game Hi-Fi Rush had begun, but Mack has now clarified the studio is considering its options.</p>

<p>"We are considering a sequel positively," said Mack. "We are not yet at the stage where we can say specifically, 'This is what we're going to do'."</p>
<p>"Many of our staff have a lot of love for [Hi-Fi Rush], so we feel like we have options," added Johanas. "We're currently at the stage of considering various opportunities."</p>
<p>Johanas stated many members of the development team have a "strong attachment" to Hi-Fi Rush, adding: "Not only the game but also the characters and the world are beloved by us, so I want to cherish this IP."</p>
<p>However he believes it's "important to try new things", which is seemingly a philosophy that itself led to the development of Hi-Fi Rush - a clear change in tone for the studio following <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-evil-within">The Evil Within</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, Egashira said creating new experiences is "in the DNA of Tango Gameworks".</p>
<p>"Hi-Fi Rush became popular as a new IP, but if Hi-Fi Rush were to stay the same forever, it would eventually become outdated," he said. "I think Tango Gameworks is about taking on new challenges. I hope to continue to work in a way that puts developers at the centre, without losing our passion."</p>
<p>As previously reported, Krafton head of corporate development Maria Park stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-2-already-in-development-six-months-when-krafton-acquired-tango-gameworks">a build for a Hi-Fi Rush sequel was about six months old</a> ahead of the studio acquisition.</p>
<p>"[Tango] want to make sure [it] surpasses the expectations of the existing fans," said Park. "For instance, some of the feedback about Hi-Fi Rush was that some people felt it was [just] going through factories, so now they want to give a more open world type of experience. I don't think it's going to be completely open world, but a more dynamic environment [that] you play in. Also, having more advanced technology applied to the rhythm action so that it feels more synchronised."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A fourth Sonic the Hedgehog film is on the way, with a spring 2027 release date.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-release-date-2027-1236254778/">Variety</a>, Paramount is currently preparing for a new film as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> releases in cinemas this weekend.</p>
<p>Fans have already been speculating which new characters will be introduced in the post-credits of the third film, who will undoubtedly be the focus of the inevitable fourth film.</p>

<p>The first two Sonic the Hedgehog films have earned a combined global box office total of $725.2m, with the third film expected to top the box office this Christmas season.</p>
<p>Plot details for Sonic the Hedgehog 4 are obviously being kept under wraps for the moment, so it's unclear who from the cast will return.</p>
<p>Jeff Fowler has directed all three Sonic films, with Ben Schwartz as the voice of the titular blue blur and Jim Carrey as antagonist Dr. Robotnik.</p>
<p>The third film introduces Shadow the Hedgehog from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-sa2-dc">Sonic Adventure 2</a> game, voiced here by Keanu Reeves.</p>
<p>"Sega and Paramount more closely align game and film worlds for an authentic Sonic romp with added Keanu cool," I wrote in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film-review">Eurogamer Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film review</a>.</p>
<p>"Sonic 3 is a resounding success and fitting finale to the Year of Shadow. It's quippy and self-aware, balancing broad pop culture appeal with authenticity to its source material, while its flashy action thrills alongside an unbridled sense of cool that's only enhanced by Reeves as Shadow."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/slitterhead-demo-now-available-on-all-platforms/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, Bokeh Game Studio announced the release of a free Slitterhead demo on all platforms. This demo lets players try out the game's first chapter (tutorial included), and its save data will carry over to the full game if they purchase it afterward. On that note, 30% discounts are now available on PlayStation, Steam, and Epic Game Store; there are no discounts for the Xbox version, though.</p>
<p>In addition, the physical PS5 Day 1 Edition, which is distributed in North America by XSEED Games, is now available at a $10 discount off the MSRP of $59.99. It includes a physical copy of the game, a CD with original songs from the game composed by Akira Yamaoka, an art book with over 100 pages of gruesome details, and a sticker sheet, all packaged in a custom outer box.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/unnamed-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>There was a fair amount of anticipation for Slitterhead ahead of its release, mostly because the game has been designed by Keiichiro Toyama, the legendary creator of Silent Hill and Gravity Rush, among other games.</p>
<p>However, the game wasn't received as well as Bokeh Game Studio hoped for. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/slitterhead-three-nights-kowlong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, the game was rated just 6.3 out of 10. Here's what Kai Tatsumoto had to say about his experience with Slitterhead:</p>
<p><em>For Bokeh Game Studio’s inaugural title, Slitterhead is such a strange anomaly to try and recommend over the other horror games that have topped 2024’s list of new releases. Those intimately familiar with Keiichiro Toyama’s general vibes would gladly find some enjoyment in his new studio’s new IP, but it can be tough to recommend for fans who haven’t already been lured in with the premise of a playable Wong War-Kai experience. Slitterhead is an experience that's fantastic in still shots or in story trailers but the actual gameplay becomes a muddled mess when the player is forced into repetitive chase and combat sequences.</em></p>

			<p>Game developer and publisher Maximum Entertainment has announced a new first-person sniper simulation game titled Center Mass: Streets of Ramadi. It was developed in collaboration with Brandon Webb, a former SEAL Sniper course Head Instructor, to achieve a realistic gaming experience. As a SEAL sniper, you'll navigate high-stakes environments, operate lifelike weapon systems, and rely on your skill to complete dynamic, high-stakes objectives under pressure.</p>
<p>Players will have the opportunity to conduct advanced training in long-range shooting in various environmental conditions that influence the elevation and wind compensations. They'll also get to master tactical techniques such as milling, stalking, and creating hides.</p>
<p>They will perform authentic interactions with their sniper rifles, from manual scope adjustments to bolt operation and a full suite of ballistics influenced by weather, distance, and ammunition types.</p>
<p>Center Mass: Streets of Ramadi takes place in the titular city located in the Al-Anbar province of Iraq. Here, players will explore anything from urban enclaves to open farm grounds, with locations inspired by real operations made by the SEAL team. Mission types will include&nbsp;Special Reconnaissance, Area Surveillance, Overwatch, and High-Value Target neutralization.</p>
<p>Maximum Entertainment promises 'endless replayability' thanks to emergent events such as ambushes and IED discoveries. The game also supports an online cooperative mode where players team up with a spotter to communicate, strategize, and control the battlefield. While one player focuses on communications, intel, and firing solution calculations, the other executes high-stakes precision shots with no room for error. Over the course of the game, it will be possible to unlock new weapon systems, attachments, and equipment.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/top-call-of-duty-players-to-watch-in-2025.1066065/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/top-call-of-duty-players-to-watch-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Call of Duty League’s 2025 season is in full flow, and there are plenty of players on the board eager to prove themselves this year. It has been a mixed bag of matches to kickstart the competitive season, and some shockers have been handed out. In the opening weeks of the CDL 2025 season, Atlanta FaZe plummeted to the bottom of the table, sending shockwaves through COD’s community.</p>



<p>In this guide, I’m going to break down the top Call of Duty players to watch in 2025. From the upcoming rookie talent to the future world champions, this list covers everyone worth watching this season.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-mixed-bag">Mixed Bag</h2>



<p>Here are the players you should keep an eye on as the competitive season unfolds.</p>



<h3 id="h-isaiah-gwinn-gwinn">Isaiah ‘Gwinn’ Gwinn</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Gwinn hit the ground running this year with the Carolina Royal Ravens. He served an instrumental role in the team being propelled to the top of the table, securing a perfect record in the opening weeks against some capable squads, including Atlanta FaZe. He was pivotal in handing FaZe the first 0 – 3 loss the team has secured in almost two years.</p>



<p>By mid-December, Gwinn was sitting on a KD of 1.34, leading the pack and standing atop some of the best Call of Duty players in the world.</p>



<h3 id="h-thomas-scrap-ernst">Thomas ‘Scrap’ Ernst</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Scrap’s ascension has been a glorious thing to watch. He started as a loud-mouthed rookie on Toronto Ultra, beefing with anyone who would look in his direction. He eventually mellowed and became much more rounded out as a player, but the Call of Duty League Championship has remained out of reach for him two years in a row.</p>



<p>With a second-place finish in 2023 and a third-place finish in 2024, it’s only a matter of time before this world-class player secures his trophy, and this year, he’s backed by a killer team on LA Thieves.</p>



<h3 id="h-anthony-shotzzy-cuevas-castro">Anthony ‘Shotzzy’ Cuevas-Castro</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s impossible to jot down the most electrifying competitors in COD esports and <strong>not </strong>include Shotzzy. For years, this young pro player has been a superstar of the game, securing two world championships and dominating from every angle. He’s one of the most entertaining players to watch, and many consider him to be godlike on the sticks.</p>



<p>Last year, he secured the world championship with OpTic Texas, and he’s already started strong this season. In Black Ops 6, Shotzzy can make the most of Omnimovement, flying around the map with reckless abandon, and even if he doesn’t go back-to-back at CDL Champs, he’s one of the most hilarious players to watch, period.</p>



<h3 id="h-khalid-khhx-almadhi">Khalid ‘Khhx’ Almadhi</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Khhx is one of the newest players in the Call of Duty League, entering the fray with the Vegas Falcons, an all-new squad backed by a Saudi Arabian investment. Fans wrote off the Vegas Falcons ahead of the competitive season, and a donut hasn’t helped the squad gain much traction, but a standout member of the team is Khalid ‘Khhx’ Almadhi.</p>



<p>At the time of publishing, the Vegas Falcons boasted a 0 – 4 win record and a 14% map win percentage, which is woeful, but Khhx has been working like gangbusters to escape the bottom of the leaderboard.</p>



<p>His debut match against the Royal Ravens was a loss, but it saw him secure a solid opening KD, and per the stats, he went on to hit a 1.28 KD in his second spin, becoming the first player to kickstart his tenure in the CDL with two matches above a 1.2 KD. To open the season, he sat above the likes of Dashy and Pred in terms of overall KD.</p>



<h3 id="h-paco-hydra-rusiewiez">Paco ‘HyDra’ Rusiewiez</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>HyDra has been a phenomenal player year in, year out since debuting with the New York Subliners in 2021. In the Modern Warfare II season, he skyrocketed to success with the squad, securing two Major wins and a world championship victory, along with a smattering of MVP awards.</p>



<p>Last season, he snatched a second-place finish at COD Champs, securing some of the most exhilarating plays in the wider tournament and cementing himself as one to watch for years to come. This year, he’s flying the LA Thieves banner alongside Envoy, Scrap, and Ghosty, which many consider to be one of the greatest potential-filled rosters <strong>ever</strong>.</p>



<p>He has opened the season with a 1.18 overall KD and a perfect record of 4 – 0, at the time of publishing. Few players are more worthy of your time or attention than HyDra.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/naoe-fastest-assassin-ever/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/naoe-will-be-%E2%80%98the-fastest-assassin-we-ever-made%E2%80%99-ubisoft-says.1066056/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/naoe-fastest-assassin-ever/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be released early next year, and already the game has started splitting the community down the middle. Since the title was revealed by Ubisoft earlier this year, it has proven to be a divisive game, and nobody truly knows how to feel about it. It was given a significant pushback by Ubisoft already, as it was supposed to be released in October 2024.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, Ubisoft’s Jonathan Dumont took a deep dive into Naoe, one of the game’s lead characters who fights alongside Yasuke, the first assassin in the series based on someone who <strong>actually existed</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-super-speedy">Super Speedy</h2>



<p>In the interview with Entertainment Weekly, the creative director of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Jonathan Dumont, explained the advantages of Naoe, a ‘shinobi’-style character with insane agility levels:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Naoe’s the fastest Assassin we ever made. She runs super fast, she has a lot of gadgets to keep her stealth so that she doesn’t have to fight often. We wanted to satisfy that for players that come in for that ninja-Assassin game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Assassin’s Creed fans spent years begging for a title to surface set in Japan, but when it was finally revealed, it left many feeling disappointed. Given that Ubisoft was beaten to the punch by the likes of Ghost of Tsushima, a high bar has been set that the current Ubisoft formula might not be able to reach.</p>



<p>The proof will be in the pudding, though.</p>



<p>In 2023, Ubisoft released Assassin’s Creed Mirage, and it was taken in remarkably well by fans because it was a small-form game that was seen as a return to the more classic AC experience. In AC Shadows, it’s back to the gargantuan open-world RPG model.</p>



<p>In Shadows, Naoe’s story is all about self-discovery and the betterment of her character and those close to her. Dumont explored that in the interview with <a href="https://ew.com/assassins-creed-shadows-naoe-backstory-fastest-assassin-we-ever-made-exclusive-8762696" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>She will start a bit of a path of vengeance or fulfilling a promise that she made to her family. As she discovers a world in need, she begins to really value the community values her father taught. Can she make a better world?</p>



<p>The Hidden Blade is given by her father, and we’re going to learn a little bit more what that means.</p>



<p>She does feel like a panther looking at her prey.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows will launch amidst a packed release window on February 14 – are you looking forward to the game? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Speaking with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/dune-prophecy-showrunner-alison-schapker-interview-2024-12&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dune-prophecy-showrunner-alison-schapker-interview-2024-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Business Insider</em></a></span>, she explained how <em>Sisterhood of Dune</em> focused primarily on the time period in which a young Valya Harkonnen comes into control of the sisterhood, while she wanted to show the ripple effect of her decisions in shaping the Sisterhood into the Bene Gesserit.</p><p>“We also wanted to have room to create a rich television series, and see an older Valya, played by Emily Watson, a little more in control — where she took the sisterhood, and then how she was tested as part of a larger exploration of how it went from the Sisterhood to the Bene Gesserit. We wanted to look at the organization over time.”</p><p>The season finale of <em>Dune: Prophecy</em> airs this Sunday, and follows a bombshell episode in which we find out that Sister Francesca (Tabu), mother of Emperor Javicco Corrino’s son Constantine (Josh Heuston), had been unwittingly reinserted into their lives to use her powerful influence to return the Bene Gesserit to a position of power within The Imperium. All that is left is to see who survives for the second season once the Spice has settled. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s not good, it’s pretty obnoxious, and it’s <em>wildly</em> derivative, but more than anything else—despite the actual enormous scale—it feels <em>small</em>.</p><p>Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson is extraordinarily good at doing what he does, no matter how little you may think of what that is. After years of battling against Indian music channel T-Series, Donaldson’s YouTube channel is now not only the most subscribed on the service, but ahead by over 50 million people. It’s  at 337 million subscribers—a number that’s higher than the current population of the United States. His mastery has never been delivering unmissable entertainment, but rather working the algorithm like a savant. The result is an extraordinary combination of ruthless cynicism and widely appealing, unchallenging...stuff. It might be Donaldson and his small group of friends visiting the world’s most expensive hotels, or challenging 100 people to stand inside a red circle, or giving away cars to strangers, but its faux-crude editing disguises meticulous craftmanship that maximizes “engagement.”</p><p>Which is all to say, you can hate him, his videos, his revolting commercialism, the way he tricks children into thinking the solution to large-scale environmental crises is to engage in performative nothingness, his stupid side-parting, whatever—none of it changes the fact that he’s very, very good at it.</p><figure id="" data-id="f2d355cb3fd20a7cf5facaca8c13e29a" data-recommend-id="image://f2d355cb3fd20a7cf5facaca8c13e29a" data-format="jpg" data-width="2328" data-height="1310" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A shot of the players on their podiums from above." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A shot of the players on their podiums from above." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Amazon Prime / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f2d355cb3fd20a7cf5facaca8c13e29a" data-recommend-id="image://f2d355cb3fd20a7cf5facaca8c13e29a" data-format="jpg" data-width="2328" data-height="1310" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A shot of the players on their podiums from above." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Which is what makes <em>Beast Games</em>’ peculiar flatness so bizarre. The formula matches that in a lot of his recent videos, which—ever since the astonishing success of his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/0e3GPea1Tyg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/0e3GPea1Tyg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">permission-free rip-off of <em>Squid Game</em></a></span>—have frequently featured competitive events: “Every Country On Earth Fights For $250,000,” “Survive 100 Days In A Nuclear Bunker, Win $500,000,” “100 Kids Vs 100 Adults For $500,000.” Each is astonishingly brief given the scale and time they take to film, those three running 18, 15, and 17 minutes respectively. It’s merciless, exhausting viewing, designed to capture its audience for the whole run, commercials not interrupting viewing but breathlessly crammed into the relentless footage, like a tennis ball machine rapid-firing images into your face.</p><p><em>Beast Games</em>, on the other hand, feels like a reality TV competition. Not a <em>good</em> reality TV competition. Not something visually beautiful and exquisitely edited, like <em>Survivor</em>, or something that demands the audience get invested in solving a central mystery, like <em>The Mole</em>, but just some events occurring one after another, while Donaldson endlessly shouts about how much money they’re giving away. It looks so oddly cheap, despite the ludicrous expense, like something filmed on a studio’s back lot.</p><p>Oh, and it so blatantly lifts from <em>Squid Game</em> as to just be <em>weird</em>. Sure, the comparison is unavoidable since Netflix remade the Korean drama as a U.S.-made reality show (albeit without murdering its contestants), but why on Earth did Amazon dress up the anonymous stage crew in hooded suits with emblem-blazoned face masks? Why deliberately force that association? Let alone have contestants sleep in rows and rows of bunk beds, all wearing costumes with their number written on their chests and backs. But cheap-looking versions. It’s like trolling, but where <em>Beast Games</em> is the victim of its own troll.</p><figure id="" data-id="4b555b2eb92127784b161f93b998e09e" data-recommend-id="image://4b555b2eb92127784b161f93b998e09e" data-format="jpg" data-width="2345" data-height="1319" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The city built for the show." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The city built for the show." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Amazon Prime / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4b555b2eb92127784b161f93b998e09e" data-recommend-id="image://4b555b2eb92127784b161f93b998e09e" data-format="jpg" data-width="2345" data-height="1319" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The city built for the show." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Like a lot of 2000s game shows in the wake of <em>The Weakest Link</em>, <em>Beast Games</em> relies heavily on forcing people or groups of people into making selfish decisions, here in order to proceed from the starting 1,000, as the numbers are whittled down. And, to be fair, these are often interesting dilemmas. In the first episode, the 1,000 players are stood on 1,000 podiums in a vast studio, and some CG trickery gives the impression there are vast drops between them (it turns out there <em>are</em> big drops between them, as eliminated players fall through trapdoors in their podium that presumably drop them into sponge pits—and there’s no getting away from how incredible it was to watch that happen to a hundred people, falling a split-second after the last). Donaldson then brings out “bribes,” his trademark briefcases filled with $10,000, and if anyone chooses to eliminate themselves from the game in exchange for the sums, their entire row is eliminated too.</p><p>This same formula is then beaten half to death over the first two episodes that were released today, although, again, it can be compelling. Primarily because you get to scream at your TV, “It’s IRRESPONSIBLE not to just take the money!” and then talk among yourselves about how a guaranteed $100,000 now is the correct, perhaps even moral choice, over a one-in-a-thousand chance at $5 million after multiple, unpredictable events, which you already know are more likely to see you eliminated based on someone else’s actions rather than your own failings.</p><p>However, by the second episode’s cliffhanger you will witness gobsmacking stupidity in a vastly larger version of the above. “How can I betray these people I’ve grown to love like family over the last three hours for a paltry life-changing amount of money?” these ridiculous people ponder, when the alternative is...carrying on playing in an attempt to beat them to winning the money so they won’t.</p><p>There are other oddities, like the moment you see a massive Feastables banner in the “city” they built for the event, as if $100,000,000 wasn’t enough money that Donaldson didn’t demand product placement. (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mr-beast-lunchly-lunchable-mold-ksi-rosanna-pansino-1851677305&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mr-beast-lunchly-lunchable-mold-ksi-rosanna-pansino-1851677305">Lunchables are entirely absent</a></span>.) Or indeed the existence of that “city,” a smattering of buildings and some pretend sidewalks and lawns where the contestants spent an entirely unexplained and un-shown 24 hours between the two episodes. (The first episode ends with a 24-hour timer on a massive screen, and the second begins with it ticking to 0. Huh?)</p><figure id="" data-id="d1ebd7224e1d6afa305df6a282f8c32c" data-recommend-id="image://d1ebd7224e1d6afa305df6a282f8c32c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2031" data-height="1143" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Donaldson and friend presenting from the top of a tower." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Donaldson and friend presenting from the top of a tower." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Amazon Prime / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d1ebd7224e1d6afa305df6a282f8c32c" data-recommend-id="image://d1ebd7224e1d6afa305df6a282f8c32c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2031" data-height="1143" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Donaldson and friend presenting from the top of a tower." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But among all these <em>Squid Game</em> antics and mock-ethical dilemmas, there’s something that’s entirely missing: any sense of this being MrBeast.</p><p>Donaldson isn’t one of life’s great TV presenters, but he’s not incompetent, either. He says his lines (albeit in a whiplash-inducing combination of live and ADR), and while it’s fair to level him with the observation that he reacts like a bemused scientist on an alien planet whenever he directly interacts with the contestants, so do most TV game show hosts. But the result of this is that he feels like most other game show hosts, not MrBeast.</p><p>Also on the team are his usual YouTube cohorts including Karl Jacobs, Nolan Hansen, Tareq Salameh, and Chandler Hallow. Ava Kris Tyson is notably absent, having been in the middle of what proved to be a series of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czxrn5k22p4o&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czxrn5k22p4o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">false accusations</a></span> during filming, and is seemingly no longer a part of the crew. But, again, their roles on YouTube are to run around screaming and being childlike, which is deeply irritating to adults, and an absolute joy to children. Here, they seem to be intended to offer commentary on the scene, but each gets perhaps two lines over the two episodes. Karl, for whom I have a deep hatred due to hearing his unacceptable laugh so bloody often from my son’s tablet, delivers the best line throughout (as contestants fall through their podiums he notes, “The fall’s only scary for the first two minutes.”), but is otherwise mute.</p><p>The editing feels like TV. The camera work feels like TV. The presentation, the events, the obligatory confessionals with individual players, all just TV. TV presented by low-scale personalities, with low-scale production. And this should have been something else! It should have been that god-awful energy of YouTube!</p><figure id="" data-id="fbc429187df23889362d34ca0318a3b3" data-recommend-id="image://fbc429187df23889362d34ca0318a3b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="2334" data-height="1313" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The players trying to build towers out of foam blocks." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The players trying to build towers out of foam blocks." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Amazon Prime / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fbc429187df23889362d34ca0318a3b3" data-recommend-id="image://fbc429187df23889362d34ca0318a3b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="2334" data-height="1313" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The players trying to build towers out of foam blocks." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It might seem an odd complaint, that the show didn’t feel irritating enough, but if it’s <em>not</em> what MrBeast delivers, then what’s it all for? It’s certainly going to pull in an audience because of the name, but I’m not convinced it’ll keep it. Not least with the show being released weekly now, which is not how kids watch <em>anything</em>.</p><p>It’s notable that alongside the launch of the show, the MrBeast YouTube channel also uploaded a 24-minute video that shows his lo-fi means of reducing the number of players from 2,000 to the 1,000 that start the show. It’s designed to be a gateway, the YouTube video literally ending as the Prime show begins, imploring its audience to jump over and enjoy the first episode for free. And, like a thousand internet outlets are unashamedly also promoting today when “reporting” on the program, you’re supposed to pick up that 30-day free trial to carry on.</p><p>I think that’ll work at first, but I also think that silly, scrappy YouTube video was far more entertaining for the intended audience than the blandly tidied up and flattened Amazon show. (It also doesn’t hide that some people just walked off, fed up, during filming, and shows how easily <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-beast-games-amazon-prime-video-lawsuit-scandal-1851708322&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-beast-games-amazon-prime-video-lawsuit-scandal-1851708322">people would have been injured</a></span> during frantic events.)</p><p>And so, <em>Beast Games</em>, despite the number of players, the size of the sets, and the enormous prize, feels so strangely small. It feels minor, unimportant, uneventful.</p><p>I began by observing how good Donaldson is at what he does, no matter how much I, personally, find it deeply problematic. (My son loves him, and believes in his sticking-plaster philanthropy, and I struggle between letting him love a thing and sometimes feeling it’s necessary to say that he’s doing harm.) <em>Beast Games</em> isn’t what Donaldson’s good at, and that’s really strange. The result is something that’s...fine? Small, unimportant, but fine. Just not what it could or should have been, no matter how little I’d have wanted to watch that.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The morning after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/">The Witcher IV</a> was officially revealed at The Game Awards, GameSpot had the chance to sit down with the game director Sebastian Kalemba and executive producer Małgorzata Mitręga. Although the interview was primarily focused on the reveal trailer, we did speak about Gwent, in-game romance, side quests, and the gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer officially revealed that Ciri will be the protagonist for the new Witcher saga. In the video, she hunts a new monster based on Serbian folklore called the Bauk--a spider-like creature that gets in the heads of its victims before killing them. As part of our interview, we also got to hear a little about the inspiration for the new monster and more of what to expect from the much-anticipated sequel.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.</em></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: How are you both feeling after the reveal?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Sebastian Kalemba: </strong>I feel relieved, super excited, and happy. A little bit tired, but that's good, to be very honest, because we just entered production. But I'm super, super, super happy with the reaction we got so far, and we've been preparing for this moment all year and it was a really, really exciting experience. I was visualizing this moment for months and finally it blew up and I'm super happy. The team is excited and the team really deserves this moment. We finally don't have to talk about this project with the codename Polaris. We can call it Witcher IV. We can say it aloud that Ciri is the main protagonist and it's a new saga and it will take place in new regions of the world. These things we can finally reveal, and focus on the production and kick off a new year in the second with great energy.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>To speak on Ciri a little bit, was that a hard decision to go with Ciri as the protagonist or was that pretty obvious from the beginning?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>SK: </strong>It was an obvious choice, and I remember nine years ago we already made this call. [...] So it wasn't a hard choice. We decided [to] put the spotlight on Ciri because she deserves it. She was running most of her life and this is the moment for her to define herself. This gives us more room to expand the franchise here and there, but also to be able to tell the origin stories so new players will be able to experience this world from a different perspective but in a very appealing way.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Małgorzata Mitręga: </strong>This is a new protagonist--a new adventure--and it's the beginning of the saga, right? So this is a fresh start [that pays] a lot of respect to the sentiment to the previous installments.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Can you talk about the regions where it takes place or at least one?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>MM</strong>: We can refer to the trailer, right? It's far north, in an isolated village. The trailer is showing the experience of what you [can expect] for the side content for the game. It won't be one-on-one because it was custom-created for having a consistent story that shows everything we want to show to the world [at this time]. But a lot of that comes from the game itself, and the assets are actually from the game. So it's a pre-render on the custom build, but it's an engine [with assets] from the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4418436-3.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4418436" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4418436-3.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4418436"></a><figcaption>The Witcher IV</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4418436-3.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Can you talk a little bit about shifting the focus to Ciri, in terms of storytelling?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>SK:</strong> So let's look at Ciri also through the prism of the trailer because when you look at this, there are no surprises. We specifically wanted to tell the story of a young girl that is not able to confront her destiny, [something Ciri can relate to]. Ciri was running for almost her whole life, and she finally found peace in Kaer Morhen. [...] That's why she's the very first witcher by choice. She decides to become a witcher because [she enjoys it]. It gives us a lot of room to explore some really cool emotional stakes, and some cool tropes to tell some great stories. There are common denominators [between her and Geralt] like the way she fights and the way she behaves, but she's also very passionate, very determined, and very engaged in anything she encounters and this is what we love [about her].</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>MM: </strong>She's [also] younger [and] more agile. Of course she [can also do more magic than Geralt] so it gives us [more to work with] when it comes to the gameplay. And you can see a glimpse of it in the trailer. We introduced a chain, so there are different tools and there will be more of them.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>SK:</strong> Małgorzata [also] mentioned the spell. Ciri is not a regular human being. She's a source.</p><p dir="ltr">That makes her a special and super-powerful being. What does it mean? It means that you can control or at least sense the magic in the world. So in the trailer, she is simply using [the water as a source] to create a powerful spell.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I haven't read the books in a while, but when she trained at Kaer Morhen, she never actually went through witcher school, and never underwent the Trial of Grasses.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>MM: </strong>Yes. We cannot explain what happened [yet], but for those who played the previous game, know she was not mutated back then, [but she has] definitely passed the Trial of Grasses [at this point in the story]. This also gives us a lot of possibilities for her to become a true Witcher and still find how she wants to perform that on her own terms. And the player will be able to grow with her and help her to make those choices.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I imagine balancing gameplay will be an interesting challenge considering how powerful she is canonically.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>SK:</strong> Yeah, that was one of the things that we solved at the very beginning of pre-production. Yes, she was OP in Wild Hunt and there was a purpose behind this, but here [we want to give] you an opportunity to build her up in your way, with the tools we'll give you and with the stories you will be able to experience.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4418437-4.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4418437" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4418437-4.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4418437"></a><figcaption>Ciri using a spell in The Witcher IV</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4418437-4.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Can you talk a little bit about the monster that was shown? I know that's a new monster for the Witcher, but I think it's based on Serbian folklore.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>MM</strong>: Yeah, it's based on Serbian folklore. It's more than a little bit [inspired actually].</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>SK: </strong>We pay a lot of attention to everything but [especially] to the monsters. That's at the center of [a monster slayer's world], right? And Ciri is a monster slayer. The Bauk is a very special being. It is a deadly monster that's complex and intelligent. He senses your fears and he's able to play with your mind. He makes you dizzy [and] lost. Then he attacks in a moment when [you're confused]. You can experience it while watching [the initial confrontation in] the trailer.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>MM: </strong>We wanted to show that the Bauk is a very complex monster and you can experience more creatures like that during the game. We want to introduce new monsters, for sure, but of course, there will be a variety of them. [Monsters are one of the] most important elements of the Witcher world, right? But they're always connected to the region, to the location, to the people around them, to the environment, [and] to the story.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Gwent?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>SK: </strong>I'll be honest with you, I was impressed by the amount of people that said, "Gwent 2.0." [There's been] so much positively [around] Gwent. And what I can say is, it's a part of this world.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>MM: </strong>We love it and it's important. And also we love our community.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>SK: </strong>It's very important and we hear you guys. We hear you and don't worry, all right?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4418438-5.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4418438" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4418438-5.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4418438"></a><figcaption>Ciri getting ready to swing her sword in The Witcher IV trailer</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4418438-5.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>When it comes to romance, what can fans expect? Will there be any in The Witcher IV?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>SK: </strong>Absolutely. It's a part of the way we make games. It is a part of human nature. It's a very normal thing. Without that I think we wouldn't be able to tell the very full story.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>MM:</strong> It's an important part of life.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>SK: </strong>But as always, we want to pay a lot of attention to it and make it super compelling and very meaningful. So it's not just to make a romance for the sake of making a romance. That's not the CDPR way.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>CD Projekt Red is known for their side quests. Have you guys thought about how you plan to push side quests even further?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>MM: </strong>Yeah. We are always pushing further with each and every game. We will learn from the previous games and also look at what's happening in the market. You can expect us to. With our ambition, it will be nothing less. But yeah, we are looking forward [to exploring choices and consequences further]. To surprise the player, and to show them you don't really have control of [everything]. You think you're doing something and then it's the other way around. We also want to push how the side content and main content [are connected]. And also with Ciri herself [and how her growth is affected], right? For sure, we will look there to push the boundaries further.</p><p><strong>SK</strong>: Yeah, exactly. We want to make them meaningful, and we want to make sure that the consequences are visible. So you [feel as though] you had an impact either on an NPC or world in general. [These complex decisions are] why our games have long tails, right? Because of these choices and consequences [add a lot of] re-playability. You can experience the game a little bit differently here and there.</p>
