		<p>Developer Path Games has announced its next game and it is called Dark Mass. Much like its previous game Insomnis, Dark Mass is a first person horror title but it swaps a regular, land based mansion for a manor that is deep underwater in the middle of the sea. How did it get there? Well, that’s one of the mysteries. The announcement trailer gives a sense of what to expect in this unusual deep sea dive.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dark Mass - Announcement Trailer | 4K" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j2sv9NAia24?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Dark Mass puts you in the role of deep sea explorer Alice who, along with her brother Reed, set off to to explore a ship wreck. However, they instead find the out of place manor that still retains much of its identity, despite being on the sea bed. Alice soon becomes trapped within the manor and has to solve its puzzle and avoid the horrors that still inhabit the house, including the monster Silas, who stalks Alice through the manor. Throughout the story, Alice maintains contact with Reed, who is on the boat, through a walkie talkie. Navigating through the manor will be slow at times as Alice’s movement is impacted by the deep sea currents. The story will have multiple choices with these leading to different endings.</p>
<p>A release date for Dark Mass is yet to be confirmed, but it is expected at some point this year.</p>

The trailer and screenshots <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/20/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-out-june-26-on-ps5-ps4/">on Sony’s announcement blog post</a> show off some light visual updates, but they look like sharpened versions of things like enemy models — maintaining the feel of a 25-year-old game with a little less blur. (Your weapons have visible hands holding them now, too.)</p><p>A bigger deal for many people might be an updated, console-friendly version of its complicated mouse and keyboard interface, including DualSense support and a quickbar for weapons and abilities. If you’re nostalgic for the old RPG overlay look, though, the visual design appears nearly unchanged. There’s even cross-play support for the game’s notoriously rocky cooperative multiplayer mode.</p><p>According to <a href="https://nightdivestudios.com/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-2/">Nightdive’s website</a> and comments from a moderator in the studio Discord server, the game is supposed to include some of the original’s existing community mods on top of offering broader mod support. The Discord moderator says the remaster will ship with the SS2 Community Patch or SCP, which rebalances some frustrating features, among other patches. (This was <a href="https://www.systemshock.org/index.php?topic=11449.0">discussed by Nightdive</a> back in 2020.) We’ve reached out to Nightdive to confirm the details on what exactly mod support will look like, including how the remastered version might play with the ShockEd fan mission editor. The <em>System Shock 2 </em>community has been essentially remastering the game for decades, but an official version makes those efforts a lot easier to find.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Tonight's Future Games Show obviously wasn't about any one game or studio in particular, but funnily enough, it did open and close with games from (technically) one developer. The show started things off with a look at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3494520/Lost_Rift/">Lost Rift</a>, a supernatural, survival, PvPvE extraction game - that's a lot of things - from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/people-can-fly">People Can Fly</a>. In case you were wondering, this is what became of Project Victoria which was shelved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bulletstorm-and-painkiller-devs-people-can-fly-let-over-120-people-go-and-suspend-or-downsize-projects">only three months ago</a>. Weirdly enough, the show then ended with the series that put PCF on the map: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/painkiller">Painkiller</a>. Or, a remake of it anyway.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
When I say that these two announcements were technically from one developer, I mostly do mean it in that PCF made the original gory, hellish first-person shooter, whereas this remake is being made by Anshar Studios, a studio mostly known for assisting other developers - it's helped out on games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>, and even People Can Fly's poorly received <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outriders">Outriders</a>.

<p>
The Painkiller remake looks like it'll still have plenty of enemies to mow down in increasingly brutal ways, you'd expect that of a game with a name like that, but there's some key changes here that make it more than just a fresh lick of paint. For one, there'll be four characters to play as, each with their own passive ability, and more notably, co-op will be a bigger component this time around. Makes sense with the different playable characters, though I'm normally hesitant about remakes at the best of times, so I'm curious how that emphasis will go down. There's also tarot cards that grant buffs, currencies to earn, skins to unlock, all stuff that mostly just sounds like padding, truth be told.
</p>
<p>
Painkiller doesn't have a precise release date just yet, but it's currently slated to come out sometime Fall 2025, and it's already available to wishlist on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300120/Painkiller/">Steam</a>. I guess <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> isn't guaranteed to be the biggest medieavally, gothicy boomer shooter this year after all.

            <p>
If you've found yourself pondering the time-travel terrors teased in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-developer-bloober-reveals-next-game-original-sci-fi-horror-cronos-the-new-dawn">Bloober Team's Cronos: The New Dawn reveal trailer last October</a>, you might be intrigued to hear the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> studio has now shared further details in a new developer diary. That's alongside the reveal of I Hate This Place - an open-world survival horror game it's publishing later this year.
</p>
<p>
Cronos: The New Dawn, as we learned last year, follows the adventures of the enigmatic Traveler as they journey between a monster-infested post-apocalyptic future - created after a cataclysmic event known as the Change - and 1980s Poland. Now, though, Bloober has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuSJpd2c7UY">talked a little more about its upcoming sci-fi horror</a>,  - which is said to draw inspiration from the likes of John Carpenter's The Thing, mind-pummelling German TV series Dark, 12 Monkeys, Dead Space, and even a touch of Dark Souls in terms of its challenge.
</p>
<p>
As for Cronos' enigmatic lead, the Traveler is just one of a group - described as 'divers in time' - sent to explore the ruins of human civilisation in search of time rifts allowing them to extract people from the past who didn't survive the apocalypse. In Cronos' alternative timeline, the world ended in the '80s - thanks to the aforementioned Change - and the resulting wasteland is populated by monstrous creatures known as The Orphans.

<p>
These are the remnants of humanity, and can take different forms, each with distinctive abilities. What connects each variant, however, is the fact they're all still made of human tissue, introducing an element of body horror reminiscent of The Thing. Additionally (as per Bloober's not entirely serious closing Q&amp;A), players can expect walls of flesh, face-punching melee combat, "kinda" flamethrowers, dismemberment of sorts, and aliens ("maybe"). And ladders.
</p>
<p>
It's promising stuff (especially for ladder fans, apparently), but sadly we've still no clearer idea of when Cronos: The New Dawn will arrive - beyond its previously announced "2025" launch window on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, that is. What we do know, though, is that it isn't the only game on Bloober's 2025 release slate. The studio has also unveiled I Hate This Place, an isometric open-world survival horror currently due to arrive in "Q4" this year.
</p>
<p>
I Hate This Place is the work of developer Rock Square Thunder (Bloober is handling publishing duties under its new Broken Mirror Games label) and it's inspired by Kyle Starks and Artyom Topilin's comic book series of the same name. Players take on the role of Elena, who finds herself in a deadly fight for survival in a "harsh and unforgiving wilderness" after unwittingly awakening a malevolent force. It promises crafting, formidable foes, tense gunfights, and melee combat "that rewards ingenuity over brute force" - alongside a day and night cycle said to impact gameplay dynamics. Oh, and "avoid the Horned Man at all costs".

<p>
"Drenched in bold, vivid colours and retro '80s comic book aesthetics," adds Bloober, "each location is lovingly crafted to tell its own disturbing story through stylish visuals that blur the line between reality and nightmare in a world where everything wants you dead."
</p>
<p>
I Hate This Place launches via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2604490/I_Hate_This_Place/">Steam</a> and the Epic Games Store in "Q4" this year.

            <p>
Nightdive Studios' long-in-the-works <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/system-shock-2">System Shock 2</a> remaster finally has a release date, and it's coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on 26th June.
</p>
<p>
Nightdive initially announced it would be remastering <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> developer Irrational Games' critically acclaimed - and hugely influential - 1999 FPS/RPG sci-fi horror hybrid <a href="https://x.com/NightdiveStudio/status/1160740078685057025">back in 2019</a>. At the time, it was known as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/system-shock-2-enhanced-edition">System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition</a>, but it's since had a name change, and will now be arriving as System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster.
</p>
<p>
Following on from Nightdive's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/system-shock-review-shodan-steals-the-show-in-this-faithful-remake">extremely well-received System Shock 1 remake</a>, which launched back in 2023, its System Shock 2 remaster promises enhancements to characters, weapon models, textures, cinematics, and animations. That's alongside quality of life improvements, optimised controller support, updated co-op multiplayer, and achievements. PC players can also expect mod support, up to 144fps, and ultra-widescreen compatibility.

<p>
At its heart, though, it's still the same acclaimed System Shock 2. That means another battle of wits against rogue AI SHODAN as players - choosing between one of three military branches - find themselves on he FTL ship Von Braun in the year 2114. "Hybrid mutants and deadly robots roam the halls while the cries from the remaining crew reverberate through the cold hull of the ship," explains Nightdive. "SHODAN... has taken over, and it's up to you to stop her."
</p>
<p>
And now, just managing to squeak into the 25th anniversary window with two months to spare, Nightdive's System Shock 2 remaster launches on 26th June. It's be available for Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PS4, Switch, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/866570/System_Shock_2_25th_Anniversary_Remaster/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/system_shockr_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">GOG</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-cb94d9">Epic</a>, and the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/agecheck/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster">Humble Store</a>. Additionally, anyone that pre-ordered Nightdive's original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/system-shock">System Shock</a> remake on Steam (or crowdfunded it at the $30 level or higher) will <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1598858095/system-shock/posts/4320315">get the System Shock 2 remaster for free</a>.
</p>
<p>
"It's the finest work that both Looking Glass and Irrational ever produced," Eurogamer contributor Rick Lane <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/system-shock-2-still-stands-as-irrationals-finest-work">wrote of System Shock 2 back in 2015</a> (beware spoilers!) "and if that doesn't give you a shout of being the best game in existence, I'm not sure what does."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-info-all-post-launch-content-will-be-free/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ahead of today's appearance at the Future Gaming Show, Wccftech was invited to a remote press presentation of Remedy's very first multiplayer game, the co-op shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-multiplayer-game-set-in-the-control-world-revealed-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBC: Firebreak</a>. Game Director Mike Kayatta was on hand to provide many details on this intriguing project set in the universe of Control (and Alan Wake, since it's all shared under the so-called Remedy Connected Universe).</p>
<p>Firstly, we learned that the development team for FBC: Firebreak is composed of around 50 Remedy developers. It is a cooperative first-person shooter for groups of three players, targeting 'AA' scope and mid-price (it will also be added on day one to Game Pass and PlayStation Plus). As previously stated, the game isn't far off, being slated for a Summer 2025 debut.</p>
<p>For those who haven't played Control, the basic premise is that the headquarters of the titular Federal Bureau of Control, the strange and mysterious Oldest House, came under assault by The Hiss. The FBC decided to close the doors and lock them in tight to make sure that the infection didn't spill out into the rest of the world, but everyone working at the FBC was locked inside with them. Fast-forward six years after the end of Control and the doors are actually still locked, except now the supplies are running out: food, water, and everything else you can think of. Exterminating The Hiss actually has turned out to be impossible. What happens when the Federal Bureau of Control actually loses control? That is the story of FBC: Firebreak.</p>
<p>The titular Firebreak is an initiative of volunteer first responders who are sent into the weird, dangerous crises that are spreading all across the Oldest House now that the FBC has lost control over the place. These people volunteering come from all across the Bureau. There are combat-trained Rangers, but also secretaries and middle managers. The FBC essentially hands them some very specialized equipment, gives them a bit of on-the-job training and just hopes that they survive.</p>
<p>Kayatta then outlined the game's key pillars. The first of them is called 'Only in Control'. Due to the inherently weird and unpredictable setting, Remedy felt it was a perfect space for them to explore. From the beginning of this development, they asked themselves this question over and over again. Is this something that could only ever happen in Control? Is this something that only Remedy would make? If the answer was yes, they figured they were on the right track and moved forward.</p>
<p>The next pillar is 'Pick up and play'. Remedy wanted to make something that players could enjoy on their own terms. That meant ditching all the engagement stress that can be seen in a lot of live service games. FBC: Firebreak won't have daily or monthly grinds, Battle Passes and the like, as Remedy isn't interested in giving people a second job. This pillar is also about putting up as few barriers as possible between players launching the game and when they actually start shooting Hiss. It includes ditching cutscenes and forced tutorials, as well as making sure that players can jump in with their friends without worrying about their respective progress.</p>
<p>The third pillar is 'Better together'. The developers acknowledge the challenge of having to empower individual players while still making sure that cooperation remains meaningful. Ultimately, Remedy made it so most things you can do in this game organically help the team progress, even without any direct communication within the group.</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, the last pillar for FBC: Firebreak was 'Fun on repeat'. Of course, making something truly replayable is always tough, and the developers recognized they couldn't keep up an endless stream of new story chapters. The foundation was, therefore, placed on delivering engaging minute-to-minute gameplay and systems that could create impactful and memorable moments unique to your session.</p>
<figure><figcaption>You will be able to choose between three Crisis Kits: Jump, Fix, and Splash. It's possible to switch between them in the middle of the match, and they can be further customized with perks.</figcaption></figure>
<p>When going on a mission, Firebreak members are assigned to a Job. Each Job is defined by a few different things, like a unique environment, a unique set of objectives (the victory condition), and a unique crisis that players will deal with when they get there. Once you know which Job you want to take on, you are going to choose two independent levers that you can pull: Threat Level and Clearance Level. The former determines combat intensity; basically, it's the difficulty level in FBC: Firebreak. The higher the Threat Level, the more combat you're going to face, and this also scales the number of rewards that you earn by playing a session.</p>
<p>The Clearance Level is a bit different. Each Job is actually split into three zones, and the Clearance Level sets the number of zones that you will be playing through in a complete run. It also determines what types of rewards you can earn. There are actually more than three Clearance Levels, and Remedy hinted that at higher levels even stuff like corrupted items would appear on Jobs.</p>
<p>Each player is going to have access to three loadouts that are called Crisis Kits. Each of these is centered around a specific unique tool and a general play style, although you can modify this play style with perks. If you end up regretting that choice later, or you simply face something that you weren't expecting, you're going to be able to switch mid-match and the game is going to recognize that you've done that and reward you for the time that you spent playing that kit.</p>
<p>Remedy shared the key specifics of each Crisis Kit:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jump Kit </strong><br>
An electricity-focused Crisis Kit for Firebreakers who want to excel at field control and positioning<br>
<strong>Tool:</strong> Electro-Kinetic Charge Impactor<br>
▪ A portable compression impactor capable of delivering an impressive amount of electricity through the conductive plate attached to its end.<br>
<strong>Item:</strong> BOOMbox<br>
▪ An improvised device that attracts nearby enemies with music before exploding. After deploying the BOOMbox, it can be charged with the Impactor. The device will taunt all enemies in proximity for a short time before automatically detonating.</li>
<li><strong>Fix Kit </strong><br>
An impact-focused Crisis Kit for Firebreakers who want to solve most problems by hitting them with a massive wrench.<br>
<strong>Tool:</strong> Wrench<br>
▪ A large wrench capable of repairing machinery and staggering enemies with powerful swings.<br>
<strong>Item:</strong> Swivel turret<br>
▪ An improvised device that autonomously acquires enemy targets and fires&nbsp;damaging projectiles at them. After deploying the Swivel Cannon, it needs to be assembled by striking the parts with the Wrench. The completed device will autonomously fire upon enemies until it falls apart.</li>
<li><strong>Splash Kit </strong><br>
A water-focused Crisis Kit for Firebreakers who want to put out fires and manipulate the conditions affecting their crewmates and enemies.<br>
<strong>Tool:</strong> Crank-Operated Fluidic Ejector<br>
▪ An industrial hydro cannon capable of pooling and ejecting heavy globules of water. Excels at extinguishing fires and priming enemies for devastating effects.<br>
<strong>Item:</strong> Humidifier<br>
▪ An improvised device capable of spraying healing water over a wide area. After deploying the Humidifier, it can be primed with the Ejector. The device will automatically heal all crewmates in proximity for a short time before falling apart.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remedy explained that one of the hard truths about being a Firebreaker is that the FBC doesn't really expect you to survive. This means that when you complete the objectives of a Job, the FBC considers the mission a success whether you make it out alive or not, and that success is rewarded with XP for your career at the FBC and your proficiency with the kits you used. But if you want currencies that give you access to new gear upgrades and cosmetics, you'll need to find them and escape the Job alive with them.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Firebreak is about efficiency. You can't fail objectives, but the longer you spend doing them, the more and more Hiss will show up to stop you, increasing the chance that your crew dies on the job. That means the longer you spend exploring for currency, the more risk you're inviting and the harder it will eventually become to make it back to headquarters in one piece.</p>
<p>Perks are heavily linked to the currencies, being one of the most meaningful and interesting things that you can buy with the currencies in the game. Perks can change how you play; for example, one perk might give you a chance that a missed bullet returns to your clip, or the ability to extinguish yourself when burning by jumping up and down. You can also equip two perks of the same type to obtain a stronger version of that perk, and even equip three of the same to share its effect with nearby teammates. Increasing your kit proficiency also expands the available perk slots.</p>
<p>Any online game lives or dies in large part depending on the developer's post-launch pipeline. Remedy appears to be aware of this. They claim to have concrete plans that will be better detailed in the future. For now, they shared the key concepts for the roadmap. To begin with, all playable post-launch content (such as Jobs) released for FBC: Firebreak will be free. Paid cosmetic content will finance the game's ongoing support.</p>
<p>Lastly, although the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-will-have-lower-pc-requirements-than-remedys-single-player-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aims for lower specs than previous titles like Control or Alan Wake 2</a>, the Finnish studio confirmed that the full suite of technologies will still be available, including full ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, and Reflex. Following the presentation, Remedy's Mike Kayatta answered a few questions from the assembled press.</p>
<p><iframe title="FBC: Firebreak – Gameplay Trailer (Future Games Show)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ohYTWzw0Uno?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>WCCFTECH: Is there any character progression system to keep players engaged over time?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. The thing that we've prioritized with player progression is a little bit less about power ramping, which I think is really difficult to keep up with and also starts to create a big gulf between players. So, we focused a lot on unlocking options over time. The more you play, the more ways that you can play. We have quite a bit of that. We look forward to getting into that more deeply as we get closer to release.</p>
<p><strong>CNET: Why go for three-player squads versus four-player? Is solo or duo play possible?</strong></p>
<p>I can answer both of these questions with the same answer, which is that I just don't have very many friends, so we have fewer people in the squad. Yes, you can definitely play by your sad, lonely self. More honestly, the reason why we chose three-player squads was really an organic quirk of development. We actually started testing with four players. I think it just didn't feel quite as good. It was a little harder to understand where people were. That's something that's not required but definitely helpful in this game. With all the chaos and the systems going off, three just felt right. I would say that the game is definitely optimized to be played with three. You're going to get the most out of it.</p>
<p><strong>INVERSE: How does FBC: Firebreak lean into Remedy's trademark style of storytelling? What will players who love that kind of story find here?</strong></p>
<p>With this type of game, it was really important for us not to take our traditional storytelling route, and the reason is just that this is not a single player game where you're kind of walking down a special path and experiencing the world from certain angles and ways, exploring it by yourself. For a game like this, we wanted to preserve space for your experience inside of the game. That means basically telling the story inside the narrative world that we've put together. That means leaving more space for you to have the conversations that you want on the mics. There's a million reasons for it, but that doesn't mean that we have abandoned the idea of narrative. The world is extremely rich. It is the world of Control, after all. There's a lot to see, explore, and immerse yourself in, but I would not go in expecting something like Alan Wake 2.</p>
<p><strong>BLEEDING COOL: Are you able to max out everything when it comes to job upgrade options and whatnot, or are there a finite number of resources, and you'll have to make tough choices in what direction you want to go with your character?</strong></p>
<p>You'll be able to max out everything. Of course, that will take time, and we're going to move the goalpost on you over time as the game adds content. We're not interested in making you commit to difficult choices and be stuck with it. I don't think that's so fun.</p>
<p><strong>WCCFTECH: What kind of post-launch content can players expect from FBC: Firebreak?</strong></p>
<p>Well, again, this is something that we're going to talk a lot more about in the future, but I can at least say that this is a systems game where we really want to lean into the idea of you being able to have more toys in the sandbox and ways to refresh your experience and create the emergent moments that we know the game can make. So, that's what we'll be prioritizing. What that specifically entails is something that we'll detail in the future.</p>

So, that's what we'll be prioritizing. What that specifically entails is something that we'll detail in the future.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>DIGITAL TRENDS: This has a very distinct sense of humor and style compared to Control. How do you balance making something that feels tonally distinct while still feeling like it's part of the Control Universe?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, this is a question I have asked myself many times over the years. The answer is that Control has this great blend of horror and tension, and then it also has this great edge of absurdity as well. It has a very specific recipe breakdown. I'll just arbitrarily pin it at 70%-30% for those two things. The strategy with this game was we didn't want to betray Control, and we didn't want to take it out of that space, but we also knew that for this type of game, we had to take the same ingredients and basically invert them. So, yes, we lean more into the absurd side of Control, but we're not trying to invent a new type of humor that you would never have seen in the universe.</p>
<p>Of course, we do have some of that tense, horror-like edge as well, although it does kind of step back a little bit to make room for some of the more fun and joyful aspects that are also present in Control.</p>
<p><strong>How long will a Job take to compete?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we're still tweaking some of this stuff and figuring it out, but generally speaking, we shoot for sessions that are under 30 minutes. But it was also important to us that we had a session type that you could jump in and out of. That's one of the reasons why we have those distinct aspects that you can control, both the difficulty and the complexity, to mix and match what you're looking for.</p>
<p><strong>Can players expect to interact or see Control characters like Jesse Faden in FBC: Firebreak?</strong></p>
<p>In terms of who you're going to see, we'll leave that for people to discover in the game, but I will say this at least. It was really important to us that we protected both Control and non-Control players with this game. That means protecting Control players by saying, hey, if you were into that single player journey and you're looking forward to continuing that single player journey in Control 2, we don't want to make you feel as though you had to go participate in a cooperative multiplayer shooter that might not be your genre in order to really understand that single player journey. On the other hand, let's say you really can't be bothered with Control. That's okay, too. It's definitely set in the same universe, it's the same lore, it is officially canon and so forth, but at the same time, we've tried to keep those barriers at just the right level and make sure both of those groups get what they want out of this franchise.</p>
<p><strong>One of the big highlights of Control was dealing with objects of power and the bizarre events that they cause. How has this been adapted into the FBC: Firebreak experience?</strong></p>
<p>This is something that we're really excited to dive into later. I think if you take a look at both of the trailers, you'll start to get a hint at the way that we're using them. I also made a cheeky reference earlier to the appearance of something we call corrupted items. I will say yes, they're an important part of the universe. They're my favorite flavor of weird in this universe. They're just so iconic and so I think we would be kind of crazy to avoid them. I think we have a lot of fascinating and fun ways that we've employed them in the game. We'll be showing more of that soon in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Remedy's previous games have taken creative inspiration from film and other media, from True Detective to Annihilation. Were there any similar guiding pop culture touchpoints for FBC: Firebreak?</strong></p>
<p>Honestly, a lot of our inspiration has actually been quite internal. We've got the Remedy Connected Universe that we've been building out. We're super excited about it, it has a lot of depth and complexity. It's got a lot of things that people haven't seen yet. Honestly, the most important thing for us was to not go kind of pull from the outside and accidentally risk diluting Control, because it's such a strong world. What we really tried to do was actually look to Control for inspiration and ask ourselves, what didn't we see, what would we like to see more of, and what happens when you take on that same universe from a totally different perspective? For us, that was enough.</p>
<p><strong>Did you take inspiration from successes and failures in other multiplayer games?</strong></p>
<p>I wouldn't say that. We didn't take a cynical approach, we we didn't try to do some sort of like, well, what succeeded and what failed from a pure business dissection standpoint. Of course, we do pay attention to it, but I think it's more from the perspective of what works for players. Whether something's successful or not, some people have great ideas in a package that just doesn't work, and some people have terrible ideas that seem to pop. We played a ton of other games in the cooperative PvE space, and we tried to pay the most attention to what people were saying and feeling, and as the game developers, what we were feeling and what we connected with.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

			<p>During the Future Games Show Spring Showcase, Belgrade-based developer GFA Games debuted a new gameplay trailer for its upcoming STALKER-like MMOFPS Pioner. We've <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-qa-2-devs-reveal-pve-pvp-mechanics-of-this-stalker-like-mmofps-confirm-beta-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered</a> the game multiple times over the years, even featuring it on our <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-multiplayer-games-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most anticipated multiplayer game list</a>. Despite the delays, the developers have <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-like-mmofps-pioner-shows-new-trailer-confirms-2025-launch-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">again</a> confirmed the game's planned 2025 launch on PC, with a console version coming afterward.</p>
<p>Pioner is set in a haunting alternate reality where Soviet-era structures are abandoned on a desolate, post-apocalyptic island of more than 50 square kilometers. Powered by Unreal Engine 4, it will run on even modest hardware according to the official minimum and recommended requirements:</p>

<p>The developers of Pioner recently answered some lingering questions from the community:</p>
<ul>
<li>It will be possible to complete the story campaign without going to PvP zones and complete isolated missions without other players.</li>
<li>The game will feature voice and text chat. Global, divided by region, party, or clan.</li>
<li>Some quests can be completed in co-op, but not the entire storyline.</li>
<li>Only cosmetic in-game purchases are planned.</li>
<li>Thanks to the server mirroring system, there won't be any need for custom servers, as players can form a guild that allows them to create a similar enclave on existing servers.</li>
<li>Pioner will support cross-play only on consoles, not with PC, for the sake of balance.</li>
<li>GFA Games plans to release regular updates, including balancing patches, new content, and even major additions that significantly expand the game world.</li>
<li>The game will be available on Windows and Linux.</li>
<li>An anti-cheat is being worked on.</li>
<li>There are no plans to switch to Unreal Engine 5 before the game's release. The developers said that UE5 is very demanding on hardware, and they want as many players as possible to enjoy the game.</li>
<li>Pioner will be buy-to-play.</li>
<li>Players won't need to participate in PvP. Story-based activities and activities in which you can get beaten up by other players are separated by both distance and organization.</li>
<li>The left side of the island is dominated by PvE content, while the right side of the island is a PvP area. At the same time, there is only one region in the game where PvP is implemented everywhere - Shadowlands. Only partial areas with PvP rules are implemented in Middle Earth. The team also announced additional rules to avoid the bullying of solo players and respawn camping.</li>
<li>Getting the best equipment will be possible in PvE and PvP activities. The main item you need to have is blueprints and resources. The latter can be obtained in many activities, including PvE. In the world of PIONER, artifacts play a vital role in the economy and the equipment crafting process. Artifacts are expensive and difficult to obtain. The search for artifacts is almost always connected with anomalies, and you can only get an artifact if you have the appropriate equipment.</li>
</ul>

The devs at Remedy talked about their design philosophy behind the <em>Left 4 Dead 2</em>-like shooter, answered some questions, and showed off one of the game’s missions. </p><h2 id="h8080"><a id=""></a>What kind of game is <em>Firebreak</em>?</h2><p><em>FBC: Firebreak</em> is set in the same universe as <em>Control</em>, which itself is part of the larger “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-max-payne-control-remedy-entertainment-1850967623?_gl=1*ladiid*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjQzODI0NS4xMjcuMS4xNzM2NDU1NDYzLjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-max-payne-control-remedy-entertainment-1850967623?_gl=1*ladiid*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjQzODI0NS4xMjcuMS4xNzM2NDU1NDYzLjYwLjAuMA..">Remedy Connected Universe</a></span>” that also includes <em>Alan Wake.</em> Specifically, <em>FBC </em>is set roughly six years after the events of <em>Control</em>. The destructive interdimensional Hiss still infest most of the Oldest House, the impossibly large and cosmic-horror filled HQ of <em>Control’s </em>Federal Bureau of Control. The lockdown is still in place, and after all these years, supplies are running out and people are getting desperate to take back the HQ and kick the Hiss out for good. So the Bureau’s director—<em>Control </em>protagonist Jesse Faden— has ordered the creation of the Firebreak Initiative. This is a volunteer-based emergency response team tasked with stopping the Hiss.</p><p>One of first things that surprised me was Remedy confirming that <em>FBC</em>: <em>Firebreak </em>has no cutscenes. This is part of Remedy’s desire to make <em>FBC </em>pick-up-and-play friendly, one of the game’s core design pillars. The idea is that no matter how many hours you’ve played, you should be able to quickly hop into a game with a buddy and have a good time. </p><p>The other two pillars: Make sure <em>FBC </em>is fun on repeat, and content needs to feel like it could only be found in the wild, strange world of <em>Control</em>. </p><p>During the event, Remedy showed a pre-recorded mission involving three players. Remedy calls these&nbsp;missions “Jobs,” featuring a single main objective with action spread out across a number of sections. Players can control how long and difficult these jobs are before hopping in, which will determine the kinds of rewards and how much XP is awarded at the end</p><p>The job we saw was called Paper Chase and involved three players working together to fight through the Hiss, including battling many enemies seen in<em> Control,</em> while destroying thousands of sticky notes scattered around the Oldest House. The post-it notes can even stick to you and obscure your vision. The combat reminded me of what you might find in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/everything-is-left-4-dead-now-1847096864&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/everything-is-left-4-dead-now-1847096864"><em>Left 4 Dead 2 </em>or <em>Back 4 Blood</em></a></span>, or even a mission in <em>Destiny 2</em>. Lots of shooting, managing space, and working together to defeat hordes of baddies or complete smaller sub-objectives.</p><figure id="" data-id="89fbddeb364637b164767302e1eafa2b" data-recommend-id="image://89fbddeb364637b164767302e1eafa2b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Remedy Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="89fbddeb364637b164767302e1eafa2b" data-recommend-id="image://89fbddeb364637b164767302e1eafa2b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Each player takes into battle a special kit that includes different tools that can change things up in a big way. These include turrets, which are just guns taped to office chairs, or a boom box that attracts enemies to it. Like <em>L4D2</em>, players reach big emergency checkpoints throughout the mission and can take a breather and restock. How many of these doors appear in a mission will depend on how hard you made the job. </p><p>Eventually, at the end of the mission, the group took on a giant monster made out of yellow sticky notes. With regards to the key pillars, this certainly seems like something that could only happen in the universe of <em>Control</em>. </p><h2 id="h8081"><a id=""></a><strong><em>FBC </em>Won’t Feel Like A Second Job</strong></h2><p>If you are wondering why Remedy decided to limit <em>FBC </em>to only three players instead of the more traditional four, the devs explained that they tried out four players early on but it felt like “a little too much to pay attention to” during jobs, and three players “felt better.” You can play solo if you want, or just with one other buddy, but there are no bots. So you’ll need some friends and you’ll need to plan time to play together.</p><p>Getting friends together is tricky for a lot of adults and Remedy seem aware of this. Their goal is to make the game extremely easy to hop into, hence no cutscenes or lengthy tutorials, and to not include any FOMO elements or make <em>FBC </em>feel like a “second job.” You can stop playing <em>FBC </em>for months and then come back and you won’t be behind or need to grind to catch up to friends. <br></p><p>Relatedly, when I asked if <em>FBC </em>had an ending that players could eventually reach, I was told no. The game is meant to be played over and over again, with players unlocking new perks and gear to alter how they play while trying out harder jobs. Interestingly, there also won’t be any major “bespoke” story updates. So it seems the world of <em>FBC </em>will be pretty static compared to some other online games. </p><p>As a big fan of <em>Control</em>, I asked how <em>FBC: Firebreak </em>will impact the already announced and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/annapurna-interactive-stray-alan-wake-tv-control-2-1851647950&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/annapurna-interactive-stray-alan-wake-tv-control-2-1851647950">currently in development <em>Control 2</em></a></span><em>. </em>For the most part, it won’t. In a later answer given to me via an email after the event, Remedy provided more detail on their thinking. </p><p>“This was a very conscious decision made early on to protect <em>Control </em>players who shouldn’t be made to go outside their genre comfort zone to follow those stories and to protect non-Control players, who shouldn’t feel like they need to go out of their genre comfort zone to understand <em>Firebreak</em>,” said game director Mike Kayatta. Remedy did confirm that <em>FBC </em>is “canon” to <em>Control </em>and hinted that some characters from the game might show up in Firebreak. </p><h2 id="h8082"><a id=""></a>Is <em>FBC: Firebreak </em>a live-service game?</h2><p>Remedy revealed during the event that <em>FBC </em>will include paid cosmetics and post-launch updates, another fairly big departure from Remedy’s past games. However, they admitted that they were hesitant to use words like “live-service” or “seasons” as these mean very different things to different people. </p><p>They instead explained that they want to respect players’ time. No content in <em>FBC </em>will be “time-restricted” or be based around FOMO. Remedy insists they are working hard to make a game “for people with kids,” aka gamers with limited time. They also confirmed that all playable content updates will be free and promised more specific details closer to launch.</p><p>When I asked if <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> will have a battle pass or not, the answer was fairly vague. I asked for some clarification and received this response:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>We’re not going to have any time-restricted content delivery mechanisms. We’ll be revealing more about our post launch a bit later, but ultimately we can confirm that none of this content will be released on limited time rotation. We want to ensure that whether you play daily or play every other week, you’ll have the opportunity to acquire all the same items.</p></blockquote><figure id="" data-id="47a1184d8423696ee2e5a13d38cc5be0" data-recommend-id="image://47a1184d8423696ee2e5a13d38cc5be0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Remedy Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="47a1184d8423696ee2e5a13d38cc5be0" data-recommend-id="image://47a1184d8423696ee2e5a13d38cc5be0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When I asked how <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> will compete with other online shooters and co-op games, Remedy pushed back and said they weren’t competing with those kinds of games. Instead they want <em>FBC </em>to “slot in” to your life between other games that might demand more of your time. <em>FBC </em>can be a thing you come back to whenever you want and have some free time. Once again, the devs brought up the goal of not making <em>FBC </em>feel like a second job.</p><p>Finally, I asked about Switch 2. Remedy made a point during the presentation to talk about how they are striving to make <em>FBC </em>Steam Deck verified and want it to run well on lower spec PCs. So I wondered if that meant a Switch 2 port was in the works. </p><p>“We are very busy in developing the game for the launch,” said Kayatta. “So we haven’t given the Switch 2 any thought at this point, but things can always change in the future.” Well, I tried. </p><p>For now, <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> will launch later this year on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/remedy-firebreak-shooter-flop-plan-co-op-game-pass-ps5-1851736526&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/remedy-firebreak-shooter-flop-plan-co-op-game-pass-ps5-1851736526">It will launch day one on both Game Pass and PS Plus</a></span>, another way Remedy is trying to give <em>FBC</em> the best shot at finding an audience and avoiding the fate of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566?_gl=1*kid9cz*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDk5MDMwNi4xNjUuMS4xNzM0OTkwMzE3LjQ5LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566?_gl=1*kid9cz*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDk5MDMwNi4xNjUuMS4xNzM0OTkwMzE3LjQ5LjAuMA..">Sony’s failed FPS <em>Concord</em></a></span>.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I can say this for certain: The game's tutorial does a lot of work in introducing you to the game's core mechanics, which include choosing cards with sequential actions, "burning" cards for temporary boosts, positioning, teamwork, and having enough actions or options left if a fight goes longer than you think. I'm not a total newcomer to the <em>-haven</em> games, having played a couple rounds of the <em>Gloomhaven&nbsp;</em>board game. But none of my friends, however patient, did as good a job of showing just how important it was to consider not just attack, defend, or move, but where each choice would place you, and how it would play with your teammates.</p>
<p>I played as a "Banner Spear," one of the six starting classes. Their thing is—you guessed it—having a spear, and they can throw it or lunge with it from farther away. Many of the Banner Spear's cards are more effective with positioning, like pincer-flanking an enemy or attacking from off to the side of your more up-close melee teammate. With only two players taking on a couple of enemies, I verbally brushed off the idea of using some more advanced options. My developer partner, using a Deathwalker, interjected: "Ah, but that is what summons are for."</p>
<p>Soon enough, one of the brutes was facing down two skeletons, and I was able to get a nice shot in from an adjacent hex. The next thing I wanted to do was try out being a little selfish, running for some loot left behind by a vanquished goon. I forgot that you only pick up loot if you end your turn on a hex, not just pass through it, so my Banner Spear appeared to go on a little warm-up jog, for no real reason, before re-engaging the Germinate we were facing.</p>
<p>The art, animations, and feel of everything I clicked on was engaging, even as the developers regularly reassured me that all of it needs working on. With many more experienced players kicking the tires in early access, I expect the systems and quality-of-life details to see even more refinement. It's a long campaign, both for players and the developers, but there's a good chance it will be worth it.</p>

I recently got to see a hands-off preview of the game, which strives to combine the team's signature strangeness with the pick-up-and-play appeal of a modern multiplayer shooter. But its best feat may be what it <em>doesn't </em>want to be: your part-time job.</p><p dir="ltr">In FBC Firebreak, teams of three players go on missions called Jobs, in which they have to cleanse various sections of the unpredictable Oldest House, fighting The Hiss with an array of weapons that feels decidedly Remedy-like. Control's wide variety of Hiss enemies was on exciting display in the mission I saw, called Paper Chase, in which FBC first responders had to make it through hordes of corrupted agents using weapons like a piggy-bank mallet, all before fighting a gigantic boss monster that had formed from millions of sticky notes, like a chaotic blend of Office Space and Ghostbusters.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4461923-screenshot2025-03-19110123.png" data-ref-id="1300-4461923" data-ratio="0.55927835051546" data-width="1940" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4461923-screenshot2025-03-19110123.png" data-ref-id="1300-4461923"></a><figcaption>FBC Firebreak leans into some classic co-op mechanics, such as complementary player builds, but it leans into Remedy's weirdness, too.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4461923-screenshot2025-03-19110123.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The demo I saw showed off several "Kits," each of them meant to lean into a type of play and collectively complement each other in a three-person squad. The Jump Kit uses electricity abilities and offers buffs to mobility; the Fix Kit is a tanky offering with a huge wrench for melee attacks; the Splash Kit is designed as a support class that can disrupt the environment using a water-based loadout.</p><p dir="ltr">While the game can be played solo or in pairs, Remedy said it's designed for the full team of three to take on hordes of Hiss. As each Job comprises three zones with different objectives, environments, and challenges presented each time you play, and with each zone escalating in difficulty and culminating in a boss showdown, players short on allies will have their hands full, but it's doable.</p><p dir="ltr">The visual flair, inventive weapons, intense combat, and sly workplace humor shading it all were very reminiscent of Control, but because of the first-person perspective and the game's endlessly replayable mission format, it also reminded me of Left 4 Dead.</p><p dir="ltr">Game director Mike Kayetta told me that although the team looked to other modern shooters for guidance on bringing FBC Firebreak to life, much is owed to that co-op all-timer, too. "Of course, there is no (and should be no) perfect comparison to another game out there [...] especially, the greats like L4D. It's the crowned granddaddy of the whole co-op session thing, and yes, there's been a lot of evolution and movement in games since then, but I don't think anyone could jump into this space without some healthy respect and awe for the original king."</p><p dir="ltr">One thing I learned in writing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-made-left-4-dead-special-according-to-the-devs-making-games-like-it/1100-6503996/">retrospective on Left 4 Dead</a> is how its total lack of a metagame--no battle passes, no leveling system, no endless train of unlockables--is considered by some developers to be a non-starter today. You just can't really build a game like that anymore, a few developers suggested when I spoke to them for that story. FBC Firebreak doesn't go as far as L4D in throwing out <em>all </em>of those elements; you do level up, and there are loadouts to perfect and rewards to unlock, but a major distinction between this game and most others in the multiplayer space today is that it doesn't punish you for not playing on its schedule. Refreshingly, it has no plans to be a live-service game in that sense.</p><p dir="ltr">"Most of that decision came from just being gamers and listening to gamers," Kayetta told me. "So many people are feeling the same thing. There's already too much good stuff out there for me to get through my backlog, and now you want me to play <em>only </em>this game? Or feel too bad because I didn't play this game <em>enough</em>? Maybe I'm just grumpy because I have two kids at home and precious little time to play, but I know I can't be the only one."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4461924-screenshot2025-03-19110142.png" data-ref-id="1300-4461924" data-ratio="0.55975168132437" data-width="1933" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4461924-screenshot2025-03-19110142.png" data-ref-id="1300-4461924"></a><figcaption>The game's story is set six years after the events of Control, and many have made The Oldest House their home.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4461924-screenshot2025-03-19110142.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Funnily enough, I also have two kids at home and have lamented how games ask for my undivided attention to the extent that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/weve-reached-peak-battle-pass-and-i-can-no-longer-keep-up-with-my-favorite-games/1100-6508089/">I sometimes stop playing games I enjoy</a> just because I feel like I'm not able to min-max their metagames properly. Kayetta's words were all too familiar to me, as I'm sure they are to many others reading this now. This feeling was so common within Remedy that the game director told me he couldn't even recall a time when anyone pushed back against the idea and vouched for making the game more of a traditional live service. "No second-guessing. Really, I am sitting here racking my brain for a single example of someone who wanted to do something different and drawing a blank," he said.</p><p dir="ltr">That's not to say FBC Firebreak will be without post-launch support. The game will get free updates such as new missions, and paid cosmetics will be available to engage the community that's playing the game a lot anyway, but if you're among such devotees, it ought to be because you want to be there, not because you feel obligated to show up. There will be "no limited-time rotations or daily log-ins," Remedy said.</p><p dir="ltr">The line between post-launch support and a live-service game is blurry, Kayetta said, "because different people have different takes on what [live service] means. What we do on Firebreak has never been about trying to conform to or buck those trends. We just talked about what was going to provide value to the people who give our game a shot and join the community we're trying to build. And what was reasonable to ask of them in return. This is where we landed."</p><p dir="ltr">It's almost nostalgic to hear a team speak this way about a multiplayer game. It made me think of how many hours I poured into L4D--literally thousands, I'd estimate--and how I did that all without concern for any of the FOMO-inducing metagame systems that now similarly keep me engaged with games I do genuinely enjoy but sometimes play merely to check their proverbial boxes. Some live-service games have opted to offer battle passes that don't expire as a solution, but this hardly helps since newer battle passes are always available too. I've even found this system to be worse sometimes, like when I jumped back into Halo Infinite and found I had about nine earlier passes to work on if I cared to catch up to present-day offerings.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4461965-screenshot2025-03-19110442.png" data-ref-id="1300-4461965" data-ratio="0.56043388429752" data-width="1936" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4461965-screenshot2025-03-19110442.png" data-ref-id="1300-4461965"></a><figcaption>Strange weapons, an abundance of enemy types, and ever-shifting mission objectives are meant to keep the game full of surprises.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4461965-screenshot2025-03-19110442.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">To the extent FBC Firebreak has progression systems, I expect I'll be heavily inspired to max them out anyway. I tend to enjoy Remedy's work, the gameplay demo I saw looked excellent, and I'll no doubt be scrubbing its levels for more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-alan-wake-2-reveals-about-the-remedy-connected-universe/2900-4952/">Remedy Connected Universe</a> teases to dissect in any case. But it's heartening to know I'll be doing all these things because I want to, not because they're some unseen boss's orders.</p><p dir="ltr">FBC Firebreak is coming to PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 this summer. It'll be a "mid-priced title" and, in a rare move, it will launch into both Xbox Game Pass <em>and </em>PlayStation Plus on day one.</p>

                <p>At the Future Games Show: Spring Showcase, publisher Arc Games revealed a video game adaptation of Frosthaven. Based on the popular board game and in production at Snapshot Games, development on the project is being led by CEO and X-COM creator Julian Gollop. Isaac Childres--who designed the Frosthaven board game--is also involved with the adaptation and fans can check out a closed beta playtest for Frosthaven starting March 27 and running through April 24. This will feature six starting character classes and 20 quests to try out.</p><p>"We're very excited to bring Frosthaven into the digital realm," Gollop said in a press release. "With this video game adaptation of Frosthaven, all of us at Snapshot Games know just how beloved the board game is and have been taking great care of replicating the board game experience as much as possible. We feel that fans of the board game, both newcomers and long-time veterans, will find that the video game we're working on is not only a faithful adaptation but also another way to play their favorite board game in a more accessible way to help introduce their friends to the game."</p><p>If you've never played it, Frosthaven is a spiritual successor to the board game Gloomhaven. One of the most successful board games to be crowdfunded through Kickstarter, the core focus of Frosthaven is on carefully managing resources, coming up with powerful synergies between character classes, and exploring a world of grim fantasy. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large"

Games says that players will need to balance risk and reward as they explore the deep mechanics and challenging scenarios of Frosthaven, and while it doesn't have a firm release date yet, it will be released on PC eventually. Other elements that Snapshot is working on for Frosthaven include building and managing your own outpost, tactical turn-based combat, and co-op multiplayer for up to four players.</p>

The news was revealed during the latest Future Games Show. The 2D zombie survival game debuts on April 9 for $25 and is a spinoff of a series that's gathered 150 million downloads on mobile.</p><p>Unlike the original mobile games, which are first-person auto-runners, Into The Dead: Our Darkest Days is a 2D third-person survival game set in Texas circa 1980 that asks players to manage characters' health and wellbeing, scavenge for supplies, and build a base. Combat is best avoided, as just one or two undead monsters can kill playable characters, especially if they're already injured, sick, or tired.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4448328-ss_a18287a7d975ab53c7f4328712cef2d7e46bc326.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448328" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4448328-ss_a18287a7d975ab53c7f4328712cef2d7e46bc326.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448328"></a><figcaption>Into The Dead: Our Darkest Days lets you build out a base, but demands you defend or even ditch it when it's time.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4448328-ss_a18287a7d975ab53c7f4328712cef2d7e46bc326.jpg"></figure><p>Like State of Decay, the game features permadeath, so there are no do-overs and killing off your entire community will spell game over.

            <p>FBC: Firebreak - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-control-developer-remedy-reveals-first-ever-multiplayer-game">Remedy's three-player co-op first person shooter</a> based within Control's Oldest House - is set to release this summer, and now the team has given us a fresh look at the upcoming game.</p>
<p>In FBC: Firebreak, players will take on the role of volunteer first responders, who are doing what they can to help sort out the Hiss that remain within the building - essentially, what happens when the Federal Bureau of Control actually loses control?</p>
<p>The studio shared a new trailer for FBC: Firebreak as part of this evening's Future Game Show presentation, giving us a look at how volatile office stationary can really be! I am talking about lacerating post-it note people - it's chaos!</p>

<p>These post-it note entities are part of FBC: Firebreak's aptly-titled "Paper Chase" job. Jobs are this game's version of missions, with each job being a "wrapper for a unique crisis" within the Oldest House, so if you have played Control, you will recognise locations.</p>
<p>In the case of FBC: Firebreak's Paper Chase job, it's set in the bureau's Executive Sector. "And, just like real world crises, like fires and floods, these things have a way of coming back - your work is important, but never ends," adds game director Mike Kayatta.</p>
<p>As to how FBC: Firebreak will all work, once players have selected a job to take on, they will then select a Threat level - that is to say, decide on the combat difficulty, as well as how many rewards players can earn - as well as a Clearance level. The Clearance Level determines the number of zones players can make their way through, as well as what type of rewards they can earn.</p>
<p>Then, there are FBC: Firebreak's loadouts, or to give them their Remedy name, Crisis Kits. These kits are each centred around a unique tool, and FBC: Firebreak players will have three saved kits to choose from: Jump Kit, Fix Kit and Splash Kit.</p>
<p>The Jump Kit is an electricity-focused Crisis Kit, complete with an Electro-Kinetic Charge Impactor. The Fix Kit comes with a chunky wrench (or, spanner for those of us in Blighty), while the Splash Kit is a water-focused kit with a Crank-Operated Fluidic Ejector.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you are already thinking about FBC: Firebreak's post launch content, well Remedy is on it. The game itself will be a premium mid-price release on its debut, but any playable post-launch content will be free for all owners. There will also be some cosmetic items players can spend some additional money on, if they so choose.</p>

<p>The team at Remedy is, understandably, aware it is about to release a multiplayer shooter into the world during a period when multiplayer shooters are having a hard time standing out - but even so, it says it isn't nervous.</p>
<p>During a Q&amp;A about FBC: Firebreak attended by Eurogamer, the developer said it wasn't concerned about the game finding its niche. "It's not that we are arrogant," said Remedy spokesperson Thomas Puha, "but since the inception of this game, we've very carefully thought [about] who the audience is, and that dictates everything from how we built it - such as how easy it should be to get into, how long the sessions are... we are not going to do a game that [feels like] another job."</p>
<p>Puha continued: "There are reasons why we [Remedy] have managed to survive for 30 years in this industry, which is so volatile. It's managing risks, which means 'let's be careful with the budget and make a game in a sensible budget and time frame'. But also, we are not naive. It's our first multiplayer game, so we are doing everything in our power to make sure things launch well."</p>
<p>Puha added Remedy intends to support FBC: Firebreak for "the longhaul", and the studio has "very concrete plans" on what the post-launch content should look like. "Let's get it out first, and we will take it from there," Puha said.</p>
<p>FBC: Firebreak will be making its debut this summer (a more specific date is TBA) across PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. It will also be available via Game Pass Ultimate and PC, as well as on PlayStation Plus' Extra and Premium tiers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/into-dead-our-darkest-days-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PikPok has announced the release date for zombie shelter survival game&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days</em>, the latest entry in the developer's&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead&nbsp;</em>series and the first one to land on PC.</p>

<p>As revealed during today's Future Games Show presentation,&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days&nbsp;</em>will arrive on PC via Steam Early Access on April 9th. PikPok says it's intending the game to remain in Early Access for "at least a year", but that timeline "may shift".</p>

<p>Previous&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead&nbsp;</em>games were released on mobile devices (and Switch), but&nbsp;<em>Our Darkest Days&nbsp;</em>represents the franchise's first foray into the land of PC. It's also getting a native Mac port.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days-release-date-stained-glass.jpg?itok=ry8Ywd4A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days-release-date-stained-glass.jpg?itok=Bj9QN4si 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days&nbsp;</em>is coming to Steam in April.</figcaption></figure><p>As you might expect from an&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead&nbsp;</em>game (assuming you've played one before, of course),&nbsp;<em>Our Darkest Days&nbsp;</em>offers side-scrolling action blended with base management and survival horror-style exploration.</p>

<p>From your shelter (which can, of course, be upgraded), you'll sally forth into the city of Walton to scavenge for supplies and help your camp to survive. Of course, along the way, you'll have to deal with the undead.</p>

<p>PikPok describes&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days</em>' world as "dynamic and challenging"; you'll be faced with decisions like whether to recruit allies or leave people to fend for themselves, how to manage your camp's "physical and psychological needs", and more.</p>

<p>Intriguingly, the developer says that entire parts of the town "may become overrun and completely uninhabitable" as you play, necessitating a shelter move or perhaps even abandonment. It's all down to you.</p>




<p>You may be a little worried about&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days&nbsp;</em>if you can remember the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/day-before-will-completely-shut-down-in-janhuary-as-steam-will-refund-all-players" rel="nofollow">last zombie survival game</a> that tried to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fntastic-the-day-before-social-media" rel="nofollow">make a name for itself</a> on Steam, but this one looks like it's much more reasonably scoped, so hopefully, we won't get a repeat of that debacle.</p>

<p><em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2239710/Into_the_Dead_Our_Darkest_Days/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on April 9th.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord">Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord</a>, is coming up to three years now, but at the Future Games Show this evening, all these years on, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/taleworlds-entertainment">TaleWorlds Entertainment</a> announced that the strategy action game will be getting its first bit of DLC, War Sails. If you can't gather from the name, featured image above, and trailer below, the DLC is all about boats; sailing 'em, fighting with 'em, trading with 'em, you name it, these boats can do it (within reason).
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
War Sails quite notably is introducing a Viking-inspired faction, where you can do your usual thing of deciding to trade, recruit, or fight them (once you've made your way to the Northern Kingdom anyway). Based on details from a press release, sailing won't be as easy as 1, 2, 3 as you'll have wind and water physics to deal with.

<p>
But one thing that does sound neat, and you can catch a glimpse of in the trailer above, is that you'll be able to ram into and board enemy ships, as well as destroy their oars and tear their sails. Sounds like a slightly more in-depth take on what <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> has going on, and I'm quite fond of that game.
</p>
<p>
The DLC will have 18 ships to choose from, all of which handle differently and can be upgraded, and you'll be able to unlock more banners, hairstyles, tattoos, armour, that sort of thing. You've not long to wait either, as it's set to be released this coming June 17th.
</p>
<p>
On top of all that, more free updates are planned too that'll bring in some new mechanics like a stealth and disguise system, a Parley feature, and general combat improvements. Best keep your eyes peeled for that one.

            <p>Frosthaven - the sequel to Cephalofair's knock-a-horse-out massive board game - is getting a digital version from Julian Gollop's Snapshot Games. You can <a href="http://playfrosthaven.com/">sign up here</a> to its closed beta kicking off March 27th, and it's coming to Steam early access later this year.</p>
<p>Like predecessor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gloomhaven">Gloomhaven</a>, Frosthaven is a tactical <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> where you'll resolve story events and encounters between dungeon delving, retiring old characters and unlocking new classes as you progress. New to Frosthaven is a fleshed-out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">management game</a> that has you build up and  protect an outpost, while dealing with harsh seasons and invaders.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I really <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gloomhaven-pc-review">enjoyed Gloomhaven digital</a>, mostly for not getting in the tabletop game's way to much, but also for not requiring glue to put third party token trays together. Core to the game is tactical card combat where everything from movement to spellcasting is dictated by your hand. You pick two cards a turn from a deck you customise as you progress, and select actions from the top of one card and the bottom of the other. Each card also has an initiative value, so you're constantly assessing threats to see if you can pull off slower moves, or even whether you're better off sacrificing advanced plays altogether and opting for the generic attack or move option each card offers.</p>
<p>You can get old cards back by resting, but this means burning others. It's all crunchier than a Crunchy bar dredged in grit then left out to dry under an alien sun that emanates ultra-crunchy crunch rays, but  also full of character and a bit of roleplaying.</p>
<p>Designer Isaac Childres has consulted on the digital version throughout development, and Snapshot say they've spent a lot of time getting the feel of the world right in motion. In a preview session I attended recently, Director Hristo Petkov gave me the example of the Snowdancer. She's a bestial, graceful hero character whose dance-like fighting style the team had originally animated as similar to Capoeira - before Childres told them he'd imagined it closer to ballet. There's an entire environment named the Metallic Ruins in the digital version that only exists as prose in the board game, and they've worked closely with Childres to bring it to life here.</p>
<p>They're keen to highlight a more robust tutorial this time, too - also designed by Childres - alongside some more granular difficulty selections, including ones that prevent you getting exhausted and failing. The early access version has 35 quests across the first two acts of the game, with the full game planned to have over 130. There's also 2-4 player co-op multiplayer. I'm excited! I never ended up buying Frosthaven, since I'd also need to start sleeping on the box to justify the space investment, so this suits me just fine.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
