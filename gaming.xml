<p>A new Chapter has arrived in Fortnite with the launch of Chapter 7 Season 1, which brings the customary refresh of weapons and equipment found in the loot pool alongside it.</p>



<p>Fortnite Chapter 7 kicked off on the back of the huge Zero Point live event, attended by over 10 million players, which saw stars from the likes of Star Wars, Marvel, DC Comics, The Simpsons, and K-Pop Demon Hunters unite to fend off the Dark Presence.</p>



<p>Spring Break has now arrived in Fortnite as a result, and Insider Gaming has all the details on the new and unvaulted weapons in Chapter 7 Season 1.</p>

<p><strong>There are eight new weapons and pieces of equipment added in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, including a new mobility item—Wingsuits.</strong></p>



<p>The importance of Wingsuits early in the season is vital following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-happened-to-the-battle-bus-fortnite-chapter-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">destruction of the Battle Bus</a>, as surfing the waves onto the island provide limited landing spots. If you get your hands on a Wingsuit early, traversing the map becomes much easier and you can head to further locations to hunt for loot, where there’s likely to be less competition.</p>



<p>A full list of the new weapons and equipment found in Fortnite this season are below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Iron Pump Shotgun</li>



<li>Twin Hammer Shotguns</li>



<li>Deadeye Assault Rifle</li>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-all-unvaulted-weapons-amp-equipment-in-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1">All Unvaulted Weapons &amp; Equipment in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1</h2>



<p><strong>Five weapons have been unvaulted for Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, alongside the return of the All Terrain Kart and a host of healing items.</strong></p>



<p>The likes of Chug Jugs, Shield Kegs, Med Kits, Bandages, and Shield Potions remain available, while players in Zero Build can continue to find Shield Bubble Jr and Port-a-Fort items to utilize.</p>



<p>On the weapon scene, the return of the Enforcer AR provides options from mid-to-long range, while there’s plenty of options for short-range combat with the Dual Micro SMGs and Tactical Pistol.</p>

            <p>Surprise! Chris Redfield, Excella Gionne, and an adult version of Sherry Birkin are all on their way to Resident Evil: Survival Unit.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-new-resident-evil-game-has-been-announced">Resident Evil Survival Unit was unveiled over the summer</a>. Co-developed by Aniplex Inc and Joycity Corporation, with Capcom working in "close collaboration" with the studios to "ensure authenticity and quality", the free-to-play mobile strategy game is now available. Which is why fans have already poked around in the back end of the Android version and discovered references to as-yet unreleased characters.</p>

<p>The mobile game released with 19 characters, comprising a mix of new and fresh faces. As is usually the case, some are free and some are not, but as yet, we hadn't heard anything about series stalwart Chris Redfield at all, or been officially told of the pending arrival of Sherry and Excella.</p><p>However, as reported by Portuguese site <a href="https://residentevil.com.br/noticias/chris-redfield-sherry-birkin-e-excella-gionne-estao-nos-arquivos-de-resident-evil-survival-unit/">REvil</a>, skins of a young RE1-era Redfield, Sherry, and Excella have all been discovered in the character database of the Android version, along with images of an all-new monster created especially for this game, thought to be called Mortem.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-has-v11-vacuum-black-friday-leftovers-now-near-zero-profit-to-clear-stock-for-cyber-monday-2000648918</link>
            <guid>1368577</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dyson still sells older models like the V8 that launched nearly a decade ago, but if you want cleaning power that really removes embedded dirt from carpets, you need something more recent with stronger suction and better brush technology. The newest Gen5 models cost around $1,000 which feels excessive for a vacuum regardless of how good it performs so finding middle ground makes sense for most households.</p>
<p>The Dyson V11 Origin hits that sweet spot with powerful suction and modern features without the premium flagship pricing and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">Amazon just dropped it to $399 for Cyber Monday weekend, down from the usual $629</a>. This marks a record low for post-Black Friday clearance and offers 37% off one of Dyson’s most capable cordless vacuums.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>185 Air Watts That Clean Carpets Deeply</h2>
<p>The <strong>Dyson V11 has 185 air watts of suction power</strong> which is 60% more than earlier V-series models, and it has enough power to pull dirt that is stuck in carpet fibers that other cordless vacuums leave behind. The motorbar cleaner head has a<strong> motorized brush bar with anti-tangle technology</strong> that actively removes hair that has gotten stuck in it while you clean. This means you won’t have to cut hair off the roller every few days which is a pain, and it is very important if you have pets or long hair in the house because regular brush bars turn into useless tangles of hair after a week of use.</p>



<p>You can<strong> choose between three power modes to control the balance</strong> between suction strength and runtime. Auto mode automatically changes the power level based on the type of floor and the amount of dirt, giving you the best cleaning while using the least amount of battery power for everyday tasks. By lowering suction, Eco mode can extend runtime by up to 60 minutes which is great for quick touch-ups or cleaning big areas with light dirt. When you have to clean up a lot of tracked-in mud or pet accidents, boost mode gives you the most suction for about five minutes. The <strong>LCD screen shows the current power mode</strong>, how much time is left until the battery runs out (down to the second), maintenance alerts when the filters need to be cleaned and blockage alerts when something blocks the system.</p>
<p>The hair screw tool has a conical brush bar that is made to spiral long hair and pet hair into the collection bin without getting tangled: It makes it very useful for cleaning upholstery, stairs, and car interiors where pet hair gets stuck deep down. The crevice tool can get into tight spaces between cushions and along baseboards. The mini soft dusting brush, on the other hand, is great for cleaning delicate surfaces like lampshades and keyboards<strong>. In just a few seconds, you can also switch to handheld mode by taking off the wand</strong>.</p>



<p>Advanced <strong>whole-machine filtration catches 99.99% of particles as small as 0.3 microns</strong> and keeps allergens, dust mites, and pet dander inside the sealed system instead of letting them back into the air. People with allergies will benefit greatly from this HEPA-level filtration because the air that comes out is cleaner than the air in most homes. The bagless design lets you empty the bin with just one button press which ejects dirt without you having to touch it.</p>
<p>The lithium-ion battery keeps the suction strong as it drains, unlike older nickel-based batteries which lose power slowly over time. The docking station that hangs on the wall charges the vacuum and keeps the tools that come with it close at hand so everything is organized and ready for quick cleanups. And it <strong>takes about 4.5 hours to charge from empty to full</strong>&nbsp;and you can still take the battery out if you want to buy a spare for long cleaning sessions.</p>
<p>Instead of paying $629 for the V11 Origin, you can get it for $399 and it saves you $230 on a vacuum that usually stays at a high price because it is Dyson’s best-selling model between entry-level and flagship levels. This is your last chance to get premium Dyson performance before stock runs out and prices go back up.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/if-you-have-apple-devices-anker-3-in-1-magsafe-charger-is-flying-off-the-shelves-at-a-record-low-2000648819</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Anker has been breaking its own records with portable charging solutions lately, and we’re here for it. If you rely on multiple devices to get through your day, like your smartphone, smartwatch, and earbuds, you need something that can top all three up without the usual cord clutter. The Anker 3-in-1 MagGo UFO charger for iOS does exactly that, and today is a great time to pick one up without paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6106/">On a regular day, you’d expect to pay around $90 for it, but thanks to Cyber Monday, this all-in-one charging solution just dropped to $57, after a nice 36% discount.</a> All color options are discounted, but the prices vary. For instance, the black and pink versions are sitting at $57, while the white is going for $56, $1 less. The Teal version, on the other hand, is up for grabs at $59. All the offers are open to all shoppers, meaning you can score the discount whether you’re a Prime member or not.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6106/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Size of a Baseball</h2>
<p>When folded, this charger is the size of a baseball and resembles a macaron in looks. It’s much more compact than traditional adapters, meaning you can just slip it into your pocket and get going. Sturdiness comes from the built-in silicone strap, while the skin-friendly texture makes it comfortable to take it with you on the go. When opened, it offers three charging stations for three of your essentials; iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods.</p>
<p>Just drop each on its respective station, and it’s going to top them up in no time. Even better, you don’t always have to lay the whole thing open to use it. Support for Standby mode lets you keep the charger folded and still use your phone in landscape, which is perfect for when you want to stream a show, set a timer, display a calendar, or take a quick video call while it’s being powered.</p>



<p>The 15W capacity isn’t massive, but it’s enough to power your devices without much waiting. It can get an iPhone 15 Pro to 20% in 15 minutes and an Apple Watch Series 9 to 30% in 22 minutes. As for the compatibility, the charger plays nicely with iPhone Series 12 through 17 (except iPhone SE), Apple Watch Series 11/10/9/8/7 Ultra, plus Apple Watch Series 1-6, AirPods 2/3/4, and AirPods Pro 2, as well as the latest Pro 3.</p>
<p>Safety is taken just as seriously. ActiveShield 2.0 monitors temperature over 3,000,000 times per day to prevent overheating. The box comes with the wireless charging station, a 40W adapter, a 5 ft (1.5 m) USB-C to USB-C cable, a welcome guide, and a 24-month warranty for some extra peace of mind.</p>
<p>This early Cyber Monday deal lets you save an impressive $33 on a compact, all-in-one charging solution that’s both efficient and portable. You can use it on your trips if you like travelling light, or even at home to reduce the typical cord clutter. In fact, it can also make a great gift for a tech enthusiast in your life!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Chapter 7 has kicked off in Fortnite, but an array of popular modes, including Blitz, Reload, and Fortnite OG, are not yet available in Season 1, but the roadmap has been detailed.</p>



<p>Fortnite brought an end to Chapter 6 with the thrilling Zero Point live event, showcasing a wealth of collabs with recognisable faces from K-Pop Demon Hunter, Marvel, DC Comics, Star Wars, The Simpsons, and more, all featuring.</p>



<p>Chapter 7 Season 1 is now underway, and, while not all game modes are available, Insider Gaming has the details on when to expect their return.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-reload-return-to-fortnite">When Does Reload Return to Fortnite?</h2>

<p><strong>Reload returns to Fortnite on December 4, once the Battle Bus is back in commission and available to take players to the new Surf City map.</strong></p>



<p>The Battle Bus was destroyed in the closing moments of the Chapter 7, Season 1 trailer, though Dummy is hard at work repairing the iconic mode of transportation, and <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-seven-pacific-break-v39-00-update-notes?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games shared a Fortnite roadmap</a> for the coming weeks.</p>



<p>When Reload returns, the new map, Surf City, will be available, featuring a smaller version of the main map, with POIs including Sus Studios, Divey Dam, and Battlewood Boulevard.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-blitz-return-to-fortnite">When Does Blitz Return to Fortnite?</h2>



<p><strong>Blitz returns to Fortnite on December 4, the same day as Reload is back and when Ranked is available again, when the Battle Bus is back in commission.</strong></p>



<p>A new map, Starfall Island, will serve as the environment for Blitz this season, with POIs including Ritzy Redux, Holloway House, and Flowberry Fields.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-fortnite-og-return">When Does Fortnite OG Return?</h2>



<p><strong>Fortnite OG players will need to wait a little while longer for the return of the mode, as it will be out of commission until December 11.</strong></p>



<p>When Fortnite OG is back, Season 7 will kick off in the mode, and the arrival could come alongside the start of the fan-favorite Winterfest event, adding extra content to the game in preparation for the holiday season.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-delulu-return-to-fortnite">When Does Delulu Return to Fortnite?</h2>



<p><strong>Delulu players face the longest wait of all for the mode to return, as Delulu will not be available until December 12, Epic Games has confirmed.</strong></p>



<p>The proximity-chat mode is expected to stay permanently; however, following an introduction in Chapter 6, it adds to the plethora of game modes available in Fortnite.</p>

<p>According to Epic, Chapter Seven: Pacific Break "kicks off a new era" for Fortnite Battle Royale, "where some of the greatest stories are told – the Golden Coast". Expect New POIs such as Battlewood Boulevard, Sandy Strip, Wonkeeland, Classified Canyon, and more, and while the Battle Bus is out of commission, players will "Storm Surf their way to the Island instead".</p>
<p>Players can also expect new gameplay, too.</p>
<p>"In the <em>very rare occasion </em>players are downed, they can use a Self-Revive Device to revive themselves while they’re DBNO (Down But Not Out)," Epic explained of the new Stay in the Game mechanic. "Additionally, new DBNO movement options include Roll &amp; Tumble, DBNO Sprint, and Stay on the Move. Lastly, Drivable Reboot Vans have rolled onto the Island."</p><div>

<p>You'll also be able to claim loot, powers, and transformative skills when you defeat a boss, with full Health and Shield, bonus max Health and Shield, infinite Energy, and a "powerful ability". Doing so, however, will ensure you're visible to nearby opponents, so be careful.</p>
<p>There's also Simple Build, an option in Settings (Game &gt; Building) that "makes learning how to build simpler".</p>
<p>"Turn it on, look in the direction you want to build, and just… build!" Epic said.</p>
<p>Of course, with each new chapter comes a new battle pass, and this one boasts The Bride, Marty McFly, and Fortnite Originals like Miles Cross and Cat Holloway. As Epic explained: "In addition to their other unlockable Styles, the Battle Pass includes special Styles for three of the Outfits: Cat Holloway, Carter Wu, and Dark Voyager (Reality Redacted). Unlock these additional Styles by completing Quests in Blitz Royale, Reload, and Battle Royale respectively."</p><p>Don't forget that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-narrative-sequel-to-kill-bill-is-premiering-in-fortnite">The Lost Chapter: Yuki's Revenge will premiere in Fortnite later today</a> (30th November) at 2pm, ET / 11am PT / 7pm GMT / 8pm CET. It's an animated movie made in the Fortnite engine, directed and written by Quentin Tarantino. You can access the premiere 30 minutes before its starting time, so be sure to get there early.</p>
<p>This comes shortly after Fortnite gave the world <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-x-simpsons-caused-a-spike-in-new-and-returning-players">a hugely popular Simpsons crossover</a>, which brought back a record number of returning players.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-just-threw-the-breville-barista-coffee-machine-into-clearance-mode-right-after-black-friday-2000648660</link>
            <guid>1368550</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Can’t start your day without a warm (or cold) cup of joe first thing in the morning? You need a good coffee machine at home, because those instant options aren’t the most flavorful, and heading out to your local cafe in your pajamas isn’t very ideal. Yes, coffee machines can cost a pretty penny, but that’s what sales like Black Friday and Cyber Monday are for. Even though the event is over, there are still plenty of deals to be had across a wide range of categories, including kitchen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5371/">One of our favorites? This 29% discount on the highly-rated Breville Barista Express espresso machine, which brings the price down to $500</a>. You’re saving a straightforward $200 on a machine that’s going to help you make delicious cappuccinos and lattes within minutes, and the discount applies to both Black Sesame and Brushed Stainless Steel options. Looking for something that makes a bold statement? Black looks absolutely stunning. Prefer sticking to the classics? You’re going to love the stainless steel version. There are no delivery charges to worry about either. Just add the item to your cart, checkout, and enjoy barista-level coffee from the comfort of your own home.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5371/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Rich Flavors Every Time, Without Stepping Out of Your Home</h2>
<p>Breville Barista Express uses a four-key formula to give you the results you want, including precision puck, extraction pressure, extraction temperature, and microfoam bubbles. It is part of the Barista Series that offers all-in-one espresso machines with an integrated grinder that lets you choose between 16 precision grind settings. These convert beans into espresso within seconds, extracting all the goodness hidden in there.</p>
<p>The thermocoil heating system controls water pressure, while the steam wands turn milk into smooth microfoam with a silky texture for you to get creative with latte art. To extract all that rich flavor and aroma, the coffee machine starts with a low-pressure infusion and then ramps it up gradually. The result? A well-balanced, rich cup that feels straight out of your favorite coffee shop.</p>



<p>All the controls are right there on the machine, and they’re pretty easy to follow. You can pick a grind amount, a filter size, a program, and the number of cups you’re hoping to fill. Your purchase will also come with 2 free bags of specialty coffee, which makes it easy to get started without paying anything extra. Other accessories include a razor-dose trimming tool, a 54mm stainless steel portafilter, 1 &amp; 2 cup single and dual wall filter baskets, coffee scoop, integrated tamper, stainless steel milk jug, cleaning disc, tablets, brush tool, allen key, water filter, and a filter holder. There’s also a 1-year limited warranty included for some peace of mind, just in case something goes wrong.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking for a convenient way of making professional-level coffee at home, this deal offers a great chance to grab one of the best coffee machines out there for less. It may look intimidating at first, but getting started is straightforward and shouldn’t take more than a couple of tries to perfect your coffee recipe.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new Chapter in Fortnite has begun, and significant changes have arrived alongside it, including the absence of the Battle Bus when launching into a game of Battle Royale.</p>



<p>Rather than the familar approach of hitching a ride on the Battle Bus, players instead ride a huge wave to arrive at the island, which impacts landing zones as the maximum distance of travelling is shorter.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering what has happened to the Battle Bus and whether the change is permanent, Insider Gaming has all the important details.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-is-the-battle-bus-in-fortnite">Where is The Battle Bus in Fortnite?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>RIP. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Battle Bus in Fortnite is no more, having been destroyed at the end of the launch trailer for Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, marking the end of an era.</strong></p>



<p>After the climatic battle to defeat the Dark Presence in the Zero Point event, which saw a who’s who of collabs featuring the likes of Star Wars, Marvel, Superman, K-Pop Demon Hunters, Homer Simpson, Godzilla, Hatsune Miku, and more, it appeared that the band of misfits had gotten by unscathed.</p>



<p>However, that was not the case as in the closing seconds of the Chapter 7 Season 1 launch trailer, the Battle Bus was blown out of the sky, and now, instead of thanking the bus driver when entering a match, you pay respects instead as you surf the waves on the way to the island.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-battle-bus-coming-back">Is the Battle Bus Coming Back?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, the Battle Bus is returning to Fortnite and is not gone permanently, and the absence of the Battle Bus is only for a few days, as it will be back in commission on December 4.</strong></p>



<p>The wreckage of the Battle Bus can be found on the island in Chapter 7, Season 1, and interacting with Dummy, an NPC, nearby results in a mini quest to gather materials to repair the bus, which Dummy intends to do.</p>



<p>At the start of Chapter 7, popular alternative modes to Battle Royale like Reload, Blitz, and Fortnite OG are not available, due to the bus being destroyed, but they will be back in the near future—which implies the bus will also be returning.</p>



<p>Expect the repair of the Battle Bus to play a major part in the early parts of the story in Chapter 7, Season 1, with more to be revealed in the coming weeks.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-most-subscribed-streamers-tarkov-creators/</link>
            <guid>1368544</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov is once again blowing up as the game pushes through the 1.0 release window and into whatever comes next. Two weeks ago, the game graduated from a beta state it had sat in for almost eight years, moving into a full release format and being listed on Steam for the first time.</p>



<p>Now, thanks to an ongoing Twitch Drops campaign, the game is bigger than ever on the popular streaming platform, and the most-subscribed creators on the site are dedicated solely to Escape from Tarkov. They beat everyone from Kai Cenat to Caseoh, and from Jynxzi to Jason the Ween.</p>







<h2 id="h-escape-from-tarkov-on-top-by-almost-double">Escape from Tarkov On Top… By Almost Double</h2>



<p>The biggest streamer in the world right now by active subscriptions on Twitch is Pestily, arguably the most prolific Escape from Tarkov streamer in the business. Pestily has been streaming Tarkov since the earliest days and is almost synonymous with the extraction shooter, having become something of a personal friend to the title’s developers at Battlestate Games.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Pestily boasted a whopping 132,310 subscriptions, all thanks to an ongoing Twitch Drops campaign that sees Escape from Tarkov players rewarded for gifting subs to streamers broadcasting the game.</p>



<p>This makes Pestily the most-subscribed streamer on the planet.</p>



<p>He’s closely followed by LVNDMARK (read: Landmark), a North American creator who sat on 90,404 subscriptions at the time of publishing.</p>



<p>The list doesn’t end there, though, as here are some other Escape from Tarkov creators <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/subscribers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">topping the leaderboard</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>SheefGG – 53,942</li>



<li>Glorious_E – 31,240</li>



<li>WillerZ – 17,579</li>



<li>Gingy – 15,781</li>



<li>StankRat – 10,121</li>
</ul>



<p>Behind Pestily, the next closest streamer in terms of subscriptions is Kai Cenat, with 70,097.</p>



<p>Sure, most of these subscriptions will be short-lived, as they’ll have been gifted on a one-month basis that will see tens of thousands of them disappear when the renewal window rolls around next month, but it’s nothing if not indicative of the sheer power of Escape from Tarkov, even ten years after it hit the market in alpha.</p>







<p>Have you given any gifted subs to secure drops in Escape from Tarkov? Let us know which streamer you’ve backed on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-makes-a-zero-profit-move-as-airpods-pro-3-hits-an-all-time-low-close-to-pro-2-discount-pricing-2000648773</link>
            <guid>1368529</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="290">Apple introduced the highly anticipated AirPods Pro 3 just a couple short months ago, and just in time for the holidays, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">these popular earbuds are already seeing a discount thanks to Cyber Monday.</a> The earbuds launched with a price tag of $249, but this week you can scoop them up for 12% off. That ends up saving you $29, with the price coming down to just $220. So if you’re searching for a standout gift or just treating yourself to an upgrade, now is the perfect opportunity to grab a pair.</p>
<p data-start="292" data-end="812">So, what’s new about the AirPods Pro 3? The AirPods Pro 3 now feature an improved real-time noise canceling, removing up to twice the noise as the previous generation was capable of.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="814" data-end="1252">The battery life has also been improved. You can now enjoy up to 10 hours of listening time (eight hours with active noise cancellation enabled) on a single charge—ideal for long flights or long days at the office. The charging case retains its MagSafe compatibility and now includes a built-in speaker, which helps you locate it using Apple’s “Find My” feature. If your case slips between couch cushions or gets lost in your bag, the speaker will ping, making it easier to track down.</p>
<p data-start="1254" data-end="1617">Apple has also upgraded the fit of the AirPods Pro 3. The updated design allows for better in-ear stability during physically demanding activities such as running, HIIT, yoga, and more. The earbuds now come with new foam-infused ear tips in five different sizes. This is includes a new XXS size to better fit ears of all shapes and sizes.</p>
<p data-start="1254" data-end="1617">Another welcome change is the switch from Lightning to USB-C for charging. This aligns the AirPods Pro 3 with Apple’s 2025 product lineup and simplifies the charging process for users with other USB-C devices. Of course, the case still supports Qi wireless charging, so if you already have wireless charging pads at home, you can continue using them without any issues.</p>


<h2 data-start="1254" data-end="1617">Smart Features</h2>
<p>The features of other Apple products seem to be leaking their way across product lines. Much like an Apple Watch,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/"> the AirPods Pro 3</a> are now capable of heart rate sensing. Track your heart rate and calories burned for up to 50 different workouts. You can access the data tracked via your iPhone.</p>
<p data-start="1619" data-end="1988">The AirPods Pro 3 now support live translation. With the help of Apple Intelligence, you can communicate with someone across languages — having your AirPods translate to your native tongue in real-time, right in your ear. Ever read <em>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em>. We now have real-world babel fish.</p>
<p data-start="2499" data-end="2884">While the AirPods Pro 3 aren’t exactly a budget buy, they are the most refined version of Apple’s flagship earbuds to date. You get enhanced sound quality, noise cancellation, and thoughtful design improvements. If you’ve been considering a pair, now’s the time to take advantage of the discount before the holiday rush. Own them for just $220 for a limited time.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-sells-15-6-portable-monitor-for-peanuts-fhd-screen-works-with-switch-and-laptop-2000648886</link>
            <guid>1368520</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  Extend your workspace or game on a 15.6-inch Full HD IPS display anywhere.
                </p><div>
              
              <p>Small screens on laptops or handheld consoles (like the Switch) are fine for most things but they can be hard to see when you’re trying to find enemies in competitive games or edit spreadsheets with small text that hurts your eyes. A portable monitor fixes this by giving you a full-sized screen wherever you need one.</p>
<p>The<em> Arzopa A1</em> has a <strong>15.6-inch Full HD screen and can connect to almost anything with USB-C or HDMI</strong> which makes it great for gaming, working or streaming. For Cyber Monday, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5746/">Amazon drops the price of this portable monitor from its usual $104 to $63</a> and this is the lowest price ever which it almost too cheap to pass up to buy a second screen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5746/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>IPS Panel Quality in a Package That’s Easy to Take on Trips</h2>
<p>This monitor has a 15.6-inch IPS panel with a resolution of 1920×1080 and the text is clear and the colors are bright which makes spreadsheets and games look sharp. The<strong> IPS technology lets you see the screen from 178 degrees both horizontally and vertically</strong> so the picture stays the same even when you look at it from the side or from above. This is important when you’re sharing the screen with someone next to you or when you have to put the monitor at an angle because of lack of desk space.</p>



<p>The <strong>60Hz refresh rate</strong> works well for regular gaming and work tasks, but competitive gamers might notice a difference when playing fast-paced shooters on 120Hz or 144Hz monitors. <strong>Response time is about 5ms</strong> which is fine for casual games, RPGs and strategy games where clear visuals are more important than quick reactions. The 16:9 aspect ratio works with most laptop screens and gaming consoles so there are no black bars when you mirror displays or make your workspace bigger.</p>
<p>The <strong>built-in kickstand folds out from the metal back panel</strong> and locks into different positions which means you can use it on desks, tables or even your lap without needing a separate stand. This design saves space when you travel and gets rid of extra accessories you would have to pack. The m<strong>onitor is only 1.6 pounds and 0.35 inches thick at its thinnest point</strong> so it fits easily into laptop bags or backpacks with your other gear.</p>



<p><strong>USB-C ports</strong> that can handle both video and power from compatible laptops are part of the connectivity which means that everything can be connected with just one cable, so you don’t need a separate power adapter. The <strong>mini-HDMI port</strong> can take signals from gaming consoles, desktop computers, cameras, or any other device with an HDMI output. If your laptop can’t provide enough power, the monitor can get power from a separate USB-C power adapter or through USB-C from your laptop.</p>
<p>The package comes with the monitor,<strong> a USB-C to USB-C cable, a USB-C to USB-A cable, a mini-HDMI to HDMI cable, and a case that protects the monitor</strong> and acts as a screen cover while it’s being moved. It only takes a few seconds to set up because all you have to do is plug in the right cable and the display turns on by itself.</p>
<p>If you buy this portable monitor for $63 instead of $104, you’ll get a price that beats most basic external displays while still keeping Full HD resolution and IPS quality. For less than the cost of budget monitors that don’t have portability features, you get a real portable second screen with a built-in stand, multiple ways to connect, and compatibility with a wide range of devices.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-drops-the-new-fire-tv-soundbar-plus-to-an-all-time-low-losing-all-margin-to-rival-jbl-and-bose-2000648813</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  Enjoy 3D, room-filling audio for all your favorite content.
                </p><div>
              
              <p>Cyber Monday deals are rolling in. Most of these are Black Friday discounts being carried into the weekend, so if you missed grabbing something during the sale, there’s still a chance to bag it for less.</p>
<p>While several retailers are offering plenty of discounts, Amazon is being the most generous right now. It’s offering up to 50% off its own devices, taking hundreds off security cameras, smart displays, streaming sticks, Kindles, and more. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">Those looking to give their entertainment setup an upgrade this holiday season should consider nabbing the latest Fire TV Soundbar Plus while it’s going at a 40% discount</a>. This brings the price down to just $150. You’re saving a massive $100 on an audio solution that’s going to make it easy to hear dialogues clearly, plus enjoy your favorite tunes to the fullest. Even better, both Prime and non-Prime members will enjoy free delivery on their purchase, which adds even more value to the offer.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Multiple Audio Modes</h2>
<p>Design-wise, it’s pretty similar to the older Fire TV soundbars. It sits nicely on your TV console without drawing too much attention to itself, and can even be mounted on a wall for a clean, tidy setup. But despite the compact frame, it does not compromise on the sound. Three full-range speakers, three tweeters, and two woofers push audio in all directions. Pair that with Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, and you’ll enjoy a 3D, room-filling experience that pulls you in, making you feel like you’re a part of whatever is playing on the screen. Sound mimics real life; the Battle of Pelennor Fields from The Lord of the Rings plays out as if it’s happening right in your living room. Watching a scary movie? Footsteps and whispers are going to feel like they’re coming from behind, making the whole thing even spookier.</p>
<p>The Dialogue Enhancer works overtime to keep the conversations sharp by actively pushing voices above background sounds, even with low volume. You won’t have to constantly rewind just to hear what was said. You can also choose between multiple audio modes that optimize the sound based on what’s playing. These include Movie, Music, Sports, and Night modes. The night mode for instance, delivers balanced audio that won’t wake the entire home up, while the music mode gives bass a boost. Speaking of music, you can even use the soundbar as a speaker by connecting it to your smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth and streaming your favorite tracks.</p>



<p>Setting everything up and getting started couldn’t be simpler. Plug your soundbar’s HDMI cable into your TV’s eARC/ARC port, and power the TV on with your remote. The audio will instantly change from your TV to the soundbar; simple as that. As for the compatibility, it plays nicely with just about any smart TV, plus the screens connected to streaming media players.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">There’s a lot more to like about this soundbar, especially now that it’s going at a $100 discount.</a> This deal lets you grab it for just $150, which is basically nothing for all that it’s packed with. It’s an early Cyber Monday deal, but keeping past trends in mind, we’re expecting it to expire soon. If you’ve been after a reliable audio solution, today is the day to make the move. You’re also going to enjoy free delivery if you place your orders before Dec. 4.</p>

<p>Boy, was 1992 a different time for computer games. Epic MegaGames’ <em>Jill of the Jungle</em> illustrates that as well as any other title from the era. Designed and programmed by Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, the game was meant to prove that console-style games of the original Nintendo era could work just as well on PCs. (Later, the onus of proof would often be in the reverse direction.)</p>
<p>Also, it had a female protagonist, which Sweeney saw as a notable differentiator at the time. That’s pretty wild to think about in an era of <em>Tomb Raider</em>‘s Lara Croft, <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>‘s Aloy,&nbsp;<em>Life is Strange</em>‘s Max Caulfield,&nbsp;<em>Returnal</em>‘s Selene Vassos,&nbsp;<em>Control</em>‘s Jesse Faden,&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>‘ Ellie Williams, and a seemingly endless list of others—to say nothing of the fact that many players of all genders who played the games <em>Mass Effect</em> and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> seem to agree that the female protagonist options in those are more compelling than their male alternatives.</p>
<p>As wacky as it is to remember that the idea of a female character was seen as exceptional at any point (and with the acknowledgement that this game was nonetheless not the first to do that), it’s still neat to see how forward-thinking Sweeney was in many respects—and not just in terms of cultural norms in gaming.</p>
<h2>Gameplay to stand the test of time</h2>
<p>Having been born in the early 80s to a computer programmer father, I grew up on MS-DOS games the way many kids did on Atari, Nintendo, or PlayStation. Even I’ll admit that, as much as I enjoyed the DOS platformers, they don’t hold up very well against their console counterparts. (Other genres are another story, of course.)</p>
<p>I know this is blasphemy for some of my background and persuasion, but <em>Commander Keen</em>‘s weird, floaty controls are frustrating, and what today’s designers call the “game feel” just isn’t quite right.</p>

<p>Too many platformer games on PC in the ’80s and ’90s were frustrating to play, and they offered very little ammunition for a PC user to use in an argument with a Super Nintendo or Sega Genesis (Mega Drive) owner to convince them that PC that costs thousands of dollars is better for <em>those types of games</em> than the much-cheaper consoles; there were both technical and cultural reasons for this</p>
<p>With <em>Jill of the Jungle</em>, Sweeney was one of the first to give PC players that ammunition.</p>
<p>I replayed the entire trilogy of episodes, which is <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fjill_of_the_jungle_the_complete_trilogy">bundled into one package on GOG</a>, in one afternoon recently. It was fun as hell. The movement and jumping are as responsive as you want them to be, and the level design is ingeniously creative. It ramps up in difficulty across the episodes at an appropriate pace, but it’s never unfairly frustrating.</p>
<p>Even the graphics have aged decently well. Yeah, they look retro—but in the fun, nostalgic way Super Nintendo games look retro as they’re rediscovered by new generations, not in the “look, you had to be there” way that a lot of its PC platformer peers do.</p>

<h2>An artifact of historical relevance</h2>
<p>Tim Sweeney, who founded Potomac Computer Systems turned Epic MegaGames turned Epic Games, is obviously a looming figure in the technology, gaming, and entertainment industries today. His company’s Unreal Engine is the default choice for AA and AAA game developers who want a ready-made game engine, and it’s widely used in Hollywood productions like Disney’s <em>The Mandalorian</em>, too.</p>
<p><em>Fortnite</em>, the flagship game of Unreal Engine, is one of the most popular games in history, and was one of the main drivers of the tech industry’s obsession with the “metaverse” in the early 2020s. To this day, major gaming publishers are trying (and largely failing) to copy <em>Fortnite</em>‘s success.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>And Sweeney is an outspoken corporate activist—whether you agree with him or not, and no matter how you judge his sincerity and personal incentives—against platform gatekeepers like Apple and Google, who many feel leverage their positions unfairly.</p>
<p>So all that means&nbsp;<em>Jill of the Jungle</em> would be interesting even if it&nbsp;<em>wasn’t</em> fun, simply because it was the last game Sweeney (who was originally a programmer) personally designed.</p>

      Tim Sweeney left all sorts of Easter eggs in the game, including his own name.

<p><em>Unreal</em>, the 1998 breakthrough game that arguably made Epic Games’ current industry prominence possible, was designed by then-up-and-comer Cliff Bleszinski; Sweeney only worked on it as a programmer, though, of course, engineering was arguably just as big a part of that game’s success as its design.</p>
<p><em>Jill of the Jungle</em> is a marvel of technical polish and what game designers call “juice”—all the little extra touches that add up to make a game feel great and seem extra—for its time. But it’s also a beautifully designed platformer, with amazingly creative levels.</p>
<p>I don’t always agree with Sweeney’s opinionated stances in the industry, and while many independent game developers champion him as a hero for standing up to the big platforms, I don’t trust his long-term ambitions any more than I do Apple’s. But playing&nbsp;<em>Jill of the Jungle</em>, it’s abundantly clear why he’s been as successful as he is.</p>
<p>There simply aren’t many people in the games industry who can claim equal mastery of engineering and business acumen, and those who have both are often pretty successful. But <em>Jill of the Jungle</em>‘s refined and clever game design also proves that Sweeney understands the creative dimension, too. There are even fewer people who have all three of those skills.</p>
<p>The game is <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fjill_of_the_jungle_the_complete_trilogy">worth a spin</a> just for fun and nostalgia, even if you don’t care about its historical relevance. Maybe I have nostalgia glasses on, but I think it has aged quite well.</p>

            <guid>1368505</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  Upgrade your existing rig or build a new one with a new 6GB, HDMI 2.1 &amp; DisplayPort 1.4a graphics card for a fraction of the price of a new gaming PC.
                </p><div>
              
              <p>PC gamers and computer DIYers alike are going to love this Cyber Monday deal at Amazon after Black Friday — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6105/">the ASUS Dual GeForce RTX 3050 is a gaming graphics card that’s capable of upgrading an older gaming rig or being the visual nerve center of a self-built one, and it’s just $160 after a 20% off deal</a>. That’s a great price for a major upgrade on an older computer, and definitely a more economical choice than buying an entirely new machine.</p>
<p>The RTX 3050 is compatible with PC towers, not laptops. It connects to the PC’s motherboard to drive the computer’s graphic performance. It’s an exceptional mid-range gaming graphics card with 6GB of GDDR6 VRAM, PCIe 4.0 support, HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4a ports, and a compact dual-slot build that allows it to also fit into the more-slender desktop PCs. It’s power- and heat efficient so you don’t need the large tower or big cooling setup to prevent it from overheating.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6105/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Reliable HD Gaming</h2>
<p>Installation of the RTX 3050 could not be easier — open the tower, find the motherboard, and either add the card in an empty graphics slot or replace the existing one. Once up and running, your PC will be fully capable of 1080p gaming, which is great for shooters, indie games, and eSports games thanks to the high frame rate and stable performance. It’s not a 4K gaming machine, but it’s plenty of HD power for an exceptional price.</p>
<p>The HDMI 2.1 hookup and fast refresh rate give you the further option of hooking up your upgraded PC to a faster monitor or TV. And as a new card, the firmware updates and the driver support will be better. Since every piece of a tech setup has a finite life before it reaches obsolescence — the point where the manufacturer no longer provides updates or support, and games are no longer compatible — a brand-new graphics card will push that deadline further down the road, thus extending the lifespan of your entire PC for a small price.</p>



<h2>Upgrade or Build</h2>
<p>Swapping out a graphics card to upgrade and extend the life of a PC is rewarding, but building one either from scratch or from the bones of an old dead tower is&nbsp;<em>fun</em>. But the cost does add up when you’re shopping for all of the components — motherboard, internal storage, RAM, and five or six things you didn’t know you needed until you tried to boot up. An inexpensive graphics card is a key component of a DIY build or rebuild, and the performance you get from the GeForce RTX 3050 for its original $200 price earned it an average 4.6-star rating from Amazon reviewers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6105/">Now with this Cyber Monday deal that drops 20% off the price, the RTX 3050 vastly overperforms on its new $160 price</a>. Hit Amazon now before this Cyber Monday gamer deal ends.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/playstation-vr2-goes-zero-profit-for-cyber-monday-ps5-owners-get-premium-vr-for-budget-headset-money-2000648879</link>

                  The best value for money VR headset if you own a PS5.
                </p><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday is over but Cyber Monday keeps the excitement going by lowering prices even more on gaming hardware at Amazon. The <strong>PlayStation VR2</strong> is a next-level virtual reality headset that feels completely different from smartphone VR headsets and if you have a PS5 and want to get deeper into immersive gaming, this is the headset for you.</p>
<p>Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5779/">this bundle is only $299, down from the usual $399 and it comes with Horizon Call of the Mountain</a>, so you can start playing a full AAA VR adventure as soon as you open it. This bundle is at its lowest price ever on Amazon for Cyber Monday.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5779/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>OLED Screens and Eye Tracking</h2>
<p>The <strong>PSVR2 has two OLED panels that give each eye a resolution of 2000×2040</strong>&nbsp;which is 4K total resolution. This gets rid of the screen-door effect that older VR headsets had, where you could see individual pixels. The <strong>110-degree field of view</strong> gives you peripheral vision that is similar to real life, so virtual environments feel truly big instead of like you’re looking through binoculars. With <strong>HDR support</strong>, deep blacks and bright highlights stand out and gives images more depth. The 90Hz or 120Hz refresh rate options make fast gameplay smooth which helps with motion sickness and makes head movements feel natural instead of laggy.</p>



<p>The <strong>PSVR2’s best feature is eye tracking</strong> which lets the headset see where you’re looking and use that information in many different ways. Foveated rendering uses the graphics processing power to focus on what you’re looking at directly and lower the detail in your peripheral vision, and it makes things run faster without you noticing any quality loss. Some games use eye tracking to help you aim in shooters, make eye contact with NPCs in story-driven games, or start events based on where your gaze stays.</p>
<p>When there are explosions, impacts, or weather effects like rain, <strong>haptic feedback vibrates through the headset itself</strong> and adds a physical element that regular VR doesn’t have. The <strong>adaptive triggers on the included Sense controllers push back against your finger pressure</strong> in a way that makes drawing a bowstring feel tense or pulling the trigger on a gun feel real. Inside-out tracking uses four cameras built into the headset to keep an eye on the controllers and your play area and you don’t need any sensors mounted around your room.</p>



<p><em>Horizon Call of the Mountain</em> shows off what PSVR2 can do with a VR adventure set in the Horizon universe: It has climbing mechanics that use hand-over-hand motion, archery that requires real aiming and drawing and beautiful views that show off the graphics quality. The game was made specifically for VR instead of being a port of a flat-screen game which means that every interaction uses the headset’s eye tracking and haptic features.</p>
<p>For $299 instead of $399, you can get the PSVR2 with Horizon Call of the Mountain which makes high-end VR available at a price that used to only get you entry-level standalone headsets. For $100 less, you get Sony’s best VR technology, including eye tracking, haptic feedback, and 4K OLED visuals – plus, you get a full AAA game that would cost $60 on its own.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>'s success is due, in part, to the "hype" and community discussions surrounding the horror game's release.</p>
<p>That's according to Silent Hill series producer Motoi Okamoto and writer Ryukishi07, who said in an interview with <a href="https://dengekionline.com/article/202511/57863">Dengeki Online</a> (as translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/silent-hill-fs-success-was-helped-greatly-by-memes-fanart-and-theories-it-inspired-devs-say-a-new-approach-to-writing-characters-unlocked-potential-for-virality/">Automaton</a>), that it was memes, fan-made content, and livestreams that made the game trend online, and especially in Japan.</p>

<p>"Recently, discourse about games is being consumed at a rapid pace," Okamoto said. "But games that do get talked about even months after release are the ones that are fun to theorise about and analyse, and they usually get a lot of character fan art. From my experience, titles which are able to show us that kind of hype tend to live on for longer."</p>
<p>Writer Ryukishi07 added that horror games "ultimately boil down to how much the player resonates with them. That's why protagonists of such games tend to be on the less-talkative side, so players can immerse themselves in the game.</p>
<p>"It's not something that makes you feel 'I want them to be my friend', it's more of a dark kind of appeal," he added.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean we can expect all future Silent Hill instalments to be action-heavy or set in Japan, though. Ryukishi07 suggested that while the latest game shouldn't necessarily set a blueprint for "the way the series should follow [...] if the direction we took with [Silent Hill] f is well-received, hopefully it could become one of the examples of the Silent Hill series' expressive range."</p><p>I had a good time with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-review">Silent Hill f, awarding it four out of five stars</a>, writing that Silent Hill f's frustrating first-half is outweighed by a brilliant, delirious second that's well worth the initial slog. Developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-gets-a-fresh-update-that-addresses-combat-concerns-by-introducing-a-much-easier-casual-option">Neobards has since implemented an update</a> to make replays a little more enjoyable, and the combat sequences a little less frustrating.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  Save 11% on the PlayStation Portal Remote Player over at Amazon this holiday season.
                </p><div>
              
              <p>Handheld gaming consoles have come through in a big way this past decade. The Nintendo Switch paved the way for the other big players in the gaming space to rethink what it means to be able to game while on the go. We’ve since seen the advent of the Steam Deck—Valve’s PC gaming handheld—along with some other third parties throwing their hats in the race with the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6104/">PlayStation has its own take on the format with the PlayStation Portal Remote Player for PS5. Amazon happens to have it discounted for Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</a> The 11% savings equates to the handheld system dropping from $200 to just $179 for a limited time. You end up saving $21.</p>
<p>On the surface, the PlayStation Portal Remote Player looks like if you hacked up a PS5 DualSense controller and stuck the pieces to the side of your Nintendo Switch. That’s not a bad thing. The PS5 controller is comfortable to use, and having the handheld mimic it almost exactly allows for a more seamless experience when playing games between your PlayStation 5 console and your PlayStation Portal Remote Player. The handheld is capable of playing games at up to 60fps, displaying in a resolution of 1080p. Choose between either the white version or the midnight black model.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6104/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<p>Where the PlayStation Portal Remote Player differs from the other gaming handhelds is its not a standalone unit. The Portal doe not let you play games directly on the unit itself. the games you play are either streamed from the cloud or streamed from your home PlayStation 5 console. So in that sense, it’s more akin to the Wii U gamepad as opposed to the Nintendo Switch.</p>

		<p>If you like Helldivers then I recommend you keep an hour free to watch For Liberty! which is a new fan-made film based on Helldivers 2. It is exceptionally professional with spectacular animation and a rousing score that features familiar-sounding riffs.</p>
<p>It’s also very funny and captures the expandability of the Helldivers along with the fascist regime hiding under the name of Managed Democracy. There’s even a little Drag Race reference which I was not expecting.</p>


<p>For Liberty! finds the Helldivers on a planet where the Automatons are conducting experiments on the Terminids and creating cyborg bugs, but for what reason? The plot follows a female Helldiver as they investigate what is going and, of course, kill an awful lot of robots and bugs. It also cleverly uses the first person perspective from the game for a dramatic key moment, and like all good franchise films, teases a sequel right at the very end of the credits.</p>
<p>You can watch the entire movie below, but if you like it go and give them a like and follow on YouTube where you can find out more about the film.</p>
<p><iframe title="For Liberty! A Helldivers Film (Full Movie)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M7nXj34kwIg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Helldivers 2 has been a huge hit for Sony with an<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/03/helldivers-2-is-coming-to-xbox-in-august/"> Xbox X|S version launching this yea</a>r. On December 2nd 2025 the Python Commandos Premium Warbond will launch with three brand new stratagems and a new primary weapon. The new gun, a combination assault rifle and grenade launcher called the AR/GL-21 One-Two. It’s “heavy to wield, but the damage dealt is heavy too, making your primary slot more versatile than ever with two guns in one!”</p>

<p>You will also get the M-1000 Maxigun is belt-fed with ultra-high ammo capacity, and there’s a new Guard Dog assistant, this one is armed with a flamethrower. There is new armour, new emotes, new capes and all the usual cosmetic bobbins.</p>
<p>Alongside For Liberty! there is also an official Helldivers film<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/07/helldivers-and-horizon-zero-dawn-movies-announced-by-sony/"> on the way</a>. The Helldivers movie will be based on Helldivers 2, but there is no confirmed release window, cast, or even what story will be told through the movie.</p>

<figure data-uuid="1c74ecdbe6fc7"><a title="Bionic Commando - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1c74ecdbe6fc7/bionic-commando-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Get your spiciest takes at the ready, because it's time to dive into another edition of Box Art Brawl!</p>
<p>It was a special edition affair <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-snes-classic-mini-console">last time</a>, as we celebrated the 35th anniversary of the SNES by matching up three boxes for the SNES Mini. There was one clear winner in our eyes, and you lovely lot agreed with us! The simplistic Japanese design comfortably walked away with the win, taking 48% of the vote and leaving Europe and North America with the remaining 26% and 25%, respectively.</p>
<p>Inspired by the arrival of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-expands-switch-onlines-nes-and-game-boy-library-with-four-more-titles">Game Boy version on Nintendo Switch Online</a> this week, we're taking a look at three covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/bionic_commando">Bionic Commando</a> on the NES — what can we say, it had more variety in its art than the arguably more relevant GB release! It's a trio of different designs to pick between this week, so let's dive straight in.</p><div><figure data-videoid="JEHFv10kUS0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytJEHFv10kUS0" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38eeb6yoinug&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/retro/related-articles:194374 @ 1764522739 -->
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="e5d22baea3f6e"><a title="Bionic Commando - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e5d22baea3f6e/bionic-commando-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73-bionic-commando">Capcom / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Much like the promise in its top left corner, the North American cover is all-out action. Our titular hero swings from his bionic arm front and centre, with the odds stacking up behind him. There are giant metal machines, foot soldiers, helicopters, <em>bats</em> — it all builds up a question of 'how will he ever get out of this one? Buy the game to find out!'</p>
<p>Honestly, the colour variety rules in this one, too. It's an all-round goodie, no?</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure data-uuid="fc751c1809b5c"><a title="Bionic Commando - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fc751c1809b5c/bionic-commando-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73-bionic-commando">Capcom / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>A lot of that action is stripped back for the European release — the helicopters and foot soldiers make the jump, sure, but where are the <em>bats</em>?? The commando's outfit has been swapped out to something that more closely resembles a comic-accurate Vision, and a big old blue border steps up to occupy an unsettlingly large portion of the box.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="4633698e5dd54"><a title="Bionic Commando - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4633698e5dd54/bionic-commando-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/73-bionic-commando">Capcom / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now this is something different! It might not be quite as kinetic, but the Japanese cover opts for action of a different kind, with our titular hero shooting at the baddies across from him. Be it the looming big bad in the fiery sky or the blood-soaked logo, this cover leans way more into the high-stakes gore of it all, and makes for a rather eye-catching design in the process.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Right out from the grand finale to Chapter 6, Fortnite has kicked into Chapter Seven: Pacific Break, starting a new era for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite-battle-royale">Fortnite Battle Royale</a> at the Golden Coast. This is more than just a bunch of new locations and branded tie-ins, though, with a clutch of core gameplay changes, including boss battles, simple build and self revives.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter Seven: Pacific Break | Cinematic Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eln66CJHna8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>One change is how you drop into your <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a> match, with the Battle Bus now out of commission and Storm Surfing the way that you reach the Island instead. From there, the map has new POIs including Battlewood Boulevard, Sandy Strip, Wonkeeland, and Classified Canyon.</p>
<p>But really it’s all about the new gameplay tweaks and additions.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter Seven: Pacific Break | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tv2zM8jI4gU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Here’s the breakdown:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stay in the Game&nbsp;– In the very rare occasion&nbsp;players are downed, they can use a Self-Revive Device to revive themselves while they’re DBNO (Down But Not Out).
<ul>
<li>Additionally, new DBNO movement options include Roll &amp; Tumble, DBNO Sprint, and Stay on the Move.</li>
<li>Lastly, Drivable Reboot Vans have rolled onto the Island!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Defeat the Boss, Be the Boss&nbsp;– Defeat bosses to claim their loot, powers, and transform into them! Becoming a boss grants full Health and Shield, bonus max Health and Shield, infinite Energy, and a powerful ability. Careful: boss positions remain visible to nearby opponents at all times!</li>
<li>Simple Build&nbsp;– Simple Build is an option in Settings (Game &gt; Building) that makes learning how to build simpler. Turn it on, look in the direction you want to build, and just… build!</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond that the new battle pass has got a whole host of film references that 12-year-olds won’t really understand. The Bride from Kill Bill is turning up, katana in hand, and Marty McFly will bring 1980s chic to 2025 (a decade on from the “future” that he ended up visiting in the sequel).</p>
<p>This is all a little bit temporary, though. The Battle Bus returns on 4th December, at which point Reload will come back online with the Surf City map, Blitz Royale will have the new Starfall Island map, and ranked will also return. Fortnite OG will also return on 11th December with Season 7.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Escape from Tarkov Code Unlocks Nikita’s Voice, But You Need to Hurry]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-nikita-voice-hurry/</link>
            <guid>1368469</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlestate Games has skipped over the issues plaguing one of the rarest rewards in Escape from Tarkov and just issued a code that will give you <strong>Nikita’s voicelines </strong>instantly in the spearhead extraction shooter title. This is in response to waves of people complaining that Twitch drops, which are supposed to unlock the voice, simply aren’t working as intended.</p>



<p>If you want to unlock Nikita Buyanov’s voicelines in Escape from Tarkov, the code you need is right down below.</p>







<h2 id="h-nikita-voice-code-for-escape-from-tarkov">Nikita Voice Code for Escape from Tarkov</h2>



<p>If you want to unlock Nikita’s voicelines in Escape from Tarkov, you need to use the following code: <strong>WILWILBE</strong>.</p>



<p>Like any other code, this <span>can be redeemed via the escapefromtarkov.com site&nbsp;<strong>or&nbsp;</strong>through</span> the launcher. Once you’ve entered the code, you’ll be met with a <strong>green message </strong>if it worked, just like the one below:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>However, there’s a huge catch. You’ve only got <strong>three days </strong>until the code becomes invalid, so if you’re reading this guide after December 2nd or 3rd, you’re out of luck, and you might never get the voicelines.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov recently launched into a 1.0 state after more than a decade in development. It was the biggest milestone in the game’s history, but it was somewhat marred by network issues, server instability, and a hefty assortment of bugs, all of which led to Battlestate Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bsg-apologize-escape-from-tarkov-launch-problems/">issuing a public apology</a>.</p>



<p>That being said, the game has now become more accessible and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-getting-easier-first-time-decade/">easier for newcomers</a>, and in our recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-review-ultimate-extraction-shooter/">Escape from Tarkov review</a> (which scored maximum marks), we wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Through thick and thin, Escape from Tarkov has prevailed. It’s an enormous, deep, and rich game that’s still evolving, it offers unparalleled emotional experiences, and it looks, sounds, and feels great while doing all that. It’s the most punishing game you’ll ever play, but if you put enough hours into understanding this gem of a title, you’ll come to appreciate that it is a generational masterpiece of the extraction shooter market.</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you managed to secure Nikita’s voice in Tarkov.</p>

			<p>Epic Games announced the release of Fortnite Chapter Seven: Pacific Break, following the <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1994855116869116102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highly successful finale of Fortnite Chapter Six: Zero Hour</a>, where 10.5 million players joined the event in the game and over three million were watching through various livestreams.</p>



<p>As fitting for the Golden Coast island, players will 'Storm Surf' their way to it instead of dropping from the Battle Bus as usual. Once there, they'll find a brand new sun-soaked map that can be explored on foot, with vehicles, and even with the new hot air balloons. The developers outlined the following key locations: </p>



<p>● Battlewood Boulevard<br>● Sandy Strip<br>● Wonkeeland<br>● Humble Hills<br>● Bumpy Bay<br>● Classified Canyon</p>



<p>As you can see in the image gallery below, Fortnite Chapter Seven: Pacific Break features a fair amount of variety in locales.</p>

<p>Fortnite Chapter Seven: Pacific Break introduces a few juicy gameplay additions, such as drivable reboot vans and a self-revive device that can be used when the player is in the DBNO (down but not out) state. DBNO is also further enhanced with the ability to roll and tumble away from enemy fire, a sprinting ability which uses Energy, the ability to use ziplines, ascenders, and even get into cars as a passenger, or crawling or being thrown into the back of the aforementioned reboot van.</p>



<p>Defeating bosses like Human Bill, Hush, or Beach Brutus will let you claim their powers as well as their loot, giving your character full health and shield, a bonus maximum health and shield, infinite energy, and a powerful ability. On the flip side, your position will be visible to nearby opponents at all times.</p>



<p>In Fortnite Chapter Seven: Pacific Break, during each phase of the storm, Rift anomalies may summon loot and grant powerful effects to everyone in the match. More anomalies will be added throughout the course of the season.</p>



<p>Furthermore, to ensure fairness at the start of a match, gold bars will no longer carry over from one match to another. As such, players should spend them before the current match ends to reboot their teammates, hire characters, or grab powerful gear from vending machines with a new item stock. Epic is also now letting players drop bars to share resources with teammates.</p>



<p>Additional improvements include redesigned hit markers and improved visibility, ammo status indicators for weapons in the inventory, the ability to aim down sight while jumping, a spectator mode that now automatically tunes into the nearest teammate, and an overhauled emote wheel.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The new season adds several new weapons that Epic says are more responsive, offering layered recoil and smoother ADS (aiming down sight) transitions. Reload progress is now saved when your magazine is empty, which is certainly going to be useful. Here's the list of new weapons in Fortnite Chapter Seven: Pacific Break:</p>



<p>● Iron Pump Shotgun: A new heavy-hitting Pump Shotgun.<br>● Twin Hammer Shotguns: Dual-wielded Pump Shotguns.<br>● Deadeye Assault Rifle: Scoped, automatic, and built for those who hit headshots at middle-to-long ranges.<br>● Holo Rush SMG: Scoped, fast, and dangerous in tight quarters.<br>● Vengeful Sniper Rifle: Reaps opponents with bolt-action precision.<br>● Arc-Lightning Gun: Zap players, vehicles, and builds with electricity.<br>● Forsaken Vow Blade: Dash in and out faster than with the Kinetic Blade, unleashing a flurry of lightning-fast strikes.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fortnite-chapter-seven-pacific-break-wingsuit.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The wingsuit is a featured item for this season, allowing players to glide through the Golden Coast island. Moreover, the following items are returning from the Vault:</p>



<ul>
<li>All Terrain Kart (alongside the usual sports cars and SUVs)</li>



<li>Enforcer AR, Tactical Pistol and Dual Micro SMG</li>



<li>Shockwave and Clinger grenades</li>



<li>Chug Jugs</li>



<li>Shield Kegs</li>



<li>Med Kits</li>



<li>Bandages</li>



<li>Shield Potions</li>



<li>Mini Shield Potions</li>



<li>Zero Build only: Shield Bubble Jrs and Port-a-Bunkers</li>
</ul>



<p>The Fortnite Chapter Seven: Pacific Break Battle Pass lets you seek revenge as The Bride, represent the future as Marty McFly and unlock Fortnite originals such as Miles Cross and Cat Holloway, plus a new version of Dark Voyager. It also features special styles for three outfits: Cat Holloway, Carter Wu and Dark Voyager (Reality Redacted). These additional Styles can only be unlocked by completing Quests in Blitz Royale, Reload and Battle Royale, respectively.</p>



<p>By the way, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-quentin-tarantino-kill-bill-lost-chapter-yukis-revenge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quentin Tarantino's The Lost Chapter: Yuki's Revenge</a> will premiere later today at 2 PM Eastern Time.</p>
