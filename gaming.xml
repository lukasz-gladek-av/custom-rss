<p>In case you missed it, Nintendo shadow-dropped the new mobile game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/fire_emblem_shadows">Fire Emblem Shadows</a> in September. If you haven't given this free-to-play title a go just yet, now might be the time to take a look.</p>
<p>A new story "and more" has been added in a free update. Book 2 - Wolf Brother adds episodes 1-4. You can unlock the chapters by collecting Story Fragments earned as battle rewards. You'll also need to complete Book 1 before you can dive into this new content featuring the character Joachim.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Unsettling footsteps approach a small, impoverished village quietly tucked away deep in the mountains…A kind boy from a cold village in the northern mountains who rarely seeks conflict. He's a descendant of wolves from the bloodline of Fenris. You can unlock him by battling and collecting Book 2 Story Fragments."</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<p>Along with this, there's also a new labyrinth map, and new weapons and skills have been added as treasure rewards.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The feature rewards this time are Soul items for Lyn: Plain Wind. Collect 12 of these to recruit Lyn as one of your disciples."</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Last month, something a bit surprising, and perhaps concerning, took place in the games industry: a deal was made which saw that a mixture of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, equity firm Silver Lake, and Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners had privately acquired EA. There's a whole host of reasons why this is worrisome, but one reason in particular is the way that it might affect <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims</a>.
</p>
<p>
While it isn't exactly a paragon of identity politics, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> has by and large been a game that welcomes and encourages people of all creeds, notably LGBTQIA+ folks. It is probably safe to assume that these new owners, however, will not be so welcoming. In fact, concern has been so great over this acquisition that the biggest Sims YouTuber around lilsimsie has <a href="http://youtube.com/post/UgkxPVv5K6a9ZXkFzbLrta3DlHckpC8A9OF6?si=sglHvJEekR-fr1md">left EA's Creator Network</a>, having been joined by other big Sims YouTubers like <a href="http://youtube.com/post/Ugkxe7pZtIiCBZpCErpuc1fqI3k41pAsna53?si=OTATMfwD8usqaILA">Plumbella</a> and <a href="http://youtube.com/post/UgkxGxA76frKUAO6anFj84Ijhqkc4m-jlznc?si=4KaoEumB9X0jgD7u">James Turner</a>.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
In turn, a message has now been shared by The Sims team on its official Dwitter account seemingly attempting to assuage some of the above concerns, though it has been delivered in a bit of a vague tone. "We're continually inspired by our incredible players and creators; by your imagination, creativity, and the joy you bring to The Sims every day," reads the statement.
</p>
<p>
"We deeply respect that everyone experiences The Sims in their own way and will make choices that are right for them. However you choose to play, create, or share, we’re grateful to be part of your journey. Our mission, values, and commitment remain the same. The Sims will always be a space where you can express your authentic self."
</p><p>
The statement carries on with an even vaguer bit about how everyone's "passion and voices" have affected bits to come in 2026, and that on November 4th there'll be a new update coming to The Sims with "150+ fixes and fresh freebies." Notably, this update is "the first of ongoing updates that address the things that matter most to you," though personally this feels slightly disconnected from the main message and is more addressed at those who are frustrated with how broken the game often can be.
</p>
<p>
This is all well and good for now, it's just still a bit too early to tell what kind of effects this acquisition will have. For now let's all just cross our fingers for the future of any staff members currently working at EA.

            <p>The Halo series is coming to PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>In a new demo debuted at the Halo World Championship, Microsoft has revealed Halo: Campaign Evolved – described as "a faithful yet modernised remake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-combat-evolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a>'s campaign" – is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S next year.</p>
<p>The remake has been "rebuilt from the ground up" on Unreal Engine 5, and will include high-definition visuals, refined controls, two-player splitscreen co-op on console, up to four-player online co-op on console and PC, three new missions, an expanded arsenal of weapons, vehicles, new enemies, and more. It will be playable "day one" with Game Pass.</p>

<p>For those unfamiliar with the seminal shooter, the Halo story kicks off after the Master Chief crash-lands on a mysterious ringworld known as Halo, working alongside remaining humans to help humanity survive against overwhelming Covenant forces. Alongside his AI companion Cortana, he uncovers Halo’s dark secrets and fights to avert the annihilation of all life in the galaxy.</p><p>"We wanted to start where it all began, with the original campaign that defined Halo," executive producer Damon Conn <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-answering-the-big-questions/">said</a>. "Starting here means people that have never played the game before will be able to understand the story from the very beginning, and that can help us chart a course forward with new Halo stories."</p>
<p>"Focusing on the campaign experience means we can concentrate fully on really capturing the atmosphere, tone - the emotional impact of what made the first campaign so special and iconic."</p>
<p>In Halo: Campaign Evolved, you'll be able to wield nine additional "iconic" weapons from across the Halo series inside the Halo: Combat Evolved campaign, including the Energy Sword, Battle Rifle and Needle Rifle, as well as hijack vehicles and even pilot the Covenant Wraith tank – two firsts for the Halo campaign.</p>
<p>That's not the only big change, either.</p>
<p>"We learned from Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary that there was still an appetite for things like better wayfinding, navigation, and diversity in enemy encounters," director Max Szlagor added. "In The Library specifically, which features several Flood encounters, we wanted to reevaluate the pacing and enhance the environmental storytelling. We've added new lines to Guilty Spark, which guide players through the level, and there's new dialogue that gives more insight into the narrative as it plays out."</p><p>"We're so excited about bringing Halo to those who may not have had chance to play it in the past," Conn added. "At its heart, Halo is about connection, we're thrilled to meet a new generation of players on their platforms of choice to fall in love with Halo the same way we did. We're not trying to rewrite Halo's legacy - we're trying to immerse you in it like never before.</p>
<p>"This is Halo for everyone."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s easy to get into the weeds on a hobby, especially if you’re into PC gaming and dreaming of the highest levels of graphical performance. But how much is too much for hardware? Spending top dollar on graphics power, processing, RAM, storage, etc. — like many things — eventually leads to diminishing returns. When it comes to gaming laptops, MSI’s $5,699.99 Titan 18 is well beyond that inflection point. But it’s also like nothing else.</p><p>It’s not very logical to spend that much when other excellent gaming laptops are nearly as powerful but cost almost half as much. While the Titan is an absolutely reckless purchase, it’s also a joyous one that goes all out for specs and wide-eyed coolness factor.</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODA2MDc3"><p><span>$<!-- -->4800</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Top-tier gaming performance in a laptop</li><li>Massive, bright 4K Mini LED screen</li><li>Loud but satisfying mechanical keyboard</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>As good as it is, it doesn’t blow away a much cheaper 5080 laptop</li><li>Astronomically expensive</li><li>Battery drains after just a couple hours of everyday tasks</li><li>120Hz refresh is half the speed of cheaper laptops with 2.5K OLEDs</li></ul></div></div></div><p>The Titan goes hard on just about everything, though execution is a mixed bag. The 18-inch Mini LED 4K HDR display has a resolution of 3840 x 2400 and a variable refresh rate up to 120Hz. It looks fantastic. It’s not as contrast-y as an OLED, but it has a colorful punch with enough brightness to be easily visible in even a sun-drenched room. SteelSeries made its mechanical keyboard with Cherry low-profile switches, and it’s one of the most tactile and <em>loudest </em>laptop keyboards I’ve ever touched. It’s got a ping-y metallic undertone in its key presses, which I normally don’t want in a mechanical keyboard, but for some reason I love it in the Titan.</p><div><div><p id="component-report-card"><h2>Component report card</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Screen:</strong> A</span></li><li><span><strong>Webcam:</strong> C</span></li><li><span><strong>Mic:</strong> C</span></li><li><span><strong>Keyboard:</strong> B</span></li><li><span><strong>Trackpad:</strong> C</span></li><li><span><strong>Port selection:</strong> A</span></li><li><span><strong>Speakers:</strong> C</span></li><li><span><strong>Number of ugly stickers to remove:</strong> 4 (one underneath)</span></li></ul></div></div><p>The seamless trackpad is edge-to-edge illuminated by customizable RGB lighting instead of being invisible like on a Dell, and its haptic feedback has a satisfyingly hefty knock that’s unlike any other. But like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/611176/dell-xps-13-laptop-review-9350-intel-lunar-lake">Dell XPS 13</a> I tested earlier this year, it’s not the most reliable at detecting finger clicks. If it had this feedback combined with the reliability of a MacBook’s trackpad, it would be my all-time favorite. And the Titan is flush with ports and expandability, including two super-fast Thunderbolt 5 ports, three USB-A, two user-accessible RAM slots, and <em>four </em>M.2 SSD slots. Cap off the Titan’s specs with its top-tier Nvidia RTX 5090 laptop GPU, Intel Core Ultra 9 285HX CPU, 64GB of RAM, and 6TB of SSD storage, and the lofty $5,700 price starts making more sense.</p><p>The Titan 18 is unapologetic about its status as a desktop replacement. It’s 7.94 pounds / 3.6kg of “you paid out the nose for me to sit in one spot and crush AAA games or churn through processing-heavy tasks, and that’s what I’ll do.” And with its massive 400W power adapter, the whole package weighs 10.5 pounds / 4.76kg. I lugged it with me on a road trip, and having a machine this powerful when visiting family was awesome — even if traveling with it wasn’t so fun, since it didn’t fit in any of my bags. While it’s easier than moving a full desktop PC and monitor, you’ll feel just as tethered to a wall plug. The Titan’s 99Whr battery can barely eke out 2.5 hours of basic Chrome, Slack, Google Docs, and chat app usage before it’s drained — and that’s in Eco mode with Windows Energy Saver turned on the whole time. While playing a game on battery, even with Nvidia’s BatteryBoost optimizations enabled and targeting just 30fps, it dies in about an hour or less.</p><div id=":R4gbcrij96:"><div><div><p><figcaption><em>The Titan is maximum gaming laptop, from the design to the light-up dragon.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>Ports on the rear include a proprietary power connector, HDMI 2.1, and ethernet.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><div><div><p><figcaption><em>On the right, two Thunderbolt 5, one USB-A, and a 3.5mm audio jack.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>And on the left, two more USB-A and a speedy SD card slot.</em></figcaption></p></div></div></div><p>But when you’re plugged in and going full-tilt on a visually demanding game, the Titan is a joy to use. It can play <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> at Ultra settings in 4K with ray tracing and DLSS 4 turned on at around 60 frames per second (or higher with frame generation). Turn ray tracing off or some settings down, and you can comfortably play at well over 60fps. Early levels of the <em>Battlefield 6</em> campaign ran confidently at 60–75fps on the Ultra graphics preset and at the panel’s native 4K resolution. There were infrequent dips into the mid-to-high 50s during chaotic moments in larger areas, but everything remained smooth and snappy. If you want to push frame rates to the Titan’s max 120Hz refresh or even slightly higher, you can bump the resolution down to 2560 x 1600, and it still looks adequately crisp. But keeping the game in 4K Ultra and turning on DLSS 4 Quality yielded a happy medium of 90 to 100fps, while adding single-frame generation comfortably boosted it to 120 to 140fps.</p><div><table><thead><tr><th><h3>System</h3></th><th><h3>MSI Titan 18 / RTX 5090 / Core Ultra 9 285HX / 64GB / 6TB</h3></th><th><h3>Asus ROG Strix Scar 16 / RTX 5080 / Core Ultra 9 275HX / 32GB / 2TB</h3></th><th><h3>Razer Blade 16 (2025) / RTX 5090 / Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 / 32GB / 2TB</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Geekbench 6 CPU Single</td><td>3054</td><td>3113</td><td>2968</td></tr><tr><td>Geekbench 6 CPU Multi</td><td>21957</td><td>19709</td><td>15922</td></tr><tr><td>Geekbench 6 GPU (OpenCL)</td><td>234632</td><td>200189</td><td>213016</td></tr><tr><td>Cinebench 2024 Single</td><td>133</td><td>137</td><td>119</td></tr><tr><td>Cinebench 2024 Multi</td><td>2173</td><td>1965</td><td>1287</td></tr><tr><td>PugetBench for Photoshop</td><td>8037</td><td>8482</td><td>8679</td></tr><tr><td>Sustained SSD reads (MB/s)</td><td>14516.67</td><td>6832.06</td><td>6726.25</td></tr><tr><td>Sustained SSD writes (MB/s)</td><td>9194.8</td><td>6550.21</td><td>4931.41</td></tr><tr><td>3DMark Time Spy</td><td>24897</td><td>20977</td><td>22498</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Fan noise, while loud, isn’t as bad as some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/658137/gigabyte-aorus-master-16-gaming-laptop-rtx-5080-review">16-inch gaming laptops I’ve tested</a>. The Titan’s large chassis allows for more effective cooling under load, pumping out lots of hot air from its flanks. The keyboard deck near the laptop’s hinge gets incredibly hot to the touch, but thankfully, your fingers on the WASD keys are spared. The width of the chassis also means the six-speaker sound system can help a tiny bit in identifying directional game sounds like gunfire. Though the speakers are sadly just okay for movies and music, lacking depth and much low-end.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->7</strong><span><figcaption><em>The illuminated trackpad is especially fun, though unfortunately underwhelming in performance.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>There are two elephants in the room with the Titan: the looming temptation of a proper desktop gaming PC and the class of 16- and 18-inch gaming laptops with RTX 5080 GPUs that sit below it. You can get a much more powerful desktop PC for half the Titan’s price, add a 240Hz QD-OLED monitor, and <em>still</em> have enough money left over for an M5 MacBook Pro or even an Asus ROG Zephyrus G14. But let’s be honest, if you’re considering an 18-inch, 8-pound gaming laptop, you’re probably moving it around enough that this combo won’t work. But in that case, you could save around $2,400 on a gaming laptop with a 5080 like the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.asus.com%2Fus%2F90nr0ld1-m005n0-rog-strix-scar-16-2025.html" rel="sponsored">Asus ROG Strix Scar 16</a> and get, on average, within 7 to 10fps of the Titan’s performance.</p><p>Running benchmarks on the Titan’s RTX 5090, which runs at its full wattage, I was struck by how close 5080 laptops were nipping at its heels. For $2,100 to $2,400 more than an Asus ROG Strix Scar 16 or Lenovo Legion Pro 7i, the Titan only yields an extra 7fps on average in 4K or about 9fps more in 2.5K. The screens on those laptops are a little smaller and lower-res than the Titan, but they have lovely 240Hz OLED displays with deeper blacks, bolder colors, and a stronger contrast. As much as I love the size and brightness of the Titan’s Mini LED, I prefer the look of those OLEDs. Even the 5090-equipped Razer Blade 16 and 18, pricey machines in their own right, cost $1,000 less than the Titan. The half-inch-thinner, 3-pound-lighter <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/649577/razer-blade-16-2025-rtx-5090-review">Blade 16</a> is much more versatile and travel-friendly, and its performance is mostly on par with the Titan. Though the Titan has a higher-end CPU (with twice as many cores), greater cooling (for quieter fans), user-accessible RAM slots (though <a href="https://youtu.be/z2c_oGk-eIU?si=ptk1zSNzTl3xwNT6&amp;t=681">not <em>easily </em>accessible</a>), faster Thunderbolt 5 ports, and two more M.2 SSD slots.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>In case you were wondering, the Titan 18 is gargantuan enough to eat smaller gaming laptops like the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The sickos who pony up for the Titan are still getting a machine that isn’t quite like anything else. It’s an illogical purchase, far from any semblance of pragmatism or value-for-dollar shopping — even if you’re aiming for a little futureproofing. But despite its shortcomings and super high price, it’s still a beastly laptop with its own boisterous charm.</p><div><div><p id="SFV5mq"><h2>2025 MSI Titan 18 HX AI A2XWJG specs (as reviewed)</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Display: </strong>18-inch (3840 x 2400) 120Hz Mini LED</span></li><li><span><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel Core Ultra 9 285HX</span></li><li><span><strong>GPU:</strong> Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 Laptop GPU</span></li><li><span><strong>RAM:</strong> 64GB DDR5 6400MHz (user-replaceable)</span></li><li><span><strong>Storage:</strong> 6TB across 3x SSDs in RAID 0; 1x PCIe Gen 5 NVMe and 3x Gen 4 slots (one slot is empty)</span></li><li><span><strong>Webcam:</strong> 1080p 30fps, Windows Hello</span></li><li><span><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4</span></li><li><span><strong>Ports:</strong> 2x Thunderbolt 5 USB-C (DisplayPort / Power Delivery 3.1), 3x USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, HDMI 2.1, RJ-45 ethernet, full-size SD Express card slot, 3.5mm combo audio jack, reversible DC power</span></li><li><span><strong>Weight:</strong> 7.94 pounds / 3.6kg</span></li><li><span><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 15.91 x 12.11 x 0.94 - 1.26 inches / 404 x 307.5 x 24 - 32.05mm</span></li><li><span><strong>Battery:</strong> 99Wh</span></li><li><span><strong>Price:</strong> $5,699.99</span></li></ul></div></div><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="352fea995ebc8"><a title="Metroid Prime Art Book 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/352fea995ebc8/metroid-prime-art-book-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It often feels like <strong>Metroid</strong> fans are starved for new goodies these days; doubly so for fans of Retro Studios’ Prime series. Yet just over a month before the highly anticipated fourth mainline entry for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Switch</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Switch 2</a>, you can get your hands on an absolutely <em>stunning</em> hardback art book from Piggyback covering the first three Metroid Prime games – plus a little extra for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Prime Remastered</a>.</p>
<p>Ripping the shrink wrap off the book, it’s immediately clear just how premium <strong>Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective</strong> really is. Clocking in at 212 pages, the minimal black fabric cover displays little more than an outline of Samus on the front, the main Metroid logo on the back, and the book’s title on the spine. These elements shine red when angled in the light and it looks very elegant in person.</p><div><figure data-videoid="FsuAt4uVyTk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FsuAt4uVyTk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FsuAt4uVyTk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FsuAt4uVyTk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4022bdxqojnr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>My only concern with the cover is that it does pick up minor marks and smudges when handled for longer periods. They rub away easily enough, but it’s something to keep in mind.</p>

<p>Diving into the book itself, it starts off with a relatively short foreword from series producer Kensuke Tanabe going over his introduction to Retro Studios and how the team leveraged its talent to create such incredible games. Every title is then covered in release order with an introductory write-up from Retro Studios for each (though which specific individual, exactly, is undisclosed).</p>
<p>Peppered throughout are further remarks from Tanabe; short anecdotes on how he and Retro Studios worked together on specific mechanics and designs. A lot of it is pretty well-known, but there are definitely a few little tidbits that came as a surprise. Did you know that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/metroid-prime-remastered-almost-had-completely-new-cutscenes">Prime Remastered almost had completely brand new cutscenes</a>, for example? Well, now you do.</p>
<p>In addition to Tanabe’s writing, other breakout boxes essentially replicate text from the in-game Scan Visor logs, and as someone who knows the Prime games inside out, I felt somewhat disappointed that Nintendo and Piggyback went in this direction. These kinds of write-ups work fine in the game itself, but I don’t need to read about how Sheegoth has a vulnerable underbelly (wink-wink, use the Morph Ball Bomb) in an art book. Tell me about the design process!</p>

<p>This is a pretty glaring issue throughout the entire book. While I certainly appreciated Tanabe’s insights, I feel a lot more could have been provided by Retro Studios itself. What was the initial approach in creating <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime_2_echoes">Prime 2</a>'s Luminoth? Why go with <em>this</em> design instead of <em>that</em> one? What kind of challenges were overcome?</p>
<p>As I gazed in wonder at the incredible concept art, multiple questions arose in my mind about the development process involved; unfortunately, most simply went unanswered. It’s important to acknowledge that many devs who worked on the trilogy — including art director Todd Keller — are no longer at Retro, so I can understand why they weren’t directly involved.</p>
<p>As for the artwork itself, well, it's outstanding. This is an extensive dive into the Metroid Prime Trilogy and showcases almost every major aspect of the games, including Samus’ suits, her ship, enemies, bosses, environments, and more.</p>
<p>It’s a <em>lot</em>, and it’s a real treat for fans of the series. I particularly enjoyed looking at some of the alternative designs for the Space Pirate enemies, which seemingly took on a more emaciated appearance compared to the final in-game models.</p>

<p>Naturally, without <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/metroid_prime_hunters">Metroid Prime: Hunters</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/metroid_prime_pinball">Pinball</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/metroid_prime_federation_force">Federation Force</a>, you could argue that this isn't quite as 'complete' as some would like. Indeed, one of the most obvious omissions is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/metroid-prime-4-beyond-who-is-sylux">Sylux</a>, the shadowy antagonist who really only appears properly in Hunters and Federation Force. Their ship, however, <em>does</em> crop up at the end of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a>, but even this isn't present here. It's an odd choice given the character's prominent presence in the marketing for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.</p>
<p>Speaking of Beyond, I had hoped that there might be a small nod to the upcoming sequel in the book, and while there are hints toward it in Tanabe's notes (<em>"Retro and our team at Nintendo will keep working together to the best of our ability to bring new stories for fans to enjoy!"</em>), there are no visual references. This was perhaps a bit optimistic on my part, and my hope is that there might be another book in the future dedicated to the long, storied development of Prime 4.</p>
<p>Despite my concerns and disappointments, Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective is a lovely book that Prime fans will absolutely devour – I sure did. It's the kind of visual feast you'll want to just dive into again and again at a moment's notice, so you can bet it will take pride a place on my coffee table for the foreseeable future.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> CEO Dan Clancy has admitted the company "failed" by both allowing streamer Emiru to be physically assaulted at TwitchCon last weekend, and "in our response following".</p>
<p>Last weekend, streamer<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/streamer-assaulted-at-twitchcon-slams-event-security-i-think-other-creators-should-seriously-consider-not-attending-in-the-future"> Emiru was assaulted at a TwitchCon Meet and Greet after a man crossed multiple barriers to grab her face and try to kiss her</a>. A viral video that caught the incident suggests TwitchCon's own staff did not prevent the incident from occurring, nor "came to ask what happened or if I was okay" in the immediate aftermath.</p>
<p>In Twitch's initial response, it said "the safety and security of all those attending TwitchCon is our highest priority", and called the behaviour of the man who pushed past the queue to grab Emiru and kiss her "completely unacceptable and deeply upsetting". It then revealed it had "blocked this individual from returning to the TwitchCon premises, and they are banned indefinitely from Twitch, both online and in-person events".</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>hello everyone, I am okay and thank you for all of the kind messages, sorry I cannot respond to them all 🩷</p><p>Yesterday, the man who assaulted me was allowed to cross multiple barriers at twitchcon and even in front of another creators meet and greet to grab me and my face and try…</p></div>— emi ⭐️ (@emiru) <a href="https://twitter.com/emiru/status/1979602519967060414?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 18, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>Emiru disputed this version of events, however, saying, "Twitch's statement they said that the guy was immediately caught and detained [was] a blatant lie".</p>
<p>"He was allowed to walk away from my Meet and Greet, and I didn't hear he was caught until hours after he attacked me, and it felt like this only happened because of my manager pressing for it, not because TwitchCon staff present thought it was a big deal," she added, later confirming she was pressing charges.</p>
<p>In the days following the incident, Clancy was criticised for a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/twitch-ceo-dan-clancy-responds-to-emiru-twitchcon-assault-says-its-a-challenge-in-todays-society-and-not-limited-to-twitc">video interview</a> in which he said, "the challenge we face is a challenge in today’s society. It’s not limited to Twitch, it extends throughout our society.</p>
<p>"Now, what happened yesterday, obviously, was something that we care deeply about securing this environment. We're looking very closely at everything that happened there, and I care deeply about Emi," he added. "She's a friend of mine, and so I want to see how we can support her. This is just something we have to keep working on. I think everyone identifies our tools in terms of trust and safety as the leaders in the industry about helping creators, but that means there's always more work to be done, because that's the world we live in now."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">First, I want to be upfront and take accountability for the security incident that occurred during Emiru’s Meet and Greet.

<p>Now, in a fresh statement, Clancy said he "want[s] to be upfront and take accountability for the security incident that occurred during Emiru's Meet and Greet", saying, "it shouldn't have happened and we take that very seriously".</p>
<p>"We failed, both in allowing it to occur, and in our response following. We mismanaged our communications about the incident, and that includes the comments I made. I apologise to Emiru for all that took place."</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Twitch is now investigating "everything" about how they run Meet and Greets, "from sign-ups to the layout to increased security controls". This includes a review of its teams, production and venue staff, so it is "better equipped" for future events".</p><p>"We're also doing a comprehensive review of overall event safety and security, and will be making updates for future TwitchCons," he added. "While we won't be sharing all security updates for privacy and safety reasons, we will keep our community informed about changes that directly impact attendees.</p>
<p>"You put a lot of trust in us by attending TwitchCon, and we take our responsibility to keep you safe seriously," the statement concludes. "We know that TwitchCon means a lot to a lot of people, and it means a lot to us. Be on the lookout for more updates, and thanks for being a part of Twitch."</p>
<p>Clancy said the company has also "hard concerns about IRL" streaming, and though he didn't expand on what those concerns were, added that the IRL category was now "a part of Twitch" and "TwitchCon [should ensure it] meets the needs of a variety of participants". More will be revealed "soon".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It took me a while to get into <em>Ball x Pit</em>. The new roguelike blends elements from games like <em>Breakout</em>, <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, and even city builders, creating a complex mix of ideas. But as is the case with many roguelikes, once I figured everything out well enough to get a taste of my first win, delving back into the pit for another round was all I could think about.</p><p><em>Ball x Pit</em> barely has a story — it’s more like a setup. The initial moments of the game show a multi-tiered Gondor-like city called “Ballbylon” being struck by a giant, glowing rock (ball?), and all that remains is a giant pit that “treasure seekers” aim to explore. Then, you’re dropped into the action. Initially, as a knight-like character called “The Warrior,” you move around a narrow playing field, shooting balls up toward steadily advancing hordes of enemies. Your character fires automatically and you have infinite ammo, letting you focus on aiming your shots for optimal bounces and picking up gems and other goodies dropped by defeated bad guys.</p><p>Like in <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, when you pick up enough gems, you’ll gain a level, which improves your stats and gives you the chance to choose some kind of upgrade, like special balls that can poison enemies or activate lasers. Occasionally, enemies will drop little rainbow spirals that can level up a bunch of your upgrades at once, let you fuse balls together to combine their powers, or evolve two balls into a special new one. With the right combination of upgrades, you can get extremely powerful, with balls and effects flying around the screen as you wipe out the enemies and bosses. When you finish a run, win or lose, your character gets experience that carries over so they’re more powerful in future runs.</p><p>After a run, you can choose to visit “New Ballbylon” for the <em>other</em> part of <em>Ball x Pit</em>, which involves base-building. During this phase, you can set up things like plots of wheat and forests for resources or buildings that open up new characters and permanent stat boosts. To harvest resources or build things, you’ll have to send out your characters to bounce against the plots and structures by aiming them like you do in the main part of the game. You can also upgrade structures so they offer better perks, and you’ll eventually be able to make buildings that will auto-harvest resources for you.</p><p>Initially, I didn’t like the base-building; I just wanted to keep doing the main runs. But once I had a good engine for resources and understood how upgrading buildings worked, I was spending a lot longer than I expected optimizing my base, which had the added benefit of making things easier when I jumped back into a level.</p><p>Some buildings unlock new characters, and they’re nearly always worth the effort: the characters have wildly varying playstyles that keep things fresh. One character gets 5 percent more damage for each bounce, so I’d try to shoot balls into tight corners where they’d ping wildly and potentially rack up serious damage. One character makes the game turn-based. Another character automatically picks their own upgrades, and one of the last characters that you can unlock plays the game <em>entirely on their own</em>, which I found very useful while trying to grind some late-game levels and upgrades.</p><p>By the end of my time with <em>Ball x Pit</em>, I will admit that I started to feel a bit of the emptiness I do when I play <em>Vampire Survivors</em> now. Once winning became more routine, I started to focus on maximizing things in a way that felt more obsessive rather than fun. I’m even ashamed to say that I let the auto-play character handle a bunch of runs on the last level while I went and did other things.</p><p>But when you’re in the zone on a good run, the game is a delightful, colorful, and chaotic experience that feels like a hyper-extreme version of the classic <em>Breakout</em>. With so many characters to play and ways to improve your base, <em>Ball x Pit</em> goes deep.</p><p><sup>Ball x Pit<em> is out now on Nintendo Switch, PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X / S, and is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://x.com/devolverdigital/status/1981737834819014867">on October 28th.</a></em></sup></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/805022/ball-x-pit-review-pc-nintendo-switch-ps5-xbox-series-x-s]]></content:encoded>

The game tasks players with guessing a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Mega Man Legends 2 is celebrating its 25-year anniversary today, October 25, 2025. Below, we look back at how its unresolved cliffhanger ending still overshadows its memory.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Mega Man Legends 2 is an unfinished promise. The anime-inspired adventure series was beloved by fans of the blue bomber for its inventive, Zelda-like spin on the classic formula. It was filled with lovable characters who have endured long past the series itself, like Tron Bonne, the Servbots, and the hero, Mega Man Volnutt. But like a serialized cartoon series, the second game in the series ended with a whopper of a cliffhanger--and then never returned to it. The legacy of Legends for the last 25 years has been fans waiting for a resolution that never came.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Spoilers for the Mega Man Legends series follow</strong></p><p dir="ltr">For those unfamiliar with the Mega Man Legends series, it's unusually story-rich for a Mega Man game. Set in the distant future, in a world almost completely covered with water, Mega Man Volnutt and his adoptive family, Barrel and Roll Caskett, dig for treasure in ruins guarded by ancient technology called Reaverbots. All the while, they're alternatively pursued and occasionally aided by sky pirates called the Bonnes: Teisel, Tron, and big baby Bon Bonne. Each of the main characters in the colorful world is fully voiced, aiding in the presentation as a Saturday-morning cartoon come to life.</p><p dir="ltr">The first game explores Mega Man investigating ruins to avert a prophesized disaster, but inadvertently awakening it in the process. Another being, called Mega Man Juno, reveals to Volnutt that his original name is Mega Man Trigger. Trigger was designed as a "Purifier Unit" whose purpose was to eliminate the Carbons--aka the artificial humans who live in this world. Needless to say, he does the right thing and protects humanity instead.</p><p dir="ltr">The second game treads familiar ground but expands upon it with multiple new characters and a larger scope. This time a unit called Sera tasks Mega Man to find four keys that will unlock the Mother Lode, a rich energy source that would usher in utopia and end the constant scrapping for resources. But Sera's counterpart, Yuna, later informs Mega Man that the keys would not save humanity but rather doom it, by eliminating the Carbons and replacing them with the ancient, non-artificial humans. In the end, the three come to an understanding and stop the Master Program from initializing the wipe, but in the process, the three are left stranded on the moon of Elysium, separated from their home on the planet Terra. To make matters worse, Yuna explains that the shutdown of the Master system will trigger a failsafe by reactivating an even older Elder system, activating machines across the ruins of Terra. Mega Man Legends 2 ends with Roll attempting to build a rocket to save her stranded sibling, but we never see if it's successful.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VcNbjdMCvY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_VcNbjdMCvY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">This is the canonical, chronological end of the Mega Man series. Several of the individual Mega Man series--from the classic 8-bit platformers, through Mega Man X, Mega Man Zero, and Mega Man ZX, and finally Mega Man Legends--form one continuous (though loosely connected and often ret-conned) story. Legends is the last, which means that its unresolved ending is the last thing we see happening in a story that has been changing and evolving since the 1980s. The last in a long line of heroes called Mega Man is stranded, with a clock ticking toward the destruction of all society. It's unsatisfying enough on its own, but even more so as the bookend for an entire franchise that spans dozens of games.</p><p dir="ltr">Making matters worse is the unfulfilled promise of Mega Man Legends 3. The anticipated sequel was teased by Capcom in 2010, closely coinciding with the departure of series co-creator Keiji Inafune. Capcom's plans for Legends 3 included an ambitious idea to invite fans into the development process, soliciting feedback from the community. The company announced it would release a "Prototype Version" on the 3DS eShop, to act as a prologue. This was remarkable for the time, as early access was not yet an industry standard.</p><p dir="ltr">But as the months went on and no Prototype Version released, fans began to suspect that the project had been canceled. Capcom confirmed this in July 2011, announcing that there would be no Mega Man Legends 3 or even Prototype Version released at all, despite <a href="https://www.siliconera.com/adapt-japanese-game-english-voiceovers/" rel="nofollow ">later reports</a> that the demo was nearly completed. And in a PR misstep that would live in infamy for Mega Man fans, Capcom's UK Twitter account <a href="https://x.com/CapcomEurope/status/93558391309471744" rel="nofollow ">appeared to blame the cancellation</a> on a lack of fan involvement. A later tweet <a href="https://x.com/CapcomEurope/status/93940828984193024" rel="nofollow ">clarified</a> that it meant to refer to a lack of interaction in the online "Development Rooms" Capcom had made, not fan support more broadly. Inafune, for his part, <a href="https://www.siliconera.com/keiji-inafune-still-like-make-mega-man-legends-3/" rel="nofollow ">expressed interest in making the game</a>, as an outside contractor with his own studio, as late as 2014.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Mega Man Legends exists now mostly in memory. Capcom has gladly capitalized in its history of Mega Man games with compilations of almost every series. The Legacy Collections have now compiled the classic, Mega Man X, Mega Man Zero and Mega Man ZX, and Mega Man Battle Network series, with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mega-man-star-force-legacy-collection-coming-in-2026/1100-6534729/">Mega Man Star Force collection</a> coming in 2026. Once that releases, every Mega Man series will be readily accessible on modern platforms--except Mega Man Legends. Those games, first released on PlayStation, have remained stuck in that generation, aside from a PSP port.</p><p dir="ltr">And so Mega Man Legends has become a symbol of unfulfilled potential. The series charted a new path forward for the classic character, reinventing him as an anime-styled adventurer with deep lore and a wide cast of lovable, memorable characters. But for all of its promise, it's also the Mega Man series that has received the least games: two in the main series and the quirky minigame spin-off The Misadventures of Tron Bonne. It's become a sore spot for Mega Man fans, even as the series has received new entries like the well-received Mega Man 11. For fans of Mega Man Legends, we're all up there with Volnutt, Yuna, and Sera: waiting for a rescue, and a resolution, that will never come.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over recent weeks, we've seen new releases for a whole host of <em>Warhammer 40K</em>&nbsp;Space Marine chapters, including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-white-scars-combat-patrol-review-ride-wind" rel="nofollow">White Scars</a> with their new Combat Patrol and First Company Captain miniature, and my personal chapter, the Raven Guard, who got the same treatment. But now, it's time for the <em>40K</em> poster boys to upgrade, and we see a whole host of new miniatures for the Ultramarines, and a brand new Terminator boxed set.</p>

<p>We've been covering <i>Warhammer 40K</i> for a while on the site, and you can check out our full <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/warhammer-40k-guide" rel="nofollow">Warhammer 40K Guide</a>, or our preview for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-40k-leviathan-first-look" rel="nofollow">Leviathan box</a> that launched the latest edition of the rules.</p>




<h2>All The Terminators, All The Time</h2>

<p>Before we get into the Ultramarines releases, hitting shelves at the same time is the new Crux Terminatus Battleforce. This boxed set is made up entirely of Space Marine Terminators. These Space Marines wear Tactical Dreadnought Armor and are even more durable than normal Space Marines. Most chapters (those that conform to the Codex Astartes, more on that later) only let their 1st company wear Terminator armor, and that company is made up entirely of veterans who've proved their worth in combat.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;Crux Terminatus Battleforce contains 18 Space Marine Terminator miniatures, and 11 are brand new to this boxed set and will be available separately at a later date.</p>

<ul><li>1x Captain in Terminator Armour&nbsp;</li>
	<li>1x Chaplain in Terminator Armour</li>
	<li>1x Ancient in Terminator Armour (brand new in this set)</li>
	<li>10x Assault Terminators (brand new in this set)</li>
	<li>&nbsp;5x&nbsp;Regular Terminators</li>
</ul><p>The new Assault Terminators can be armed with either thunder hammer and storm shields, which have low attacks, high strength, and high damage, plus an additional wound for the storm shield, or twin lightning claws, which have more attacks, a better to hit roll, but lower strength and damage than the thunder hammer option. Your choice will depend on what targets your force is going up against, but with 10 in the Battleforce, you can build a squad armed with 5 of each, or the whole 10 armed with the same loadout.</p>

<p>These Terminators are also available for any chapter, they just happen to be releasing alongside a swathe of other Ultramarines releases, and although the box art features an Ultramarines color-scheme, the included transfer sheet has decals for the&nbsp;Ultramarines, Salamanders, Imperial Fists, White Scars, and Raven Guard.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-new-ultramarine-releases-4.jpg?itok=IAFvTOa2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-new-ultramarine-releases-4.jpg?itok=jYpWGc1S 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Are You Codex Compliant?</h2>

<p>The Ultramarines are the largest and considered the most organised of the Space Marine chapters. As a legion of the founding Space Marines, their Primarch wrote the book on Space Marine organisation and methods of war, the Codex Astartes. They strictly adhere to this doctrine, where some other chapters might see it as guidance.</p>

<p>To bring war to the enemies of the Emperor, the Chapter Master of the Ultramarines gets a brand new miniature, along with his personal guard, the Victrix Honour Guard. You might have seen Marneus Calgar and his Honour Guard from that moment in <em>Space Marine 2</em> where he drops from the ramp of a Thunderhawk Gunship to save Titus in a cinematically epic scene.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-new-ultramarine-releases-6.jpg?itok=QU3o60PL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-new-ultramarine-releases-6.jpg?itok=KdK3JCLx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This version of Marneus comes wearing the&nbsp;Armour of Antilochus and carries the Gauntlets of Ultramar, which can be used at range or in close combat. He can also be attached to a terminator unit and deep strike onto the battlefield, and then allow that unit to shoot and charge in a turn in which they advance or fall back to keep the pressure on your opponent. This version also doesn't replace the Gravis armored version that comes with 2 Victrix Honour guard, and both are still valid for use.</p>

<p>We're also getting a new Victrix Honour Guard unit, which Marneus, or any other captain, can lead. These come in units of 3 or 6 and come armed with&nbsp;master-crafted bolt carbines and power axes. They also include options to build a Chapter Champion wielding twin-linked blades of honour and a Chapter Ancient (who carries an absolutely insane banner in true ostentatious Victrix Honour Guard style).</p>

<p>Accompanying the new Victrix release, they have a new Company Champion in&nbsp;Cato Sicarius. This already famous Space Marine hero now leads the Vixtrix Honour Guard, guarding the chapter's highest-ranking officers. Wielding the Talassarian Tempest Blade, which has three attack types (strike, sweep, and coup de grace). Cato deals with threats as they close, rather than waiting to defend his charges, and can join a unit of Victrix Honour Guard with Marnesu Calgar as well.</p>

The shoulder pads come for a variety of different armor types, including Phobos, Tacticus, Gravis, Bladeguard Veterans, Aggressors, and Terminators. The included transfer sheet has 255 Ultramarine decals for a lot of unique variety (as long as it adheres to the Codex).</p>

<p>The new miniatures, especially those for the Ultramarines, look fantastic. Cato and the Victrix especially look like you would expect those who have excelled even beyond the 1st Company of veteran marines. It's also great to see the Assault Terminators, who've had rules and no new miniatures for a while. I'll be building mine all with lightnight claws in true Raven Guard style.</p>

<p>The new Marneus, Cato, and Victrix Honour Guard combine for a pretty devastating unit, which then makes it incredibly difficult to shift Marneus from. But attaching Marnus to a deep striking terminator unit, like those in the Crux Terminatus Battleforce, means he can deep strike far up the battlefield, and bring the pain right to the enemy.</p>

		<p>Cats are lying with dogs, a seven-headed beast has emerged from the ocean, the city walls have crumbled, Halo is coming to PlayStation 5. Truly, the end times are upon us. Or, well, the end of the notion that Xbox gamers will meaningfully breathe the words “console exclusive” ever again.</p>
<p>Still, it did look nice. Here’s hoping Halo: Campaign Evolved does a better job of retaining the visual feel of the original than the first Anniversary Edition.</p>
<h2>In the News This Week</h2>
<p>So, that’s obviously the biggest headline of the week. Let’s get all the biggest stories we’ve caught, though.</p>

</ul>
<p>Phew! Well, what else could we squeeze into the features this week? Well, I had some thoughts about the revisionist storytelling of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/20/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown-lets-you-rewrite-the-worst-90s-star-trek/"><strong>Star Trek: Voyage – Across The Unknown</strong></a>, which lets you take different paths through the 90s Trek series story, and Amazon might have one of the first good uses for LLMs in video games, to create more interactive characters, starting with <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/23/amazon-luna-wants-to-take-over-family-gamenight-with-snoop-dogg-presiding-over-courtroom-chaos/">Courtroom Chaos starring Snoop Dogg</a></strong>. Yup, he’s basically Judge Judy for the relaunching Amazon Luna.</p>

<p>Rounding out the week, <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/24/what-we-played-jurassic-world-evolutions-3-pokemon-z-a-battlefield-6/">What We Played</a></strong> featured Jurassic World Evolutions 3, Pokémon Z-A &amp; Battlefield 6.</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>What have you been playing this week?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Andrewww </strong>has finally finished the story of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, switching down to story mode to get past the button mashing of combat and the more enjoyable environmental riddles. He also made a start on Cocoon and the Silent Hill 2 remake, the latter of which had monster much too early for his tastes. He just wanted to walk round in the fog.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week’s round up. Enjoy the weekend, and we’ll catch you for more gaming shenanigans next week!</p>

<p>Before we dive into what we're playing, let's quickly recap this week. First up, Masahiro Sakurai presented another hour-long Direct for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, and it was a doozy. We've <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-direct-2-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">compiled all the major announcements in one place</a>, so be sure to check it out if you missed it.</p>
<p>Several big games have also been confirmed for Switch 2, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/system-shock">System Shock</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. But if your heart lies with Nintendo games, then you'll be pleased to know that the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a> will be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendo-expands-switch-2s-gamecube-library-next-week-with-a-spooky-classic">heading to Nintendo Switch Online next week</a> - hooray!</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer<br></h2>
<p>It's still all about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ball_x_pit">Ball x Pit</a> at the moment, and I'm thrilled that we're getting a Switch 2 version next week with a free upgrade for current owners. It's just such an addictive game, and I say this as someone who never got along with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>. I can't put it down!</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This weekend, I will mostly be playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades 2</a>. However, since my friends keep telling me how bad the ending is, and the upcoming patch promises to fix that, I might have to slow down slightly so that I don't get to the bad ending before it gets fixed.</p>
<p>I will also be playing some games for awards judging that I'm doing! And maybe some Ball X Pit, because my friend who worked on it sent me a code, and maybe some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/regency_solitaire">Regency Solitaire</a>, because my friend who thinks I should play it sent me a code, and maybe some <strong>Sims 4</strong>, because I'm using it to map out a floor plan for something I'm working on. Also, it's my birthday, so... cake???</p>

<h2>Felix Sanchez, Video Producer</h2>
<p>This weekend I'm gonna be playing 1, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a>: I've gotten into it again, and there's just so so much – one of the most impressive games of all time. 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/storyteller">Storyteller</a>: a game I only briefly tried out a month ago, but really want to jump back into, since the game's premise seemed really cool! And finally maaaaybe 3, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>: I bought it because of all the buzz, and might have a friend who's gonna do the same, so 2-player online roguelike beat 'em up might be on the menu!</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>It's time to dive into Ball X Pit and spend all weekend... probably playing Ball X Pit. If my addictive personality kicks in, then it's all over for other activities.</p>
<p>Though since I'm done with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> for the most part (until the DLC), it's back to finishing up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> too. Hopefully. Have a good one!</p>

<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>This weekend I'm hoping to spend some more time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blippoplus">Blippo+</a>. It's a beautifully odd thing from what I've seen so far, but I wonder how much it would appeal to people outside a very specific age bracket.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, I still need to kick the final boss' behind in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> (I'm hoping upgrading my Elephant Bananza will make the final fight breezier), I want to get back to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, and I've played about 25 minutes of Final Fantasy Tactics. Lots to be getting on with! Have a good one, folks.</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Finished up Star Wars Outlaws main campaign last Wednesday, so the weekend will be spent taking care of the extra “Pirate's Fortune” DLC mission. I must confess to very poor Hades 2 progression on the Olympus front, will continue to try hard(er). Some new physical Switch arrivals this week with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/earthion">Earthion</a> and Absolum getting some priority treatment.</p>
<p>UFO 50 report: 40 of 50 games played. The four games this week are all a treat, with Valbrace a particular highlight since it fixes my only issues with dungeon crawlers by providing action oriented combat. But Rakshasa’s death gamble, Star Waspyr’s power-up mechanic and the wild west meets Final Fantasy Grimstone are all on my favourites list.</p>
<p>Game of the week is <strong>Alentejo: The Tinto and The Ugly</strong>. It’s not often we get a Game Boy developed game made in Portugal, let alone a sequel! By the time you’re reading this I will be covering the game’s lunch party. Wish me luck, pardner’.</p>

<p>Yes, like many other games nowadays, this patch will apparently be adding some of the "things" discussed during the latest broadcast. <strong><br></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Masahiro Sakurai:</strong> "Some of the things I covered today will be implemented via a day one update, so be sure to download the update if you're planning to buy the physical version."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Previous Nintendo releases, such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, have sometimes released day one updates to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/mario-kart-world-update-is-out-now-here-are-the-patch-notes">enable access to online play</a> and activate certain features. It seems like there might be a <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000103774">similar update for Kirby Air Riders</a>, based on a translated message on the game's Japanese store page listing:</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Notice from the manufacturer</strong> "Update data is required to play via internet or local communication."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, if you are picking up a physical copy of Kirby's new game, expect a download on release. And when Nintendo shares the official patch notes, we'll provide an update.</p>
<p>If you missed the latest broadcast, be sure to check out our guide here on Nintendo Life. Some of the news included new modes, online play, gameplay details, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/kirby-air-riders-global-test-ride-demo-kicks-off-next-month">a global test ride demo</a>, and there were even some new amiibo revealed.</p>

<p>While there's no word from Xbox about this, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has issued a reminder about how Xbox is very much open to supporting the Switch 2 going forward. He also acknowledges the "excellent support" Microsoft's gaming division has received from Nintendo.</p>
<p>Here's what he had to say about this during a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/55776">recent chat with Famitsu</a>, according to a rough translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We are making efforts to lower the barrier to entry for people to play our games through services like Xbox Play Anywhere and Xbox Game Pass. However, if there are people who want to play our games on the PlayStation 5 or the Nintendo Switch 2, we would love for them to play our games on those platforms. In that regard, we have received excellent support from both Sony Interactive Entertainment and Nintendo."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spencer has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/xbox-is-really-looking-forward-to-supporting-switch-2">previously mentioned this year</a> how the Xbox team is "really looking forward" to supporting the Switch 2, so now that Nintendo's new hybrid system has been released (and more developers are finally getting their hands on dev kits), maybe there will be more announcements going forward.</p>
<p>Xbox has also stated over the past year how it wants to bring more games to "more platforms", and even did a deal in 2023 to revive the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/call_of_duty_ghosts">Call of Duty</a> series on Nintendo devices. It's also released titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grounded">Grounded</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pentiment">Pentiment</a> on the Switch.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-nightmare-inspirations/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dying-light-the-beast%E2%80%99s-nightmare-difficulty-is-inspired-by-alien-isolation-and-resident-evil-3.1334752/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a blog post on Dying Light’s Pilgrim Outpost, Tymon Smektala, the franchise director at Techland, has expanded on everything coming to Dying Light: The Beast. The Techland veteran explained about the Call of the Beast challenge path, the New Game+ mechanics coming soon, and the new ‘Nightmare Mode’ that’s being added in the future.</p>



<p>In Tymon’s words, some elements of Nightmare Difficulty have been inspired by other games, namely Alien: Isolation and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis.</p>



<h2 id="h-dying-light-the-beast-is-the-gift-that-keeps-on-giving">Dying Light: The Beast is the Gift That Keeps on Giving</h2>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast is a phenomenal open-world zombie game with plenty of meat on the bones, despite being born as a DLC for Dying Light 2: Stay Human. In a post on the Pilgrim Outpost, Tymon Smektala explained about everything else that’s in store for The Beast.</p>



<p>While <a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/dev-blog-11-week-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the post</a> references Legend Levels, the Ray Tracing update for PC, and the collaboration with PUBG Mobile, one of the juiciest tidbits came from the discussion about Nightmare Mode.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re currently looking into each of our bosses to see how we can adjust their behaviors to make them more unpredictable. On top of that we’re also considering some neat tweaks to our Volatile enemies – these are just intentions, so I don’t want to promise too much, but we’re looking at games like Alien: Isolation or Resident Evil 3: Nemesis for inspiration.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Nightmare Mode loop will be introduced <strong>after </strong>New Game+ and the Legend Levels update, and it’ll be more of an intelligent update than just making enemies stronger. That’s what Tymon has promised, anyway.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Yes, enemies will do more damage and the game more demanding, but that isn’t the point on its own. We’d like to try a more realistic survival loop – so expect some new mechanics in that regard.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast players can participate in an ongoing challenge path that will run into 2026. Through this, users can unlock exclusive rewards for taking part in community challenges, the first of which required the player base to rack up 60 million sliced off limbs.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Twitch CEO Dan Clancy Responds to Emiru Assault: ‘We Failed’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-ceo-dan-clancy-responds-emiru/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/twitch-ceo-dan-clancy-responds-to-emiru-assault-%E2%80%98we-failed%E2%80%99.1334749/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, clips surfaced on social media showing Emiru, a popular streamer and cosplayer, being forcefully assaulted by a man at TwitchCon in San Diego. The content creator was approached by a man who grabbed her in an embrace and seemed to try to kiss her. In the clips that emerged, we saw a woeful response from event security, and in the days that followed, Twitch failed to address the incident.</p>



<p>Now, in a lengthy post, Twitch CEO Dan Clancy has written about the incident involving Emiru and has stressed what is being done to improve things moving forward.</p>



<h2 id="h-it-means-a-lot-to-us">‘It Means a Lot to Us’</h2>



<p>Dan Clancy’s <a href="https://x.com/Twitch/status/1981825064904667169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">response</a> to the Emiru assault situation was lengthy, but fans and other creators have already batted the statement down and attempted to kick back the ‘apology’:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>First, I want to be upfront and take accountability for the security incident that occurred during Emiru’s Meet and Greet. It shouldn’t have happened and we take that very seriously. We failed, both in allowing it to occur, and in our response following. We mismanaged our communications about the incident, and that includes the comments I made. I apologize to Emiru for all that took place. </p>



<p>What are we doing moving forward? For Meet and Greets, we’ve begun a complete analysis of the incident that took place, as well as other issues that came to our attention after TwitchCon concluded. We’re examining everything, from how we do sign ups, to the layout, to increased security controls. </p>



<p>We’re also doing a comprehensive review of overall event safety and security, and will be making updates for future TwitchCons. While we won’t be sharing all security updates for privacy and safety reasons, we will keep our community informed about changes that directly impact attendees. </p>



<p>We have heard concerns about IRL streaming at TwitchCon. Twitch has evolved over the years, and IRL streaming is a part of Twitch. But, we need to ensure that TwitchCon meets the needs of a variety of participants. We will be reviewing how we handle IRL streaming at TwitchCon, and will have more to share soon. </p>



<p>Finally, we got clear feedback on accessibility across the event. We’re reviewing with our teams, including our production and venue staff, so that we’re better equipped for future events. </p>



<p>You put a lot of trust in us by attending TwitchCon, and we take our responsibility to keep you safe seriously. We know that TwitchCon means a lot to a lot of people, and it means a lot to us. Be on the lookout for more updates, and thanks for being a part of Twitch. </p>



<p>– Dan Clancy</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Users were quick to jump on Dan Clancy’s comments under the post on X (formerly Twitter), with some pointing out how much of a holistic failure TwitchCon was (and will likely continue to be).</p>



<p>One streamer wrote, ‘I must pathetically claim that I am EMBARRASSED to be a Twitch streamer.’ Another was quick to point out similar failings from Twitch: ‘And you’re only saying this because Emi’s a big streamer and there are a lot of eyes on this. How many smaller streamers have dealt with similar or worse but have had their complaints swept under the rug?’</p>



<p>Do you think Twitch needs to do better, or is this par for the course for the platform? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In the run-up to the release of Black Ops 7, a point of contention for the community is around the innovation (or lack of) tied to Call of Duty: Warzone. The battle royale platform that was released in March 2020 has started to stagnate yet again, and fans are dropping off for alternate experiences, such as the upcoming Battlefield 6 ‘RedSec’ battle royale release.</p>



<p>In a recent blog and <a href="https://x.com/RavenSoftware/status/1981852213581381882" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media post</a>, Raven Software acknowledged that Warzone’s Resurgence experience is becoming stale and recognized that the Rebirth Island map is in dire need of a revitalization.</p>



<h2 id="h-too-little-too-late">Too Little, Too Late</h2>



<p>Many Warzone creators and diehard fans have stressed that Raven Software is making changes far too late, especially as the first season of Black Ops 7 will bring a new small-form Warzone map – <strong>Haven’s Hollow</strong>.</p>



<p>In any case, the team at Raven is desperate to refresh the Rebirth experience by tidying up the map:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve heard you loud and clear – Rebirth Island and the broader Resurgence experience have started to feel a bit stale.</p>



<p>So, to start, we’re delivering a full refresh to Rebirth Island in Season 02, which includes new POI updates, a cosmetic pass, and several other upgrades that improve flow.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Following the launch of Haven’s Hollow, Raven Software will reintroduce a map rotation system, switching between Haven’s Hollow and Rebirth Island to keep things ‘fresh’.</p>



<p>It was promised that, in the coming weeks, a ‘deep dive on how (they) intend to deliver a higher frequency of updates’ will take place. It was confirmed that Warzone will receive balancing changes to alter the meta <strong>twice per season</strong>, and that from season two onwards, the competitive community will receive updated Ranked and Private Match mechanics.</p>



<p>All this will come before or during the launch of Avalon, the new Blackout-themed Warzone map landing during season two, several weeks after the launch of Black Ops 7 on November 14.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/former-playstation-exec-slams-live-service-games-repetitive/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/former-playstation-exec-slams-live-service-games-%E2%80%98it%E2%80%99s-a-repetitive-action-engagement-device%E2%80%99.1334740/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent interview, former PlayStation executive Shawn Layden went in against the company’s pivot to focusing on live-service games, which has yet to pay off. For several years, PlayStation’s studios have tried to produce a solid live-service game, but have mostly failed in their quest to do so.</p>



<p>Layden, who departed PlayStation in 2019 due to the creative direction the company was taking, recently criticized the live-service market, explaining how, in his eyes, live-service titles <strong>aren’t real games</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-again-and-again-and-again">Again and Again and Again</h2>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2025/10/24/video-games/sony-playstation-online-multiplayer-live-service-struggles-concord-marathon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Ringer</a>, a variety of indutstry names gave their two cents to answer the question, ‘Why can’t Sony make more multiplayer hits?’</p>



<p>One such name was Shawn Layden, a former PlayStation executive who was at the company for just short of a decade, who has fired shots at the live-service mission on PlayStation’s slate.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>A live-service game to me isn’t really a game. It’s a repetitive action engagement device.</p>



<p>For me, a game—because of where I come from—means I need three things. I need a story, I need a character, and I need a world. And&nbsp;<em>Horizon</em>,&nbsp;<em>God of War</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Uncharted</em>&nbsp;have all three of those things. </p>



<p>If you’re doing a live-service game, you just need a repetitive action that most people can get their head around, an ability to communicate in that world with other like-minded people, and the player’s desire to do it again and again and again.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Layden went on to stress that every developer successful in the live-service space found the winning formula ‘five, six years ago’. There was a boom of sorts that saw games like Fortnite skyrocket in popularity, and since then, everyone with a multiplayer offering seems to have jumped on the seasonal operating model.</p>



<p>These days, it’s very rare to succeed with a new live-service game, Layden insists:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s like a mirage on the top of a sand dune. You pursue it. You can’t quite get there. Or if you do get there, what you brought to the party no one wants to play anyway.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Do you think live-service games should be abandoned by developers in favor of an alternate operating model? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>During the Halo World Championship event, the future of the Halo series was uncovered, including the imminent arrival of Halo: Campaign Evolved on PS5. This marks a milestone moment, as it’s the first time in history that a Halo title has wound up on a PlayStation platform.</p>



<p>Those who have potentially never played a Halo game because of their platform of choice are now preparing to dive into the sci-fi shooter series. That’s all well and good, but when is Halo: Campaign Evolved coming to PS5?</p>



<p>Let’s find out about the release window.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-out">When is Halo: Campaign Evolved Coming Out?</h2>



<p>Halo is a legendary series that has been the face of Xbox for more than two decades. The franchise has been expanded over the years with a live-action television series, books, animated projects, and, of course, a hulking stack of major and minor games.</p>



<p>Next year, Halo will come to PlayStation for the first time. This was addressed by the PS team in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-launches-on-ps5-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent blog post</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For nearly 25 years, Halo has offered players an epic sci-fi universe to explore, unforgettable characters to meet, and exhilarating gameplay to experience together. From large-scale battles to friendships formed over late-night co-op sessions, Halo has always been more than just a game – it’s about the players who’ve made it part of their lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the beginning, we wanted to build a world with stories and experiences that bring people together. And now, for the first time, PS5 players will get to be part of that journey too.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, there isn’t a release date for Halo: Campaign Evolved on PS5, Xbox, or PC</strong>. It can be wishlisted on all these platforms, but aside from a window of ‘2026’, there are no further indications as to when Halo: Campaign Evolved will be released.</p>

                <p>Retro Games Limited just launched a new version of its miniature Commodore 64 home computer. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/THEC64-Mini-Black-Not-Machine-Specific/dp/B0FKJCL1ZF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The C64 Mini - Black Edition</a> is a limited release that celebrates the talented developers who create modern Commodore games. The Black Edition comes preloaded with The C64 Mini's original 64-game lineup <em>and </em>25 modern titles, including all-time C64 greats like Sam's Journey and A Pig Quest.</p><p>The C64 Mini - Black Edition retails for $120 and is exclusive to Amazon in the United States. Amazon is "temporarily out of stock" on launch day (October 24), but you can still place an order. The original C64 Mini launched in 2018 with a $70 MSRP--you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/C64-Mini-not-machine-specific/dp/B07GMV1X1K?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">grab one today from Amazon for only $51</a>. The substantial price hike is probably partially tied to economic changes and tariffs, but the inclusion of the modern games likely played a much larger role.</p><p>The vast majority of the new games--19 to be exact--are sold on itch.io by big Commodore 64 publishers, including <a href="https://psytronik.itch.io/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Psytronik</a> and <a href="https://www.protovision.games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Protovision</a>. Psytronik's games are usually five bucks or less, but titles published by Protovision tend to carry higher price tags. There are four preloaded Protovision games that would normally cost around $55 combined: <a href="https://protovision.itch.io/sams-journey" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sam's Journey</a> ($24), <a href="https://piggy18.itch.io/a-pig-quest" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A Pig Quest</a> ($11.61), <a href="https://protovision.itch.io/mw-ultra" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MW Ultra</a> ($11), and <a href="https://protovision.itch.io/yeti-mountain" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yeti Mountain</a> ($9). These are among the most ambitious C64 games around. For instance, developer Knights of Bytes created over 2,000 screens for Sam's Journey's 30 extremely long levels. It's one of the best retro platformers I've ever played (it's also <a href="https://knightsofbytes.itch.io/samsjourney-nes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available on NES</a>). In short: The $50 price increase seems more than reasonable.</p><div data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4799" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="Commodore 64 Mini (C64 Black Edition)" data-collection="" title="Commodore 64 Mini (C64 Black Edition)">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/THEC64-Mini-Black-Not-Machine-Specific/dp/B0FKJCL1ZF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/THEC64-Mini-Black-Not-Machine-Specific\/dp\/B0FKJCL1ZF?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/THEC64-Mini-Black-Not-Machine-Specific/dp/B0FKJCL1ZF?tag=gamespot-promos-20">The C64 Mini - Black Edition (89 Games)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/THEC64-Mini-Black-Not-Machine-Specific/dp/B0FKJCL1ZF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/THEC64-Mini-Black-Not-Machine-Specific\/dp\/B0FKJCL1ZF?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/THEC64-Mini-Black-Not-Machine-Specific/dp/B0FKJCL1ZF?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$120 | Available Now</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Black Edition comes with the same items as the original: The C64 Mini computer, a classic USB joystick, USB power cable, HDMI cable, and instruction manual. Like numerous other mini consoles, it doesn't come with an AC adapter, but basically any USB brick will work. Or you can just power it through one of the USB ports on your TV.</p><p>The C64 Mini is approximately half the size of the original Commodore 64 computer. The "keyboard" is decorative--none of the mini home computers have functioning keyboards. But if you want to use the BASIC interpreter to write your own programs and/or boot games you add to The C64 Mini via USB stick, you can plug just about any keyboard into the second USB port. You can also connect a second joystick for multiplayer. A solid, budget-friendly option is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hyperkin-Trooper-Controller-not-machine-specific/dp/B07M5HYTZL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hyperkin Trooper</a> for around $18.</p><p>The C64 Mini displays games in 720p resolution in pixel perfect or original 4:3 aspect ratios. You can add scanlines (CRT filter) if you want to replicate the classic look. All preloaded games have four save slots, and you can save your progress at any point.</p><p>Here's the full list of modern Commodore 64 games included on The C64 Mini - Black Edition out of the box. The prices next to each title are what you'd pay on itch.io. Games without prices are available to download for free. As a reminder, these are just the new games; the Black Edition still comes with the original 64 games. </p><p><strong>25 New Games:</strong></p><ul><li>A Pig Quest ($11.61)</li><li>Caren and the Tangled Tentacles (~$80, Physical)</li><li>Galencia ($5)</li><li>Good Kniight ($4)</li><li>Grid Pix ($2)</li><li>Guns 'N' Ghosts ($3)</li><li>Hessian ($2)</li><li>Hunter's Moon Remastered ($5)</li><li>It's Magic 2 ($2.22)</li><li>Joe Gunn: Gold Edition</li><li>Metal Warrior Ultra ($11)</li><li>Millie &amp; Molly ($2)</li><li>Nixy and the Seeds of Doom</li><li>Ooze: The Escape</li><li>p0 Snake</li><li>Pains 'N' Aches ($5)</li><li>Planet Golf (~$43, Physical)</li><li>Rocky Memphis: The Legend of Atlantis ($5)</li><li>Runn 'N' Gunn ($2)</li><li>Sam's Journey ($24)</li><li>Shadow Switcher</li><li>Spinning Image</li><li>Steel Ranger ($5)</li><li>Yeti Mountain ($9)</li></ul><p>You can find plenty of other modern C64 homebrew on itch.io.

<figure data-uuid="0aa4728cae145"><a title="Factorio" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0aa4728cae145/factorio.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>Since the launch of the Switch 2 in June, many developers have been announcing upgrades for existing Switch releases.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the construction and management title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/factorio">Factorio</a> will be getting a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition. This title was originally released on the Switch in 2022, and the Switch 2 version will be a free upgrade for existing owners.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The price for this upgrade will be... free. We don't believe paying for a technical upgrade is reasonable."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you don't already own the game, there'll be a paid bundle which includes the game and the Switch 2 Edition upgrade. Here are the features you can expect from this upgraded edition for Switch 2:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ownxjv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<ul>
<li><em>Better resolution. The game will run on the screen's native 1080p resolution instead of 720p. When docked, it supports all resolutions, including 2160p (4K).</em></li>
<li><em>Variable refresh rate support for the console's screen.</em></li>
<li><em>Some higher quality animations.</em></li>
<li><em>Some higher resolution sprites.</em></li>
<li><em>Other visual improvements.</em></li>
<li><em>Faster loading times.</em></li>
<li><em>Ability to build much larger bases.</em></li>
<li><em>Mouse mode support. Using the Joy-Con Mouse Sensor, the left or right Joy-Con can be used as a mouse.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Along with this, it's also been confirmed <strong><a href="https://wiki.factorio.com/Space_Age">Factorio: Space Age</a></strong> is on its way to the Switch 2, as DLC for $35 (or the regional equivalent). It will include the same content as the PC version. The aim is to get both the Switch 2 Edition and Space Age out by December (before Christmas), but this is "not an official release date" just yet. So when we get a proper date, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>If you're curious to know more about this upcoming release, the developer has documented the title's "<a href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-439">Journey to the Switch 2</a>" on the official blog, and there are also some extra details about the one year anniversary of Space Age.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/full-metal-schoolgirl-review.1334692/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">First impressions matter, right? Full Metal Schoolgirl throws you into its third-person shooter action shortly after a blazing fast anime-inspired opening to the tune of a J-rock banger. It immediately establishes its irreverent attitude and goofy anti-capitalist satire in a futuristic world where robots are exploited and referred to as "the working dead" – and with the goal of taking down a CEO villain, I thought to myself, "Hell yeah." But about halfway through a second run of this roguelike, it dawned on me that there just wasn't much to Full Metal Schoolgirl; it’s a dull and repetitive shooter whose gameplay foundations aren't quite good enough to save it from the largely tedious, unrewarding grind up its 100-floor tower.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Full Metal Schoolgirl - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During the intro sequence where you break into the evil Maternal Jobz Corporation, you choose to play as Ryoko or Akemi, two cyborg anime girls who are functionally and aesthetically human – the one you pick winds up being the lead character and the other gets captured and plays into the story as you progress. They're seeking revenge on the company and its CEO for working their dad to death, and the story's initial disdain for corporate bullshit is sharp in a way that reminded me of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-review"><u>Hi-Fi Rush</u></a>. However, that's as far as it goes before things devolve into annoying quips and no real intrigue to motivate each run; like most parts of Full Metal Schoolgirl, it doesn't build on its good ideas and its shallow execution on them wears thin rather quickly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I have a high tolerance for anime tropes, and here, it teeters between charming and eyerolling, and more frequently leans toward the latter. It's not just for its crass innuendos, but also in its incessant yapping that doesn't exude any memorable personality into its interesting premise. I'm not here to handwave the attention drawn to upskirts or the creepy actions of the doctor who upgrades your skills, either – it's just unnecessary. The moments its tropes really do work are at the very beginning and the very end, and it's as if everything in between was overlooked in the process, which is where you'll spend most of your time.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Once you've given Full Metal Schoolgirl a couple runs, you've pretty much seen it all.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Each floor is made up of a series of narrow hallways filled with enemy fodder alongside environmental hazards, as well as square office building rooms that function as small combat arenas. The latter throws optional challenges at you like clearing the room within a time limit or without using heals for extra money for upgrades. But this overall formula does not fundamentally change across its 100 procedurally generated floors. The scenery may change slightly for each block of floors, yet the structure stays the same. While they may throw different enemy types at you like drones, bomb-strapped robots, turrets, and mechanized dogs, no amount of mixing and matching them can make up for mediocre implementation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's easy to see how the procedural generation clashes with itself when certain doors lead to a completely empty room or the combat challenge prompts just don't align with the way encounters are set up. This haphazard level design feels very basic at best and frustratingly messy at worst, and it persists through the large majority of the 14 hours I put into finishing the campaign. Boss fights act as endcaps to blocks of floors, and while they're relatively refreshing after blasting through the same areas over and over again, their attack patterns are quite telegraphed and simple to overcome. Still, I'll take dodging area-of-effect explosions and dumping my ultimates (or Punishment attacks, as it's called) into a spongy boss over thoughtlessly repeating identical floors of enemies, so I do wish these kinds of battles weren't so few and far between.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Defeating a boss grants you a key to start a subsequent run at their floor, which is a godsend to cut through the needless repetition – but, they're one-time-use. If a run goes sideways after using the key and you don't defeat the next boss 20-something floors up for the next key, get ready to start at a much lower level, buddy. While this raises the stakes, as any roguelike worth its salt should do, the disappointment of having to trudge through the most boring parts to make it back to where you left off doesn’t feel worth it. Even though it gets easier on account of upgrading your stats and abilities from the materials and money you earn from each run, ascending chunks of floors still takes a lot of time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was excited that this is an anime-style shooter at least, which is something I've been seeking since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/freedom-wars-remastered-hands-on-preserving-the-vita-classic-as-you-remember-it">Freedom Wars</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/03/03/sword-art-online-fatal-bullet-review">Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet</a> (which didn't quite capitalize on the premise). More often than not, playing through Full Metal Schoolgirl felt like a chore, but I can appreciate the mindless fun its mechanics sometimes offer. With a handful of specific guns and melee weapons I vibed with, I was able to get into a groove, turn my brain off, and just mow down mobs of enemies. Although most guns are pretty counterintuitive for the way encounters are designed, a high-level electric chaingun or chunky plasma ball launcher carry the right kind of weight and feedback you want from a shooter. That said, movement itself is a little too sticky for this style of game, especially when there are annoying platforming sections. And melee attacks and jumps are a tad unresponsive, even if cutting through a crowd with a katana's dash attack or the Labrys axe's aftershocks can be satisfying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's moments like these that started to shine though more frequently in the final chunk of floors. The rate at which genuinely challenging encounters presented themselves, and the confluence of weapons that were fun to use showed up, let Full Metal Schoolgirl finish on a higher note than the absolute slog it took to get there. It didn't exactly flip the script or break away from the conventions established at the start, but it began to make the most of its basic pieces by throwing almost everything at you at a brisk pace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I progressed, I naturally figured out which types of guns worked for me – slow shotguns and rifles never made sense to use, but a strong SMG that'd overheat quickly became a favorite. Learning to manage my energy meter for big axe combos, dodging, and hoverdashing became more important in the late game. And weaving in your auto-attack drone (which you summon on a cooldown) was key to salvaging a few runs. Being smart with the scarce battery supply (which is your healing item) factored into how I approached combat as well. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Michael Higham's 10 Favorite Roguelike/lite Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Rarity of gear you're rewarded with from challenge rooms is random, which leads to moments of pointlessness where I'd clear a challenge room only to be met with common level rarity items that pale in comparison to rare and legendary gear from much earlier floors. At least this makes the modifiers meaningful as they can affect how your health, energy, movement, and damage output works, especially when the shields you equip have a sizable impact on your survivability.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Once you've given Full Metal Schoolgirl a couple runs, you've pretty much seen it all. There are decent ideas with potential that meld the shooter genre and roguelike framework well – it's unfortunate that they get squandered by foundational shortcomings. Whether it be a misunderstanding of what makes the genre work or an intentionally derivative take on roguelike games, the loop it creates is woefully repetitive with boring level design. Although I found some mindless fun since its fundamental gameplay is decent and shines a bit brighter towards the very end, it's certainly not good enough to redeem this monotonous shooter. The anime-inspired charm wears thin as its tropes quickly become annoying, even if its premise shows promise. I got into a groove in its final hour as I ascended the last floors with gear and upgrades that were fun to use, but the climb to get there wasn't exactly worth the slog.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/full-metal-schoolgirl-review]]></content:encoded>

              <p>The AirPods Pro 2 are still Apple’s flagship earbuds and they sit just one generation behind the recently released Pro 3. Here’s the thing though: the improvements between these two generations are incremental at best and definitely don’t justify paying 30 percent more for the newer model. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/">you can grab the AirPods Pro 2 for just $169, down from their usual $249 price tag</a>. That’s<strong> an all-time low on Amazon</strong> and makes these earbuds three times cheaper than Apple’s over-ear AirPods Max headphones.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The first reason listeners are drawn to AirPods Pro 2 is that they fix the problem with listening to audio in noisy settings in the first place. <strong>Noise cancellation in these AirPods is made possible with Apple’s own H2 chip</strong>&nbsp;where it picks up background noise using external microphones and generates anti-noise that effectively cancels it out before it hits your eardrums. The end result is incredibly quiet background noise so that listeners can enjoy their audio with the volume turned down to safe levels rather than competing with background noise.</p>



<h2>Advanced Audio Technology for a Fraction of the Price</h2>
<p>The custom-built driver in each earbud produces<strong> high-fidelity sound with rich bass response</strong>, clear treble, and balanced midrange frequencies that bring out the details in your music. Apple’s Adaptive EQ continuously adjusts the sound profile based on how the earbuds fit in your specific ear shape, which means you get consistent audio quality even if the buds shift slightly during movement. This real-time tuning happens automatically in the background, so you never have to fiddle with manual EQ settings or worry about suboptimal sound. The <strong>personalized spatial audio feature creates an immersive three-dimensional soundstage</strong> that makes audio feel like it’s coming from all around you rather than just two points inside your ears.</p>



<p>The <strong>transparency mode</strong> is one such feature that totally unites the manner in which you use your wireless earbuds in your daily life. You no longer need to physically take out your earbuds every time someone is talking to you or if it is an announcement that you need to pay attention to; rather, with the transparency mode, all you need to do is press the stem, in which case you can immediately understand what is happening around you without having to stop the musical playback in the background, thanks to the external microphones that allow background sounds to seep in while keeping the volume low so that it doesn’t completely pause the playback.</p>
<p>The<strong> hearing aid function is a true innovation</strong> that is more than just an ordinary consumer audio device feature. Following a basic hearing test done by using the app in partnership with the AirPods Pro 2, it is possible to amplify certain frequencies according to your own hearing needs, thus serving as an authentic hearing aid for mild to moderate hearing loss using a clinical-grade level device for the true benefit derived from its usage.</p>
<p>Listening time with the battery is almost six hours with active noise cancellation on, and then<strong> the charging case gives multiple charges for a total playback time of almost 30 hours combined</strong>. The use of USB-C is also a big improvement since it is compatible with charging any other Apple device such as the new iPhone 15 series, iPad, MacBook, and also AirPods with just one cord, thus eliminating cords on your desk or in your backpack. Also, the <strong>charging case is compatible with any Qi-certified charging pad</strong>, plus it is also compatible with the new MagSafe charging devices.</p>
<p>At $169, AirPods Pro 2 provides the essential high-end benefits one would want in a daily listening experience at an affordable price.</p>

                <p>For years, Netflix has told investors that it's serious about investing in the video game industry. But the streamer's ambitions may need to be re-calibrated again. Boss Fight--the studio behind Netflix's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/squid-game-unleashed/" data-ref-id="5000-652368">Squid Game: Unleashed</a> mobile game--has been shut down.</p><p>David Rippy, the CEO and co-founder of Boss Fight, shared the news on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7387225251513827328/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">his LinkedIn page</a>, and shared his gratitude for the experience:</p><p>"Thanks, everyone who reached out today," wrote Rippy. "Rough news, for sure, but I'm very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I'm very proud of, including Squid Game Unleashed, which hit #1 in 26 countries. You'll see lots of Boss Fighters with similar posts. Please consider them if you have any open roles--they are outstanding people and true professionals through-and-through. As for Bill, Scott and me--we're going to take a little breather before tackling whatever is next. Love to hear from you if there's anything interesting going on, workwise or otherwise."</p><p>Last summer, Netflix co-CEO, president, and director Greg Peter indicated that the streamer was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-to-ramp-up-investment-in-gaming-as-company-addresses-further-monetization-possibilities/1100-6533263/" data-ref-id="1100-6533263">going to "ramp up" its investment in gaming</a> in part to explore new monetization options. Earlier this month, Netflix <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflixs-new-batch-of-games-can-be-played-straight-on-your-tv-no-controller-required/1100-6535331/" data-ref-id="1100-6535331">added five new games</a>--Lego Party, Boggle Party, Pictionary: Game Night, Tetris Time Warp, and Party Crashers--that can be played on televisions with your phone as the controller.</p><p>Previously, Netflix had even bigger plans for a AAA multiplayer shooter from a team that included Halo and Destiny veteran Joe Staten. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-shutters-aaa-game-studio-led-by-overwatch-and-halo-vets/1100-6527313/" data-ref-id="1100-6527313">that game and the studio behind it were closed</a> in 2024. Netflix gaming executive Alain Tascan later told <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-boss-explains-why-company-killed-the-aaa-multiplayer-game-from-halo-veteran/1100-6530293/" data-ref-id="1100-6530293">Bloomberg</a> why the streamer pulled the plug on that project.</p><p>"I don't want this move to be seen as, 'We're not going to do big ambitious games,'" said Tascan. "It was just the genre of the game... I don't think was matching the platform. This team was really good at what they were doing, but we wouldn't have been the best partner for them to express their skills and their expertise."</p>
