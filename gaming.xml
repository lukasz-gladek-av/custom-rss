The latest change to homescreen section of the Xbox dashboard will be available to Xbox Insiders this week, alongside options to hide system apps, choose the number of apps and games listed, and modify the size of the tiled UI.</p><p>You’ll soon be able to pin up to three of your recently played games or apps to the homescreen. “These pins will stay near the front of the list as you launch other things, giving you quick access to your go-to titles,” <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/16/xbox-insiders-get-new-ways-to-personalize-home/">explains Eden Marie</a>, principal software engineering lead for Xbox experiences.</p><p>If you don’t want to see system apps listed on the homescreen you’ll be able to disable these to focus solely on games and apps. If you really want to take customization a step further, you’ll also soon be able to reduce the number of visible tiles in the recently played games and apps list. Microsoft says it’s “refining this setting” and it’ll be available to Xbox Insiders soon.</p><p>Microsoft is making these Xbox Home interface changes because fans have requested more customizability. “We’ve heard from many of you that Home should feel more like your space,” says Marie. “Whether it’s surfacing your favorite games, hiding what you don’t use, or simply making Home feel less crowded, this update is a direct response to that feedback.”</p><p>Microsoft previously tested a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/26/23808139/microsoft-new-xbox-home-ui-available-now-download">big overhaul of the Xbox Home UI</a> in 2022, before shipping it broadly to Xbox owners in 2023. The software maker made more room for backgrounds, quick access to games, the store, and settings as part of the UI overhaul.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Feel free to take out all four, but if you’ve got the reflexes, <strong>you can keep one lamp alive just to parry that shot for massive damage</strong>. </p><p>Aside from that, Lampmaster’s got a fairly basic move set of combos and jump attacks. The big issue is that there’s so many goddamn arms that it’s hard to figure out where the hit’s coming from. The easy tip is that <strong>only one of the arms is holding the sword, but even that can be hard to see at this stage thanks to the dark background</strong>. Still, if you can get a visual grasp on it, that’s what you’re keying off of.</p><p>The only other move of note is an energy blast where the lights in their hands turn purple and they hit you with a wave of Dark energy. The dodge timing on that is that it’s hitting after the second gathering of purple energy.

Best we can tell you there is that <strong>their sword will shake a little before the first hit swings down; and the big delay is between the second and third hits</strong>. The good news is it’s easier to see them against the new backdrop, and no individual hit in the combo is dangerous on its own, just <strong>try your damndest not to eat all four strikes</strong>. They also get a second four-hit combo that’s easier to dodge, but the final hit has them flying backwards to charge at you. <strong>There’s a subtle audio cue when the charge is coming, and it’s easily parried.

But here’s a better idea: Stop them from pulling that shit in the first place. <strong>Just before he busts out the new sword, you’ll get a message about them performing a strange ritual with their lamps.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-spoiler-amano-matsuda<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Popular commanders are getting classic Amano art reprints.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards">pre-orders</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mtg-final-fantasy-starter-kit-preorder-where-to-buy-in-stock-amazon">sell out</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gatherings-final-fantasy-commander-decks-are-packed-with-fun-surprising-references">tons of references are revealed</a>, Magic: The Gathering's upcoming crossover with Final Fantasy is shaping up to be its biggest ever. Today, we get to add to that fun with six cards that are available in the upcoming set: three featuring classic concept art by Yoshitaka Amano, and three with more recent art by Toshitaka Matsuda.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Flip through the gallery below to see all six cards</strong>, and read on to learn where to find them yourself:</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering x Final Fantasy - 6 Through the Ages Cards</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The cards we are revealing today are part of the "Through the Ages" bonus sheet that is within the larger main set. That means they are all reprints of existing cards reskinned with concept art and characters from different Final Fantasy games - so while there are no brand new or mechanically unique cards here like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-your-first-look-at-over-a-dozen-new-cards-from-magic-the-gatherings-upcoming-final-fantasy-set">the ones that have been shown off recently</a> or those in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-deck-reveal-spoilers">the Commander decks we previously revealed</a>, they do have art that stretches back all the way to the very first game in the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike the cards in the main set, Through the Ages cards do not become legal in Magic's Standard format (though they still are if the existing card was already legal there, of course), essentially just making them alternate art versions of those cards. That said, they can be found in both the fancier Collector Boosters as well as one in every three of the regular Play Boosters that are used for Limited events like Draft and Sealed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That means if you plan to play a lot of this set either at your local game store or digitally on something like Magic: The Gathering Arena, you are likely to see these cards in action quite frequently. Five of the six cards here are Rares, which means they won't show up as often, but Thrum of the Vestige is notably an Uncommon. That's a reskin for one of Magic's most ubiquitous cards, Lightning Bolt, and I wouldn't be surprised if this particular printing has quite the impact on the set.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Warrior of Light reprinting of Jodah, the Unifier is also certain to be a popular one - Jodah is a powerful and common Commander, and the art used here is Amano's from the Japanese boxart of the original Final Fantasy. Similarly, Amano's iconic art for Final Fantasy 4's Cecil Harvey has been repurposed for one of Magic's strongest partner commanders, Tymna the Weaver, which has only ever been reprinted once before this. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These cards launch physically as part of the larger Final Fantasy set on June 13, with the digital versions going live on MTG Arena and MTGO on June 10. And if you are a Final Fantasy fan who isn't into Magic yet, there is still reason to be excited, as FF7 Remake series director Tetsuya Nomura said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-a-reason-why-sephiroth-has-a-different-design-in-the-magic-the-gathering-set-but-director-tetsuya-nomura-cant-share-more-sparking-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-speculation">the design of Sephiroth on one card is different for some cryptic reason</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomrmarks.bsky.social" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Executive Reviews Editor.

While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/">Mario Kart World</a> is the banner game, the handful of others coming on June 5 are mostly ports of existing games. Among those, Bravely Default is an oddball, as it's an HD remaster of a game that's more than a decade old rather than a modern game like Street Fighter 6 or Cyberpunk 2077 that can finally run on Nintendo hardware. But for my money, Bravely Default is also an all-time RPG classic, and as strange as it feels to be nostalgic for the 3DS era of games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2</a>'s Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster looks to be a great way to play it.</p><p dir="ltr">For those unfamiliar, Bravely Default was a riff on the classic Final Fantasy formula, making it FF in all but name. Four warriors of light, holy crystals, the whole enchilada. It sported a robust class system that encouraged players to find game-breaking combinations, and it was one of the first to sport the ability to speed up encounters and auto-battle--both now mainstays in classic RPG remakes--or even turn them off entirely. The title referred to one of its battle mechanics, the ability to "Default" (defend and store an extra Brave Point aka BP) or "Brave" (spend extra BP, or even go into BP debt, to take extra actions). So for level-grinding, you could Brave every time to burn through low-level enemies, and against tougher enemies and bosses you would need to take a more considered approach.</p><p dir="ltr">It was followed by the semi-sequel, Bravely Second: End Layer, and a full sequel, Bravely Second. Notably unlike the Final Fantasy series, the Bravely games take place in one consistent canonical world, so the sequels build on the stories and continuity that came before them.</p><p dir="ltr">But like much of the 3DS library, Bravely Default is not exactly easy to play anymore. You need working 3DS hardware and a game cartridge, and unlike Bravely Default 2, it was never released on another platform like Steam. That makes it a prime candidate for the HD remaster treatment, allowing fans to own it in a format that continues well into the future. After a brief hands-on, I'm convinced that Bravely Default will be my most-played Switch 2 game outside of Mario Kart at launch.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496384-01_battle_brave_en.png" data-ref-id="1300-4496384" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496384-01_battle_brave_en.png" data-ref-id="1300-4496384"></a><figcaption>The Battle menu in Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496384-01_battle_brave_en.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496385-01_battle_brave_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496386-01_character_tiz01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496387-01_character_tiz02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496389-01_concept02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496390-01_concept03_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496392-01_concept04_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496393-01_job_freelancer_abi01_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496395-01_job_freelancer_abi02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496396-01_system_graphic_new_en.png" data-ref-id="1300-4496385,1300-4496386,1300-4496387,1300-4496389,1300-4496390,1300-4496392,1300-4496393,1300-4496395,1300-4496396" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496385-01_battle_brave_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496386-01_character_tiz01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496387-01_character_tiz02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496389-01_concept02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496390-01_concept03_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496392-01_concept04_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496393-01_job_freelancer_abi01_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496395-01_job_freelancer_abi02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496396-01_system_graphic_new_en.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496385-01_battle_brave_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496386-01_character_tiz01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496387-01_character_tiz02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496389-01_concept02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496390-01_concept03_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496392-01_concept04_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496393-01_job_freelancer_abi01_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496395-01_job_freelancer_abi02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496396-01_system_graphic_new_en.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">To start, the game looks fantastic. The prerendered painterly backgrounds look incredible and vibrant on the big screen, which is all the more impressive when you consider they were originally made to appear on a 3DS. This visual style--your polygonal characters running against a painted backdrop--was itself a throwback to early 3D RPGs like Final Fantasy 7, but it looks especially wonderful here. Meanwhile, the style of the character models themselves largely holds up. It's a testament to the strength of the art style that these characters--squat chibi characters rendered in the unmistakable style of Akihiko Yoshida--still look so elegant in their simplicity. I wasn't able to tinker with the job classes to see the lovely way these models look when donning their various outfits, but I'm looking forward to it.</p><p dir="ltr">The battle system remains untouched as far as I can tell, which is fine by me because it's already perfectly balanced. I only played a little bit of an early area but I know from experience that the combination of the Brave/Default and job-class systems creates some engaging combat puzzles, especially once the game starts challenging you to split its systems wide open. This is a game that absolutely wants to make you feel like you've outsmarted it.</p><p dir="ltr">The newest element is a pair of minigames, which seem well designed even if they're temporary diversions at best. Both use the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-that-supports-joy-con-mouse-controls/2900-6517/">Switch 2 mouse functionality</a>, challenging you to use both at once in different ways. The first is a rhythm game that has a glowing tether between your two cursors, and so matching the rhythm means lining up the tether to intersect with the music prompts, or hitting exact notes with the cursors themselves. The second is an airship-piloting game set in the first-person perspective of a pilot, so you have to manage steering the ship's wheel while also tending to other tasks. Imagine Steel Battalion but cute, with its massive controller being virtualized on screen. Neither game feeds back into the main game, but you can use the job-class costumes in the minigames as you unlock them for a bit of personalization.</p><p dir="ltr">I doubt I'll play much of the minigames. They're neat little showpieces for the Switch 2 mouse functionality, but they aren't the draw. The real prize is Bravely Default, one of my favorite modern(ish) RPGs, getting a beautiful restoration and being released from 3DS jail. If you haven't played it before, or even if you have, this looks to be the way to experience it.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) - Official Release Date Reveal | Trailer 2</p>
      </div>
<p>GTA Online gets weekly updates, but Zelnick is likely referring to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-online-is-adding-story-dlc-featuring-gta-5s-franklin-and-dr-dre/1100-6498737/" data-ref-id="1100-6498737">the biggest ones that have added new story content</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-online-adds-big-new-mode-assault-on-cayo-perico/1100-6516769/" data-ref-id="1100-6516769">big new heists.</a> Rockstar apparently originally planned even more expansions for GTA Online, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-have-had-a-james-bond-like-story-dlc-actor-says/1100-6522891/" data-ref-id="1100-6522891">James Bond-like DLC focused on Trevor.</a></p><p>Rockstar remaining so dedicated to GTA Online over the years is part of the reason why the game has continued to be so successful--and lucrative. The game features <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-s-online-mode-is-the-gift-that-keeps-on-giving-take-two-says-about-its-monetary-opportunity/1100-6418882/" data-ref-id="1100-6418882">microtransactions</a> as part of Take-Two's ambition to create ongoing revenue beyond sales of the base game. And those have been strong, too, as GTA 5 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-has-sold-an-absolutely-absurd-amount-of-copies-in-the-last-three-months/1100-6531582/" data-ref-id="1100-6531582">just sold another 5 million copies in the past three months</a> to boost its lifetime tally to 215 million.</p><p>"Our strategy is when we give consumers a hit, they would like to stay engaged. And that requires our teams to create more content quite properly, to support that content, and to market that content," Zelnick explained. "The business has become a worldwide, ongoing business.

                <p>The Android gaming handheld scene is bursting with options, but the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DT4G4PD2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Retroid Pocket 5</a> offers arguably the best performance for the price among today's retro handhelds. Released late last year, the sleek portable sports powerful hardware capable of running high-end native Android games and apps, while also doubling as great portable for streaming console and PC titles. It has a custom frontend for retro games and is powerful enough to run sixth- and some seventh-generation console games.

                <p>Darth Vader is one of the most looming and well-known characters in all of pop culture. Actor James Earl Jones provided most of Vader's lines throughout his history (with actor Matt Sloan taking over for some video games and television appearances), and actually signed over his voice for future Star Wars productions before his passing. However, something tells me Jones didn't predict Vader ever dropping the F word in a video game.</p><p>An <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-now-lets-you-speak-to-darth-vader-with-the-ai-generated-voice-of-james-earl-jones/1100-6531599/#:~:text=Users-,Fortnite%20Now%20Lets%20You%20Speak%20To%20Darth%20Vader%20With%20the,Fortnite%2C%20with%20his%20family's%20consent." data-ref-id="1100-6531599">AI model for Jones' voice as Vader is used</a> for the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-new-weapons-in-star-wars-galactic-battle-all-guns-and-loot/2900-6520/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6520">Fortnite addition</a>, and the Dark Lord has been saying some pretty wild stuff to players, including <a href="https://x.com/AciDicGamerz/status/1923359424581689384" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">eliminating their duos partner</a> and using profanity. Fortnite player Loserfruit was a witness to Vader using her words "freaking" and "f---ing" when she was asking about what food he was eating.</p><p>"Freaking? F---ing? Such vulgarity does not become you, Padme," Darth Vader replied. Obviously, the moment went super viral, super quick, with Epic Games responding on Twitter that a hotfix was indeed in place immediately.</p><p>"We pushed a hotfix immediately and this shouldn’t happen again," it <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1923397890241593822" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">replied</a>. Now, with the model in use, this isn't the only weird thing Vader is saying.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blades-of-fire">Blades Of Fire</a> is the latest dark fantasy smackeroo from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/castlevania-lords-of-shadow">Castlevania: Lords Of Shadow</a> developers MercurySteam. It takes place in a world where steel is a divine substance passed down to humanity by the mysterious Forgers. Some sinister young queen has, however, cast a spell that turns everybody else’s steel into stone, granting her followers a near-monopoly on all the butt-kicking.</p>
<p>Playing as bleak and burly beardyman Aran “We Have Kratos At Home” de Lira, your job is to chase down that queen, murder her minions, and craft a whole bunch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darksiders">Darksiders</a>-esque weaponry. Aran is accompanied by Adso, a juvenile sidekick in the vein of Atreus, who catalogues the game’s “over 50” enemy types and can also translate lore written in the ancient Forger language.</p><!--more-->

<p>I’m keen on what I’ve seen of Blades Of Fire’s geography, which is stuffed full of ruined palaces, enchanted trees and such. I’m much less keen on Aran – he’s got a tragic past he “refuses to let define him entirely”, but any empathy I feel is sabotaged by the fact that Aran’s default outfit consists of at least eight belts. I’m undecided, meanwhile, on the combat. It’s described as “unique”, with controller buttons corresponding to body parts, but come now, MercurySteam, the concept of limb-targeting is literally as old as I am.</p>
<p>Ah, if only there were some kind of demo I could play to work through my misgivings. Oh yeah, that’s right – publishers 505 have <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/blades-of-fire-demo-78b5d3">just released a demo on the Epic Games Store</a>. Way to smother the lede, Evans-Thirlwell!</p>
<p>As you might deduce from the title, Blades Of Fire is heavy on the blacksmithing. You’ll collect Forge Scrolls to develop your crafting capabilities. There are 30 of these scrolls, plus seven weapon families, at least three types of damage in the shape of stabbing, slashing and bludgeoning, and an unspecified quantity of different raw materials. All of which allows for “almost infinite weapon combinations”. Please, PRs, I beg of you. Please allow the ridiculous phrase “almost infinite” to die. I hate getting all tangled up in self-contradictions when I’m trying to count broadswords.</p>
<p>Blades Of Fire is due out on 22nd May, so now is a fine time to sample that demo. Let us know if you do. Also, let us know what your preferred maximum belt count is for a videogame protagonist. Seriously, eight belts - that’s like, four more than Voldo in most Soulcalibur games.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks is exiting early access and getting its 1.0 release on May 22nd, PLAION and Wired Productions has confirmed. The big announcement is that when the game launches, all microtransactions will be removed. Players who have been part of the early access period and bought the in game currency will be able to spend it through the in game store. The in game store is not going to be available for those who did not take part in early access. The general DLC model will replace microtransactions.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks – Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLRTsjrCP00?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Game Director Chris Mallinson, of developer Caged Element, said, <em>“We set out to make the Orkiest of Warhammer 40,000 games, and through our early access period we’ve had thousands of people help us achieve that goal – along with our previous publisher PLAION. Now with Wired Productions picking up the torch, we’re launching out of early access and into version 1.0 with a different approach that we think players will really appreciate and enjoy. We thank both partners for their dedication to the game, along with Games Workshop. We’re of course very happy to be back with our pals at Wired Productions, since we worked with them before on GRIP. Now enuff o’ dat, on to da WAAAGH!!!”</em></p>
<p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:154">Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks was going to be a free to play title funded by microtransactions, though that has obviously changed. The main move to being a paid title means that Caged Element can include player hosted games with custom rules, private games, a free roam mode, and remove the third party account requirement. As the game transitions from free to play to paid, the game will be offline from May 20th to May 22nd. The launch price will be $15.99, 15.99€ and £12.79.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnites-swearing-darth-vader-ai-has-already-been-fixed.1191429/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-swearing-darth-vader-ai-fixed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An exploit that caused&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s new Darth Vader AI to swear at players has already been fixed, so if you were hoping to hear some fruity language from everyone's favorite Sith Lord, you might be disappointed.</p>

<p>Earlier today, a clip showing Australian streamer Loserfruit prompting the game's new AI-powered Darth Vader to swear at her (as preserved <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1923397890241593822" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here by user Cordial</a>) went viral. In the clip, the Vader AI can be heard clearly dropping an F-bomb. He might be evil, but that's probably not what Epic intended.</p>

<p>Following the clip's proliferation, Epic <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1923397890241593822" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">responded</a> to Cordial in order to confirm that the issue "shouldn't happen again", since a hotfix has been pushed. If you ask me, it would have been infinitely funnier if they'd kept the swearing in the game, but I guess we can't have nice things anymore.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-swearing-darth-vader-ai-grievous.jpg?itok=m4uO1d19 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-swearing-darth-vader-ai-grievous.jpg?itok=6wKLtCv7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>General Grievous may be an evil guy, but at least he would never swear at you...</figcaption></figure><p>According to an official <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/disney#darth-vader-faq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a>, Vader's dialogue is generated by Google Gemini 2.0 Flash, and the audio, which is clearly based on original actor James Earl Jones' voice, is created by the ElevenLabs Flash 2.5 model.</p>

<p>Vader only understands English (and not Galactic Basic, weirdly enough), and if you're a minor, you'll need your parent or guardian to approve voice or written communication with Vader via the parental controls section of the game.</p>

<p>The character can be spoken to by the first team to recruit Vader in either the standard Battle Royale mode or its Zero Build alternative, and he's also available in the Ranked play mode, so even if you're trying to sweat up a storm, you can still take some time to chat with Ani (spoiler alert).</p>




<p>The Darth Vader AI is part of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-star-wars-crossover-2025" rel="nofollow">latest&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>collaboration</a>, which also brings the likes of Emperor Palpatine, Poe Dameron, and, er, Darth Jar Jar as skins for players to terrify their foes with.</p>

<p>Of course, if you're playing&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on iOS, then all of this is moot, at least for now; earlier today, Epic announced that Apple has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-offline-worldwide-ios-apple-block" rel="nofollow">blocked the release of the game</a> on iOS in the US and Europe, which means it's currently offline on the platform "worldwide".</p>

A mere vessel without a soul. Someone like Matt Sloan (voice of Darth Vader in various video games and shows) carries more sentiment to this role than an AI ever could. Not to mention that Generative-AI is quite harmful to the environment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As long as we don't have a way of finding renewable energy or a way to minimize harming our future generations, I can't see any 'fun' behind this," they added. "Sure, Darth may comment on sweaty players or comment on his hatred for sand, but is that worth [it] in [the] long-term? Is this small addition really needed to enhance our experience in the bigger sacrifice of polluting our world?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Nothing in this world is certain, except death, taxes, and the internet making AI racist," added <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1ko0lla/comment/msmm0eq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>another</u></a>, while one simply <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1ko0lla/comment/msmofg9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a>: "Leave it to the internet to take a cool thing and ruin it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is probably a timely opportunity to remind parents that players under 13 or their country’s age of digital consent, whichever is higher, will need their parent or guardian’s permission to talk with Darth Vader. You can approve or deny Darth's shenanigans by heading to Epic Games' parental controls and selecting “allow voice and written communication with AI Features."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.

It's unclear if the port will release digitally-only or be sold as a physical edition, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We considered Red Dead Redemption 2 a "masterpiece" when it released in 2018, awarding it a 10/10. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/25/red-dead-redemption-2-review"><u>IGN's Red Dead Redemption 2 review</u></a> said: "Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game of rare quality; a meticulously polished open-world ode to the outlaw era."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps red Dead Redemption 2 coming to Switch 2 wouldn't come as a huge surprise. In a Q&amp;A with investors following Take-Two's most recent financial results, CEO Strauss Zelnick answered a question about the publisher's support of the Switch 2 by saying he felt "great optimism" for Nintendo's new platform. In fact, he said Nintendo's support of third-party publishers this time around was better than it had been in the past.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're launching four titles with Nintendo Switch 2, and that's I think a bigger array of releases than we've ever offered before with a new Nintendo platform," he said. "Historically, being a third-party in the Nintendo business has been a bit challenging. I think Nintendo has been very forthcoming in addressing that. And we're stepping up too, because we have great optimism for the platform. In terms of what we would bring to any platform, we address it on a case-by-case basis, we obviously want to be where the consumers are. But we would not necessarily bring every title to every platform. There are also great catalog opportunities as well."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Rockstar Game Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically, Take-Two is bringing Civilization 7 (June 5, launch day), the NBA 2K and WWE 2K series (unclear which games, or when), and Borderlands 4 (September 12). Those admittedly aren't surprising inclusions, as Take-Two was already publishing all four franchises on the Nintendo Switch. But Zelnick's quote does make it sound like the door could be open in the future to other releases, especially from Take-Two's back catalog. GTA 6 probably won't make the cut, but perhaps GTA V or red Dead Redemption 2?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.
