			<p>Yesterday, we got <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-dominates-us-game-sales-in-april-2025-with-oblivion-remastered-and-active-player-numbers-with-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmation</a> from Circana (formerly NPD) that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered performed very well in the United States last month, managing to outperform the original's 15-month sales in a single month.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://newzoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newzoo</a> has doubled down on the praise with its own global report on engagement and revenue in April. Oblivion Remastered was second only to Fortnite thanks to an 'outstanding' performance, according to Newzoo, and the analysts called it a benchmark for a successful remaster. Minecraft benefited from the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-minecraft-movie-marks-new-opening-record-for-a-videogame-adaptation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record-breaking movie</a>, while <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-selling-2x-as-fast-as-any-other-jrpg-on-steam-proving-square-enix-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/runescape-dragonwilds-has-suddenly-launched-on-steam-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Runescape: Dragonwilds</a> both had successful debuts.</p>
<p>Here's the full overview for the month of April 2025 across PC and console games, per Newzoo:</p>
<h2><em><strong>Revenue Movers and Breakthroughs</strong></em></h2>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</strong> (#2, new) delivered outstanding revenue performance following its surprise launch on April 22, despite the absence of any formal pre-release marketing. The game’s success underscores the enduring power of the IP, the quality of the remaster, and the appeal of its $50 price point, making it a benchmark for how to execute a remaster effectively.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II / III / Warzone / Black Ops 6&nbsp;</strong>(#3, +7) saw strong momentum with the launch of Season 3 on April 2, which introduced new maps, content, cosmetics, and a new Battle Pass. A key highlight is the reintroduction of a revamped version of Verdansk; the original Battle Royale map in Warzone, tapping into the nostalgia trend which recently enjoys great popularity.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Schedule I&nbsp;</strong>(#5, +7) continued its upward trajectory, drawing significant attention and gaining over 4.5 million new players during April alone.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Counter-Strike 2 &amp; GO</strong>&nbsp;(#6, +7) surged following Valve’s release of three new weapon collections (cosmetic skins) on April 1, driving renewed engagement and spend.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Minecraft</strong> (#8, +6) climbed in the rankings despite offering movie-themed DLCs and add-ons for free on the Minecraft Marketplace, showcasing the franchise’s exceptional engagement and monetization strength. It’s also worth highlighting that Premium Revenue in April saw a very significant increase, marking this month one of the strongest ever for Minecraft full-game sales.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Forza Horizon 5 (</strong>#9, +69) experienced a substantial boost as the former Xbox/PC exclusive launched on PlayStation at the end of April, expanding its reach to a new audience.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</strong>(#11, +8) saw an increase in revenue despite a slight decline in MAU rank. The launch of Season 2 on April 4 introduced new monetization drivers, including a Battle Pass and cosmetic content, which encouraged player spending.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong>&nbsp;(#13, new) exceeded sales expectations, surpassing 2 million units sold within just 12 days of launch. The title has resonated strongly with both players and critics, reflecting the impact of a clear creative vision and the dedication of its development team.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>RuneScape: Dragonwilds</strong>&nbsp;(#16, new) launched in Early Access on April 15 and attracted nearly one million monthly active users in just the second half of the month. Its early success underscores the enduring appeal of the RuneScape IP and the compelling execution of its survival gameplay.</em></li>
</ul>
<figure><figcaption>Image credits: Newzoo</figcaption></figure>
<h2><em><strong>Engagement Highlights</strong></em></h2>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Minecraft&nbsp;</strong>(#3, null) no movement on the ladder, but Minecraft achieved a record high in monthly active users (MAU) in April, thanks to the success of "A Minecraft Movie." The game attracted both old and new players, selling over 700K copies in April alone.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Schedule I&nbsp;</strong>(#11, +16) received its first Early Access content update on April 10 and continues to build momentum, maintaining an impressive 98% positive rating on Steam.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>R.E.P.O.&nbsp;</strong>(#13, -1) remains a strong performer in Early Access, sustaining player engagement and earning an overwhelmingly positive review score of 96% on Steam.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</strong>(#14) highlights the enduring power of the franchise, entering the top 20 for both MAU and revenue despite launching without pre-release marketing. Notably, most of its MAUs stem from Xbox, following its day-one inclusion in Game Pass.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong> (#18, -7) is gradually transitioning from a broader appeal to a more dedicated core audience. As expected, PlayStation users are demonstrating the highest retention, driven by the platform’s strong presence in Japan, Monster Hunter's key market.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Overwatch 1 &amp; 2&nbsp;</strong>(#19, -1) slipped one position, even as the percentage of recent positive Steam reviews more than doubled (48%) compared to its lifetime average (23%). Season 16, which<a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-team-says-stadium-mode-is-very-popular-outlines-future-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> introduced a new game mode – Stadium-</a> appears to be a step in the right direction, but fierce competition and a month-over-month decline in console MAU continue to present challenges.</em></li>
</ul>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-review-one-man-army</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-review-one-man-army.1196160/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-review-one-man-army<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I don't think anyone had a turn-based tactics game set in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge" rel="nofollow"><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle</em>s</a> universe on their bingo card, but here we are. Perhaps an even more unlikely combination is that <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> is developed by Strange Scaffold.</p>

<p>Strange Scaffold is a developer known for robust zaniness and unconventional concepts, so their spin on&nbsp;the half-shell heroes is just that: Unexpected. Known for working as a team, the turtles are a force to be reckoned with, but Strange Scaffold turns the concept on its head and asks, "What if the Turtles split up?"</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-level-changes.jpg?itok=2xCY4qZs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-level-changes.jpg?itok=JcsGcQJG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Gotta get a move it. It's just you, after all.</figcaption></figure><h2>Lone Wolves -- or Rather -- Lone Turtles</h2>

<p>Indeed, rather than taking control of all four Turtles at once, this tactics title asks players to control one character per level. Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, and Michelangelo are all doing their own thing in a post-Shredder, post-Splinter world, and that's led them down different paths.</p>

<p>In <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em>, levels feature grid-based tiles a la <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/fire-emblem" rel="nofollow"><em>Fire Emblem</em></a>. Levels are dynamic and throw new obstacles at you as you're told to rush forward to an objective or slay a certain number of enemies. All the while, you have Foot Clan goons ready to pounce on your Turtle. You are, essentially, a lone wolf blazing a path forward against uneven odds.</p>

<p><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em>'s greatest strength is the solo aspect of gameplay; it's also the game's greatest weakness. Like I said, each level has a designated character, so you're forced into the role of a specific Turtle. This gives each character an even amount of playtime to explore their diverse set of abilities.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-rooftop-brawl.jpg?itok=A6pw7GrP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-rooftop-brawl.jpg?itok=Vt3e3QVe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time to kick some baddies.</figcaption></figure><p>That said, I can't help but wish that all four turtles could be played at once. Sure, we've seen the whole gang fight together numerous times, but that's what makes <em>Ninja Turtles</em> what it is. Level design is somewhat toned down to be minimalistic to balance around controlling one unit per level.</p>

<p>The gameplay is very safe and doesn't try anything daring. Would we had all four turtles together fighting against hordes of Foot Clan, I can just imagine the great synergy and chaos that could ensue.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-store.jpg?itok=p6YtRcsI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-store.jpg?itok=TjG6YMCW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can also buy more abilities in the store!</figcaption></figure><h2>The Turtles' Tools of the Trade</h2>

<p>But for all my gripes, Strange Scaffold does an admirable job of making every Turtle feel distinguished and powerful on their own. The Turtles' abilities reflect that of their personalities: Leonardo is a brutal force to be reckoned with and easily the most powerful of the four. Donatello uses gadgets to maneuver around the map and shock his enemies.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Michelangelo skates around on his board with high mobility, flipping around enemies. Raphael, probably my least favorite of the bunch to play, is still a powerhouse, especially with his Berserker ability, which leeches health from KO'd enemies.</p>

<p>Combat generally revolves around careful consideration of spending your limited amount of action points. Wise usage of these points and positioning your unit well is crucial for survival, especially being one character. You can get surrounded by the Foot Clan pretty easily if you're not careful.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-leonardo.jpg?itok=kPdGvvAi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-leonardo.jpg?itok=hWzoNx0L 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time to get Radical.</figcaption></figure><p>One crucial component of the Turtles' attacks is buffs and debuffs. Like in Leonardo's case, getting a KO with his Rad Slash attack grants a stack of Radical, which increases the damage of his next attack. In a similar fashion, on KO, Leonardo's Feint Cut adds a stack of Evasion, allowing him to completely dodge an attack.</p>

<p>It's all about the manipulation of these buffs rather than just trying to defeat as many Foot Clan ninjas as you can. Of course, debuffs play a huge part in <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> as well. Donatello, for instance, can use Stun Kunai to cause the Stuck debuff, keeping enemies in place for a round.</p>

<p>Playing with debuffs, especially Stuck,<em> Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> appeals to the tactical gamer in me. Throwing down Donatello's shock traps, applying Stuck, and watching multiple enemies get KO'd in a single round is cathartic.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donatello-shock-traps-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown.jpg?itok=wSBwB9sa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donatello-shock-traps-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown.jpg?itok=mSlfLWmB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>No one's gettin' to me with this impenetrable wall of shock traps.</figcaption></figure><h2>Goin' on a Rampage in<em> Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown </em></h2>

<p>Once you get the hang of how each turtle plays,&nbsp;<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> isn't all that challenging. The first few levels are a little tricky, just because you're not familiar with their skills. After a few rounds, you'll start going through Foot Clan baddies like nothin'.</p>

<p>Leonardo is <em>especially</em> powerful, and for most of his levels, he is nearly invincible if you use your abilities competently. It's great to fulfill that power fantasy, but victory feels like it comes too easily.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-leonardo-gameplay.jpg?itok=S08iu2eb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-leonardo-gameplay.jpg?itok=ntUkd4Vl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The odds are stacked against them.</figcaption></figure><p>Moreover, enemy variety is lacking. There are only a handful of enemies, and most of them are simply standard goons with three health. Those can be taken out in a hit or two. The more powerful ones are just slower and tankier, and a few other enemies thrown into the mix, like ninjas that spawn with their own stack of Evasion, hardly pose a challenge.</p>

<p>It <em>is </em>fun to faceroll these enemies and plow through levels. A lot of the Turtles' abilities allow for you to push enemies. Pushing enemies off the edge of the map for a cheap kill is always satisfying. So, while I do enjoy the combat and variety each of the group brings,&nbsp;<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> is lacking in terms of difficulty and enemy variety.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-donatello.jpg?itok=gqBiErXO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-donatello.jpg?itok=ljMT0LRI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Donatello, always the brains of the operation.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Blasé Adventure for the Gang</h2>

<p>My understanding of <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> lore is, admittedly, surface level. I dressed up as Leonardo as a kid for dinner every night, enjoyed the occasional episode of the show, and I still play the games that come out. Still, I'm not an expert with the story by any stretch of the imagination.</p>

<p>With that in mind, one of Strange Scaffolds' strengths is writing.&nbsp;Unfortunately, I just don't see that strength on display here. The idea that Shredder and Splinter are dead and the group is out on their own is a concept that opens the door to multiple intriguing narratives. Most of the dialogue just isn't compelling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Ninja Turtles comprise such strong personalities, and while the tech-geek side of Donatello or the rapscallion nature of Michelangelo shines through in some instances,&nbsp; nothing about it really captivated me. It's a breezy game, too, so there's little time for the narrative to get rolling when it can be completed in five or so hours.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-ost-unlock.jpg?itok=tepbRM_S 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-ost-unlock.jpg?itok=vrh4sEF5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can unlock songs to listen to at your leisure. The OST in <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> is quite excellent!</figcaption></figure>

<p>The art style is something I'm conflicted on. I'm a fan of the classic look of the Turtles, and the figurine-like models of the characters and enemies can be endearing. The UI, with its punk, grafiti-like aesthetic oozes with that <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle</em> charm. The rest of it, well, it's a bit bland.</p>

<p>Levels take place in four areas: The streets of New York, the sewer, the subway, and the rooftops. Spend a moment on the subway as Leonardo, and you've pretty much seen how the rest of his levels will look. The sewers, yeah, they're the same throughout Donatello's handful of levels, too.</p>

<p>Despite some gripes,&nbsp;<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown </em>is a charming and competently made tactical game. It feels a bit subdued, especially with the focus on controlling one single Ninja Turtle per level. Despite this, the Turtles themselves feel distinct enough, and there's just the right amount of strategy for it to be a good-but-not-radical time.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A new video from Youtuber Destin Legarie includes a number of allegations about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> developers Bungie from anonymous former employees. Amongst other things, we hear that Bungie staff once proposed a Destiny subscription model, but were "vehemently shut down" by leaders. There are also lots of claims about toxic, unaccountable management, and some throwaway insights about how the company's culture has changed in the course of being acquired by Sony. </p><!--more-->
<p>I confess, the part that catches my eye is a smaller detail: there was apparently concern that a particular Destiny 2 armour set would be so compelling for players, it might stop them hoovering up new gear in the Eververse cosmetics store. I find this intriguing because it speaks to the tricky line I imagine most artists have to walk when calibrating the appeal of outfits in loot-driven games with microtransactions. You don't want any of your work to look ugly, but there needs to be an obvious distinction between the included drops and the bits you're selling separately. It seems like it should be fun, in the absence of tyrannous executives, to haggle over that distinction.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7wZ2tpjrmE">Destin Legarie's video</a> is a mixture of paraphrase and quotation. He doesn't share much background on his sources, or indicate how many he's spoken to, so it's not clear how representative all this is of the current mood at Bungie. </p>
<p>Sources in the video accuse the company's leadership of being arbitrary, high-handed and overpaid, often shutting down suggestions from creatives in meetings. No names are given, but Legarie's interviewees do comment positively about certain former Bungie higher-ups - former chief technology officer Luis Villegas, former community manager Eric Osborne, and former game director Joe Blackburn. </p>
<p>The video's sources also reserve some vitriol for Bungie's human resources team, who are characterised as covering up for the missteps and bad behaviour of leaders. One particular HR person, who has now apparently left, is described as being more concerned about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-buying-destiny-devs-bungie-for-36-billion">securing the company's acquisition by Sony in 2022</a>, as part of which they were supposedly due to receive a $5 million payout. Sources also describe having their social media feeds monitored and being warned against promoting themselves as Bungie employees.</p>
<p>According to the video, some or all of those leaders who were difficult to work with have now been shifted to the Marathon reboot, leaving people with much less gamedev experience in charge of Destiny. All this has, according to one source, caused "structural issues that severely undermined the studio's culture, decision-making, and the final product". There's also talk of the studio's "internal language" growing more corporate, with a distinct shift from talk of "games" and "players" to talk of "companies", "products" and "customers" during the Sony acquisition.</p>
<p>Among the examples of this corpo thinking is an alleged disagreement over one Destiny set, the Trials Of Osiris PvP armour, which has fixtures that light up when you win consecutive matches and gain reputation. Management were said to be so worried about its enduring appeal that they "almost [blocked] Expanded Trials Accessory glows to protect Eververse sales". In the abstract, it's a fun one to consider inasmuch as the Osiris gear is obviously designed with permanence in mind - it's a wearable ranking system - but that cuts against the logic of a free-to-play shooter that needs you to keep topping up your DLC wardrobe to make money.</p>
<p>Assuming all of this is legitimate reporting, it continues a chaotic month in which Bungie have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon">caught using an artist's work without permission in Marathon</a>, a project other anonymous former developers have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-a-rough-reception-and-evidence-of-art-theft-in-marathon-morale-is-reportedly-in-free-fall-at-bungie">described as evidence of "good old boy" thinking among Bungie leadership</a>, who have allegedly ignored staff concerns about its shortage of PvE functionality.</p>
<p>I'll ask Bungie and Sony for comment. All this follows <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">mass layoffs last year amid stagnating returns for Destiny</a>. As part of that restructuring, some former Bungie developers have now formed a new studio at PlayStation who appear to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/despair-at-prospect-of-new-playstation-live-service-game-lifted-by-mysterious-mention-of-frogs">working on a game about frogs</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>DICE has published a <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1925204954978861553" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> detailing some of its thoughts about the class system for the upcoming Battlefield game, and it includes bringing back a controversial feature from Battlefield 2042.</p><p>Older titles, like the much-loved Battlefield 4, had class-locked weapons, but Battlefield 2042 introduced the ability for players in any class to choose whatever weapon they wanted. Some portion of the audience didn't enjoy this, while others embraced this expanded freedom, and DICE is sticking with it for the next Battlefield game.</p><p>In Battlefield 6, or whatever the new game is called, DICE said it will allow for "fully customizable weapon loadouts" that give players the "freedom to play the way [they] want."</p><p>Each class will have signature weapons, however, and using them provides certain benefits. For example, DICE said if you choose the Recon class, a weapon from the sniper rifle category will afford increased breath-holding duration. If a player who chose the Assault class uses a sniper rifle, they don't get this benefit.</p><p>DICE said it wanted to offer players the option of customizing their loadouts irrespective of class because doing so may allow them to "meet the needs of your squad" to have success on the battlefield.</p><p>Battlefield 2042 launched with "Specialist" characters as opposed to the traditional class system. People generally did not like this, and DICE brought back the four traditional classes in a later update.</p><p>The developer also confirmed that each class in Battlefield 6 will have a signature trait that provides passive bonuses; a Recon player will be able to spot enemies while aiming down sights, for example. Classes have signature gadgets, too, and they are unique to each class with the aim of giving players what they need to "fulfill the role of that class."</p><p>"We envision the future of Battlefield classes to be a series of interconnected systems and fundamentals that shape your role on the field, while granting you the freedom to customize how you execute that role," DICE said. "Through Battlefield Labs play sessions, feedback, and data gathering, we aim to strike a balance between defined roles and player choice."</p><p>While this is DICE's plan for now, the studio said it might make changes throughout the Battlefield Labs testing process. DICE encouraged people to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">sign up for Battlefield Labs</a> for a chance to try the game out in a future test.</p><p>EA will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-be-fully-revealed-this-summer-launching-by-march-2026/1100-6531349/" data-ref-id="1100-6531349">officially unveil the new Battlefield game this summer</a>.

			<p>Over the years, Rockstar Games and Take-Two have filed multiple patents that highlight how Grand Theft Auto VI will revolutionize open-world games forever.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 Alerts recently posted on <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a> a recap of ten patents owned by Rockstar Games that highlight how the game will push video game boundaries forward to offer an experience like few others. The patents include<a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts/status/1924140270578450830" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> tech for the creation of lifelike characters</a>, <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts/status/1924140273917108735" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simulation of fluid flow on 3D surfaces</a>, seamless NPC movement powered by a <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts/status/1924140277536825480" target="_blank" rel="noopener">road network graph</a> for smooth virtual navigation, <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts/status/1924140281114566866" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enhanced graphics rendering</a> with sharper details, better lighting and smoother performance, <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts/status/1924140285455696244" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continuous level of detail</a> for models which will make buildings, cars and NPCs look great no matter their position relative to the camera, <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts/status/1924140289750598054" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduced load times in online sessions</a> that will allow users to join others seamlessly, use of motion capture in conjunction with AI to predict <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts/status/1924140293563228503" target="_blank" rel="noopener">body pose</a>, a system that manages <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts/status/1924140297015218414" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in-game transactions</a>, use of <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts/status/1924140306066550898" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data-driven blocks for animations</a>, allowing characters to adapt to any situation without requiring rigid coding, and enhanced anti-cheat measures with <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts/status/1924140309447164001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hidden game variables</a>. Each individual patent can be checked out in full by searching for the patent number in <a href="https://patents.google.com/">Google Patents.</a></p>
<p>Little has been shown so far of Grand Theft Auto VI, but given Rockstar Games' history, there's no doubt that it will be among the most impressive open-world games ever released, even if it ends up using only a portion of the tech showcased in the patents above. Sadly, fans of the series will have to wait longer than anticipated to return to Vice City, as the game won't launch this year as originally announced, and will debut on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S only in <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">May 2026</a>. At least, the bad news of the delay was accompanied by <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-surprise-second-trailer-as-rockstar-shares-first-info-and-many-gorgeous-images/">a new trailer</a>, which provided a second, great look at the game.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI launches on May 26th on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

He is the central figure with which an entire universe revolves around. But, it would be a shame if you watched years of <em>Mission: Impossible</em> films and didn’t realize that it’s truly the cast of characters around Hunt that make him who he is, and thusly, this franchise what it has become.</p><p>Hunt would’ve been dead years ago if Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) weren’t opening prison doors we he needed or monitoring the security system inside of the most secure buildings. Beyond their operational importance, villains like Owen Davian (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) and August Walker (Henry Cavill) give powerhouse performances while also pushing Hunt to the edge of his limits. Some of the best lines are uttered by people other than Hunt. And the emotional stakes of each film typically are from these side characters. </p><p>In honor of the unsung heroes, here are the most irreplaceable characters in <em>Mission: Impossible </em>history.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="db148e004c5e185a89089fa396e63785" data-recommend-id="image://db148e004c5e185a89089fa396e63785" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aaron Paul looking confused" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aaron Paul looking confused" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="db148e004c5e185a89089fa396e63785" data-recommend-id="image://db148e004c5e185a89089fa396e63785" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aaron Paul looking confused" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Aaron Paul was in <em>Mission: Impossible</em>? Yes, I’ve seen every movie multiple times and still have that reaction sometimes. A weaselly slacker-looking version of him briefly appears as the brother of Julia Meade-Hunt (Michelle Monaghan) at her engagement party to Hunt. His main contributions are to appear slovenly next to Hunt and unintentionally aid in her kidnapping. The energy that would make him famous as <em>Breaking Bad</em>’s Jesse Pinkman is tightly bottled up and kept under wraps for his few lines of dialogue. -Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2a13d058614da042857ebca5a759a93e" data-recommend-id="image://2a13d058614da042857ebca5a759a93e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1500" data-height="750" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Declan Gormley surveying the field" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Declan Gormley surveying the field" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2a13d058614da042857ebca5a759a93e" data-recommend-id="image://2a13d058614da042857ebca5a759a93e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1500" data-height="750" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Declan Gormley surveying the field" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the biggest missed opportunities of the <em>Mission: Impossible</em> franchise is abandoning Ethan Hunt’s most charismatic teammate ever in Declan Gormley (Jonathan Rhys Meyers). In the underrated <em>Mission: Impossible III, </em>he avoided gunfire and the blades of gigantic wind turbines while piloting a rescue helicopter with the same cool he displays while charming angry drivers in a traffic stop he’s created as a diversion with the smoothest Italian you’ll ever hear in this franchise. Was he memorable? Yes. But, since Ethan and his team went on to thwart bigger threats without him, he wasn’t what you’d call an essential part of the franchise.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7c725ad17532a43da01571a38db97b86" data-recommend-id="image://7c725ad17532a43da01571a38db97b86" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Anthony Hopkins looking dazed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Anthony Hopkins looking dazed" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7c725ad17532a43da01571a38db97b86" data-recommend-id="image://7c725ad17532a43da01571a38db97b86" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Anthony Hopkins looking dazed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A virtuoso acting talent such as Sir Anthony Hopkins being near the bottom of any movie list has nothing to do with his performance and everything do with his character’s utility. Appearing briefly in <em>Mission: Impossible II </em>as the sly and wise Mission Commander Swanbeck, Hopkins’s standout scene with Cruise is one of the coolest mission briefings in the history of the franchise. You can feel the confidence Swanbeck exhibits when he tells Hunt, a man who previously broke into Langley, “This is not Mission Difficult, Mr. Hunt. It’s Mission: Impossible.” Alas, Hopkins’ talents were wasted on a character so replaceable he was only used for one scene.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f3a346dba2e6469b7740257a81aadac9" data-recommend-id="image://f3a346dba2e6469b7740257a81aadac9" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Paula Patton pointing a gun" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Paula Patton pointing a gun" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f3a346dba2e6469b7740257a81aadac9" data-recommend-id="image://f3a346dba2e6469b7740257a81aadac9" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Paula Patton pointing a gun" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Ditching <em>MI3</em>'s JV squad of expendables, <em>Ghost Protocol</em> put Paula Patton in the shoes of operative Jane Carter, a woman who’s out for revenge against the hitwoman who killed her partner. The movie doesn’t give her a lot to work with but she matches Cruise’s energy with a physical performance that sees her go toe-to-toe with assassin Sabine Moreau (Léa Seydoux) assassin on the 130th floor of Dubai’s Burj Khalifa and seduce  feisty telecoms billionaire Brij Nath (Anil Kapoor). She completed the mission with full marks but failed to leave much of a memorable impression on the series beyond that. - Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="18e011a61efad5565d4a1b931208463c" data-recommend-id="image://18e011a61efad5565d4a1b931208463c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jean Reno looking suspicious " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jean Reno looking suspicious " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="18e011a61efad5565d4a1b931208463c" data-recommend-id="image://18e011a61efad5565d4a1b931208463c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jean Reno looking suspicious " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’ve always felt that any globe-hopping espionage movie that lacks a grizzled Frenchman is missing something, that certain je ne sais quoi. Maybe that’s because I first fell in love with spy movies in the ’90s thanks to the one-two punch of 1996’s <em>Mission: Impossible</em> and 1998’s <em>Ronin</em>. As&nbsp;<em>Mission: Impossible</em>’s Franz Krieger, although we’re initially meant to think he’s a basically good member of Ethan Hunt’s new crackerjack team, he feels like bad news from the beginning and only confirms our suspicions before the end. Reno skillfully gives off just enough of a sleazy vibe to set off our alarm bells, and his presence makes us wary of possible threats to Ethan not just from outside the team, but from within it as well. Most importantly, though, with Reno’s presence in the mix, it gives the film that authentic espionage movie flavor, the stuff of cigarette-smoke-filled safehouses, narrow European streets, and potential treachery lurking around every corner. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0b3f68781f9f988fe291cf3d2fcb9256" data-recommend-id="image://0b3f68781f9f988fe291cf3d2fcb9256" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Max Mitsopolis on the phone" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Max Mitsopolis on the phone" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0b3f68781f9f988fe291cf3d2fcb9256" data-recommend-id="image://0b3f68781f9f988fe291cf3d2fcb9256" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Max Mitsopolis on the phone" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>In order to clear his name and identify the real mole in the original <em>Mission: Impossible</em>, Ethan must track down an enigmatic figure known only as Max with whom the mole had dealings. Given that Max is a shadowy and powerful arms dealer, we might be expecting a Keyser Söze type—a menacing, larger-than-life underworld kingpin who you feel would just as soon put a bullet in your head as let you walk away from a meeting alive. So it’s a wonderful surprise when the hood is pulled from Ethan’s head at his first meeting with Max and we instead see the great Vanessa Redgrave, who plays Max as enigmatic, yes, but also effervescent—a woman who can both fix Ethan with a cold intellectual stare as she asks him probing questions and gush about how much she adores his brazen confidence. </p><p>Redgrave gives Max tremendous depth; she’s fiercely intelligent, deeply private (“I don’t have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession; it’s like a warm blanket.”), and not without warmth herself. She establishes in that very first film that this franchise’s take on the world of international intrigue won’t just trot out the usual stereotypes for its villains but will offer something smarter and more surprising—figures whose power comes not from their skills with firearms or the ruthless deployment of violence but from their intellect and ability to negotiate with others to secure what they want. — Carolyn Petit</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8779d9306c53126da22a737ea505d8e3" data-recommend-id="image://8779d9306c53126da22a737ea505d8e3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="627" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="John Musgrave looking at someone" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="John Musgrave looking at someone" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8779d9306c53126da22a737ea505d8e3" data-recommend-id="image://8779d9306c53126da22a737ea505d8e3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="627" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="John Musgrave looking at someone" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You can usually see a double cross coming a mile away in <em>Mission: Impossible</em>. Not when John Musgrave is silently mouthing instructions only a restrained Hunt can understand, and before he slips him a knife to set himself free. With Phillip Seymour Hoffman’s overwhelmingly dastardly performance as Owen Davian distracting us, and Laurence Fishburne’s ambiguously snarly depiction of IMF director Theodore Brassel misdirecting us, Crudup’s slick performance slipped his nefarious intentions through our detection like a snake in the grass. Without Crudup, <em>Mission: Impossible III </em>is predictably one-dimensional, and the outstanding torture scene fake-out with a captured Hunt and his wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan) has less of a punch. Musgrave is the logic behind the madness, and also an essential part of the film. He just isn’t as integral to the franchise as the 12 characters ahead of him.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="379462ad1245423a278cb80bc8ed78d8" data-recommend-id="image://379462ad1245423a278cb80bc8ed78d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Thandie Newton glaring" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Thandie Newton glaring" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="379462ad1245423a278cb80bc8ed78d8" data-recommend-id="image://379462ad1245423a278cb80bc8ed78d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Thandie Newton glaring" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Mission: Impossible II</em> doesn’t work without Thandie Newton being seductive while maintaining her agency, and being cunning without being unrealistically fearless.

The rogue MI6 agent disillusioned with the global power structure was always one step ahead of Ethan Hunt, an agent so capable, he’d previously infiltrated both Langley and the Vatican without being detected. From the moment he appeared onscreen as the man who’s infiltrated Hunt’s mission delivery system and trapped him, we knew we were witnessing a rare villain. He framed the IMF, manipulated CIA double-agent August Walker (Henry Cavill), and formed the shadowy Syndicate of former agents. Beyond <em>being</em> evil, he <em>sounded </em>evil, with a gravelly whisper that made every threat feel like a dark premonition. He was so good at being bad that he was the villain for two separate <em>Mission: Impossible</em> movies, making him one of the most invaluable baddies in the franchise’s history.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="877046cc356108e6e0469117000f02d9" data-recommend-id="image://877046cc356108e6e0469117000f02d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Laurence Fishburne being pissed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Laurence Fishburne being pissed" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="877046cc356108e6e0469117000f02d9" data-recommend-id="image://877046cc356108e6e0469117000f02d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Laurence Fishburne being pissed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To be honest, IMF director Theodore Brassel would’ve made this list simply for uttering the two coldest sentences I’ve ever heard in a <em>Mission: Impossible</em> movie. With Ethan Hunt strapped to a gurney after being suspected of going rogue and getting IMF agent Lindsey Farris (Keri Russell) killed, Brassel can see the disdain shooting out of Hunt’s eyes and doesn’t blink in the face of it. Instead he tells him, “You can look at me with those judgmental, incriminating eyes all you want. But, I bullshit you not: I will bleed on the flag to make sure the flag stays red.” Even as a one-off in the <em>Mission: Impossible</em> franchise, Fishburne’s incredible performance as Brassel made him a character you could never forget. Without him, <em>Mission Impossible 3</em> wouldn’t be what it was.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e0fe58a8bad0b27acd770b1348f998ee" data-recommend-id="image://e0fe58a8bad0b27acd770b1348f998ee" data-format="jpg" data-width="640" data-height="360" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michelle Monaghan smiling" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Michelle Monaghan smiling" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e0fe58a8bad0b27acd770b1348f998ee" data-recommend-id="image://e0fe58a8bad0b27acd770b1348f998ee" data-format="jpg" data-width="640" data-height="360" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michelle Monaghan smiling" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You can’t possibly think you can replace the only woman to ever make globe-trotting, death-defying secret agent Ethan Hunt settle down for even a second. Julia’s irresistible appeal had a man known for jumping off motorcycles and escaping car explosions helping with a dinner party like a suburban dad with a license to kill. Depending on how you view Ilsa Faust, Julia is arguably the most important woman in Hunt’s life, and thus the most important woman in this male-dominated action film franchise. She’s Hunt’s emotional weak point, one that Owen Davian presses on to bring him out of hiding in <em>Mission: Impossible III</em>, the only person Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) goes out of his way to train to be a spy, and one of the main reasons the water supply of a third of the world’s population wasn’t poisoned in <em>Fallout. </em>Beyond that, Michelle Monaghan plays her with a grounded realism that makes her the most relatable character in a movie franchise full of people meant to be extraordinary in the best and worst ways. Without Monaghan’s performance as Julia Meade-Hunt, Ethan Hunt would be nothing more than a means to an end for the audience. With her, he’s a fully formed man with stakes beyond the mission he chose to accept.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c3a9ed154bbc0370db987d74004b89d6" data-recommend-id="image://c3a9ed154bbc0370db987d74004b89d6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="600" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eugene Kittridge looking judgmentally " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Eugene Kittridge looking judgmentally " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c3a9ed154bbc0370db987d74004b89d6" data-recommend-id="image://c3a9ed154bbc0370db987d74004b89d6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="600" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eugene Kittridge looking judgmentally " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The screenplay for 1996’s <em>Mission: Impossible</em> was co-written by David Koepp and <em>Chinatown </em>scribe Robert Towne, and while I have no way of knowing exactly which elements of the script each was responsible for, I’ve always suspected that it was Towne who made the character of Kittridge so memorable. If any character in <em>Mission: Impossible</em> speaks with the kind of hard-boiled language that made 1974's <em>Chinatown</em> a neo-noir classic, it’s Eugene Kittridge. Kittridge is a higher-up at the IMF who believes Ethan is a mole and a traitor, and he will seemingly do just about anything, including making life much more difficult for Hunt’s family, to get him to surrender. At one point, he coldly tells Ethan that “dying slowly in America can be a very expensive proposition” and later, he pragmatically informs a subordinate that “everybody has pressure points. You find something that’s personally important to him, and you squeeze.” </p><p>But it’s more than the great dialogue he gets to spout that makes Kittridge so compelling; it’s the performance by Henry Czerny, who plays Eugene as a tense, tightly coiled bureaucrat whose ruthless dedication to following the letter of institutional procedure has blinded him to Ethan’s innocence and humanity. After his knockout appearance in the first film, Kittridge disappeared for decades, finally resurfacing in <em>Dead Reckoning</em>, though he didn’t have any moments that reminded us the crackling tension he and Hunt generated when they butted heads way back in 1996. Here’s hoping <em>Final Reckoning </em>rectifies that. — Carolyn Petit</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0fc2041401ba9dfabbba94bfd8e21d52" data-recommend-id="image://0fc2041401ba9dfabbba94bfd8e21d52" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="William Brandt pointing a gun" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="William Brandt pointing a gun" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0fc2041401ba9dfabbba94bfd8e21d52" data-recommend-id="image://0fc2041401ba9dfabbba94bfd8e21d52" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="William Brandt pointing a gun" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Out of everyone who’s been on Ethan Hunt’s team, there have only been two who I felt could match his tactical skills: Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) and William Brandt, played by Jeremy Renner. His spy skills are so embedded into the core of who he is that when he was pretending to be an analyst, he instinctively ripped a gun out of Hunt’s hand and pointed it at him quicker than you could sneeze. Without him, Hunt would’ve been captured by the CIA when he was on the run in <em>Rogue Nation </em>and the entire fake meeting to intercept a nuclear launch control codebook would’ve failed in <em>Ghost Protocol</em>. Outside of Hunt, he’s the only person who can both play the bureaucracy game, explaining to the government why the IMF is essential when the need arises, and get his hands dirty by beating up terrorists. To put it plainly, William Brandt isn’t someone you can replace easily.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f3d038d7344b321ce59224feb51e94c7" data-recommend-id="image://f3d038d7344b321ce59224feb51e94c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="600" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Henry Cavill pointing a gun" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Henry Cavill pointing a gun" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f3d038d7344b321ce59224feb51e94c7" data-recommend-id="image://f3d038d7344b321ce59224feb51e94c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="600" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Henry Cavill pointing a gun" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The man jumped out of a plane and got knocked unconscious by a bolt of lightning, all to keep his double agent cover intact.

First off, he’s probably the only villain in the entire series that physically pushed Hunt to the limit in a fight across multiple rooftops. Secondly, he fools multiple government officials and agents whose entire jobs are to be intelligent.

This let the film subvert the expectations of viewers in 1996, who wouldn’t have anticipated that the noble Phelps would be revealed as the double-crossing villain behind the deaths of nearly every member of Ethan’s team. Jon Voight plays both sides of the coin to perfection, believably projecting the seasoned, fatherly veteran in the opening scenes before everything goes sideways, and then making us understand how Phelps could have fallen so far and grown so disillusioned with the institutions to which he’s given so much of his life after Ethan puts the pieces together. Though it’s been nearly 30 years since that fateful betrayal, it remains the most memorable and emotionally affecting plot twist reveal in the entire series. One gets the sense that it haunts Ethan still, that perhaps part of what spurs him on to be such an extraordinary agent is having witnessed firsthand, in the fall of Jim Phelps, what he might become if he were to stop prioritizing other people’s lives over his own. —Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bc4297d4b08e0d6a947d513feb287556" data-recommend-id="image://bc4297d4b08e0d6a947d513feb287556" data-format="jpg" data-width="1500" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ilsa Faust about to fight" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ilsa Faust about to fight" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bc4297d4b08e0d6a947d513feb287556" data-recommend-id="image://bc4297d4b08e0d6a947d513feb287556" data-format="jpg" data-width="1500" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ilsa Faust about to fight" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>No one has provided a better foil for Hunt, or a better match for the gravity well around Cruise’s onscreen presence, than Rebecca Ferguson.

Ferguson also managed to go three movies without ever fading into the background as simply another prop to assist in Cruise’s one-man action star show.

Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays a maniac with an air of inevitability. He rarely gets flustered, and always speaks with the calm, self-assured tone of a doctor that already knows that all of your options for survival are in their hands. The opening scene alone, in which he threatens to shoot Ethan’s wife in front of him and isn’t the least bit persuaded by Hunt’s trained trickery, is the most intense scene in all of <em>Mission: Impossible. </em>He made you believe he was going to find Hunt’s wife and make her bleed. He made you believe he was going to escape seemingly impenetrable law enforcement custody. He made you believe he was real. That is the highest honor any actor can receive.

Don't take that risk, a lot of gamers aren't gonna pay 80 dollars and feed this notion of constant increase of the price tag. You are the CEO, you have some say with the price when it comes to your publisher."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here's Randy Pitchford's response:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"A) Not my call. B) If you’re a real fan, you’ll find a way to make it happen. My local game store had Starflight for Sega Genesis for $80 in 1991 when I was just out of high school working minimum wage at an ice cream parlor in Pismo Beach and I found a way to make it happen."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The response to Pitchford’s tweet has been mostly negative. “I am going to pirate Borderlands 4,” said one X / Twitter user. “Please stop. Just apologize and move on. This isn't fair on your developers. If you care about them, just do the right thing dude,” added another. “Randy we are begging you to stop. BL4 had so much hype and it’s being ruined in a day. Let people want to like and support the game and all the amazing people who made it,” said one commenter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Pitchford has yet to apologize directly for his comments, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-backlash-to-80-borderlands-4-if-youre-a-real-fan-comment-randy-pitchford-points-to-previous-statement-if-you-want-the-truth-here-it-is"><u>he did point to</u> a recent answer he gave on-stage at PAX East on Borderlands 4's price</a>, saying: “If you want the truth, here it is.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And now, Pitchford inched closer to an <em>actual</em> apology after <a href="https://x.com/MoxsyOG/status/1925249239149412373" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Borderlands streamer Moxsy tweeted</a> dialogue from a Handsome Jack AI prompted by a user called Duke_Newcombe who fed it Pitchford's original tweet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(Handsome Jack is the main antagonist of Borderlands 2 and self-appointed dictator of Pandora.)</p><blockquote>Ohhh boo-hoo, $80 for Borderlands 4? Let me break out the world’s tiniest violin—crafted from Eridium and oiled with the tears of whiny Vault Hunters.</blockquote><blockquote>Listen, cupcake, you’re not buying a game. You’re investing in a premium, galaxy-shattering experience personally engineered to blast your sad little dopamine receptors into orbit. You think quality loot and chaotic mayhem just code itself? You want guns that sprout legs, sing sea shanties, and explode into loot goblins without paying top dollar? Grow up.</blockquote><blockquote>Back in my day, I built an entire moonbase with my own two hands (and a metric ton of disposable Hyperion interns), and you’re crying about spending a few bucks more to virtually murder skags with style? Puh-lease.</blockquote><blockquote>But hey, if $80 is too steep, there’s always a solution: just don’t buy it. More legendary drops for the rest of us, and fewer mouth-breathing freeloaders clogging up my loot pools. Win-win.</blockquote><blockquote>Stay broke, hero.</blockquote><blockquote>•⁠Handsome Jack President of the Galaxy, CEO of Hyperion, and your personal nightmare</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/22/pitchford-1747909471374.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Randy Pitchford: "Back to work for me!"

I’m humbled by the love and support everyone has shown the team as we push hard to get this amazing game in your hands. They’re crushing it, and I can’t wait for everyone to play what’s going to be the best Borderlands ever! Regardless of where the price lands, it’s going to be worth it and then some. Back to work for me!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford, clearly, would like to draw a line under this week’s self-inflicted drama, but it seems likely the debate about Borderlands 4’s price will resurface as soon as pre-orders go live. At that point, publisher 2K Games will have to announce the price of the game, and whether it’s $80 or $70 or something else, it will be a bigger talking point now than it might have been.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Monica Schipper/WireImage.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>Hot off the heels of his turn as Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison in A Minecraft Movie, Jason Momoa is reportedly in talks to star in another video game adaptation.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/street-fighter-movie-eyes-jason-momoa-noah-centineo-more-1236407261/">Deadline</a> sources, Momoa is currently in talks for a role in Legendary’s live-action Street Fighter movie, based on Capcom's fighting series. As for who Momoa may be playing should these talks prove successful, that for now remains unknown.</p>
<p>As well as Momoa, Andrew Koji (Bullet Train), Noah Centineo (Warfare) and WWE wrestler Roman Reigns (Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw) are all said to be in talks for the Street Fighter adaptation.</p>

<p>Back in February of this year, it was announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-film-gets-new-director-still-set-for-2026">Kitao Sakurai would direct the upcoming Street Fighter film</a>, with Capcom "deeply involved" in the adaptation as well.</p>
<p>The film is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/live-action-street-fighter-movie-gets-2026-release-date">set for a release next year</a>, on 20th March, having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-film-and-tv-rights-bought-by-legendary-entertainment">first been announced back in 2023</a>. Further details for now remain thin on the ground, but it sounds like production could soon be ramping up, so stay tuned for more. Personally, I would love to see cameos from Jean-Claude Van Damme and Kylie Minogue (but I am not holding my breath).</p>
<p>As for Momoa, well, he is probably riding high on the success of A Minecraft Movie right now. The live-action adaptation, which also starred Jack Black, became a meme-filled hit on its release in April. The film generated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">$301m worldwide on its first weekend</a>, and has been such a success that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-sequel-discussions-are-already-happening">there are already talks about a sequel</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-ports-nintendo-switch-2-soon/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-nintendo-switch-2-ports-are-reportedly-in-the-works-and-will-be-revealed-soon.1196079/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-ports-nintendo-switch-2-soon/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ports of Xbox games for Nintendo Switch 2 are currently in the works, and their reveal should be imminent, according to a new online report.</p>
<p>The Verge's Tom Warren confirmed in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610793/hellblade-2-ps5-release-date-xbox-ninja-theory">recent report</a> focused on the announcement of Senua's Saga: Hellblade II Enhanced, which is launching on PlayStation 5 this Summer, that Microsoft is also working on some Xbox ports for Nintendo Switch 2, which he expects will be revealed soon. Reliable leaker NateTheHate also said the same on X, so we should probably expect to see the announcement of the first few ports in the coming weeks during the "non-E3" season.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Next up: Xbox games coming to Switch 2.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1925234110588473837?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>With Microsoft already having released ports of Xbox games on the original Nintendo Switch, such as Sea of Thieves and Grounded, it's not surprising to learn that more games will be coming to the next-generation system, which promises to be extremely successful at launch. As for which Xbox games could hit the Nintendo Switch 2, no one can say at the moment, but it's been previously rumored that <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection-playstation-5-switch-2/">Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Microsoft Flight Simulator</a> will launch on the system. Seeing the latter run on Nintendo Switch 2 would be quite interesting from a technical standpoint, as the game can be quite demanding, although if Asobo Studio managed to get the game running on Xbox Series S, it will definitely be possible to scale the game to the Switch 2 hardware capabilities, which may be better than anticipated, judging from how <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-early-comparisons/">Cyberpunk 2077 runs on the system.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sedap! A Culinary Adventure Review - Sweet and Sour]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/sedap-culinary-adventure-review-sweet-and-sour</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sedap-a-culinary-adventure-review-sweet-and-sour.1196076/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/sedap-culinary-adventure-review-sweet-and-sour<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If there’s one thing that video games need more of, it’s cooking-related games. I don’t mean the mini-games where you throw a bunch of ingredients and use them to buff your main character’s stamina or whatever, I mean games that focus entirely on the food. There’s something so comforting and satisfying about being able to virtually plate up a bowl of food. Perhaps it’s the fact that I don’t have to clean up afterwards or worry about storing the leftovers.</p>

<p>Of course, the bulk of cooking games revolve around serving burgers, pizzas, and salads. While I do love those foods, as a south asian, I do have to ask, “Where’s the rice?” <em>Sedap! A Culinary Adventure</em> answers that question with much cheer. A name that means ‘delicious’ in Malay, Sedap! is an action-adventure co-op cooking game much along the lines of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/overcooked-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Overcooked</em></a>, but with some extra toppings.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20250514232339_1.jpg?itok=L7VMn5rr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20250514232339_1.jpg?itok=b7i83I5M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>What's Cooking?</h2>

<p><em>Sedap!</em> follows Som and Gon, aspiring restaurateurs who are looking to expand their culinary horizons. They come across the Makanomicon, a recipe book filled with new recipes. Filled with excitement and curiosity, the duo decides to start a food truck and set out for Khaya Island, an abandoned archipelago brimming with ingredients, monsters, and mysteries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, I had to put my relationship with my partner to the test, so while I played as Som, whose strength lies in cooking, my partner played as Gon, the skilled hunter. While both characters are capable of cooking and combat, we quickly learned that we would have to capitalize on each character’s strengths and optimize accordingly. After a few levels, we built a good rhythm where one would venture out and focus on getting ingredients while the other stayed back in the kitchen and served up dishes.</p>

<p>Each level adds a new recipe for you to learn from the Makanomicon, so naturally, the game gets progressively harder. The cooking process is mostly a series of button-mashing, with the final preparation of the dish being a QTE. If you fail it more than three times, you have to make the dish all over again. While on their own, they’re a breeze to get through, the pressure of delivering the dish on time is what will get to you. To my chagrin, I ended up fumbling a few times due to the sheer amount of orders piling up.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20250520141753_1.jpg?itok=_i5F-r63 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20250520141753_1.jpg?itok=l1v27TOH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>To fetch your ingredients, you’ll have to weed your way through enemies and obstacles. <em>Sedap!</em> features simple hack-and-slash combat. You can buy new weapons and charms to alter your stats, and some weapons even unleash a special ability when you charge the attack. You have a health bar, of course, so when you’re knocked out, you need to be revived by your teammate or you have to wait for a few seconds.</p>

<p>At the end of the level, you’ll be rated based on how many dishes you successfully delivered in time, and you’re even granted a bonus based on the freshness of the food as well as how fast you were. You also get to see customer reviews, which, I gotta say, they’re pretty realistic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game slowly reveals more and more mechanics for you to keep in mind, some being hindrances, like a gate that can be only opened when someone stands on the switch, while others assist, like teletotems that allow you to transport items from one part of the area to another.</p>

<h2>Charm with a Side of Bugs</h2>

<p>In solo mode, you end up playing as both Som and Gon, and the game helps you out in switching between the two when it’s convenient. However, some of <em>Sedap’s</em> mechanics don’t really translate that well into the solo-player version. Your choice of weapon or charm that you choose to equip doesn’t really make all that much of a difference, since you get automatically swapped between the protagonists. Teletotems get rendered useless as you can still transport the item, but you still have to make the trek back to the kitchen.&nbsp;</p>

Oddly enough, you can’t have separate save files, so if you do want to play solo, you have no choice but to start from the very beginning. In fact, even if you want to play local co-op, you start afresh.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I tested out both local co-op as well as online co-op while playing <em>Sedap!</em>&nbsp;My partner and I tried playing online, and although we were in the house using the same internet, we both experienced frequent disconnects. We decided to switch to local co-op, and though the connection was much more stable, we still encountered our fair share of bugs and controller disconnects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sometimes the controls would get swapped around, and the X button would become the A button. Other times, the environment would just lock a character into a certain area, leaving us with no choice but to restart the level. Even the UI would sometimes be unresponsive to my controller, and I’d have to switch to keyboard and mouse just to change something in the settings.&nbsp;</p>

From the protagonists to the monsters, the designs are stinking adorable. As you’d expect from a cooking-based game, each dish looks like something I’d want to eat. The colours are warm and inviting, much like an actual kitchen. The clatter and clinking of woks and pots are a treat for the ears, especially paired with the game’s culturally infused soundtrack.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts - Sedap! A Culinary Adventure</h2>

<p>In the shallow pool of cooking games, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2650730/SEDAP_A_Culinary_Adventure/" rel="nofollow"><em>Sedap! A Culinary Adventure</em></a> stands proud with its Southeast Asian roots. It’s a genuinely fun game when you’re not faced with frequent disconnects and glitches. It still feels like a dish-in-progress, but if you’re willing to overlook a few hiccups, <em>Sedap!</em> is absolutely worth a try.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
I can’t be the only person here who’s ever had a fistfight with their washing-up. I have this big metal spatula that has a malicious habit of bouncing out of the drying rack. Again and again, it sneaks under my elbow to spring and sproing over the lino, gathering as much stray onion peel as it can on the way to the door. The fourth time this happened I bent it in two. Then I thought my sieve was giving me stinkeye, so I threw it down and stamped on it, gangland-style. Look, it was kind of a bad day. But one thing I will swear to you, probably-concerned reader: I would <em>never</em> behave this way towards my leftovers.

Any food I don’t finish is placed in fresh Tupperware, carefully dated in black marker, and slotted into the fridge like a holy relic. Sometimes, I open the fridge just to behold my works. In this regard, I am unlike the burned-out white collar protagonist of Leftovers KO!, who opens his fridge one evening to find a hamburger that has gotten so mad at being mouldy it wants to beat his face in.
</p>
<p>
The hamburger is just the start of your troubles. There’s a positively Satanic slice of stale pizza in the living room, a manky, musclebound… artichoke? I think? in the pantry, and a rabid stick of celery in the bedroom. In the absence of a compost bin, all these putrid hand-drawn foodstuffs must be pummelled into submission, using a combat system inspired by Nintendo Entertainment System classic Punch-Out.</p>
<p>You will dodge, block, punch and haymaker while trying not to run out of stamina. I found the demo quite tricky: you’ll need to KO each oozing comestible several times, and they’ll come back harder every time they clamber to their feet. Along the way, you’ll learn new moves to master in the training room. There's support for keyboard or controller inputs and I'm equally terrible with both.
</p>
<p>
It’s all the work of Mountain Man Animation, with Feardemic publishing. Find the demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3169060/Leftovers_KO/">Steam</a>. The full game launches on 25th May which, coincidentally, is when I’m doing my next grocery run. Again, though, I must protest that I would never assault my own cooking, though many would consider my cooking an assault.

                <p>Elgato is introducing Stream Deck modules, the MK.2 Stream Deck, and new Virtual Stream Deck software. The Elgato Stream Deck, as the name suggests, was initially aimed at streamers as a way to quickly do things like manipulate on-screen stream elements without having to interrupt your stream by going to a separate app. Instead, a number of programmable buttons on the interface can be bound to certain apps, keybinds, and commands to achieve quick results, such as changing stream scenes or sending your audience to another creator's stream in a raid. It turns out, though, that there are lots of uses for such an idea.</p><p>Elgato's developer-friendly platform has long supported letting anyone do just about anything with a Stream Deck, but now it is looking to blow out that experience in a big way with its newest showings at Computex, the annual computing convention held in Taipei, Taiwan.</p><div data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3563" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6531726 - Elgato Stream Deck Module" data-collection="" title="6531726 - Elgato Stream Deck Module">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Scissor-Switch/dp/B0DVZCB7JD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Scissor-Switch\/dp\/B0DVZCB7JD?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Scissor-Switch/dp/B0DVZCB7JD?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Elgato Stream Deck Module</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Scissor-Switch/dp/B0DVZCB7JD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Scissor-Switch\/dp\/B0DVZCB7JD?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Scissor-Switch/dp/B0DVZCB7JD?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$150</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The Stream Deck Module is a case of a company listening to its users and responding. Hobbyists have been ripping apart Stream Decks to use the buttons and front panel as parts of bigger projects, and the Module is for exactly those users. Available in 6-, 15-, and 32-key variants and housed in an aluminum casing, these unbranded panels are intended to be integrated into those projects. The Module will be available for $49.99 for the six-key variant, $129.99 for the 15-key model, and $199.99 for 32-keys. </p>                      </div><p>Alongside the Modules, a $79.99 Stream Deck network dock will allow you to plug a Stream Deck in anywhere you have a network port, further opening the possibilities for use in things like smart home setups and other projects.</p><p>The MK.2 Stream Deck, available for $149.99, pushes things forward in a different way. If you've ever owned a Stream Deck--I use my six-key Stream Deck to control Spotify and switch audio devices--you know the keys can be kind of mushy. Since they're not meant to be used for typing, that's not so bad, but it can be hard to tell if you've actuated one of those keys.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvUcQNxSOGQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lvUcQNxSOGQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The MK.2 swaps out the membrane beneath the current Stream Deck keys with scissor switches, which can be commonly found on laptop and other similarly low-profile keyboards. Elgato says this will provide "enhanced speed and precision," and "lends itself to typing-style interactions" that could pave the way for new Stream Deck use cases. Remember the <a href="https://www.artlebedev.com/optimus/popularis/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Optimus Keyboard</a>, that striking keyboard that featured a screen on every key? It's not hard to imagine scissor switches allowing Elgato to move in the direction of making a full keyboard.</p><p>Finally, Elgato is bringing a software-only Stream Deck app to market for desktop systems. It's similar to the existing Stream Deck mobile app, which allows you to turn your phone or tablet into a soft Stream Deck. The software will be available at first to anyone with a physical Stream Deck, and will be bundled with the Corsair Scimitar Elite Wireless SE mouse and Corsair Xenon Edge touchscreen--the Stream Deck 7.0 beta requires that you connect one of those devices for the VSD feature to be available. Notably, though, unlike its mobile equivalent, things like custom layouts and virtual faceplates won't be locked behind a paid subscription. Elgato says that the VSD software will be available with a greater range of hardware over time. We're also quite sure that no one is going to figure out a way to simulate owning a Stream Deck to make the software usable by anyone. No way at all.</p>

            <p>Bungie once considered a subscription model for its online shooter Destiny, but the idea was "vehemently shut down" by management.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> went free-to-play in 2019, but players need to pay for the most recent DLC expansions. There's also a store for paid cosmetics.</p>
<p>Other MMOs, such as World of Warcraft or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>, run on a subscription model, where players pay a monthly fee for access. According to a new report, Bungie considered this but management decided against it.</p>

<p>The news comes as part of a report into the current state of Bungie, following word last week that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">Bungie morale is in "free fall"</a> following the fallout of stolen assets used in its next game, Marathon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7wZ2tpjrmE">YouTuber and journalist Destin Legarie</a> has spoken to former employees this week. Bungie management were described as "toxic and shut down creatives on a core level", with one former employee stating: "If [management] didn't think of it, it wasn't worth doing."</p>
<p>In this context, when one employee brought up the possibility of a subscription model, it was reportedly "vehemently shut down".</p>
<p>In another example, management was concerned the glowing Trials of Osiris PvP armour was too attractive, which would impact sales of armours in the Eververse store. Decisions by management "prioritised monetisation over player experience", a former Bungie employee said. Another added: "Everything happening to Bungie is because of greed."</p>
<p>One former employee surmised: "Bungie's problems stem from a lack of player empathy, disconnected leadership, and a corporate-first culture."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Bungie for comment.</p>
<p>In 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-ceo-criticised-for-spending-millions-on-classic-cars-as-calls-for-leadership-changes-escalate">Bungie CEO Peter Parsons was criticised for spending millions of dollars on classic cars</a>. This news followed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">a round of layoffs where 220 staff</a>, roughly 17 percent of the company's workforce, lost their jobs.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">Bungie admitted to including designs in Marathon without the artist's consent</a>. And this wasn't the first time Bungie had made this mistake.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">showed off Marathon back in April</a>. It's a PvP extraction shooter set to release on 23rd September this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Embracer - the Swedish conglomerate which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-human-cost-of-embracers-restructuring-programme">bought up and then proceeded to lay off countless studios and employees</a> - still plans to release "76 different games during FY 2025/26".</p>

<p>"We are expecting Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra to drive notable revenues but to have lower margins due to shared economics with several other partners," Embracer wrote.</p>
<p>Embracer also alluded to a third AAA release on its docket, which the company previously expected to debut in FY 25/26 but will "likely need a few more quarters to polish". Therefore, this game will likely release the following fiscal year (I wonder if this is Tomb Raider).</p>
<p>"We expect this specific game to have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-nears-2m-sold-as-troubled-publisher-embracer-celebrates-success">financial dynamics more similar to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>," Embracer said.</p>

<p>In addition to releasing those 76 games in the coming year, Embracer will also spin off Coffee Stain Group into a standalone company by the end of 2025. </p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-announces-plan-to-split-into-three-companies-including-middle-earth-enterprises-and-friends">Embracer announced its split into three companies</a>: Coffee Stain and Friends, Middle-earth Enterprises, and Asmodee Group. Now Coffee Stain, known for the likes of first-person open-world factory building game Satisfactory, will separate.</p>
<p>"This strategic move will allow Coffee Stain Group to focus on its core strengths as passionate game developers and publishers, focused on delivering high quality experiences," Embracer said.</p>
<p>Middle-earth Enterprises will be renamed Fellowship Entertainment as a result, and will unite "top creators and intellectual properties" to "build unforgettable experiences for the fans".</p>
<p>Said Embracer: "The strategy is to transform into one powerhouse group with game development and publishing at its core, complemented with transmedia capabilities within IP licensing, comics, merchandise, film and distribution."</p>
<p>After a huge acquisition spree several years ago, Embracer subsequently shed thousands of staff and shuttered studios such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-studio-volition-has-been-closed-down-effective-immediately">Saints Row developer Volition Games</a>, after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-shares-plummet-after-proposed-2bn-partnership-collapses">major $2bn investment fell through</a>.</p>
<p>More recently in March, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-groups-eidos-montreal-studio-lays-off-up-to-75-employees">Embracer-owned Eidos-Montréal announced it was laying off "up to" 75 members of staff</a>, saying it didn't "have the capacity to entirely reallocate them to our other ongoing projects and services".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The quality is good enough that, while scrolling on social media, you'd think it was a legimate clip from YouTube or Twitch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Technically, Veo 3 should not be infringing on anyone's copyrighted material — and it's safe to assume Fortnite developer Epic Games did not sign this one off. But clearly the AI tool has had access to the millions of hours of Fortnite gameplay posted online, and is now able to reproduce a convincing representation on command.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One <a href="https://x.com/mattshumer_/status/1924994290729599222" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clip</a>, showing a streamer celebrating as they win a match using only their pickaxe, was apparently created within Veo 3 using a text-based prompt of nine words: "Streamer getting a victory royale with just his pickaxe".</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Uhhh... I don't think Veo 3 is supposed to be generating Fortnite gameplay <a href="https://t.co/bWKruQ5Nox" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/bWKruQ5Nox</a></p>— Matt Shumer (@mattshumer_) <a href="https://twitter.com/mattshumer_/status/1924994290729599222?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 21, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">In writing this prompt, Veo 3 has not been told specifically to create Fortnite gameplay. Still, it understands from the context what game the user is referring to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Veo 3's abilities throw up all sorts of questions, and far more pressing ones than simple copyright concerns. The ability to create footage like this undoubtedly aids users looking to fool others with disinformation, and in so doing undermine trust in legitimate footage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I can not tell if this is real or not," reads one reply. "We're cooked," reads another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The only way this is possible is if Veo 3 was trained on an enormous amount of Fortnite content," a third reply reads. "Wouldn’t be surprised if everything that gets uploaded to YouTube is now being trained on despite copyright laws."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked Epic for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For a better look at what Veo 3 is capable of outside of video games, here's a clip of the algorithm creating a fake news report on an automobile trade show that doesn't exist, with fake interviewees answering fake questions.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Before you ask: yes, everything is AI here.

Xbox boss Phil Spencer suggested Muse could be used to help ideate game concepts in the future, and even somehow aid in game preservation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Muse's reveal, quickly followed by the reveal of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-quake-2-ai-prototype-sparks-debate-online">more fake gameplay footage generated by Muse of the classic shooter Quake 2</a>, has prompted further debate — and raised questions over whether the tool would remove work or replace human creativity from existing employees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite is no stranger to AI itself, of course. Last week, the game added the ability to chat with Star Wars' Darth Vader, who will <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnites-ai-darth-vader-has-only-been-live-for-an-hour-and-already-epic-has-patched-out-him-saying-fk">reply using generative AI trained on the voice of the late James Earl Jones</a>. Jones' voice is officially licensed (and was previously used to create dialogue for Disney's own Obi Wan Kenobi TV series) and sanctioned by both the late actor and his family, but the addition still prompted <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/voice-actor-union-files-unfair-labor-practice-charge-over-fortnites-ai-darth-vader">swift condemnation and an unfair labor practice charge from acting union SAG-AFTRA</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

It doesn't make it clear what the problem is, you'll just know the code hasn't worked. The good news is, if you use our article, we'll move codes into expired when they stop working, so you can tell the difference. If a code is in the active and working list, however, be sure to copy and paste it exactly as you see it here. We test each of the codes before uploading them, and Roblox codes are often case-sensitive, so it's important that it's exact. </p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Lies of P Overture Director explains how the DLC will create a complete experience</p>
      </div>
<p>Once the update goes live alongside the Overture expansion, you will get to choose from two new gameplay difficulty options, Butterfly's Guidance and Awakened Puppet. The default difficulty level will be renamed to "Legendary Stalker" in the upcoming patch. For those of you looking for a greater challenge, will be able to take part in a boss rush mode that has several tiers of escalating difficulty. Additionally, the new Death March mode is a gauntlet of boss fights where your health and inventory will be more limited.</p><p>Difficulty options in souls-like games have been a polarizing topic for years now. Dark Souls and Elden Ring developer From Software typically refrains from adding such options to its games, while other studios allow a wider selection of options to make the experience more forgiving. Stellar Blade is a good example here, as the Sekiro-influenced game offers several difficulty modes and gameplay assists. On the extreme side, Steel Rising by developer Spiders has options that turns the game into a cakewalk.</p><p>Lies of P: Overture is expected to launch in summer for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Neowiz says you can expect it to take <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lies-of-p-expansion-will-take-up-to-20-hours-isnt-related-to-that-cutscene/1100-6530393/">between 15-20 hours to complete</a>.</p>

			<p>A few hours ago, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-18-mario-kart-world-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> another episode of its Ask the Developer Series dedicated to upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 games, and this time it's all about Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>This could very well be the 'killer application' of the new console. Its predecessor, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-8-deluxe-best-kart-racer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, launched shortly after the launch of the original Switch and was immediately a smashing success. The game has sold over 65 million units to date, becoming one of the best-selling premium titles of all time.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Kosuke Yabuki (Producer of the Entertainment Planning &amp; Development Department) revealed in this interview that prototyping on Mario Kart World started even before the predecessor launched on the Switch, while full development began later in 2017.</p>
<p><em>We were thinking about what to do for the next Mario Kart game even during the development of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and we began prototyping in March 2017. It was at the end of that year when we officially started work on it as a project. I felt that in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, we were able to perfect the formula that we'd been following in the series up to that point, where players race on individual courses. That’s why, this time, we wanted the gameplay to involve players driving around a large world, and we began creating a world map like this.</em></p>
<p>It's an exceedingly long time to make a game by Nintendo's standards. However, the team has significant challenges to overcome, such as doubling the amount of players in a race from 12 to 24 while adding an open world. Everything became much more feasible once the decision was made to move the project to the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p><em><strong>Kenta Sato (Programming Director):</strong> When we were developing for the Nintendo Switch system, it was difficult for us to incorporate everything we wanted, so we were always conscious of what we were giving up in return. We discussed things like toning down the visuals, lowering the resolution, and we even considered dropping the frame rate to 30 fps in some cases. It was a tough situation.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Kosuke Yabuki:</strong> We worked on it while kicking the can down the road in terms of deciding what to give up on, so at some point, we knew it was going to get messy. But as we'd decided to release <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-8-deluxe-booster-course-pass-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe — Booster Course Pass</a>, we thought that would give us a bit more time to continue development. That's when the conversation of moving it to the Nintendo Switch 2 system came up, and this suddenly opened up a bunch of possibilities on what we could do. It was truly a ray of hope.</em></p>
<p>Our Nathan Birch was able to <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out Mario Kart World</a> during the Nintendo Switch 2 press hands-on event and came away favorably impressed:</p>
<p><em>Mario Kart World feels very much like a shiny new Mario Kart 8 model, which will be great for those looking for more of what that game offered, but there’s no denying the game feels a bit familiar at times. That said, Mario Kart World’s interconnected map is a compelling creation, and while I need to play more, I can imagine a lot of potential ways Nintendo could utilize, and possibly expand, their new racing world. Nintendo may be about to unleash the racing platform they support for the next decade and I’m intrigued to see where this road may lead us.</em></p>

            <p>
Which sounds like the more intense experience to you, dear reader - "Butterfly's Guidance" or "Awakened Puppet"? No, this isn't me workshopping titles for my latest range of exotic fragrances. I'm referring to the new easier difficulty modes Neowiz will add to Pinnochio-powered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">soulslike</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies Of P</a> alongside the game's Overture DLC this summer.
</p>
<p>
The difficulty modes will arrive in a free Lies Of P update. The standard difficulty will be "Legendary Stalker", which honestly I think is a bit of a letdown, after "Butterfly's Guidance" and "Awakened Puppet". It barely sounds like an exotic fragrance at all. Possibly you could peddle it as some kind of feline musk.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/lies-of-p-is-getting-difficulty-options-to-make-the-soulslike-more-accessible/">VGC</a>, game director Jiwon Choi explained that "we wanted to make sure a wider audience of players could play the game," adding that the new modes are based partly on player feedback. "[By] making development adjustments and introducing these difficulty options, we can offer the experience to different types of players," he said. "This broadens the base."
</p>
<p>
This would be an obvious time to rekindle the debate about difficulty, accessibility, and the toxicity of "git gud" culture. Let me extend an avuncular arm and say: come now, friends, that debate is surely over. I think everybody agrees that giving players options that reflect their needs or preferences is fundamentally a good thing, and that there is no reason such options can't be consistent with, say, an atmosphere of abiding menace or a sense of gruelling challenge - after all, most video games and certainly, all mainstream commercial video games assist and guide players in myriad, subtle ways, even when you're playing on Mega-Bastard difficulty.
</p>
<p>
Instead, let's argue about appropriate difficulty mode naming. I have a feeling I've ranted somewhere about this before? Call me Johnny Obfuscation but I like it when developers clown around a bit with their nomenclature. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a>'s European Extreme, for example, or Ready To Rhombus in <a href="http://adventuresofsquare.com/">The Adventures Of Square</a>. European Extreme is definitely some kind of abrasive cologne: it conjures up visions of dyed chest hair and revolting suede. Ready To Rhombus, meanwhile, sounds like a whimsical hemp-based aftershave with a handwritten label, sold exclusively in Camden Town.
</p>
<p>
Difficulty settings aside, Lies Of P is also getting a couple of new bossfight modes. In Battle Memories, you can replay bosses through five difficulty tiers. In Death March, you must fell as many bosses as possible with limited health and items. Again, it's all coming this summer.
