<p>The director of Chainsaw Man is working on a new roguelite horror game on Roblox called The Inn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/534957/article/chainsaw-man-director-reveals-his-next-project-is-a-roblox-horror-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>, The Inn’s official <a href="https://x.com/TheInnRoblox/status/1909996710543421643" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter) revealed the upcoming Roblox game with a new trailer recently, informing players that Ryu Nakayama, the director of Chainsaw Man, is directing the title. Nakayama is known for his work on projects like Jujutsu Kaisen, Yatterman Night, and more. Nakayama hasn’t worked on a game before The Inn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Inn’s trailer starts with the players stepping into a traditional Japanese inn, which seems inviting from the outside but dreadful from the inside. We see some rooms engulfed in flames, supernatural beings popping up in jump scares, blood splattered everywhere, and other horror elements. No release date or window was provided for the game. </p>



<p>On the Chainsaw Man Director’s personal <a href="https://x.com/r_nkym_/status/1910016940346859949" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account, Nakayama revealed that he is working on the Roblox Horror Game in collaboration with Mayflower. It is his “first time working on a game” and has been a “challenging and exciting” experience. The director added that even though he knows that Roblox is a popular platform in North America,&nbsp; he is “deliberately trying to give it a stronger Japanese feel” (as translated by Google on X).&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/breath-of-the-wild-and-its-dlc-is-90-on-nintendo-switch-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nintendo’s Legend of Zelda: Breath of the wild and its DLC will set players back $90 for its Nintendo Switch 2 version.</p>



<p>That’s according to the mathmagician wizard out there (not really), who have calculated that whichever way you try to get the game and its DLC on the Nintendo Switch 2, it’s going to be $90.</p>



<p>That’s because Nintendo are notoriously bad for not discounting its games, no matter how old they are.</p>



<h2 id="h-90-quick-maths">$90, Quick Maths</h2>



<p>I first spotted these amazing calculations by Paul Tassi at <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/04/11/nintendo-says-switch-2-breath-of-the-wild-is-90-with-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes</a>, but basically, $90 is the number you get to no matter how you try and play the game on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>For those looking to buy the game outright, it will set you back $70, plus the $20 DLC taking you to $90. For those looking to upgrade from the original Nintendo Switch version, you’ll still have to buy the game for $60 and need to buy the “enhanced” edition for an additional $10. Add on the $20 for the DLC and you’re at the $90 price point once again.</p>



<p>The news likely adds even more frustration to what has been a disastrous reveal for the Nintendo Switch 2. It’s $450 console price point (which could still increase in the US following all the tariff shenanigans) has been a constant cause for debate in the community. </p>



<p><strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RELATED – Nintendo Switch 2 Games Will Cost Up To $98 For Physical Games When Converted From Euros</a></strong></p>



<p>Admittingly, though, it’s a console that’s still going to fly off the shelves, but I’m personally finding Nintendo’s greed here a little hard to stomach, especially given the current economic climate. It seems like whichever way we look at it, more expensive games are going to be hitting us sooner rather than later. </p>



<p>What do you think about the current pricing structure from Nintendo? Will you be buying Zelda for $90?

From there, those looking to play together on different platforms will need to add each other's Larian account name to their in-game friend's list. Players will then be able to create a cross-play multiplayer lobby and invite people accordingly. One interesting wrinkle noted by Larian is that if the person hosting the lobby is playing on PC and joined by those playing on consoles or Mac, the lobby host will need to have less than 100 mods installed and only include mods accepted on consoles and Mac.</p><p dir="ltr">The real draw of the update, however, is the new subclasses. The full list of additions can be found below.

This update addresses crashing issues that players reported, an audio issue players had while watching the Grounded documentary, fixes for the sliders in the display menu, and more.</p>
<p>However, it does not address the autosave issues that players have reported to Nixxes, which Nixxes says it is still working to fix. For now, Nixxes suggests players try a workaround if they do run into the issue and a potential explanation as to why the problem is occurring in the first place.</p>
<p>"<em>Our investigation shows that issues can occur when OneDrive or similar cloud services block the save file from being written,</em>" Nixxes wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/NixxesSoftware/status/1910698603439444167">post on X</a>. "<em>As a workaround, we suggest that you pause OneDrive while playing the game: Right-click the OneDrive icon in the Windows taskbar, click the gear icon and Pause sync.</em>"</p>
<p>The Last of Us Part II Remastered arrived on PC right at the beginning of April, and in just over a week, Nixxes has released <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-hotfix/">two patches</a> for the game, addressing the big issues players were immediately reporting. At the pace Nixxes is working at, it likely won't take them too much longer to work out a fix for the autosave issue.</p>
<p>Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-report-no-nvidia-dlss-4-mfg-but-still-smooth/">dug into the PC port</a> for The Last of Us Part II Remastered when it arrived a little more than a week ago, and even without these patches, at the time he wrote that The Last of Us Part II Remastered "<em>is one of the best games ever made in its genre, and it is absolutely unmissable for anyone who enjoyed Part I. As such, it is hard not to recommend, even though it's an entirely straightforward, albeit not problematic, port</em>."</p>

Elsewhere, there’s photo mode, cross-play, and Xbox Series S split screen. Check out the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-due-out-in-2025-adds-12-new-subclasses-and-loads-more"><u>Baldur's Gate 3 Patch 8 patch notes</u></a> for more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 8 new subclasses:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Bard - College of Glamour</strong><br>As a College of Glamour Bard, you’ll find you have the power to heal friends and command enemies in equal measure. Cast <strong>Mantle of Inspiration</strong> to bestow your allies with 5 temporary hit points. And should an enemy attack while it is cast, they’ll find themselves <strong>Charmed</strong>. Play your hand correctly and you’ll be able to use this to your advantage with <strong>Mantle of Majesty</strong>. Target Charmed enemies and you can command them to flee, move closer, freeze, drop to the ground, or drop their weapon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barbarian - Path of Giants</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Opt for the Path of Giants, and your newfound giant strength will make it easier for you to yeet friend and foe alike. Forget chugging potions to pump those muscles, these Barbarians benefit from the <strong>Giant’s Rage</strong> passive that grants both strength and size - allowing you to deal additional damage with Throw attacks. Pockets weighing you down? Not for you and your increased carry capacity!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Cleric - Death Domain</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a cleric of death, you’ll find a few dark new tricks up your sleeves - from spells that specialise in necrotic damage to three new necromancy cantrips. This includes <strong>Toll The Dead</strong>, a cantrip that causes 1~8 damage when your cleric rings the bell of impending doom - a number that scales if your target has already been damaged. We’ve also added the homebrewed ability to explode nearby corpses, damaging enemies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Druid - Circle of Stars</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">These Druids look to the stars for answers, accessing powers beyond those offered through the classic wildshapes. Taking on one of three <strong>Starry Forms</strong> for their power - the constellations of the Archer, Chalice, and Dragon. Each one favours a different play style and strategy - the Archer dealing radiant damage with astral arrows, the life-giving Chalice restoring hitpoints to you and others nearby, and the wise Dragon, allowing you to deal damage with an added bonus to constitution rolls. The Starry Forms offer not just a celestial aesthetic, but practical, powerful options to enhance your role as a healer, fighter, or strategist.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Paladin - Oath of the Crown</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ve been sworn to uphold the principles of law. Stay true to your oath and you'll be rewarded with the power to aid your allies and disrupt your foes. Guide your companions in battle with <strong>Righteous Clarity</strong>, taunt enemies with strategic interrupts, and keep your party standing strong with <strong>Divine Allegiance</strong>, absorbing their damage while restoring their health.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fighter - Arcane Archer</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mastering the dual arts of magic and marksmanship, the Arcane Archer subclass offers unique skills on top of new shooting animations. Banish foes to the Feywild, removing them from the battlefield for a turn, or unleash Psychic damage that forces enemies to make a Wisdom saving throw or be blinded until the start of their next turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Monk - Drunken Master</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Putting the brew in homebrew, as the Drunken Master, you have the ability to consume alcohol straight from your inventory, as well as drink from bottles you see around the Sword Coast, in order to recover Ki. By sharing the bottle with your enemies using <strong>Intoxicating Strike</strong>, you’ll generate a buff towards your Armour Class and your Chance to hit Drunk targets. Drunk enemies are also susceptible to the Drunken Masters' other abilities, like <strong>Sobering Realisation</strong> - which sobers up drunk targets, dealing physical and Psychic damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ranger - Swarmkeeper</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Swarmkeeper subclass provides Rangers with three kinds of deadly swarms to assist them in combat. The <strong>Cloud of Jellyfish</strong> deals extra lightning damage - potentially shocking your enemy. <strong>The Flurry of Moths</strong> deals Psychic damage, giving you the potential to Blind your enemy. The <strong>Legion of Bees</strong> deals piercing damage and forces the enemy to make a strength-saving throw or be knocked back 15ft. Each swarm also has the ability to provide you with teleportation capabilities!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Rogue - Swashbuckler</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This Rogue subclass introduces a range of new actions fit for the piratical life. Play dirty by tossing sand at enemies to <strong>Blind</strong> them. Flick your weapon at a target to <strong>Disarm</strong> them. Or use your new <strong>Fancy Footwork</strong> passive while meleeing your enemy to ensure they can’t make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sorcerer - Shadow Magic</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a Shadow Magic Sorcerer, you deal in a form of magic that makes you deadliest in darkness. This subclass gives its sorcerer <strong>Superior Darkvision</strong>, as well as the ability to <strong>Shadow Walk</strong> between places of dim light or darkness. It also lets you call forth the perfectly homebrewed <strong>Hound of Ill Omen</strong> to harass your foes, and use <strong>Strength of the Grave</strong> to prevent you from being downed - ideal for those attempting Honour Mode runs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Warlock - Hexblade</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hexblade Warlocks make a pact with an entity from the Shadowfell that manifests in the form of magical weapons. Curse your enemies and force their souls to do your bidding. Slay any enemy that isn’t generally an element of nature, construct, giant blob, or already dead, and you’ll be able to raise their spirit from their corpse for ten turns. This new summon can deal necrotic damage and will rip away a chunk of your enemy’s soul to provide your Hexblade Warlock with healing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Wizard - Bladesinging</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Bladesinging subclass merges swordplay with wizardry. Expect new spellcasting animations when casting spells with your weapon, a new Bladesong ability to grant you supernatural speed, agility, and focus, plus gives you a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN 10 of 2023</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Patch 8, as Larian has signalled, is the final major update for the game and draws a line under what has been a remarkable time for the developer. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">Baldur’s Gate 3 launched to critical acclaim</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-larians-huge-2023-profits-revealed">enormous commercial success</a> back in 2023, and has continued to sell strongly throughout 2024 and into 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Larian shocked the gaming world by confirming its intention to leave Baldur’s Gate 3 and Dungeons &amp; Dragons behind to work on a brand new game, which it teased at various points before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-larian-says-its-full-attention-is-on-its-next-game-media-blackout-for-the-foreseeable">announcing a media blackout to focus on the new mystery project</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">D&amp;D owner Hasbro. however, has teased plans to continue with the series. Speaking to IGN at the Game Developers Conference last month, SVP of digital games at Hasbro, Dan Ayoub, let on that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-started-work-on-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-then-canceled-it-the-studio-was-elated"><u>with Larian moving on</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/well-hear-more-about-baldurs-gates-future-in-pretty-short-order-hasbro-svp-of-games-says">Hasbro has "a lot of people very interested in Baldur's Gate."</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're kind of working out our plans for the future and what we're going to be doing with that. And actually, in pretty short order, we're going to have some stuff to talk about around that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ayoub didn't offer any further information about whether this "stuff" would be a full-blown new Baldur's Gate in the works, or some sort of crossover like the characters had with Magic: The Gathering previously. However, he did acknowledge that he eventually <em>wants</em> a Baldur's Gate 4, but that making one will likely take a while.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's somewhat of an unenviable position," he said. "I mean, we're not in a hurry. Right? That's the thing, we're going to take a very measured approach... We've got a lot of plans, a lot of different ways to go about it. We're starting to think about, okay, yeah, we're ready to start dipping toes a little bit and talking about a few things. And I think, in really short order, like I said, again, not to over-tease that point, we're going to have some other things to talk about around that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Larian will celebrate the release of Patch 8 with a Twitch livestream in which senior systems designer, Ross Stephens, will run through the changes and additions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/atomfall-blows-past-2-million-players-in-first-month/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atomfall-shadow-of-cumbria/">Atomfall</a> publisher and developer Rebellion has announced that their new post-apocalyptic adventure in the British countryside has attracted more than <strong>2 million players</strong> within the game's first month.</p>
<p>Rebellion also shared a few in-game statistics about how players have been interacting with Atomfall, like the fact that players have killed more than 5.9 million enemies with cricket bats, ordered over 250,000 pints of beer, drunk 500,000 cups of tea and died from rat swarms more than 420,000 times. Rebellion also pointed out that 'tin of meat' is players' preferred in-game food choice, with more than 14.1 million tins of meat being consumed so far.</p>
<p>In the game's opening weekend, Atomfall surpassed <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomfall-surpasses-1-5-million-players-in-its-opening-weekend/">1.5 million players</a>, so it's not surprising that it went well past 2 million within its first month of launch.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>It should also be pointed out that part of Atomfall reaching the audience it has is due in part to the game being available on Xbox Game Pass from day one. Still, even considering its inclusion in Microsoft's subscription service, 2 million players in weeks for a brand-new game is still an incredible feat.</p>
<p>Just one year ago, at the time of writing, there were no Fallout-esque games that took the adventure across the pond to the United Kingdom. Now, with the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-is-now-available-for-download/">Fallout: London</a> last July and Atomfall, we have two of them. This brings up an interesting point as to whether we'll start to see the same kind of post-nuclear apocalypse setting happening outside the United States more often.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atomfall-shadow-of-cumbria/">review</a> of Atomfall, we said, "<em>Atomfall is a thoroughly enjoyable game which looks and plays well, and offers a compelling narrative with surrounding exploration to keep you entertained. It's well-polished, offers good replay value, and encourages you to do things a little different, and isn't bad on the eyes either, with a good design that allows it to both look good and support last-gen consoles."</em></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/has-schedule-1-been-sued-lawsuit-controversy-explained/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/has-schedule-1-been-sued-lawsuit-controversy-explained.1162014/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/has-schedule-1-been-sued-lawsuit-controversy-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Schedule 1 is one of the most impressive success stories of 2025. The indie drug-dealing game is a hit sensation on Steam, but a lawsuit controversy has jeopardized that feel-good story. </p>



<p>The concept of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-roadmap-all-future-content-fishing-shooting-mini-games-bribery-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1</a> is simple. Players start as small-time drug dealers and work their way up, producing drugs and distributing them. However, It’s not always smooth sailing, as law enforcement and rival cartels will force you to defend your empire. </p>



<p>While relatively straightforward, the addicting gameplay loop is a massive draw. In only a few weeks after launching,  Schedule 1 reached nearly <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164500/Schedule_I/#:~:text=You're%20a%20small%2Dtime,coast%20city%20of%20Hyland%20Point." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">half a million concurrent players</a> at its peak. The meteoric rise inspired <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-creator-gives-console-port-update-after-imitations-appear-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console port imitations</a> as other developers tried to steal the magic formula. Yet, Schedule 1 also faces similar clone accusations. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-schedule-1-being-sued">Is Schedule 1 Being Sued?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Schedule 1 puts you in the shoes of a drug dealer. Image via TVGS</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Schedule 1 is not being sued</strong>, <strong>but the game is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-being-investigated-for-ip-copyright-infringement-claims/#:~:text=April%204%2C%202025-,Schedule%201%20Being%20Investigated%20For%20IP%20Copyright%20Infringement%20Claims,full%20investigation%20into%20the%20game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">under investigation</a> for IP copyright infringement</strong>. </p>



<p><a href="https://biznes.pap.pl/wiadomosci/firmy/movie-games-sa-172025-podjecie-decyzji-o-rozpoczeciu-dochodzenia-wzgledem-tworcow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">papbiznes</a> published a document titled “MOVIE GAMES SA (17/2025) Decision to commence investigation against the creators of the Schedule 1 production for claims regarding the infringement of the Issuer’s IP and related to committing an act of unfair competition against it.”</p>



<p>Movie Games S.A. already had an established foothold in drug-dealing games with Drug Dealer Simulator 1 and Drug Dealer Simulator 2 before Schedule 1, raising questions about whether it is too similar. </p>



<p>The investigation is strongly looking into: “Elements of the game’s plot, mechanics, as well as UI – User Interface.” It finishes by saying: “The Issuer will immediately inform about further actions related to the pursuit of claims regarding the infringement of the Issuer’s IP and the act of unfair competition in subsequent current reports.”</p>



<p>When news about the investigation surfaced, Schedule 1 fans lept into action and review-bombed the Drug Dealer Simulator games on Steam. The feud forced Movie Games to respond. </p>



<h2 id="h-will-schedule-1-be-sued">Will Schedule 1 be Sued?</h2>



<p><strong>If the investigation concludes that the similarities between Schedule 1 and Drug Dealer Simulator’s game plot, mechanics, UI, or anything else are too close, a lawsuit could be filed. </strong></p>



<p>After the incessant review bombing of Drug Dealer Simulator, Movie Games stepped forward and cleared up any confusion with a post on its <a href="https://x.com/MovieGamesSA/status/1909573722219888913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official X account</a>. </p>



<p>The company made it abundantly clear, “<strong>There is no lawsuit</strong>,” and it’s not the company’s intention to “<strong>Prevent TVGS from selling or developing their game</strong>&nbsp;[Schedule 1].” The statement goes on to say the investigation is being conducted because of the similarities, and “Movie Games, being a publicly traded company,&nbsp;<strong>could face severe litigation for negligence.</strong>“</p>



<p>Movie Games emphasized, “There is no ill will toward TVGS,” and they “<strong>Emailed them best wishes shortly before the release.</strong>“</p>



<p>Despite the reassuring statements, the investigation is ongoing, and we won’t know if there will be a lawsuit until it concludes. </p>



<hr>



<p>The investigation hasn’t slowed down the creation of new content for TVGS. Schedule 1 has an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-roadmap-all-future-content-fishing-shooting-mini-games-bribery-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extensive roadmap</a>, including the addition of fishing, shooting, mini-games, and more. In addition, the game regularly receives <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-april-7-update-adds-pawn-shop-boutique/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new updates</a> to ensure an enjoyable experience. </p>
