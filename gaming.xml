            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/la-quimera-release-date-ex-metro-devs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Reburn, the studio staffed by several ex-<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>developers, has announced the release date for its story-focused first-person shooter&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>.</p>

<p>The game, which was revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-Ukraine-reburn-la-quimera" rel="nofollow">alongside Reburn's rebrand</a> back in February, will be launching for PC via Steam on April 25th. There's no word yet on whether the shooter will be coming to consoles or not.</p>

<p>If you'd like to get a chance to test out&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>early, you can apply for a place on the game's upcoming closed beta, which will take place on April 12th and will run for 24 hours (starting from 7am Pacific/10am Eastern). Slots are "limited", according to Reburn, so you should be quick if you want a place.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/la-quimera-release-date-firefight.jpg?itok=NRNxFUJK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/la-quimera-release-date-firefight.jpg?itok=UdjISgMR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>launches later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>Just in case you're unaware, Reburn is the studio formerly known as 4A Games Ukraine, which was one of the overarching 4A Games' offices in Kyiv. 4A Games Ukraine, as it was then known, helped out with the development of 2019's&nbsp;<em>Metro Exodus</em>.</p>

<p>4A Games remains intact under its original moniker, and in a <a href="https://www.4a-games.com.mt/4a-dna/2025/2/28/4a-games-studio-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">studio update</a> posted around the time that Reburn decided to rebrand, 4A confirmed once again that it is, in fact, still working on a new&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>game alongside publisher Deep Silver.</p>

<p>All of this follows Embracer Group's sale of Saber Interactive <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-games-zen-studios-embracer" rel="nofollow">back in September last year</a>, and although it was widely expected that Saber would purchase 4A, that didn't end up happening, meaning 4A remained with parent company Embracer.</p>

<p>If you're confused by this, rest assured that you're not the only one. Suffice it to say that&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>is the game currently in development by the studio formerly known as 4A Games Ukraine, and it's coming to PC in April.</p>




<p><i>La Quimera&nbsp;</i>lands on PC via Steam on April 25th, and you can head over to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2282350/La_Quimera/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the game's Steam page</a> to get a chance to join the closed beta right now.</p>

            <p>In these days of combing online imagery for symptoms of genAI “hallucination”, it’s easy to forget that once upon a time, mutant video game visuals were beautiful. There's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch_art">a whole genre of art</a> dedicated to them. Here to remind us is Babushka's Glitch Dungeon Crystal, a gorgeously scruffy 2D platformer in which an old lady explores a big magic cellar, hitting graphics card malfunctions with a broom. Think <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-well">Animal Well</a>, but both you and the simulation aren’t as young as you used to be.</p> <!--more-->
<p>Babushka's Glitch Dungeon Crystal is the work of Jakeonaut, who is <a href="https://jakeonaut.itch.io/">partial</a> to busted pixels. It launched on Saturday and still has a demo on Steam, which I encourage you to try. The world is made up of fizzy, marbled terrain tiles, wavering clots of white noise, and anomalous 3D fixtures. It's like the game's carcass is being feasted on by a bunch of different aesthetics. More literally, the geography also teems with critters such as frogs, crickets and chickens who can be meddled with to various end. I walloped a cricket and it chewed a hole through some scenery for me, which almost never happens in real life.</p>

<p>The protagonist is no less delightful for her determinedly low-tech method of making headway. Ah, if only I could fix my old iBook’s addled GPU by smacking it with a dustpan and brush. Mind you, it's not all flailing broomsticks. You can also learn "hag magic" spells from totems, switching between them with spacebar. </p>
<p>These include higher jumps, the ability to climb up walls, and walking on air. It’s a familiar collection of platformer abilities, perhaps, but there’s the promise of others that let you “glitch” the levels more adventurously. You can only remember two spells at once because, as a tutorial NPC politely explains, you’re old. You also forget spells when you walk through certain errors, which feels like a device the developer will use to bookend the game’s puzzles. There's a gloomier undertow: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876850/Babushkas_Glitch_Dungeon_Crystal/">the Steam page</a> mentions themes of "aging, senescence, and fear of mortality."</p>

<p>Microsoft is going to enter the handheld gaming market. It’s just a matter of when, not if, and it’s something that Xbox head Phil Spencer is excited about.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvYRQxIaJ-k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">iJustine</a>, Spencer was asked about the Xbox’s plans for handheld gaming. While Spencer didn’t fully commit to anything specific, he did drop another tease about what’s to come.</p>



<p>“[We’ve] teased and talked about handhelds and I’m very excited because we both travel, and sometimes you can’t always take your console or your whole gaming desktop with you,” Spencer said when asked specifically if there was anything “exciting” coming from Xbox in 2025.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While Spencer didn’t confirm it, Microsoft is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/asus-seemingly-teases-project-kennan-xbox-handheld-ahead-of-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">expected to release</a> an Xbox-branded handheld PC in partnership with ASUS. The handheld, while not a full Xbox mobile system, is expected to have a heavy Xbox presence , including an Xbox guide button and “more prominent grips”. The system, however, will be a mobile PC that doesn’t run Xbox games natively. </p>



<p>Regarding an official Xbox handheld, that’s not rumored to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-gen-xbox-console-release-planned-for-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">come until 2027</a>.</p>



<p>Are you excited about Microsoft and Xbox getting into the handheld gaming space? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> about the same subject, Trinen said said Nintendo priced Mario Kart World at $80 as part of a calculation of the game's overall value.</p><p>"It's less about the strategy of pricing Mario Kart World, it's more just whenever we look at a given game, we just look at what is the experience, and what's the content, and what's the value?" he said.</p><p>"This is a game that is so big and so vast and you will find so many little things in it to discover. And there's still some other secrets remaining that I think as people end up buying and playing the game, they're going to find this to be probably the richest Mario Kart experience they've ever had," he added.</p><p>Of course, Trinen would do whatever he can to hype Mario Kart World--that is his job. Time will tell if people embrace Mario Kart World at $80.</p><p>Mario Kart World is not the Switch 2's only $80 game, as the Switch 2 editions of Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Super Mario Party Jamboree, and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom also carry that higher price point. Some games are less, as Donkey Kong Bananza is priced at $70. </p><p>According to one retailer, video game prices <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">need to go up</a> to maintain the overall stability of the market.</p><p>Mario Kart World is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">Switch 2 launch title</a>, arriving alongside the system on June 5. Mario Kart World is included with the Switch 2 in a $500 bundle, though some believe <a href="https://ase-as-nintendo-pulls-us-preorders-over-trumps-new-tariff-policies/1100-6530626/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the price might go up due to tariffs.</a></p>

Nintendo has not provided all the answers as of yet, so we can only wonder.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4471852-screenshot2025-04-07at9.01.52am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4471852" data-ratio="0.54674796747967" data-width="984" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4471852-screenshot2025-04-07at9.01.52am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4471852"></a><figcaption>Mario Kart World's breakout star: the cow.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4471852-screenshot2025-04-07at9.01.52am.png"></figure><p>What we do know is that the cow is one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-video-suggests-there-are-84-characters-including-costume-variants/1100-6530608/" data-ref-id="1100-6530608">dozens of playable characters in Mario Kart World's roster</a>--up to 24 players can take part in races in World, which is the most ever for the series.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/physical-switch-2-edition-games-can-just-be-a-switch-1-cartridge-with-a-code-in-the-box.1157241/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/07/physical-switch-2-edition-games-can-just-be-a-switch-1-cartridge-with-a-code-in-the-box/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>One of the many small facts that has been picked up on since the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> direct last week is that a physical <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-edition-paid-upgrades-come-to-mario-party-zelda-kirby-and-more/">Switch 2 Edition</a> of an upgraded game for the new console won’t necessarily have a Nintendo Switch 2 cartridge inside the box.</p>
<p>While this decision will be down to the publisher, Nintendo’s chosen the route that a physical copy of Breath of the Wild: Switch 2 Edition or the upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> with have a Nintendo Switch 1 cartridge and a download code for the Switch 2 Edition upgrade.</p>


<p>This has been confirmed by dummy packshot imagery distributed by Nintendo:</p>

		
		


<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1js9s09/nintendo_support_says_that_switch_2_enhanced/">This decision has been widely decried by gamers</a> that still champion physical media and the second hand market. Many have noted the similarity to online passes that were common in the early 2010s, which were partly designed to as a way to extract a toll from second hand game sales. This will have a similar effect, so that a second hand copy of a Switch 2 Edition game will need the buyer to separately purchase the Switch 2 Edition upgrade… at which point, you might as well see if a standard Switch version of a game is available for a lower price.</p>

<p>By contrast, it’s been confirmed that Rune Factory’s Nintendo Switch 2 Edition will be a Switch 2 specific card:</p>

<p>Additionally, there are a number of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/these-games-are-getting-free-nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-from-nintendo/">Nintendo first party games that will receive free updates</a> to support the Switch 2’s increased power, typically in instances where there’s just a bump to resolution and frame rate with minimal extra work.</p>
<p>The one upside of Nintendo’s approach is that a physical Switch 2 Edition will be usable with both generations of console, but it is a shame that Nintendo hasn’t produced a cross-gen cartridge as well – in fairness, games might have textures and game data re-encoded for Switch 2, and so balloon the size of a combined game install.</p>
<p>However, this is in contrast to the cross-gen strategies of Xbox and PlayStation. Sony’s PS5-upgraded remasters have then had PS5-specific discs printed for the purpose, while Microsoft pushed hard with cross-gen Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One discs in many instances (though typically also requiring large game updates and downloads to actually install a game).</p>
<p>Speaking of which, it’s been confirmed that Switch 2 game cards won’t necessarily have a copy of the game on the card itself. These <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Hardware/Nintendo-Switch-2/Nintendo-Switch-2-Game-Key-Cards-2785635.html">Game-Key Cards will be labelled on the box</a>, and act as a physical license key to let you download a game to the internal storage. This honestly isn’t an uncommon sight to see with modern games on other platforms, where there’s been games like Halo Infinite where the disc is effectively just a license key. This is potentially preferable to the ‘Code in Box’ physical releases for Nintendo Switch, which include an eShop key to download, as there will still be trade-in value for the game.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this is a reminder of the impermanence of digital games, and there’s always the potential risk in years and decades to come that access is removed one way or another.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-easiest-upscaling-nvidia-dlss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will support NVIDIA DLSS, as previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a>, but the AI-powered upscaler won't be the only option available, nor will it be mandatory to use upscaling in any way.</p>
<p>Speaking with<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-developers-discuss-the-consoles-tech-and-iwatas-lasting-legacy-on-its-development"> IGN</a>, Nintendo’s Entertainment Planning and Development Department's Kouchi Kawamoto and Takuhiro Dohta and Technology Development Division's Tetsuya Sasaki talked about upscaling options for the new system, revealing that, while NVIDIA DLSS will be the "easiest" upscaling option to use in games, the company is planning on providing other software-based upscaling solutions. In addition, the Nintendo representatives highlighted how not using any upscaling solution is also an option. Considering how using DLSS has a cost, we are likely going to use a wide variety of upscaling solutions to hit whichever frame rate targets developers aim for in their games.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will also support ray tracing, but much like NVIDIA DLSS and other upscaling solutions, developers won't be required to implement it in their games, as Nintendo considers ray tracing just another tool that can either be used or not depending on the situation. Considering how demanding ray tracing can get and how the console won't be the most powerful gaming system around, this isn't particularly surprising.</p>
<p>Besides supporting NVIDIA DLSS and ray tracing, one feature that sets the Nintendo Switch 2 apart from its predecessor is the mouse functionality of the Joy-Con 2 controllers. Speaking with<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-nintendo-switch-2-interview-with-nintendo-of-americas-bill-trinen"> IGN</a>, Nintendo of America's Vice President of Product and Player Experience Bill Trinen commented on the new functionality, saying how, having been added on top of the other unique features of the Joy-Con 2 controllers, it is different from that of a regular PC mouse, opening up some interesting possibilities like using dual mouse controls that he hopes third-party developers will take advantage of to evolve their gameplay. He also hopes that having this control option will make PC developers a lot more eager to want to bring their games to the console, as they wouldn't have to revamp control schemes.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches worldwide on June 5th. You can learn more about the system by checking out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">hands-on preview.</a></p>

            <p>Microsoft have developed a playable version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake-ii">Quake 2</a> that runs on generative AI. The "game" cannot currently run for longer than two minutes, has a very low frame rate, unresponsive controls, and is full of blurry textures. But Microsoft's artificial intelligensia are proud enough of the prototype that they have made it playable online. Would you like to experience a novel type of anguish? Come with me.</p>

<p>The demo is playable on <a href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/wham">Microsoft's Copilot site</a>, where they note that "Copilot may make mistakes". It operates with keyboard controls only and will prompt you with a pop-up message after two minutes to say that the timed demo is over. You can reload the page to play it again.</p>
<p>"In this real-time tech demo, Copilot dynamically generates gameplay sequences inspired by the classic game Quake II," reads a blurb on <a href="https://copilotlabs.microsoft.com/experiment/copilot-gaming-experiences/">a neighbouring Microsoft website</a>. "Every input you make triggers the next AI-generated moment in the game, almost as if you were playing the original Quake II running on a traditional game engine." </p>

<figcaption>One of these screenshots is actually Quake 2, the other is the AI demo. I'll let you guess. </figcaption>

<p>What that actually looks and feels like is a lot of staccato strafing through a surreal slosh of not-quite-right 90s shooter levels. Enemies sometimes appear and you must shoot them an unspecified number of times before they die, although will sometimes seem to reanimate. Approaching a wall and then stepping back will result in a trippy reconfiguration of your surroundings. It is like playing a bad dream of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a>. It is like being trapped in the sad nightmares of John Carmack after an intense binge of VR. </p>
<p>If you'd rather just watch it being played, marketing mogul Geoff Keighley <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1908593030141202635">tweeted a demonstration</a> of the technology, as our sister site Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-unveils-quake-2-inspired-ai-created-demo-but-its-practically-unplayable">point out</a>. Unsurprisingly, he didn't get a positive response from his followers, many of whom work in an industry where jobs and livelihoods are threatened by this technology.  </p>
<p>The demo is powered by Microsoft's Muse tech, which is the result of the corporate giant's research departments fiddling with AI so that it might help with "game ideation". Modelling an AI on Quake and its sequel makes sense from one perspective, since it is a quintessential shooter with concrete rules for enemy encounters and level design. The fundamental rules of the modern first-person shooter were founded by these games. </p>
<p>Yet as a fan of the long-lived Quake mapping scene, I play this demo and feel something that oscillates between curiosity and disgust, and it's probably 90 percent the latter. I like it better when the "ideation" is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-quake-singleplayer-map-pack-remixes-multiplayer-levels-from-counter-strike-mario-kart-and-more">done by people</a> capable of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/quake-goes-brutalist-again-in-another-free-map-pack-celebrating-concrete">very cool work</a>, who have come together in recent years to create a legit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/quake-renaissance-where-is-quake-and-how-did-it-get-here">Quake renaissance</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The 2017 edition has still never gotten a price drop and remains $300. The Switch OLED is even more at $350.

So I would say tune into our <em>Mario Kart </em>Direct to see what, maybe you’ll be able to find out about that,” he said, referring to a deeper dive into the game slated for April 17.</p><p>He continued:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> But honestly, this is a game that is so big and so vast and you will find so many little things in it to discover. And there’s still some other secrets remaining that I think as people end up buying and playing the game, they’re going to find this to be probably the richest <em>Mario Kart </em>experience they’ve ever had.</p></blockquote><p>Trinen also confirmed <em>Welcome Tour</em>, the Switch 2's <em>Astro’s Playroom</em>-style mini-game explainer for the new hardware, is a $10 digital-only download. Why not a pack-in for the console, like <em>Wii Sports</em>? “Just the amount of care and work that the team put into it, I think it was decided that, ‘Yeah, this feels like $9.99 is not an exorbitant price. It feels like a good value for what you’re getting out of the product,’ he said. <br></p><p>The veteran Nintendo employee also weighed in on why games like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> will be $80 on Switch 2 for their upgraded content, despite having been released several years ago at this point. “Well, again, what I would say is that we just look at each individual game and we look at the content and the value of that game, and then we say, ‘what is the right price for the value of this entertainment?’ What I would probably counter to some of that is that really what you’re looking at is for the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, that’s the physical price for somebody that has not bought the base game,” Trinen said.</p><p>Poor <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>. At just $70, Nintendo must not think it’s as good or just not the same “value” as some of its other games. One big question remains, then. Is $70 the new $60 on Switch 2, or the new $50? I hope Welcome Tour has a<em> The Price is Right </em>mini-game. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sabrina Carpenter is surfacing in Fortnite tomorrow, and her skins have been revealed on social media. She’s appearing as the Fortnite Festival ‘icon’ for Season 8, and fans are fawning over her sparkly outfits. On April 4, Epic Games started teasing the arrival of Carpenter in the popular battle royale game, and tomorrow, they’re delivering on the promise.</p>

<hr>



<h2 id="h-style-over-substance">Style over Substance</h2>



<p>Die-hard Fortnite fans have questioned why Sabrina Carpenter has found her way into the Fortnite ecosystem, but we’re far beyond questioning that. Fortnite has long had a strong relationship with musicians and has hosted many live events and performances in the game – Sabrina Carpenter is the latest addition to that industry-wide collaboration.</p>



<p>On social media, images of the Sabrina Carpenter skin set and a touch of bling were revealed:</p>

<p>The Season 8 update goes like at 6 AM ET (3 AM PT) tomorrow, April 8. It’s then that you can unlock the Sabrina Carpenter skins in Fortnite.

<p>Along with the skins, Sabrina enters the world of Fortnite with two instantly recognisable Jam Tracks – Nonsense and Juno. When you purchase the Sweet Little Bundle from the Fortnite Store, you’ll also unlock Please Please Please as another Jam Track.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-sabrina-carpenter-in-fortnite">How to Unlock Sabrina Carpenter in Fortnite</h2>



<p>To get the Sabrina Carpenter outfit in Fortnite, you need to purchase the Season 8 Music Pass. This will automatically unlock a base skin for Carpenter, as well as a LEGO style. The first outfit you get for Sabrina will be her Victoria’s Secret babydoll dress.</p>



<p>As you progress through the Music Pass, you’ll get the SC Electric Guitar and a second outfit – the embellished bodysuit.</p>



<p>There’s a third and final outfit for Sabrina, though – and you’ll need to buy this one.</p>



<p>It’s called the <strong>Tour-Ready Sabrina Carpenter </strong>outfit, and it will be available in the Fortnite Store throughout Season 8, along with:</p>



<ul>

		<p>The recently revealed sci-fi FPS <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/la-quimera">La Quimera</a> now has a launch date, and it’s really soon! La Quimera is coming out for PC via Steam on 25th April, and there’s a closed beta test set to take place this weekend on 12th April.</p>
<p>Here’s a fresh gameplay trailer:</p>
<p><iframe title="La Quimera -  Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVCU_hdG3Iw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Coming from Reburn – the studio formerly known as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/4a-games">4A Games Ukraine</a>, which is best known for its work on the Metro franchise, but has rebranded for this new original IP – La Quimera is a narrative-led FPS set in a futuristic Latin American megalopolis of Nuevo Caracas&nbsp;and a world created by Nicolas Winding Refn and E.J.A. Warren. The game casts&nbsp;you as a down-on-their-luck PMC soldier caught up in the battle between rival factions. All you really have is a customisable exosuit that enhances your mobility and abilities in combat, alongside sci-fi energy weapons, robot dogs and other drones. The intention is to combine the tense gunplay of the Metro series with in-depth storytelling from this new setting.</p>
<p>Playable solo or with three-player co-op, you’ll be able to coordinate combat tactics and complimentary skills, while your exosuit gives you &nbsp;things like a multitarget electric shock, scanning for hidden enemies, dodging and more.</p>

<p>Reburn as a studio naturally carries forward a lot of talent from the Metro series. The project lead is Oleksandr Kostiuk, who was Metro 2033, Last Light, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metro-exodus">Exodus</a> gameplay and AI designer, but throughout the team, there’s experience that even goes back to before 4A’s founding by ex-STALKER developers. The company is newly rebranded in an effort to distinguish itself from 4A Games Cyprus – it’s this half of the brand and this studio that is owned by Plaion, and which is presumably continuing on with the Metro franchise.</p>
<p>CEO and founder Dmytro Lymar said, “As a development studio operating out of Ukraine, the last several years have been extremely challenging in terms of bringing any artistic creation to life while contending with the realities of war and dramatic shifts in the games industry. Through it all, we stayed focused on what we love: Creating immersive, story-driven experiences. Our work wouldn’t be possible without the bravery and sacrifice of those defending Ukraine, and we’re profoundly grateful for their strength and resilience. We’re also truly thankful to everyone who supported and believed in us along the way.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/tips-for-starting-south-of-midnight/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a> is the latest game from Montreal-based developer Compulsion Games, taking you on a magical journey through this gothic version of the American Deep South.</p>
<p>There's a lot of story, art, and music to dig into in South of Midnight, and of course, plenty of gameplay. Before you get started, though, there are a few things you're going to want to know heading into South of Midnight that'll help you get the best experience possible over the dozen or so hours it'll take to complete the game's story.</p>
<h2>Tips for starting South of Midnight</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>You need to keep moving in combat</strong>. You don't have a parry, but you do have a dodge, and if you can time it right to perform a perfect dodge, then you can create this small explosion that'll knock back enemies and give you another opportunity to get a couple of hits in. That being said, enemies won't be waiting one by one to attack you, so it won't always be possible to time a perfect dodge. Keeping yourself moving and dodging is vital to getting through the many combat encounters you'll play through in each chapter.</p>
<p><b>Your traversal abilities are also crowd-controlling abilities in combat, and you should use them. </b>Every ability you get that helps you traverse the world outside of combat is a tool to crowd-control enemies when you're in combat. Yes, you can just constantly dodge and run around the small arena rooms where combat takes place and get your licks in when you can to make your way through each fight. But you'll have a more efficient experience if you're taking advantage of the fact that you can pull, push, and tie up enemies at almost any moment.</p>
<p><strong>You'll always know where to go, so take the opposite path as much as you can.</strong> One thing that helps keep you moving through South of Midnight's story is that you can always know where to go with the press of a button. Clicking R3 on your controller will show you exactly where to go to continue the story, so any path that is not that main path is where you'll find all the optional bits of storytelling you'll otherwise miss. There are plenty of little well-written notes scattered throughout each chapter that add plenty of solid context to the story. It's worth your time seeking these out, and not just for the story, but also because you'll find XP pick-ups next to many of these notes, which will help you move through the skill tree faster.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on the general skill tree first.</strong> There's one main skill tree called 'General,' and four other lines of skills you can upgrade based on the abilities you'll acquire throughout the game. Your preferred playstyle might incline you to upgrade one of the abilities first, but, as the title of the 'general' tree would suggest, you are generally better off working through that as quickly as possible. Or at least until you get to the point where you can dodge twice in a row in quick succession.</p>
<p><strong>There's no special points for playing on hard.</strong> I can save you some time right now, there's no special achievement for beating the game on hard. The combat also doesn't exactly evolve in an interesting way if you play on hard. The enemies get more spongey, and Hazel gets more fragile, is the limit of what happens. If you find the combat more engaging on hard, then all power to you, but the storytelling and the art design is where South of Midnight really shines. Less time spent on the combat means more time spent on experiencing the best parts of the game.</p>
<p>These are just a few tips that can help make your experience with South of Midnight as fun as possible. It's a wonderful game, to begin with, and keeping these tips in mind will help you experience the full breadth of that.</p>

He is Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison, a washed-up guy in his 40s, once briefly and nichely famous in 1989 after becoming champion at a particular arcade game. He now runs a failing video game store, still trying to play off this decades-past glory, unable to understand why the world doesn’t view him as the champion he needs to be.</p><p>Jack Black’s character, Steve, is far more opaque. I have very many criticisms of this movie, all the reasons why it never climbs above the ranks of “fine,” and the weird lack of character establishment or development of Steve is high among them. It’s all extremely light and silly, but at the cost of any of his actions or decisions having weight. We’re told that as a kid all he wanted to do was mine, but we’re also told that this means all he wanted to do was create, as if one equates to the other. But anyway, rather fortuitously, as an adult he stumbles upon a cuboid orb that opens a portal to the Overworld where mining <em>is</em> a way to be creative, and makes his home there. Years later he’s captured in the Nether by a bad Piglin lady, and to prevent her destroying the Overworld, sends the orb back to our world via his pet wolf, Dennis. This sets up a way for Garrison, along with a boy (Henry) and his older teenager sister (Natalie), and a realtor (Dawn), to all accidentally end up in the Overworld and go on a <em>Minecraft-</em>themed adventure. Phew.</p><p>But what happens almost straight away, as the peril of the Piglin invasion makes itself known, is that the group is split in half. Garrison, Steve and Henry in one splinter, Dawn and Natalie in the other. And at first this looks like a weirdly regressive bit of storytelling, with the male characters using crafting tables to make weapons and planning to fight, while the female characters rush around trying to reason with Villagers to get a map. I remember thinking how odd this was, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Famous_Five&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Famous_Five" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Famous Five</a></span> having George and Anne do the washing up in the stream while Dick and Julian plan how to defeat the dastardly robbers. Yet, it was setting up something more clever.</p><p>Crucially, and almost immediately, both Dawn and Natalie are bashing Piglins like badasses, Natalie discovering an unrealized skill for combat. But at the same time, Steve and Garrison are butting heads, Garrison fighting Steve to become the alpha. Steve knows what he’s doing, has survived for years in here, but Garrison finds this threatening, and repeatedly messes things up in his attempts to prove himself the better man.</p><p>So far, so cliche. The arrogant fool is hardly a novel character trope, and we know the pattern: they mess up enough times until it has actual, serious consequences, then have to face up to their folly and accept their realistic status. They’re taken down a few pegs, realize they’re not the best, and we all get a vicarious win through their humbling. Except, that’s not exactly what happens here.</p><figure id="" data-id="de663d3f0bd10915778aafc814114ff6" data-recommend-id="image://de663d3f0bd10915778aafc814114ff6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1237" data-height="696" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jason Momoa with a pink jacket and shades on his head looks at Jack Black." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jason Momoa with a pink jacket and shades on his head looks at Jack Black." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros. / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="de663d3f0bd10915778aafc814114ff6" data-recommend-id="image://de663d3f0bd10915778aafc814114ff6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1237" data-height="696" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jason Momoa with a pink jacket and shades on his head looks at Jack Black." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When the group finally turns fully on Garrison, it’s not because they’re all now in a deadly predicament he’s caused, but rather because they’ve just had enough of him. They hit him with some very hard truths. They tell him how selfish he is, how self-absorbed he is, how he is the worst person to be around. And in that moment, he breaks down. But, again, not in a manipulative way, not the cliche. Instead he just faces his reality.</p><p>He sobs, he’s broke, he’s failed at everything he’s tried for decades, and most of all, he has no friends. And then there’s the movie’s most heartbreaking line: Henry says to him, “You <em>had</em> a friend in me.”</p><p>There is <em>so</em> much talk right now about “what’s wrong with men.” People taking seriously the extremely serious statistics that show suicide as being the number one cause of death in men under 40. People trying to understand why toxic masculinity has such a grip on the zeitgeist, and why it’s being so poorly combated. And while a lot of this discussion has become ironically narcissistic and self-justifying (“actually men <em>do</em> have it really hard, so this behavior is OK”), the calm, methodical research keeps coming back to the same issue: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/newsletter/2023-10-10/more-than-1-in-7-men-have-no-close-friends-the-way-we-socialize-boys-is-to-blame-group-therapy&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/newsletter/2023-10-10/more-than-1-in-7-men-have-no-close-friends-the-way-we-socialize-boys-is-to-blame-group-therapy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">these men not having friends</a></span>. Real friends, people they can be vulnerable with, share their struggles with, people they’re willing to let support them. </p><p>In the moment that Garrison is vulnerable, Steve becomes his friend. And, he’s not magically cured! He’s almost immediately a douchebag right after this. But he’s beginning to allow himself to change.</p><figure id="" data-id="093b92e7273986bbe920836155daab2d" data-recommend-id="image://093b92e7273986bbe920836155daab2d" data-format="jpg" data-width="758" data-height="426" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Minecraft bee." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Minecraft bee." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros. / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="093b92e7273986bbe920836155daab2d" data-recommend-id="image://093b92e7273986bbe920836155daab2d" data-format="jpg" data-width="758" data-height="426" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Minecraft bee." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s interesting to contrast this with the movie’s best plot, the C or D-plot of Jennifer Coolidge’s relationship with a Villager who accidentally finds his way into our world. He doesn’t talk in English, because he’s a Villager, and after hitting him with her car, Coolidge asks him out on a date. And, once again, here the film avoids the cliche. (Please note the film does not avoid a hundred other cliches; I’m just interested that in these two mirroring storylines.) This is also an over-worn storyline, the barely sentient character who’s viewed as the “perfect man” because he doesn’t say or do anything, so the self-obsessed woman can just talk <em>at</em> him and project her own ideal responses onto him. It’s usually wildly misogynistic, a “women be like” trope to be condemned. Except, that’s not  what happens here.</p><p>The Villager is genuinely a really nice guy! He may not be able to speak, and the movie certainly does go for the obvious “You’re such a good listener!” lines, but he’s actively responsive to Coolidge (I’m sure her character had a name, but this is Jennifer Coolidge, so it’s Jennifer Coolidge being the character she plays so well), accepting of her advances, and most of all, actively interested in what she’s saying! All through facial expressions, we’re left in no doubt that he’s very happy with this situation, very happy to be the listener, and as such, exists to represent the very opposite cartoonish extreme of Momoa’s character. (And, for goodness sakes, stay for the first of the credits scenes to see the wonderful punchline to all this.)</p><p>The Villager—as silly as I feel over-analyzing this very daft sub-plot—<em>is</em> being a lovely guy! He’s not unaware, not being walked over, not a sap or a victim. He’s on what seems to be, for him, a great date! Where Garrison only talks, the Villager only listens.</p><figure id="" data-id="6791a0a9196aa9384f111365302cf1e1" data-recommend-id="image://6791a0a9196aa9384f111365302cf1e1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1265" data-height="712" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jason Momoa in his pink jacket looking horrified in a wrestling ring." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jason Momoa in his pink jacket looking horrified in a wrestling ring." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros. / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6791a0a9196aa9384f111365302cf1e1" data-recommend-id="image://6791a0a9196aa9384f111365302cf1e1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1265" data-height="712" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jason Momoa in his pink jacket looking horrified in a wrestling ring." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So for all its weird, half-empty storytelling, and the failure to have Steve be anything other than Jack Black shouting like Jack Black shouts, and the atrociously thrown-away story behind Rachel House’s Piglin boss, Malgosha, and the impossibly weird decision not to have Dawn form an army of Overworld animals for the big battle (surely that was the entire point of her  character arc?), and on and on and on, I really appreciated <em>A Minecraft Movie</em> for its loud opinions on toxic masculinity, and the need for men to have friends. There’s a moment, right near the end, in which Garrison just openly says he wants a male friend his age.</p><p>As a 40-someone who had accidentally become the husband who knows his wife’s friends, rather than having local friends to hang out with of his own, I’m acutely aware of that loneliness. I also, a year or so back, gathered the courage to say to a couple of guys I know, as weird and awkward as it felt, “I’d like to be friends.” The first person I asked rejected it, “Yeah, sure, I’ll WhatsApp you...” to silence. That sucked. That hurt. But the second couple of people: I meet up with them each once a week for coffee, and we shoot the shit, talk about the insanity of the world, get over-excited about TV shows we just saw, and tell each other what we’re struggling with. And I’m so much better for it.</p><p>I love the moments of vulnerability shown by Garrison in <em>A Minecraft Movie</em>. Yes, he’s an outlandish caricature, but they’re the film’s only honest scenes (in the Overworld, at least—the early stuff set in the real world establishing Natalie and Henry’s recently orphaned lives is so good that I wished I’d gone to see <em>that</em> Jared Hess movie). It’s not a redemption scene, but rather a scene about a man being willing to tell a difficult, vulnerable truth, and it’s what allows him to begin to put his life back together. And most of all, to have male friends.</p><p>I know many have criticized the film for its central message of “keep your creativity” for being over-used. This entirely forgets that the movie’s target audience is too young to have already heard it dozens of times, and oh god, how are adults all so incapable of remembering this? I love it for that. But I also love it for how it just so clearly says, “Boys, you need friends too.” That’s a brave, bold message.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 won’t have achievements. That, according to Nintendo of America’s Vice President of Player and Product Experience Bill Trinen.</p>



<p>In talking with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/553774/nintendo-switch-2-no-achievements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, Trinen was asked straight up if the Nintendo Switch 2 would be the first Nintendo system to include the feature for its games. Trinen’s response was a pretty firm one-word answer.</p>



<p>“Nope,” he said.</p>



<p>Hope for achievements on the new system took hold when it was revealed that both The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom would have them. Of course, they would be tracked on the Nintendo Switch app as opposed to the system itself, but they’re there.</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-nintendo-switch-2-reveal-battlefield-battle-royal-and-a-new-game-being-pitched">PODCAST<strong>:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgveqrF7Sug" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 Reveal, Battlefield Battle Royal, And A New Game Being Pitched</a></h6>



<p>Despite Nintendo not implementing the feature on its new system, that doesn’t mean no games on the console won’t have them Third-party developers could implement them through their own systems such as EA having achievements for Madden 26 or EA Sports FC tied through the EA Account. It just won’t be something Switch 2 players will be able to show off to others via the console.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is scheduled to launch on June 5, 2025. Pre-orders for the system are set to open on April 8/9 throughout the world. That is, of course, unless you live in the United States where recently implemented tariffs by the government have led to Nintendo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-in-us-due-to-trump-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delaying pre-orders in the country</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-developers-discuss-the-consoles-tech-and-iwatas-lasting-legacy-on-its-development<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Editor’s note: This interview was conducted on April 3, 2025, prior to </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-order-date-in-the-us-to-assess-impact-of-trumps-tariffs"><em>Nintendo’s announcement about delaying Switch 2 pre-orders in the United States due to the potential impact of tariffs</em></a><em>. Parts of this interview were edited for clarity.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">After getting hands-on with Nintendo Switch 2 at last week’s reveal in New York, IGN spoke with the hardware leads spearheading the development of Nintendo’s newest console. Kouchi Kawamoto and Takuhiro Dohta from Nintendo’s Entertainment Planning and Development Department, along with Tetusya Sasaki from Nintendo’s Technology Development Division, talked to IGN’s Brian Altano about the technology behind Switch 2, the classic Nintendo handhelds that have inspired them and the impact former Nintendo president Satoru Iwata’s legacy had on the development of the console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Can you talk about the SOC system on a chip the Nintendo Switch 2 was running? Is it Nvidia Tegra? If not, can you reveal which graphics architecture it's based on?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> I think you'll find a lot of the details in NVIDIA's information that they've shared.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> One of the notes in the direct suggested to hit 4K in dock mode, upscaling may be required. What kind of upscaling is this system using? Is it using AI upscaling?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> I think probably the main kind of easiest upscaling to use is the DLSS that Nvidia provides. So from that standpoint, I guess you could say this AI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> That said, we're planning on providing other options of upscaling through software and so ranging from something that uses AI to something that's not. I think you'll see that as time passes. And lastly, I'll add that even though there is upscaling, there's also the option to not upscale and just output natively. So that's also an option that developers can use.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>What about ray tracing? Is that something that your team experimented with?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> Just like DLSS, that's when we're kind of making the graphics of a game. We consider ray tracing as just another tool to do that – it's not that we're going to try to use ray tracing on everything, but really trying to figure out what types of graphics, what types of screens, what types of situations are best suited for ray tracing, and then trying to apply that. That's the approach we took when we did all of our researching and experimenting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> We saw that the switch two supports third party cameras. What about third-party mice?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> You're talking about USB mice, things like that?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Yeah, not the animal!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> [Laughs] It really depends on the game software with the structure. So if that software supports third-party USB mice, yes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> I have a six-year-old daughter. She took my Switch and I don't get to play it anymore. She also has dropped it a lot and it's okay. What have you done with Switch 2 to make sure that it can survive a kid dropping it on the floor or dropping it down the stairs?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo: Nintendo has made very sturdy devices through the ages and I believe that this time around as well, we've made something that will be sturdy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> Yeah, you can drop it a little bit. I don’t recommend it though!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 System and Accessories Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> I also have a Steam Deck and I like it, but the fan gets very loud when I'm playing high end games. It's almost distracting. What did Nintendo do to make sure that that was taken into account when designing the hardware for Switch 2?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> When a fan is loud it really does affect one's gameplay, so that is definitely something we had in the back of our mind during the development of the Nintendo Switch 2. The system is made to adapt depending on the processing capability so I'm kind of curious to hear from the others here what their experience has been like.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> When I was playing it it's not like, “Wow, there's a fan in there”. It hasn’t really gotten to the point where, even through development of the hardware, it has bothered me in any way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> The hardware team put quite a lot of effort into making sure the airflow was smooth. So a lot is coming in but there's a lot coming out, and as such the fan noise isn't too significant.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Nintendo invented the directional pad and it's been important for video games for my entire life. What did your team do to ensure that the Dpad on the Switch 2 was great for fighting games, puzzle games, platformers, all that fun stuff?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> You may think that every time you see the directional pad that it's just the same button being reused, but the truth is we do make small adjustments and add small changes every time. I have people – our development and game development teams – try them out when we make a new one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> This is a more detailed point but for the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller directional buttons, we made it so that it's even more difficult to have mistaken input. Of course, it doesn't completely eliminate that possibility but it should reduce it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> I'm a big fan of Nintendo handheld systems and always have been since the original Game Boy. What are each of your personal favorite classic Nintendo handhelds?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> I have fond memories for each of the systems that have come out but for me personally, I think the original Game Boy really has a special place in my heart. Part of the reason for that is that since then there's obviously new systems that came out, like the Game Boy Advance for example. But I just distinctly remember my mother with the original Game Boy playing Tetris, and that’s just burned into my memory.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It was Mr. Iwata's concerns about the magnets that meant it didn't come to fruition [for the original Switch]</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Some of you worked with the legendary Satoru Iwata. Is there any specific part of his legacy that inspired the Nintendo Switch 2 design?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> There are various aspects but what comes to mind first is the magnet connector. We originally didn't adopt it for the Nintendo Switch because it wasn't as secure as we would've liked. However, we put a lot of effort into this aspect and that has come to fruition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> It was Mr. Iwata's concerns about the magnets that meant it didn't come to fruition [for the original Switch]. So being able to actually address all of the issues and create something that probably would've met his standards is moving and meaningful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> I love it. I think I took the JoyCon on and off 20 times yesterday!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> I actually have a question for you. You saw the footage of the JoyCon 2 snapping on and off. Was the impression you got from that footage different from actually snapping it on and off?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Yes. I thought it was going to be like a refrigerator magnet and it was going to be wobbly loose and instead it just goes ‘snap’ and clicks in. And I was like, “Oh, that feels really nice.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> I'm very relieved to hear that!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Yeah, they told me I had to stop doing it!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Brian Altano has been playing Mario Kart for 30+ years, and it's crazy that 10 of those years were spent with Mario Kart 8. We haven't seen Battle Mode for Mario Kart World yet, but he's still holding out hope that Block Fort can come back. Bring back Block Fort!</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

There's a lot of great detail in there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For some people, I think there are people who are particularly interested in the tech and the specs of the system and things like that, for them I think it's going to be a great product.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has insisted <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> justifies its shock $80 price tag in response to controversy over the $10 hike for some Switch 2 games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced">Nintendo Direct</a> revealed the Switch 2 and launch title Mario Kart World, but it was not until after the showcase ended that the price for both products was confirmed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch 2, out June 5, currently costs $449.99 — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/industry-analysts-react-to-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-chaos-due-to-tariffs-we-are-living-in-unhinged-times">although Trump’s tariffs, which have already delayed pre-orders in the U.S., may cause Nintendo to hike the price</a>. The real shock, though, is that Mario Kart World costs $79.99 — $10 higher than the most expensive Nintendo-published game on Switch, Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth pointing out that Nintendo is bundling Mario Kart World with a Nintendo Switch 2 for $499.99, cutting the cost of the game by a huge $30 in the process. However, Nintendo has indicated this bundle is a limited-time offer, and it remains to be seen if the bundle holds at $500, given the uncertainty surrounding the tariff situation and Nintendo’s pre-order delay in the U.S.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But Mario Kart World isn’t the only Nintendo Switch 2 game to cost $80 — some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-nintendo-switch-2-will-improve-switch-1-games"><u>Switch 2 Edition games</u></a> announced during the Nintendo Direct also cost $79.99, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-star-crossed-world"><u>Kirby and The Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star Crossed World</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv"><u>Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition"><u>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games improve upon their original Switch versions in various ways. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, for example, gain additional support for the Zelda Notes service in the Nintendo Switch App that provides game help. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom-are-getting-achievements-on-nintendo-switch-2">They also have achievements on Switch 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has plenty of reaction to Nintendo’s jump to $80 for the Switch 2 generation, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive">from analysts who have helped us understand why this has happened</a>. But what does Nintendo have to say about it? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-nintendo-switch-2-interview-with-nintendo-of-americas-bill-trinen">IGN interviewed Nintendo of America's Vice President of Product and Player Experience, Bill Trinen</a>, at a recent Switch 2 preview event in New York, to ask about Nintendo’s pricing strategy for Mario Kart World to find out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We need to point out here that our interview with Trinen was conducted on April 3, 2025, prior to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-order-date-in-the-us-to-assess-impact-of-trumps-tariffs"><u>Nintendo’s announcement about delaying Switch 2 pre-orders in the U.S. due to the potential impact of tariffs</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Game Boxes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In his response, Trinen insisted Mario Kart world justifies its price tag, and pointed to the upcoming dedicated Mario Kart World Nintendo Direct where fans will learn more about the game and what it has to offer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I would say it's less about the strategy of pricing Mario Kart World, it's more just whenever we look at a given game, we just look at what is the experience, and what's the content, and what's the value?” Trinen said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Mario Kart World, I think especially as you see from the Nintendo Direct, not to give you any hints or anything, but I did read your article this morning and I think you had mentioned that you didn’t find a lot to discover when roaming around. So I would say tune into our Mario Kart Direct to see what, maybe you'll be able to find out about that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But honestly, this is a game that is so big and so vast and you will find so many little things in it to discover. And there's still some other secrets remaining that I think as people end up buying and playing the game, they're going to find this to be probably the richest Mario Kart experience they've ever had.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We also asked Trinen about the $80 cost of some of the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games. While there is a $10 upgrade path for existing owners of these games on the Switch, and both The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition ($69.99) and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition ($79.99) are available as part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership, Nintendo is not offering any sort of discount to newcomers on Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trinen’s answer here echoed his Mario Kart World response, pointing to the value Nintendo sees in its games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Well, again, what I would say is that we just look at each individual game and we look at the content and the value of that game, and then we say, 'what is the right price for the value of this entertainment?' " he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What I would probably counter to some of that is that really what you're looking at is for the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, that's the physical price for somebody that has not bought the base game. For somebody who has bought Tears of the Kingdom or Breath of the Wild, the upgrade packs for those are $9.99. And if you happen to be a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack member, both of the Zelda upgrade packs are inclusive within that membership. So there's no additional charge for those.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But I think overall, our general approach is really just focus on what's the content, what's the value, and what's an appropriate price based on that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What Trinen is saying here is that Nintendo believes its next-generation push is worth a price hike when you consider what the video games themselves have to offer. And that’s a point echoed by Piers Harding-Rolls, Research Director, Games at Ampere Analysis. He told IGN Nintendo has form when it comes to going high for the cost of its games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Nintendo has a bit of a history of pricing games higher than other platforms when coming to the market later than other platforms - in this case PS5 and Xbox Series,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I remember back in the day N64 titles being more than PS1 titles for example. Some of that is related to cost of goods, but Nintendo also likes to follow its own approach and price based on its own appreciation of value."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the current $450 price tag of the Switch 2 itself, Trinen again pointed to value, but also highlighted the increasing costs associated with releasing a video game console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Obviously the cost of everything goes up over time, and I personally would love if the cost of things didn't go up over time,” he told IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But I think any time you're building a new system that's got new features and new tech, there's costs associated with that. So again, we look at what is the experience on Nintendo Switch? What's the experience on Nintendo Switch 2? What are the new features that it offers? And certainly there's the cost of goods and things that factor into that, but we try to find the right appropriate price for a product based on that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As IGN has reported, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-fans-fear-impact-of-tariffs-on-switch-2-price-i-shouldnt-as-an-average-person-be-priced-out-of-this">some Nintendo fans have expressed concern that they may be priced out of the next-generation</a> if the company goes even higher than the already controversial prices for the Switch 2 and its games such as Mario Kart World due to the tariff situation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What is increasingly clear, however, is that despite calls from the community for Nintendo to drop the price, the Switch 2 and its games are much more likely to get even more expensive than cheaper in the United States.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Nintendo has sought to justify its bumper £75/$80 price tag for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, and pointed to the lower cost of fellow <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> big hitter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> as evidence it had not established a new, more expensive "benchmark".
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2025/04/07/mario-kart-world-price-nintendo-doug-bowser/">The Washington Post</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> boss Doug Bowser said Mario Kart World's higher price tag was simply an example of "variable pricing" that reflected the "breadth and depth of the gameplay".
</p>
<p>
"I think you can anticipate that there will be variable pricing, and we haven't set a benchmark," Bowser said.

<p>
Historically, Nintendo has set some game prices higher than others - most recently <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, which was priced at $70, an extra $10 on top of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. 
</p>
<p>
Other Switch 2 games from Nintendo include Donkey Kong Bananza (£65/$70) and the budget Switch 2 Welcome Tour, which is expected to cost around £5. It's worth noting, too, that Mario Kart World can be bought at a significant discount in a bundle with a Switch 2 - though it's unclear how long this offer will last, or whether stock will be sufficient to meet launch demand.
</p>
<p>
Bowser's comments, published today, were apparently recorded before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">Nintendo made the dramatic decision to delay US Switch 2 pre-orders</a> due to the impact of tariffs. 
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 will still launch on 5th June worldwide, including in the US, though fans there fear Nintendo may decide to increase the console's price in response to the current global economic situation.
</p>
<p>Earlier today, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-leak-confirms-iconic-tracks-return">Nintendo Korea leak revealed the return of an iconic location to Mario Kart World</a>, which Nintendo has so far tried to keep under wraps.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">console will cost $449.99</a> — a big jump from the original Switch, which debuted at $299.99 in 2017. Some have speculated that the price hike was at least partly due to the ongoing confusion around President Donald Trump’s planned tariffs. The timing was certainly awkward; Trump announced a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642240/trump-tariffs-imports-apple-manufacturing">fresh, wide-ranging wave of global tariffs</a> the same day as Nintendo’s event.</p></div><p>But Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser says that tariffs did not directly impact the console’s original price tag. “Put [<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642240/trump-tariffs-imports-apple-manufacturing">the April 2nd announcement</a>] aside. Any previous tariffs were not factored into the price itself,“ he explained, speaking to me the day after the event.</p><p>That may be true, but the impact of the April 2nd tariff announcement is already being felt. Just two days after its event, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">Nintendo announced that it was delaying Switch 2 preorders</a>, which were originally slated to begin on April 9th, in order to “assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions.” There’s currently no new preorder date, and whether the price of the console will be changed is unclear. “The news is fresh, and like many companies right now, we are actively assessing what the impact may be,” Bowser says.</p><p>So why <em>is </em>the Switch 2 so expensive? When I asked Bowser, he rattled off a list of the new console’s features: the bigger LCD screen, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642793/nintendo-switch-2-dlss-support-nvidia-ray-tracing">the more powerful internals</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642493/nintendo-switch-mouse-controls-metroid-prime-4">the Joy-Con controllers</a> that have been “enlarged and redesigned for durability,” the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">GameChat social layer built into the console</a>, and more. “We want to make sure that this is a device that is approachable, that consumers will see as part of their overall entertainment experiences and will understand that it has longevity to it,” Bowser says. “And all of those factors really go into the consideration of the price.”</p><p>The Switch 2’s price tag also puts it in the premium spot in Nintendo’s lineup. Even with the announcement of the new console, Nintendo will still be selling all three models of the original Switch — the base unit, the OLED version, and the Switch Lite — for the foreseeable future. But Bowser gave an unclear response when asked if the existing Switch devices, which top out at $349.99, had an impact on the decision to charge $449.99 for the Switch 2. “You want to consider pricing relative to the Switch since we still have that in distribution,” he says. “But, really, the consideration was driven more by what is a part of this particular gaming experience versus what it is relative to the Switch 1.”</p><div><p>“We are actively assessing what the impact may be.”</p></div><p>The console isn’t the only part of the Switch lineup that’s gotten more expensive. Select Switch 2 games have also received a price bump. For example, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642432/mario-kart-world-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> will cost $79.99 when it comes out on June 5th, compared to the standard $59.99 for first-party games on the original Switch. Speaking generally about determining pricing for games, Bowser says that “each game, we believe, is a unique experience,” and thus prices can vary accordingly.</p><p>That’s how <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour </em>— a game that teaches players details about the Switch 2 and offers tech demos highlighting its key features — ended up as a paid game instead of a free pack-in title like <em>Wii Sports</em> or <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549072/astros-playroom-ps5-review-dualsense-controller">Astro’s Playroom</a></em>. “As this game was being developed, what’s been packed into it is a depth of minigame experiences,” Bowser says. “They’re very deep, they’re very repeatable. And so, as we looked at that depth of play experience and opportunity, we felt that $9.99 was a fair price to ask for that.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/643635/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-explained<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-webster">Andrew Webster</a> <span>is an entertainment editor covering streaming, virtual worlds, and every single Pokémon video game. Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>One of the stranger details that came out of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642420/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-preview">last week’s big Nintendo Switch 2 event</a> was the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68415/~/nintendo-switch%26nbsp%3B2-game-key-card-overview">existence of game-key cards</a>. They won’t be used for all releases, but essentially they’re Switch 2 cartridges that don’t actually contain a game, but instead feature a “key” that’s used for “downloading the full game to your system via the internet.”</p><p>As video games continue to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/638535/physical-digital-video-games-nintendo-xbox-ps5-disc-cart">shift away from physical releases</a>, game-key cards understandably created some confusion among fans. I had the chance to ask Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser why they exist, and the answer was pretty simple: retail stores.</p><p>“In essence, it’s a digital game on a card,” he said. “What it’s beneficial for is for our publishing partners to be able to bring games to market that may be of a significant size, and therefore they may need too large a cartridge for that game. It allows them to sell those physical games at retail.”</p><p>That makes a certain amount of sense, as retail stores are still a notable market for Nintendo in particular. Bowser also noted that, in an attempt to make the distinction between the Switch 2 and its predecessor more clear, the company is “working with our retailers in the US” to create “separate sections for Nintendo Switch 2, so there will be that point of delineation at retail.” (Switch 2 cases also feature a different design with <em>a lot</em> of red on them.)</p><p>Still, the existence of game-key cards will likely be a disappointment for those who rely on physical games for either collecting or preservation purposes — even if it means more large-scale games on the Switch.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
