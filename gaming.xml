            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/601473/nvidia-rtx-5080-5090-gpu-preorder-buy-price-release-date-availability-founders-edition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>While Nvidia’s RTX 50-series graphics cards weren’t the zaniest devices at CES 2025, they stole the show with their promised groundbreaking performance breakthroughs. The RTX 5070, in particular, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338999/nvidia-rtx-5070-vs-rtx4090-performance-price">made headlines as a card that can supposedly rival an RTX 4090 for just $549</a>. We later learned it uses <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337402/nvidia-dlss-4-upscaling-announcement-ces-2025">DLSS 4’s AI-powered multi frame generation</a> to achieve that in supported titles, but that’s a welcome compromise for those who can’t find room in their budget for the beefier 4K-ready GPUs that are going up for sale at 9AM ET on January 30th — including the $999.99 RTX 5080 and the $1,999.99 RTX 5090.</p><p>Those premium cards are capable of greater raw performance, however. In our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/598045/nvidia-rtx-5080-review-test-benchmark">RTX 5080 review</a>, we found it’s only about 15 percent faster than the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23457556/nvidia-rtx-4080-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test-review">RTX 4080</a> it’s replacing. Meanwhile, the benchmarks we ran for our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark">RTX 5090 review</a> averaged 28 percent better frame rates compared to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23398201/nvidia-rtx-4090-review-test-benchmark">RTX 4090</a> for 4K games running at their highest settings with no frame generation help. That’s still impressive given the Founder’s Edition is small enough that it will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349976/nvidia-rtx-5090-fe-small-form-factor-sff-hands-on">fit inside a small form factor PC case</a>. No matter which you’re after, you’ll be exceedingly satisfied if you’re upgrading from an RTX 30-series card or older.</p><p>Between resellers and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/598793/nvidia-rtx-5090-5080-low-stock-warning">forewarned scarcity</a> that’s soured past launches, you’ll likely need a good game plan to secure a 50-series GPU early on. If you aren’t already in line at a brick-and-mortar location, it might be a little too late to find day one stock based on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Microcenter/comments/1iaunns/campers_already_appeared/">encampments that have spawned</a> over the past several days, but we’ll show you where to preorder one online when they become available tomorrow morning.</p><div><h2>Tips to increase your chances</h2><section><p>It’s typically faster to use a desktop or a laptop to click around and input whatever information you need. If you can, use a computer with an ethernet connection to ensure nothing interferes with your network. Bonus points if you use an ultrawide or multiple monitors to view several browser windows at once.</p></section><section><p>Some retailers may implement a wait queue. You can use your smartphone, tablet, or another secondary device to try and get a faster queue time. It can also serve as a failsafe between refreshes if one of the sites slows to a crawl on your desktop. That said, your smartphone should only be a last result to using a PC, as you don’t want to waste time juggling multiple tabs and apps or tapping away at tiny input fields.</p></section><section><p>The last thing you’ll want to be doing when the floodgates open on January 30th is fiddling with passwords and a deluge of confirmation emails. Make sure you have an account with each retailer that’s expected to carry the graphics cards, and do so ahead of launch.</p></section><section><p>If possible, you’ll also want to add your shipping and billing details in advance. This way, you’ll only have to worry about adding the GPU to your cart and completing the final checkout steps.</p></section><section><p>Both Best Buy and Nvidia allow you to sign up to be notified when the GPUs become available. B&amp;H Photo actually requires you to sign up in advance if you want to order one. Be sure to sign up for alerts on each variant of the 5080 or 5090 that you’re planning to buy.</p></section><section><p>You don’t want to rely solely on email notifications for stock alerts, as they’re often delayed and you risk missing your chance. Be sure to load up tabs for each retailer shortly before their listings go live, and then practice hitting that refresh button as fast as humanely possible.</p></section></div><div><p id="where-to-preorder-the-nvidia-rtx-5080-and-rtx-5090"><h2>Where to preorder the Nvidia RTX 5080 and RTX 5090</h2></p></div><p>As of writing, we’re only seeing retail listings for the Founders Editions of the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 at Best Buy, and you can expect Nvidia to sell them, too. That said, there are multiple options from a variety of manufacturers across all retailers, including MSI, Asus, Gigabyte, Zotac, and more. Keep reading for details on each retailer’s current plans.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->1000</span></p><div><p>Nvidia’s RTX 5080 is the successor to the RTX 4080.

Eventually, a range of laptops and pre-built desktop PCs with the GPUs will become available. The retailer currently allows you to sign up to be notified about their arrival, but you’ll want to be proactive and check the site listings early and often on the morning of January 30th.</p><p>Purchasing a 50-series graphics card from Best Buy requires creating an account. If you’re lucky enough to add one to cart, you’ll be added to a queue while the system verifies your account and confirms your unit. If successful, you’ll have 10 minutes to complete the checkout process.</p><div><p id="newegg"><h3>Newegg</h3></p></div><p><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=44583&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2FRTX-50-Series%2FEventSaleStore%2FID-1473" rel="sponsored">Newegg is teasing a comprehensive stock</a> of 50-series graphics cards.

Fans mostly hate it for a host of reasons, not least of which being the fact that it kills off two beloved characters from <em>Aliens</em> off-screen and ends with Ripley’s death. But I’m not here to talk about that  movie. Instead, I want to share with you the first teaser trailer for <em>Alien 3</em> from 1991. </p><p>So that’s a pretty cool teaser and all, but uh, <em>Alien 3</em> doesn’t take place on Earth. And yet that’s what this teaser is promising. Here’s the narration from the trailer: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>In 1979, we discovered, in space, no one can hear you scream.

And yet, they still teased that idea in the trailer above.</p><p>You might be thinking, “Well, I bet fans were really angry about that and there was a massive backlash!” But that didn’t really happen. I mean, I bet you $20 at least one person saw this teaser in a theater, got excited, and then when<em> Alien 3</em> finally arrived, he was disappointed and angry. Back then, however, things were different, and this teaser wasn’t something you could just look up online, nor were there social media platforms in the modern sense where fans could congregate and make their outrage known to filmmakers. Besides, the idea of “franchises” and “teasers” was still relatively novel in Hollywood and audiences weren’t as concerned about that stuff. </p><p>Now, 30 years later, <em>Alien: Earth</em> is doing what that teaser promised back in the 90s and bringing the Xenomorph to our home planet. </p><p>Of course, that’s already happened twice before (at least) in movies as seen in <em>Alien Vs. Predator </em>and its sequel. However, those aren’t really canon in the <em>Alien </em>franchise and break the timeline in ways that drives some fans batty. This is the first proper time the alien creatures will be on Earth, and hopefully it will be worth the 30+ year wait. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/recruit-sofia-daguerre-in-fallout-76/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/recruit-sofia-daguerre-in-fallout-76-for-a-less-lonely-apocalypse.1095417/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/recruit-sofia-daguerre-in-fallout-76/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Before <strong><em>Fallout 76</em></strong> introduced its Wastelanders update on April 14th, 2020, the massive wasteland of Appalachia felt overwhelmingly bleak and lonesome. It was up to the players and their limited interactions with each other to populate the post-apocalypse with stories and memories. But with Wastelanders, Bethesda introduced countless NPCs to flesh out the game world, along with a few notable allies and romanceable partners.</p>



<h4 id="h-who-wants-to-survive-in-the-wasteland-alone-when-spunky-sofia-daguerre-awaits"><strong>Who wants to survive in the wasteland alone when spunky Sofia Daguerre awaits?</strong></h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>One such ally is Sofia Daguerre, an astronaut with the U.S.S.A. space program. In 2103, she and her ship crashed into Appalachia. Unaware of the recent global nuclear meltdown, Sofia tucked herself away in a Free States bunker until the player discovered her and filled in the details of what went wrong with the world.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-can-you-find-sofia-daguerre-in-fallout-76"><strong>Where Can You Find Sofia Daguerre in Fallout 76</strong></h2>



<p>If you’ve spent any time exploring Appalachia, chances are you’ve unlocked The Mire. You’ll wind up traveling here around level 20 to 25, give or take. Coincidentally, that’s when you’ll receive the quest to recruit Sofia Daguerre.</p>



<p>Once you follow the radio signal included with the quest, you’ll track her last-known position to an Abandoned Bunker just north of a hunter’s shack in the northeast of The Mire. It’s near East Ridge Lookout.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-recruit-sofia-daguerre"><strong>How to Recruit Sofia Daguerre</strong></h2>



<p>Once you’ve located the Abandoned Bunker and worked your way inside, you’ll find Sofia Daguerre injured and sitting on the floor in the final room.</p>



<p>She’ll speak with you momentarily, and then you’ll drop the bomb, explaining how the world came to nuclear war and nothing is left but wasteland and magical pipes.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If only it were as simple as starting a conversation to recruit Sofia Daguerre, however. Instead, she’ll task you with the first quest in her quest line. Commander Daguerre asks you to track down the crashed ship she was aboard.</p>



<p>Thankfully, it’s close. Simply head southwest until you reach Gulper Lagoon. From there, head west. You’ll see the crashed ship in the distance. Inside is a flight recorder; take that with you because she wants the information stored within.</p>



<p>We hope you’re prepared because upon activating the flight recorder, you’ll have to wait for the download, which takes two minutes to complete. During this time, a few Super Mutants ambush the player. It’s an easy enough fight if you’re stocked with ammunition or rocking a super sledge.</p>



<p>Upon completion, return to Sofia with the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But that’s not the end of the recruitment quest. Did you think it was that easy? Not quite!</p>



<p>Next, Sofia will ask you to locate an encryption key. It’s on a U.S.S.A. robot south of Gulper Lagoon. It’s a generic retrieval quest with zero surprises.</p>



<p>Upon returning the key, Sofia Daguerre will thank you, and you can recruit her to your C.A.M.P.!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-sofia-daguerre-at-c-a-m-p"><strong>How to Get Sofia Daguerre at C.A.M.P.</strong></h2>



<p>Like other companions in <em>Fallout 76</em>, to activate Sofia Daguerre at your C.A.M.P., you’ll first have to build the appropriate item. In this case, it’s a command console. You should have plenty of resources to make the computer by this level in your journey.</p>



<p>From there, you can continue her quest line and tackle a few radiant objectives.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-quests-in-sofia-daguerre-s-quest-chain"><strong>What Are the Quests in Sofia Daguerre’s Quest Chain?</strong></h2>



<ul>
<li>Crash Landing</li>



<li>The Woman Who Fell to Earth</li>



<li>One Small Step</li>



<li>In Case of Emergency</li>



<li>Bring Home the Beacon</li>



<li>The Universe Conspires</li>



<li>Hope Remains</li>



<li>Search and Destroy</li>



<li>Heavy Eyes</li>



<li>Patently False</li>



<li>Privacy Violation</li>



<li>Contractually Obfuscated</li>



<li>Boot Camp</li>



<li>Past Expiration</li>



<li>No Brainer</li>



<li>Calling Long Distance</li>



<li>Who Sat Down Beside Her</li>



<li>Lab Rat</li>



<li>Mission Out-of-Control</li>
</ul>



<p>As you can see, companion Sofia Daguerre includes several quests to complete her story arc. That’s not to mention the various radiant quests, including Data Driven, Faint Signal, and Glitchcraft.</p>



<h2 id="h-did-you-recruit-sofia"><strong>Did You Recruit Sofia?</strong></h2>



<p>Did you follow all the steps to recruit Sofia Daguerre in <em>Fallout 76</em>? If not, which companion did you opt for? Let us know in the comments!</p>

<p>Once you have Sofia at your CAMP, don’t forget to share an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nuka-cola-wild-in-fallout-76/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ice-cold Nuka-Cola Wild</a> with her to win her affection (That doesn’t actually work, sorry.).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/ps-plus-monthly-games-wont-guarantee-ps4-games-from-january-2026/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has announced an upcoming change to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> monthly games. From January 2026, PS4 games will no-longer be a guaranteed part of the PlayStation Plus monthly games lineup.</p>
<p>The current balance of games featured in PS Plus monthly games is for two guaranteed PS4 games and one PS5 game. Of course, with cross-gen releases as they are, we’ve often had months where all three games are playable across both generations.</p>


<p>From January 2026, the focus will be on the PlayStation 5 – which makes sense since it will be over half a decade old by that point – and so PS4 games will no longer be a guaranteed part of each month’s selection. Cross-gen games that have a PS4 version could certainly still be included – and there’s still tons of PS4 games being released – but it’s not going to be a requirement anymore.</p>
<p>Any already redeemed PS4 games will continue to be playable while subscribed to PS Plus, just as you can still access previous consoles.</p>
<p>This will go hand-in-hand with a shift in focus for securing PS5 games for the PS Plus Game Catalogue, more-so than the PS4. PS4 games will still be a huge part of the service, but again, no longer a key focus.</p>

<p>Here’s Sony’s statement from the PS Blog:</p>
<p>As many of our players are currently playing on PS5 and have shifted toward redeeming and accessing PS5 titles from the Monthly Games and Game Catalog benefit, PlayStation Plus is also evolving with this trend and will focus on offering PS5 titles through the Monthly Games and Game Catalog benefit starting January 2026. As we shift to PS5, PS4 games will no longer be a key benefit and will only be occasionally offered for PlayStation Plus Monthly Games and Game Catalog starting January 2026. We may still provide titles that can be playable on both PS4 and PS5 consoles after this date.</p>
<p>Please note, this won’t affect the PS4 Monthly Games that you have already redeemed from PlayStation Plus. You’ll continue to have access to games you’ve already redeemed as long as you remain a member.&nbsp; For Game Catalog, PS4 games will still be available to play until it leaves the catalog as part of our monthly refresh.</p>
<p>We’ll continue to evolve the experience of PlayStation Plus and optimize the benefits you receive, including exclusive discounts, online multiplayer access, online game save storage and more. As we shift our focus to PS5, we look forward to adding new PS5 titles monthly for you to enjoy.</p>

<p>Microsoft’s Q2 2025 (October – December 2024) has revealed Xbox’s gaming revenue declined, but saw slight growth in via game pass.</p>



<h2 id="h-cut-to-the-chase">Cut to the Chase</h2>



<p>Xbox’s key points for Q2 2025 are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Gaming revenue declined 7% (down 8% CC)</li>



<li>Xbox content and services revenue grew 2% driven by growth in Xbox Game Pass</li>



<li>Xbox hardware revenue declined 29%</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-what-does-it-mean">What Does it Mean?</h2>



<p>It’s always hard to judge the long term effects of quarterly financials as they don’t paint a broader picture of the company as a whole. On first impressions, Xbox content and services revenue growth by 2% seems like a good indicator for Xbox Game Pass, but during the months in which the hotly anticipated Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 released, I would have expected a little more movement. However, its growth matches Microsoft’s guidance at 2%</p>



<p>Xbox’s revenue decline is something that we should hopefully see changed in the coming months, as Xbox’s new strategy is to release its games across more platforms and thus, increase revenues. But again, it’s somewhat surprising considering a big quarter with Call of Duty. </p>



<p>Xbox’s hardware revenue decline shows a sharp decrease at 29%, which is frankly a shocking statistic during the holiday period. For context, Xbox hardware grew by 3% during the same quarter last year. That being said, Xbox’s new focus on the cloud will undoubtedly have an negative impact on hardware sales.</p>

<p>You can find <strong>Nuka Cola Wild in Fallout 76</strong> by purchasing one from <strong>Bubbles </strong>at <strong>The Whitespring Resort</strong>. Alternatively, you can find a single bottle at <strong>Eta Psi House</strong> on <strong>Fraternity Row</strong>, just inside the basement, with all of the Nuka-Cola merchandise and theming.</p>



<p>If you intend to visit Bubbles and buy their stock of Nuka-Cold Wild, along with all the other unique flavors, you better bring a fat stack of caps. At almost 40 caps per bottle, Wild will set you back somewhat!</p>



<p>But what makes Nuka-Cold Wild so unique and refreshing? It’s the company’s answer to the ever-popular Sunset Sarsaparilla from out west, toward New Vegas. The soda pop features a distinctive flavor profile meant to compete with Nuka-Cola’s direct competitor, the Sunset Sarsaparilla Company, after the former failed to buy out the latter in a corporate takeover.</p>

<p>In addition to its unique flavor and color, Nuka-Cola Wild has distinct effects that make it ideal for anyone traveling alone in Appalachia for extended periods.</p>

<p>The massive boost to Hit Points and Action Points makes Nuka-Cold Wild in Fallout 76 the go-to beverage for those running low on Stimpaks or running various perks that boost the effects of food and drink items.</p>



<p>The +5 Rads isn’t too terrible, either. You can deal with a bit of radiation, right?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/the-ps-plus-monthly-games-for-february-2025-payday-3-high-on-life/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> monthly games for February 2025 have been announced, and it’s a great one for fans of virtualised heisting with Payday 3 leading the way alongside a zany first person shooter and an arcade classic franchise.</p>

<p>The following three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, which will be 4th February.</p>


<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/21/payday-3-review/">Payday 3</a> | PS5&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/17/high-on-life-review-xbox-game-pass/">High on Life</a> | PS4, PS5&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pac-Man World Re-Pac | PS4, PS5&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Payday 3 arrived at the tail end of 2023, and while it made a solid first impression – “a welcome return for the heist ’em up series, and a reminder of why the first two games were so popular,” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/21/payday-3-review/">I wrote at the time</a> – it faced an uphill battle with its fans. After a year of hefty reworks and patches, and the addition of the classic World First Bank heist in December, could it be worth diving in?</p>
<p>Well, now’s as good a time as any to see how it holds up.</p>


<p>If you’d rather play something solo, then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/17/high-on-life-review-xbox-game-pass/">High on Life</a> might be for you. Coming from Squanch Games. Whipping you away to a bizarre alien world where guns have faces and talk back to you, and who have increasingly odd fire modes, and you encounter dozens of incessantly babbling characters in the vein of Rick and Morty as you become a bounty hunter.</p>
<p>Of course, you may feel conflicted about this game, due to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/25/justin-roiland-quits-high-on-life-developer-squanch-games-as-he-faces-domestic-abuse-charges/">the involvement of Justin Roiland</a> in its creation.</p>

<p>Lastly for this month is Pac-Man World Re-Pac, a 2004 remake of the PlayStation platformer with the arcade con now on a quest to rescue his family and friends from Ghosts who saw fit to kidnap them all. And it’s Pac-Man’s birthday to boot!</p>
<p>So, what do you think of this month’s games?</p>
<h2>Can you still get the January 2025 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>You can still grab January’s titles up until the new set of game’s arrives on 4th February, so make sure to grab them while you can! They are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/05/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review/"><strong>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</strong></a> (PS5)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/08/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit-remastered-review/"><strong>Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit Remastered</strong></a> (PS4)</li>
<li><strong>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe</strong> (PS5 | PS4)</li>
</ul>

			<p>These rumors came after an awkward accident happened when sending around a marketing email regarding World of Warcraft's latest activities. However, the most surprising part that had people getting their hopes up was a link to join <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-app-to-come-to-select-lg-smart-tvs-ultimate-game-pass-subscribers-to-benefit/">Game Pass</a>, with a subject line that read as the following: "Play Call of Duty, Diablo IV, World of Warcraft, and more of Activision's biggest hits with Game Pass!" Screenshots of this email were posted on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1ic3q9w/gamepass_and_world_of_warcraft/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox subreddit</a>, where there is no denying World of Warcraft was added to the advertising, and it certainly didn't seem like it was accidentally, either.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Credit to sendcaffeineplz on Reddit.</figcaption></figure>
<p>With this email beginning to circulate, this led to a lot of excitement and buzz about the potential of World of Warcraft being added to Game Pass, and the wishes that the game would also be launching on console. However, hopes were quickly dashed by Microsoft, after they gave an official reply on X.</p>
<p>"This was a mistake on our end. Sorry for the confusion! Blizzard's World of Warcraft was accidentally included in a Game Pass email even though it's not available with the service - a correction email will be sent to those who got the original email soon."</p>
<p>Of course, the replies under this post were quickly filled with people pleading with Microsoft to just add World of Warcraft to Game Pass already, with some even saying that they've already tested the game on the controller and found that it worked just fine.</p>
<p>The images that were added to the promotion in this email were very suspicious, as it didn't appear to just be a case of accidentally mentioning the game. As seen on the Xbox subreddit, it included promo material for the Plunderstorm event, with art from World of Warcraft combined with the classic Xbox and Game Pass theming.</p>
<p>While it may seem that World of Warcraft isn't coming to Game Pass any time soon, the email definitely is suspicious and will most likely continue to cause a stir for a little while, despite Microsoft putting out their official reply.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gloomhaven-second-edition-delayed-due-to-production-issues.1095345/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/gloomhaven-second-edition-delayed-due-to-production-issues<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fans of <em>Gloomhaven</em> may need to wait longer for the latest edition. Cephalofair Games has announced a Gloomhaven Second Edition delay of several months to address production issues found with the <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/gloomhaven" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gloomhaven Game Page">Gloomhaven</a> </em>advance copies they received.</p>

<h2>The <em>Gloomhaven Second Edition</em> Delay</h2>

<p>In an update post <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/cephalofair/gloomhaven/updates/16229#top" rel="nofollow">on Backerkit</a>, Cephalofair explained the <em>Gloomhaven Second Edition</em> delay. According to them, they had advanced copies of the game ready as part of their first round of shipping via ocean freight. These were copies meant for the design team, some content creators, and different partners.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gloomhaven-second-edition-production-issue-artwork.jpg?itok=zY1sjdSo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gloomhaven-second-edition-production-issue-artwork.jpg?itok=tc04vskV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>These early copies contained significant production errors. They mention warped map boards and scenario trackers alongside poorly injected and assembled miniatures. These issues were not present in samples or pre-preproduction copies received ahead of mass production. Given the price point of <em>Gloomhaven</em>, and how much it relies on a variety of parts, these constituted major issues with the game.</p>

<p>Cephalofair has confirmed that these errors affected a significant amount of product and are in conversation with the production facility to correct these issues. The producer has acknowledged these errors and has committed with providing replacements.</p>

<p>Those replacements will take some time since the workers won't be back until mid-February due to Lunar New Year having everyone off for a while at the production facility. Not to mention the root cause of the mass production issues will need to be identified and addressed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We aren’t sure exactly how long it will end up being, but be assured that we and our production facility are determined to solve this problem quickly and efficiently.</p>

<p>Making this decision was genuinely heartbreaking, but we firmly believe it was ultimately the best call.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depending on how long <em>Gloomhaven Second Edition</em> is delayed, it may also face another challenge: the potential trade tariffs being proposed by US President Trump. As other developers <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/deep-regrets-developer-voices-potential-impact-of-imposing-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Deep Regrets Developer Voices Potential Impact of Imposed US Trade Tariffs">have expressed</a>, the vast majority of board production is done overseas in China, which can mean higher prices for all tabletop products in the United States if these tariffs are implemented. Previously Cephalofair had <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/cephalofair/gloomhaven/updates/13908#top" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Project Update: Tariffs and physical proofs of Gloomhaven ">expressed some concerns </a>about them, but were unable to say how it might impact them going forward.</p>

<p>Several Bend Studio contractors have reported on their LinkedIn profiles that they will no longer be working at Bend Studio from February 14.</p>



<p>The news comes just two weeks after it was reported that PlayStation had cancelled two of its live service projects, one of which was a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-live-service-games-cancelled-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live-service God of War game by Bend Studio</a>. </p>



<p>The number of those effected is currently unclear, but according to some posts, only a handful of contractors were given full-time opportunities, while others where let go.</p>



<p>Bend Studio’s game cancelled means that the studio has not published a game since Days Gone in 2019, which sold 7.32 million units by February 2022, a number obtained by the Insomniac Games leaks.</p>



<p>With current game development timelines, it means that almost certainly it will be a decade between Days Gone and whatever is next for Bend Studio.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear on if anyone at Bluepoint, another studio who faced a project cancelation has been effected.</p>



<p>What do you think Bend Studio will be working on next? Would you like to see Days Gone 2? Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-2-black-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">There is a moment near the end of Ninja Gaiden 2 Black where you retrace the original Ninja Gaiden’s opening level in reverse. I know that level like the back of my hand, having played it over and over and over again two decades ago on a demo disk until I could beat Murai, the first boss, without getting hit. And though you aren’t forced to go all the way to the beginning of that first stage here, this area isn't what it used to be. It’s dilapidated, rotting, falling apart; you can see the damage caused by time and the events of the first game clearly. Ninja Gaiden 2 Black never directly comments on this; Ryu doesn’t mention it, and the camera never pulls any tricks to call attention to it. It’s a moment of subtlety that's very un-Ninja Gaiden, but as I ran back through these familiar stomping grounds, I had an enormous smile on my face. Like this remake as a whole, it may not quite be what it once was, but slicing and dicing my way through it feels as good as ever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That moment is a good summary of Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, an Unreal Engine 5-powered remake of 2008's Ninja Gaiden 2, one of the Xbox 360 era’s definitive action games. Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is, according to Team Ninja, supposed to be the definitive edition of Ninja Gaiden 2, combining a stunning visual upgrade with several balance changes. Unfortunately, as good as 2 Black is – and let me state without equivocation this is a remarkable visual upgrade to an already excellent action game – it is not the end-all, be-all edition of Ninja Gaiden 2 that the Black moniker implies. Like many of the weapons Ryu wields, 2 Black is something of a double-edged sword. Its changes cut both ways.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But before we dig into what 2 Black isn't, let's talk about what it is. This is what I like to call an Action Jackson: a 3D beat-em-up with a hyperintense focus on combat above all else. Like previous versions, 2 Black takes place a year after the Xbox reboot of Ninja Gaiden. This time, the Black Spider Ninja Clan and Greater Fiends have formed an alliance to resurrect the Archfiend, and Dragon Ninja and ultimate badass Ryu Hayabusa is the only one who can stop them (though he does get a little help from his friends and the CIA). The story is more an excuse for you to travel the world, meet exciting and interesting monstrosities, ninjas, and Fiends, and turn them into limbless torsos than it is a fleshed-out narrative. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, I forgot how <em>funny</em> it is. Greater Fiends voiced by Steve Blum quote Shakespeare at you! You fight a lightning man on the Statue of Liberty! A giant, four-armed werewolf named Volf brings you to the colosseum in Venice, which is full of more werewolves, for a duel to the death, and he's like "do you want him to die?" and all the werewolves cheer, and then he's like "who do you want to kill him?" and then all the werewolves are like "Volf!" and he's like "Yes! I, Volf, will kill him!" and so you're just fighting a giant four-armed werewolf in the colosseum while a bunch of werewolves are cheering him on. This, folks, is the best camp this side of the river.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Even by genre standards, Ryu Hayabusa is a walking arsenal.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But you’re not here for that. You're here for the combat, and on that front, 2 Black delivers and then some. Ninja Gaiden 2's whole deal is that you can delimb enemies, cutting off arms, legs, and even heads as you rip through rooms, opening up anyone who is suddenly short a body part for an instant execution if they're still up and walking (or crawling) around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The downside is that enemies that are injured are even more dangerous. These dudes will jump on you, stab you, and blow themselves up to kill you. Unlike Devil May Cry or Bayonetta, Ninja Gaiden is not about styling on your enemies. It is about <em>surviving</em>. Your foes will not stand there and wait for you to attack them, nor will they do long, slow attacks with a noticeable windup. No, these dudes are fast, ferocious, and unrelenting, and they think you kicked their dog and are pretty sure you said something about their momma. They want you <em>dead.</em> </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The thing is, they’re up against Ryu Hayabusa. Ryu isn't your typical Action Jackson protag; the dude, even by genre standards, is a walking arsenal. By the end of the roughly 10-hour campaign, you're going to be walking around with no less than nine melee weapons, three ranged weapons, and four different flavors of fancy Ninja magic (Ninpo), and each melee weapon has a unique moveset with combos to learn and special techniques to master. You haven’t lived until you’ve decapitated someone with a Flying Swallow, used the Lunar Staff or Vigoorian Flail to combo half a dozen enemies at once, or pulled off the almighty Izuna Drop to slam a dude's head into the ground so hard that it explodes.</p><div id="rank-the-ninja-gaiden-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank the Ninja Gaiden games</h3><h3>Rank the Ninja Gaiden games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Ryu feels like a character from a fighting game. He has a complex moveset and combos to learn, the ability to block attacks and then sidestep or dodge backward, special moves and magic, and a unique counter-attack ability specific to each weapon that allows him to transition from defense to offense in the blink of an eye. Oh, and he's a Ninja, so he can do stuff like run up walls and leap down for a powerful blow, jump on his enemy’s heads, and leap forward and hurl them across the screen by the neck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In recent years, action games have leaned heavily on parries and invincibility-frames to get you out of trouble, but that's not how 2 Black operates. Ryu has excellent defensive tools, but Ninja Gaiden is about positioning, aggression, and mastery of both your weapons and slew of techniques. You are always moving, always looking for an opportunity to go on the offensive, and always prioritizing the biggest threat, whether it’s an injured enemy who might try to grab you, a caster hanging back to pepper you with spells, or an enormous werewolf looking to tear your face off and eat it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is a symphony of death and you are the conductor.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At its best, this is a symphony of death and you're the conductor, chaining together combos, dodging and counter-attacking, and using the Essence dropped by enemies to immediately charge your Ultimate Techniques, which are attacks so powerful that they can slice and dice an entire room. Ryu is always the coolest guy on screen, and when you’re cooking, the enemies throwing themselves at you to die give off that “surely I will be the guy that kills John Wick” vibe. When you’re not, you can die very, very quickly. You’re going to get good, or you're not going to progress.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not as unforgiving as it sounds. Save statues restore your entire health bars the first time you use them, and most of your life (minus a red section that grows over time as you take damage) is restored once you finish any given encounter. Even then, you've got items to fix that red section, heal you in a pinch mid-combat, and if all else fails, you can always kill more enemies and pray for blue Essence that will restore health. It’s never over until it's over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So it's a flawless combat system, right? Well… not quite. Just like in the original, the camera can be a little janky and get stuck in weird places from time to time. It's not too bad if you’re proactive about managing it and smart about how you approach fights, though it can have issues with tight corners and you will get hit off-screen every now and then. It’s an annoyance, but a minor one.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The other major problem is the quality of the boss encounters. Some of them like Volf are challenging, memorable, fun, or a combination of the three. But then there’s fights like the Water Dragon, a weird worm thing in the subway, or the Nuclear Armadillo (yes, really). And those… well, those kinda suck. Not because they’re hard, necessarily, but because they’re just plain not engaging to fight, force you to play in ways that zap the fun from Ninja Gaiden 2's combat system, or rely on some weird gimmick. Even some of the best fights can overstay their welcome with repeated re-runs. I mean, I love the Genshin fight, but did I really need to do it <em>four times</em>, especially when it doesn't change much during the rematches? How many times do I need to teach you this lesson, old man?!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Between fights, you'll get to explore each level, which are linear but still reward heading off the beaten path with health bonuses, Ninpo upgrades, Essence, and Crystal Skulls (Why was 2008 the year of the crystal skull?) that provide discounts at the shop. It’s here, in the stages themselves, that you see the depth of 2 Black’s visual upgrades. Yeah, the new character models look amazing (love the new hair, Sonia), but the lighting changes and texture upgrades really make these environments pop. Ninja Gaiden 2 has always been gorgeous, but it’s easy to forget how ambitious it was. These levels are <em>huge</em>, and occasional camera issues aside, the platforming sections are largely really enjoyable and provide some nice variety between combat encounters. I particularly like the one in the clock tower – running up walls and doing bird flips is fun! Who knew?</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The stages are where you can best see the visual upgrades.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">So overall, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is pretty great. If anything, though, its biggest flaw is that it's based more on the 2009 PlayStation 3 port Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 than it is the original 360 version. This is a little inside baseball, but bear with me for a second: For those who don't know, Ninja Gaiden 2 and Sigma 2 are very, <em>very </em>different. I'm not going to go into extreme depth here because there’s too much to list, but Sigma 2 added or removed certain bosses, costumes, and weapons, reworked levels, changed how weapon upgrades work, and even added three new characters (Rachel, Momiji, and Ayane) with their own story chapters. It’s… a lot. So much so that Team Ninja has even crafted <a href="https://teamninja-studio.com/ng2black/us/comparison/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a handy dandy comparison table</u></a> listing what's in all the different versions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The differences I really want to highlight, though, are the changes to enemy density and health, as they have the single biggest impact on how 2 Black actually plays. Compared to the original, Sigma 2 substantially reduced the number of enemies on-screen at once. There are dozens of enemies on iconic sections like The Stairs in the original release, so many that it could actually force the framerate into the single digits on Xbox 360. In 2 Black, you might get eight or so on screen at once in the same sequence. In exchange for sheer numbers, enemies in Sigma 2 (and thus, 2 Black) get more health and take longer to delimb, but are less aggressive. Even a Ninja Dog could tell you that these changes make combat worse. Environments are often empty and enemies feel spongy. Certain enemies, especially bigger ones like werewolves or the gargoyle-esque Van Gelfs (which are already immune to staple attacks like the Izuna Drop) take much, much longer to delimb and kill, making combat encounters with a lot of them drag.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Will's Favorite Action Games</h3><p>Rise of the Ronin is Team Ninja's latest foray into the action genre. Here's how it stacks up against my favorites.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I played 2 Black on the Path of the Acolyte difficulty (Normal) for this review because I figured it is what most people will play, though this was considered Easy in the original 360 release. After finishing it, I fired up the original Ninja Gaiden II on my Xbox Series X and played for a while on Path of the Warrior, which 2 Black lists as Hard and the original lists as Normal. Even on a higher difficulty, enemies died more quickly – I could often delimb or outright kill individual ninjas with a single attack from the Dragon Sword when it might take a full combo to do so in 2 Black – and it was exciting to fight more enemies on-screen at a time. Ninja Gaiden 2 just feels <em>faster</em> and <em>better</em> than Ninja Gaiden 2 Black. Ryu even seems to move through the environments more quickly, and it's more exciting to play as a result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2 Black's issues don't stop there. The combat changes from Sigma 2 also mean that enemies will sometimes block attacks in a combo after being hit or fall out of a combo mid-string. While this inconsistency does <em>technically</em> make 2 Black more like its predecessor, 2's combat system isn't built for it the way Ninja Gaiden Black’s is and it feels <em>bad</em> every time it happens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, however, 2 Black does do a lot right in addition to the visual upgrade. The higher level of gore from the original release is back, as is the weapon upgrade system. Sigma 2 just gives you free upgrades at certain points; in 2 Black and the original, you can buy upgrades at any shop with Essence, which you also spend on healing items. I challenged myself to play through 2 Black without using any healing or Ninpo restoration items unless I found one when I was already full up, so this didn't affect me a ton, but having upgrades cost Essence again is a good change because it forces you to choose between saving it to boost your weapons or spending it on items that will help you stay alive. Even intro screens before each mission resemble the more appealing ones from the original release more than Sigma 2. These things may feel minor, but they matter.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Enemies are spongier than in the original, but less than in Sigma 2.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">2 Black also smartly removes the not-great Giant Buddha Statue and Statue of Liberty (yes, really) boss fights that Sigma 2 added while retaining good additions like the Dark Dragon. And while enemies are still spongier than in the original, they do at least feel less spongy than Sigma 2 and there seem to be more of them. Still not quite as many as in the original, though without playing all three games back to back to back and counting corpses, it’s impossible to say.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And the good stuff from Sigma 2 is still here. I like the new levels with Rachel, Momiji, and Ayane. None of these characters have Ryu's expansive kit, so there isn’t as much depth to them, but they all feel unique and are fun to play as, especially in one-off chapters. This is still Ninja Gaiden, so they still look Like That (Ayane's costume is particularly silly), but 2 Black never treats them as anything less than Extremely Competent Action Girls and they're a nice change of pace, even if the transition from Ryu to them occasionally feels jarring from a story perspective.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finishing the campaign unlocks additional costumes for every character (though not as many as in Sigma 2, and even some of the costumes from the original are not present), which is neat. You’ll also open up Chapter Challenges if you wanna replay chapters and compete for a high score, though there aren't online leaderboards, and 2 Black does not bring back the original's New Game Plus mode. There’s the Formerly Co-op With Another Real Person But Now Only With an NPC Friend Tag Team Missions, too, if you’re looking for more to do, which is nice. And I also appreciate the return of Sigma 2's Hero difficulty, which is great for folks new to action games or who might need additional accessibility options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If I have one other complaint with 2 Black, it's that there are bugs here and there. It crashed on me once, had a few texture bugs in extremely funny places like The Stairs (if you know, you know), and once a door with some enemies (and goodies) behind it failed to open. The latter was, admittedly, really funny: I just heard rocket ninjas shooting at me from inside a train as I furiously tried to get in and kill them and they furiously tried to get out and kill me, but it did mean I had to restart from my last checkpoint to fix it.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is neither Ninja Gaiden 2 nor Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, but instead a secret third thing that mixes both versions together to create something that is wholly unique and by far the most beautiful version of this excellent action game yet. While I have a hard time calling it the definitive release because I prefer the original’s “more dudes who are more aggressive but die faster” approach, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is a definite improvement over the Sigma 2 release, fixes several long-standing issues, and unlike the original, isn’t trapped on the Xbox 360. It isn't the version I was hoping for (get on it, modders), but it is still an incredible game and I'm happy it exists. If this really is it for Ninja Gaiden 2, it will at least go out on a high note. This trip through time reminded me that while you can't go home again, and nothing will ever truly be like it was, that doesn't mean something can't still be beautiful. Ninja Gaiden 2 is remarkable, even with its flaws, and it's good to finally have it back in Black.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/sony-makes-psn-optional-on-pc-games-with-new-incentives-for-signing-in-spider-man-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has reversed course on one of their most unpopular policies, making having a PlayStation Network account optional on PC. Instead of requiring a PSN log in they will offer incentives for signing up or logging into an existing account.</p>
<p>The change has been made just in time for tomorrow’s release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/19/spider-man-2-swings-onto-pc-in-january-2025/">Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 for PC</a>, and will apply for The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered when that releases in April. It is also being rolled back to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-review/">God of War Ragnarok</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-launches-this-october-on-pc-and-ps5/">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered on PC</a>, with in-game content unlocks being added soon.</p>


<p>For the rest of the PlayStation Studios library on PC, games with online multiplayer modes will still require PSN – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/lego-horizon-adventures-review/">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> has online co-op, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/06/ghost-of-tsushima-is-coming-to-pc-in-may/">Ghost of Tsushima’s Legends mode</a> will still need PSN, but it is not needed for the single player. The exception to that is that the backlash to adding the requirement to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> was so severe that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/06/sony-backtracks-on-helldivers-2-pc-psn-requirement-may-6th-update-cancelled/">Sony backed down before implementing it</a>.</p>
<p>There’s another exception with the completely single-player Until Dawn remake. Hopefully that will be amended soon to have a more clear-cut policy.</p>
<p>Prior to making PSN mandatory last year, Sony had been giving bonus unlocks and content to those logging in – bonus costumes for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/05/horizon-forbidden-west-pc-specs-confirmed/">Horizon Forbidden West</a>, for example – and they’ve basically gone back to that plan.</p>

<p>Here’s what’s coming to the four games mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</strong> – Early unlock suits: the Spider-Man 2099 Black Suit and the Miles Morales 2099 Suit</li>
<li><strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong> – Gain access to the Armor of the Black Bear set for Kratos at the first Lost Items chest in the Realm Between Realms (previously only accessible in a New Game+ run) and a resource bundle (500 Hacksilver&nbsp;and 250 XP)</li>
<li><strong>The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</strong> – +50 points to activate bonus features and unlock extras, Jordan’s Jacket from Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet as a skin for Ellie</li>
<li><strong>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</strong> – Gain access to Nora Valiant outfit</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/first-details-emerge-on-upcoming-dungeons-dragons-video-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The upcoming Dungeons &amp; Dragons game has been unveiled, with Resolution Games showcasing DEMEO X Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked. This game has been made in collaboration between Resolution Games and Wizards of the Coast, to bring newcomers and veterans together to enjoy a world that will immerse you in the lore of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Resolution Games' has used its award-winning Demeo Action Roleplaying System to help create this title, to provide players with the atmosphere and intense battle they need to really fit into the world of D&amp;D. Below is the official announce trailer for the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked | Official Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cypwLhY8BP4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>"By leveraging the power of the Demeo system, Resolution Games is able to take a different approach to Dungeons &amp; Dragons by putting the emphasis on fast turn-based combat and pick-up-and-play mechanics," says Eugene Evans, SVP of Digital Strategy &amp; Licensing at Wizards of the Coast. "BATTLEMARKED continues <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-dragons-is-getting-another-videogame-while-hasbro-wont-finance-any-more-film-adaptations/">Hasbro's strategy</a> to leverage our extensive catalog of world-class IP to create digital games through licensing and internal studio development."</p>
<p>Compared to the typical Dungeons &amp; Dragons experience, DEMEO X Dungeons &amp; Dragons: BATTLEMARKED is a DM-less system with a focus on social strategy instead of focusing on social roleplay. Doing this encourages table talk that is focused on tactics and decision-making rather than building a personality for the characters in roleplay situations.</p>
<p>DEMEO X Dungeons &amp; Dragons: BATTLEMARKED will support cross-platform co-op play of up to four players, with two story-based campaigns when the game launches, with additional campaigns in a variety of D&amp;D settings to be planned as downloadable content in the future.&nbsp; This game will be available on multiple platforms when it's released. For now, you can keep up to date by keeping your eye on <a href="https://battlemarked.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their website</a>, where they will release information accordingly.</p>
<p>"With the launch of Demeo back in 2021, we began to grow an incredible relationship with the D&amp;D player community. Demeo and Demeo Battles quickly became a game night substitute for Dungeon Masters who wanted an out-of-campaign way to have fun with their groups and for D&amp;D players to introduce their friends and family to tabletop miniatures games," says Tommy Palm, Founder and CEO of Resolution Games.</p>
<p>Demeo is still incredibly popular and used frequently, and if you haven't already, you can try out <a href="https://www.resolutiongames.com/demeo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demeo</a> and <a href="https://www.resolutiongames.com/demeobattles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demeo Battles</a> on most gaming devices.</p>

			<p>A new trailer has dropped for Phantom Line, which is set to be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-line-is-a-stunning-paranormal-swat-co-op-tactical-fps-by-ex-cyberpunk-2077-and-bioshock-developers/">1-4 player co-op shooter</a> that takes place in a post-nuclear European continent. However, it's not your average shooter, as you will be tasked with searching for anomalies. Anomalies are paranormal activities that are hidden from the public eye. You have to find them while searching an open-world map where many dynamic events will take place to shake up the gameplay.</p>
<p>In this title, you work as an elite spec-op unit for Mortfield Industries. You've been chosen for the Operator Simulation Program called H.U.S.K, where you can take your consciousness and place it into an artificial body. By doing so, you can use the H.U.S.K.s to your advantage, using them to scout the area, distract enemies, be a decoy, and many other tactics that can help you survive while tracing the anomalies.</p>
<p>This is all taking place in a world where Nuclear war has just broken out, and you are sent off to the Iron Corridor, which is an Eastern European area that has been devastated by international tensions. In order to survive, you need to be able to be self-sufficient and improvise when the situation arises. This includes using resources around you, getting better gear, as well as hunting and cooking animals to make sure that you stay healthy on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Below is a trailer for Phantom Line, where you can see all the action unfold. Additionally, if you're interested in playtesting this game, you can do so by joining <a href="https://discord.com/invite/uHheyk2PBA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their Discord</a>, where you will be able to receive a key and try the game out for yourself.</p>
<p><iframe title="Phantom Line - New Playtest Available NOW" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AYJk7C22eeo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As well as fighting off enemies and trying to find anomalies, there will also be an Icebreaker ship that will serve as your base. From here, you will be able to customize your H.U.S.K., as well as your cabin, where you can show off all of your weapons and armor to your friends. This will also be the place where you can modify your loadout, including your gear and body.</p>
<p>At the moment, there is no set release date for Phantom Line, and they are still working on getting the game to run at a stable 30fps at 1080p. You can keep up to date with the team via Discord or the updates they post on Steam by wishlisting the game if this is something you are interested in.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mtg-aetherdrift-commander-living-energy-review-and-upgrades.1095288/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/aetherdrift-commander-living-energy-review-and-upgrades<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Start your engines! The first tentpole release for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/everything-coming-to-magic-gathering-in-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Everything Coming to Magic: The Gathering in 2025"><em>Magic: The Gathering </em>in 2025 </a>is here with <em>Aetherdrift</em><em>, </em>and we're racing to take a look at one of the preconstructed decks. This <em>Living Energy </em>review will examine it and answer what is it, is it worth buying, and if you do buy itm what are some cards you can look to add to it.</p>

<h2>Living Energy Review</h2>

<p><em>Living Energy </em>is the third energy deck set to be released in less than a year, but it is the first of those in Temur (green/blue/red) colors. The deck is also meant to capture some of the mechanical identity of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/aetherdrift-brings-wacky-races-and-new-name-for-old-plane-to-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Aetherdrift Brings Wacky Races and New Name for an Old Plane to Magic: The Gathering">Avishkar (the plane formerly known as Kaladesh</a>) that the main set wasn't able to due to its focus on the race across three planes.</p>

<p><em>Living Energy </em>showcases well known characters of Avishkar like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/3/saheeli-radiant-creator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Saheeli, Radiant Creator">Saheeli</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/2/pia-nalaar-chief-mechanic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pia Nalaar, Chief Mechanic">Pia Nalaar</a>. While there is a primary focus on energy in <em>Living Energy</em> as the name implies there are also subthemes in the deck of artifacts, and thopters that fit that Avishkar mechanical identity role, while synergizing well with the rest of the deck.</p>

<p>As far as play goes, <em>Living Energy </em>plays very ramp heavy. With 15 different pieces of ramp or mana fetch, along with 38 lands and a few ways to cheat out spells, it’s built to ramp to high mana values and take over the game with big spells. It shows in the deck’s aspirational mana curve, and average mana value of 3.64. which is higher than you typically want to see.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/academy-ruins-elder-gargaroth-and-retrofitter-foundry.jpg?itok=kw6z9F9m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/academy-ruins-elder-gargaroth-and-retrofitter-foundry.jpg?itok=OaOCohjQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Valuewise, there are some notable cards included in <em>Living Energy</em>. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/309/academy-ruins" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Academy Ruins">Academy Ruins </a>runs for $15-$20 and is the most expensive card in the deck. After that you have <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/111/elder-gargaroth" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Elder Gargaroth">Elder Gargaroth </a>which is also over $10, while there’s a set of highly playable cards in the $5-$9 range including <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/136/retrofitter-foundry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Retrofitter Foundry">Retrofitter Foundry</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/55/lightning-greaves" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Lightning Greaves">Lightning Greaves</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/135/panharmonicon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Panharmonicon">Panharmonicon</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/143/triplicate-titan" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Triplicate Titan">Triplicate Titan</a>. From a <em>Living Energy</em> review perspective, this is good, but not phenomenal value.</p>

<h3>Living Energy Commanders Review</h3>

<p><em>Living Energy</em> comes with two commander options, both of which are among the new cards for the deck. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/3/saheeli-radiant-creator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Saheeli, Radiant Creator">Saheeli, Radiant Creator</a> is the face commander, and is a 4 mana 4/4 with a pair of important abilities. Her first ability is that she gives energy whenever you play an artifict or artificer, similar to <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/3/dr-madison-li" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dr Madison Li">Dr. Madison Li </a>from the <em>Fallout</em> <em>Science!</em> deck. Setting her apart though is her second ability, where you spend three energy to make a 5/5 token copy of any permanent you control until end of turn.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/saheeli-and-pia-nalaar.jpg?itok=DmPMkYrX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/saheeli-and-pia-nalaar.jpg?itok=f07_1Ja0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The alternate commander is <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/2/pia-nalaar-chief-mechanic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pia Nalaar, Chief Mechanic">Pia Nalaar, Chief Mechanic</a>. A 3 mana 2/4, she gets down early, and generates 2 energy whenever artifact creatures deal combat damage to a player, encouraging an artifact creature heavy deck that is more aggressive. Like Saheeli she has a second ability, where at the end of turn you can spend any amount of energy, to make a vehicle token with power and toughness equal to the energy spent, and crew 2</p>

<p>While <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/2/pia-nalaar-chief-mechanic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pia Nalaar, Chief Mechanic">Pia Nalaar</a> has potential in more aggressive decks, she’s much narrower that <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/3/saheeli-radiant-creator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Saheeli, Radiant Creator">Saheeli</a>, and <em>Living Energy</em> is built to work with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/3/saheeli-radiant-creator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Saheeli, Radiant Creator">Saheeli </a>in charge. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/2/pia-nalaar-chief-mechanic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pia Nalaar, Chief Mechanic">Pia Nalaar</a> still works as an energy creator and sink in a <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/3/saheeli-radiant-creator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Saheeli, Radiant Creator">Saheeli </a>deck, so unlike some commander decks, the two options work together here.</p>

<h2>Cards To Upgrade Your MTG Living Energy Commander Deck</h2>

<p>If you purchase <em>Living Energy</em> it should be playable at casual tables, but there’s definite room for upgrades. Taming the deck’s manacurve, and focusing on making the most out of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/3/saheeli-radiant-creator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Saheeli, Radiant Creator">Saheeli</a> are our major focuses here..</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/62/the-motherlode-excavator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Motherlode, Excavator"><strong>The Motherlode, Excavator</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-motherlode-excavator.jpg?itok=1Ph-CRDH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-motherlode-excavator.jpg?itok=8Rdq8sTn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>From the <em>Science!</em> commander deck, The Motherlode is an energy generator, solid sized creature, and has the ability to take care of disruptive non-basic lands. When it does that, it also removes makes that players non-flyers unable to block until end of turn, opening up that opponent for an alpha strike.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/clb/63/displacer-kitten" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Displacer Kitten"><strong>Displacer Kitten</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/displacer-kitten.jpg?itok=pWwK0Eu9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/displacer-kitten.jpg?itok=OuFICsEw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Providing some redundancy for our commander, Displacer Kitten takes advantage of all the enters the battlefield effects in the dec by blinking them in and out of existance. The Displacer Kitten can blink any non-land permanent you control, so there’s lot of flexibility in it’s use.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/67/roil-cartographer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Roil Cartographer"><strong>Roil Cartographer</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/roil-cartographer.jpg?itok=8ggYPrEr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/roil-cartographer.jpg?itok=xdPkPVcr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>An odd omission from the deck, Roil Cartographer is from <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> and will join with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/13/nissa-worldsoul-speaker" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Nissa, Worldsoul Speaker">Nissa, Worldsoul Speaker</a> to provide energy on each land drop. The cartographer can drop on turn 2, and later on it can trade in energy for cards.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/142/unstable-amulet" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Unstable Amulet"><strong>Unstable Amulet</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/unstable-amulet.jpg?itok=VZAme-Vb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/unstable-amulet.jpg?itok=XUBpnsME 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Another area the deck is a bit light in is card advantage, so Unstable Amulet provides an early drop that can create some energy, do occasional chip damage, and essentially draw a card for two energy.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/191/izzet-generatorium" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Izzet Generatorium Card"><strong>Izzet Generatorium</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/izzet-generatorium.jpg?itok=kO_JtW2T 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/izzet-generatorium.jpg?itok=tfhh5o-B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Another two-drop option, Izzet Generatorium creates an additional energy anytime you make one, and lets you draw a card on any turn you’ve used at least 4 energy.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/38/robobrain-war-mind" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Robobrain War Mind"><strong>Robobrain War Mind</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/robobrain-war-mind.jpg?itok=G9HKYWJW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/robobrain-war-mind.jpg?itok=p8b-kIMe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Also from the <em>Fallout Science!</em> deck, Robobrain War Mind generates you a bunch of energy, draws cards on attack, and gets bigger as you have more cards in hand.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/308/wurmcoil-engine" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Wurmcoil Engine"><strong>Wurmcoil Engine</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wurmcoil-engine.jpg?itok=KVSwIav2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wurmcoil-engine.jpg?itok=Hn3I5UCD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Instead of some of the pricer options in the deck, I would purpose Wurmcoil Engine is a very good option with being a 6/6 for 6 with useful abilities, who creates tokens when it dies. It’s a perfect target to copy with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/3/saheeli-radiant-creator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Saheeli, Radiant Creator">Saheeli</a>, swinging for 6, gaining 6 life, and leaving you two 3/3s behind.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/moc/373/scrap-trawler" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Scrap Trawler"><strong>Scrap Trawler</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/scrap-trawler.jpg?itok=VOKQtFkB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/scrap-trawler.jpg?itok=t_1zf7z4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Scrap Trawler leans into the artifact and sacrifice side of the deck, by turning all your deck artifacts into resurrection spells. Since <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/3/saheeli-radiant-creator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Saheeli, Radiant Creator">Saheeli</a>’s ability makes copies, those copies also have the originals mana value, meaning you can grab pricey artifacts from the graveyard, along with cheap ones.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/104/electrosiphon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Electrospiphon"><strong>Electrosiphon</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/electrosiphon.jpg?itok=rlw4MFP- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/electrosiphon.jpg?itok=DvfpgGDh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Let’s keep drawing on that <em>Fallout </em>precon, this time with the best energy counterspell. While 3 mana is more than ideally you spent on a counter, the ability to get a bunch of energy from it makes it worthwhile in Electrosiphon’s case.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m3c/106/aether-refinery" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Aether Refinery"><strong>Aether Refinery</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aether-refinery.jpg?itok=s8dT4i5_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aether-refinery.jpg?itok=g9oacRhA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>You can put <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/216/doubling-season" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Doubling Season">Doubling Season </a>in this spot too, but Aether Refinery is a lot cheaper moneywise, and does what you’re wanting, while providing an energy outlet for big tokens. Given the deck's energy hunger, adding some explosive energy generation seems useful.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>If you want to see what the deck might look like with those 10 cards added, I’ve put it up on Archidekt, with 10 potential cuts that you can <a href="https://archidekt.com/decks/11071535/living_energy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Living Energy Upgraded">see here</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, our <em>Living Energy </em>review finds it is a slow, rampy deck with a lot of synergy and a number of different ways you can customize it. With <em>Modern Horizons 3 </em>energy theme, two other commander decks in slightly different colors that use energy in the past year, the cards for this archtype are as cheaply available as they’ll be right now.</p>

We’ll go through all of them, but I did want to specifically shout out the Dialga and Palkia full-art cards, which are both homages to previous cards featuring the god-like dragons in the Astral Radiance packs. Both cards also have “immersive” animations of the sort featured on rare cards in <em>Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</em> that give you a new perspective on the artwork.</p><p>Click through to see all the full-art cards, and if you want to see every card in the set, you can check out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/01/all-space-time-smackdown-cards-officially-revealed-from-pocket&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/01/all-space-time-smackdown-cards-officially-revealed-from-pocket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PokéBeach’s</em></a></span> round-up of all 207. Also, it’s a shame this art isn’t available on physical cards. Sure, it would defeat the appeal of a separate app to collect on, but I would buy that Palkia card in a heartbeat. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="af6cee377b269a62094d7ad788805382"

We are taking this opportunity between full development cycles to reimagine how we work at BioWare.</p><p>Given this stage of development, we don’t require support from the full studio. We have incredible talent here at BioWare, and so we have worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit.</p></blockquote><p>Asked for comment, a spokesperson for EA declined to elaborate further. “The studio’s priority was <em>Dragon Age</em>,” they wrote in an email to <em>Kotaku</em>. “During this time there were people continuing to build the vision for the next <em>Mass Effect</em>.

EA declined to say how many people BioWare still employs. “While we’re not sharing numbers, the studio has the right number of people in the right roles to work on<em> Mass Effect </em>at this stage of development,” the spokesperson wrote in the email to <em>Kotaku</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN </em>reports</a></span> that while some employees were moved to other projects within EA, some staff who had been working on <em>The Veilguard </em>were laid off.</p><p>Today’s announcement comes roughly a week after former BioWare producer Mark Darrah released a YouTube video in which he talked about his old studio only having one game to focus on for the first time in decades. Little is known about <em>Mass Effect 5</em>, including its official title. It was first teased <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-teaser-n7-day-andromeda-1850999958&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-teaser-n7-day-andromeda-1850999958">back at The Game Awards 2020</a></span> and was later confirmed to be a sequel of sorts to the original trilogy. </p><p>Darrah called the process of BioWare finding out it can’t work on more than one game at a time “painful” but also suggested the downsizing could have a silver lining for<em> Mass Effect</em>. “This might be great because what it means is that BioWare, for the first time really ever, is able to singularly focus on a single project, is able to put all of its attention on a single project, is able to put everything it has towards a single goal, which is making the best <em>Mass Effect</em> it possibly can.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sony is dropping its formerly mandatory PlayStation Network account requirements across a select number of its predominantly single-player titles on PC - but it's introducing in-game content "benefits" as an incentive to continue using one.
</p>
<p>
Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">faced a major backlash last May</a> when it announced it would be retroactively making PSN accounts mandatory for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> on PC - and while it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">eventually relented</a>, that hasn't stopped it from requiring PSN accounts to play an increasing number of its PC ports since then. It's a move that's proven contentious among PC players, particularly given its original justification for PSN accounts on PC - to ensure the "safety and security" of online play - is considerably less convincing when many affected titles are single-player games.
</p>
<p>
But now, Sony has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/new-in-game-content-incentives-coming-to-playstation-games-on-pc/">announced</a> something of a U-turn, confirming it'll be removing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-is-the-latest-playstation-game-to-require-a-psn-account-on-pc">mandatory PSN account requirements</a> from a number of its previously released and upcoming PC titles: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarok</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Remastered, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> (which launches this week), and The Last of US Part 2 Remastered (currently due in April).

<p>
In all four cases, PlayStation Network accounts will become "optional", but Sony is still eager enough for players to sign up and log into PSN that it's announced a new in-game content unlock initiative coming "soon" to the above games on PC.
</p><p>
Players that sign into a PlayStation Network account for Marvel's Spider-Man 2, for instance, will unlock the Spider-Man 2099 Black Suit and the Miles Morales 2099 Suit early. PSN accounts will also grant access to the Nora Valiant outfit in Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered.
</p>
<p>
Over in God of War Ragnarok, a PSN account lets players unlock Kratos' Armour of the Black Bear set at the first Lost Items chest in the Realm Between Realms rather than waiting until New Game Plus, and there's also a resource bundle containing 500 Hacksilver and 250 XP.
</p>
<p>
As for The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered, a PSN account unlocks an Ellie skin inspired by Jordan's jacket in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-announces-all-new-ip-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Naughty Dog's upcoming Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, as well as 50 additional points to activate bonus features and unlock extras.
</p>
<p>
Sony hasn't yet said if it'll be making PSN accounts optional for all its all future single-player-focused PC releases (or if the changes mean impacted games will now be available in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">territories without PSN</a>), but it did confirm more PSN incentives are on the way. "Game creators at PlayStation Studios will continue to work on bringing more benefits to players who sign up for a PSN account," it wrote, "so be sure to follow studio channels for more information."

There are all kinds of healthy ways you can deal with this–friends and family, exercise, eating right, getting sleep–but you can also click compulsively around the internet looking for something to press the “maybe everything isn’t the worst” button in your brain. To aid you in the latter, I present: deer cam.</p><p>I’m not sure why YouTube dropped “Brownville's Food Pantry For Deer” in front of me, but I’m glad it did. It’s a livestream of some deer-feeding troughs in Brownville, Maine, filled with acorns, apples, and oats, according to <a href="https://www.newscentermaine.com/article/life/animals/wildlife/brownville-food-pantry-for-deer-viewers-livestream-maine-wildlife/97-0cef22e5-bbe1-41dd-9953-9f83605f357f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">News Center Maine</a>. The livestream runs 24/7, with this year’s beginning on “December 16th and end[ing] when natural browse is easily available at the end of the winter season,” according to the channel description.&nbsp;</p><p>The basic premise is simple: The deer come and eat the food, and you watch them. There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BrownvillesFoodPantryForDeer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple cameras</a> that focus on the troughs, a trail, a pond, and more. (There’s also a “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47dcM4M16Ic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bird buffet</a>” camera, which is the same thing, but for birds.) Every stream has a chat, where viewers have nicknamed the deer things like Star, Oreo, and Mr. Floof, and are also talking about the weather.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Brownville's Food Pantry For Deer &quot;Trough View&quot;" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ASu9sqOT_Xk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>My favorite part, besides looking at the deer who look way too soft for animals I am not touching, is the sound: In the trough view right now, the deer are crunching away at their food, nosing around for the best goodies and doing that “looking around while chewing with their mouth open” thing animals sometimes do. They stomp around in the snow and snort, and it sounds like you’re right there with them instead of, if you’re me, sitting alone in your New York City apartment with your brain crawling after a morning spent listening to <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/01/rfk-jr-confirmation-hearing-vaccines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RFK Jr</a> talk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrPEQOg864I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WABI TV</a> says the Food Pantry is run by the McMahon family, who are in their 16th season of feeding the deer to “help restore herd numbers” in their area. The McMahons feed the deer “approximately 700 pounds of oats daily,” which WABI says can cost up to $20,000 a year. Randy McMahon, who operates the Food Pantry, told News Center Maine, “The revenue we get from our YouTube channel helps up immensely. Without YouTube, we wouldn't be able to afford what we are doing.” There are multiple ways viewers can donate, and also a merch store.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/narrative-designer-job-description-video-games"><h3>Just What, Exactly, Does A Video Game’s Narrative Designer Do?</h3></a><p>'I think the largest&nbsp;misconception&nbsp;is that we're just writers'</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In the latest BioWare update on the development of the next Mass Effect stage, the developer says it does not “require support from the full studio,” and has moved several employees to other teams at Electronic Arts. While the developer says it is reimaging how the company works, it still touts the leadership of veterans of the original trilogy.</p>



<hr>



<p>Following the release of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, a “core team at BioWare” is hard at work on the next Mass Effect game, the company <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2023/08/23/an-update-on-the-state-of-bioware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote in a blog post</a> today. However, an unclear number of employees have been moved to “other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit.” IGN has also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that a small number of Dragon Age team members have had their roles terminated.</p>



<p>In their post, BioWare highlighted members of the veteran leadership leading production on the next Mass Effect game:</p>



<ul>
<li>Michael Gamble: Manager and Producer on Mass Effect 2, Mass Effect 3, and Andromeda.</li>



<li>Preston Watamaniuk: Lead Designer on the original trilogy.</li>



<li>Parrish Ley: Cinematic Animator for the original trilogy.</li>



<li>Derek Watts: Art Director for the original trilogy.</li>
</ul>



<p>Many believe this next Mass Effect title is a make-or-break release for BioWare. Dragon Age: The Veilguard went through a lengthy, turbulent development cycle, and despite some critical success, the 1.5 million copies sold was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-says-dragon-age-the-veilguard-didnt-meet-revenue-expectations/">half of what Electronic Arts expected</a>. This combined with EA Sports FC 25 missing internal expectations resulted in a massive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-stock-drops-17-percent/">17% drop in EA’s stock value</a>. Veilguard’s game director Corrine Busch <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-the-vielguards-game-director-has-reportedly-left-bioware/">left the company earlier this month</a>, after 18 years with the company.</p>
