			<p>Evolution comes slowly in nature, but in technology it can often come all at once.&nbsp;Since Atari proliferated the joystick, and Nintendo got the D-Pad right on the first go, we’ve got used to the status quo of how we interact with our games over the past fifty years. Now though, Victrix are bringing evolution to the arcade stick, by… getting rid of the stick.</p>
<p><iframe title="Victrix™ Pro KO™ Leverless Fight Stick by Turtle Beach®" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ld7W4CUzCsM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Have you ever tried to rewrite your brain? That’s what using the Victrix Pro KO Leverless feels like if you’re coming to it after years of using a regular arcade stick. Like the deeply unusual <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/22/azeron-cyborg-gaming-keypad-review/">Azeron Cyborg</a>, Victrix are rewriting how we interact with games. Leverless sticks have been around for a while, but this is their first true foray into the mainstream thanks to Victrix’s newfound role as one of Turtle Beach’s subsidiaries.</p>


<p>The Pro KO Leverless Fight Stick has an RRP of £229.99 and comes in one colour scheme: black. While our review unit was an Xbox Series, Xbox One and PC compatible edition, there’s also a PS5/PS4/PC-flavoured one as well. In the box is the unit itself, a 3-metre braided cable in Victrix’s trademark purple, a fabric carry bag with the Victrix logo, and a breakaway USB-C adaptor to prevent any unwanted mishaps when someone trips over your cable.</p>
<p>One of the most surprising things when you first take the Pro KO Leverless out of the box is just how slim it is. With a super slim profile, it’s vastly thinner than Victrix’s headline Pro Arcade line or indeed any other major fight stick on the market. Despite its size, there’s still a decent heft to it, which you can probably attribute to the anodised aluminium body.</p>


<p>The underside is wholly covered by a chunky rubber grip plate, once again in vibrant Victrix purple, and there’s then a series of release catches so you can pop the top plate off to reveal the inner workings of the stick. It’s worth noting that the underside is more or less completely flat, and there’s no raised or lowered areas to reduce the grippy surface making contact with the table. The Pro KO Leverless certainly isn’t going anywhere once you put it on a table, and without the added leverage of an actual stick, it stays put on your lap too.</p>
<p>Underneath the metal case is an exciting builder’s kit of stick parts, and it’s refreshingly easy to customise the Pro KO Leverless when you compare it to other sticks. There’s a set of tongs to pull the buttons, switches, and their surrounds out from the housing, as well as four additional switch internals and the requisite button units.</p>
<p>There’s four circular cover plates, so you can block off up to four of the button spaces, or you can run with anything up to a full complement of 16 inputs. Because of those cover plates and the spare buttons included, you can design your own personal layout and then easily implement it. Don’t like it? Simply try something else. It takes moments to unhook the front cover and a couple of seconds to pull each of the buttons out. It’s satisfying and slick and makes the Pro KO Leverless incredibly easy to live with. There’s no wiring, no soldering, and no worrying with the Pro KO.</p>

<p>The other neat little feature is a locking mechanism for the cable connection. A spring-loaded door opens on the rear of the stick and then cradles the cable once you’ve inserted it. With this setup, you won’t have to worry about it coming loose mid-tournament and suffering the indignation of defeat when Ken simply stops moving.</p>
<p>Alternatively, when you’re at home you can add the breakaway attachment so if someone trips over the cable, it won’t rip your £230 fight stick out of your lap. Everywhere you look, the Pro KO Leverless shows signs of intelligent design and thoughtful implementation, and it makes for a great user experience.</p>
<p>At first, interacting with the Pro KO Leverless is more akin to typing on a laptop than using a fight stick. Your left hand utilises the four directional inputs, while your right rests over the eight traditional input buttons. The Cherry MX Speed Silver buttons feel fantastic beneath your fingers, with a good range of travel and you get a reassuringly solid response from each activation.</p>
<p>The top row of buttons gives you access to the traditional Xbox Home, Menu, Options, and Share inputs, while adding in additional access such as muting chat from a headset connected via the 3.5mm socket or altering the RGB lighting. There’s also the tournament-required toggle to lock all of these buttons off, so you don’t pause your opponent to death.</p>

<p>Each of the button surrounds can light up in a variety of hues thanks to the inclusion of RGB. We can all agree that this makes any gaming device better, and here you can choose between a host of colours and different effects directly on the stick, including one of the ugliest setups I’ve ever seen where the buttons are all different colours. I opted for solid purple, because, well, it’s a Victrix stick, and because it looks cool.<br>
If you want to go even deeper, there’s the Victrix Control Hub app, which lets you dig into the lighting even further, as well as update your stick’s firmware and more.</p>
<p>I think I’m a leverless convert. My traditional arcade stick skills have never fully eclipsed my ability with a controller, despite years of trying, and the Pro KO Leverless feels far more intuitive than I could have ever expected. After adjusting to the different way of interacting with my games, I think my reaction times are vastly improved, and aside from that, I haven’t experienced the same level of fatigue from long sessions as I did with a traditional stick.</p>
<p>The Pro KO Leverless won’t be for everybody, and if you’re looking for one of the absolute best fight sticks on the market, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/18/pdp-victrix-pro-fs-best-arcade-fight-stick-ps5-review/">Victrix’s Pro Arcade fight stick</a> is a delight to own. There is also a leverless version if you want the top-end leverless experience, but it’s a further £100, and far bigger and bulkier than the Pro KO. Alternatively, the Razer Kitsune is Razer’s entry in the leverless category, and can be found on sale for around the same price as the Pro KO. However, you lose the button customisation of the Pro KO, which feels essential. You do gain Chroma RGB around the edges though, and you can buy official vinyl skins as well.</p>

            <p>I'm thankfully very remote from the capital these days, but Edwin will occasionally regale the morning meeting with dark fables about how much a pint now costs in London. He'll stumble on to camera, his eyes bloodshot and breathing heavy, and we'll all know he's traded a new vital organ for a swift half. Occasionally he'll dart his head around to the sound of banging at the door then immediately dive out of the window, and we'll pray for his safe return after outrunning The Bad Teapot gang, who he borrowed £8000 from in 2006 for a warm plastic beaker of Carling with a dead wasp floating in it. Sounds bleak down there.</p>
<p>As such, I would not blame anyone south of the Severn-Wash for resorting to the stealth <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle </a>drink stealing antics we find in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sipssassin">Sipssassin</a>. You play a bald, sharply dressed sneak thief. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to never pay for another drink as long as you live. There are some nonsense lore reasons about why it's actually good and cool that you're half-inching everyone's tipples but that just makes it less fun, honestly. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>Many classic stealth tricks are available to you. Disguising yourself as a security guard. Hiding in a cardboard box. Burying yourself in a ridiculously-placed hay bale. Putting a moose head over your victim's eyes so they can't see you pinch their margarita. As with classic Hitman, there are also a selection of mundane objects to bonk people with, stunning them so you can make a getaway. You're not confined to just Agent 47's disappointing son, either. You'll also unlock other characters, one of which is Agent 47's much less disappointing son, a horrible goose.</p>
<p>There are four game modes in all. 'Sipstraction' tasks you simply with stealing six drinks then scoring you on how many times you were discovered. In 'Happy Hour' you'll need to combo guzzle as many ill-gotten bevvies as possible in a two minute time limit. 'Drinkvesitage' involves a "special tracking activity", and there's also an exploration free roam mode, where you'll take on side quests and meet characters. I'll let good mate <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2820190/Sipssassin/">Steam</a> describe the features. That's just good business sense, that.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>25 playable characters to unlock</li>
<li>5 unique missions with hidden secrets</li>
<li>4 distinct game modes to prove your Sipssassin abilities</li>
<li>Over 60 different drinks to drink</li>
<li>Lots of NPCs to steal drinks from</li>
<li>6 Legendary Drinks that grant special power up abilities</li>
<li>6 Special Gadgets that help you be a sneaky little guy</li>
<li>50 collectible shards to find and rebuild the Chalice of Destiny</li>
<li>Disguises to gain access to restricted areas</li>
<li>Wacky characters to meet and talk to</li>
<li>An alternate dimension video game conference called "Yeet3"</li>
<li>A super long straw so you can drink your neighbor's milkshake</li>
<li>Fun</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Sipsassin is due out on May 2nd, 2025. No price details, yet. Slightly more than a wasp pint, presumably.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>15 years on from the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metro-2033">Metro 2033</a>, I still think with fondness and yearning of the Uboinik automatic shotgun. It’s a six chamber cylindrical affair with mouthwatering red shells that dangle before your trigger finger like pert, juicy plums. This is just to say / I have shot / the shells / that were in / the shotgun / and which / you were probably / saving / for the mutant round the corner. / Forgive me / they were murderous / so sockety / and so round. Ahem.</p>
<p>Reloading the shotgun is an intricate process of 1) sliding four shells into the available chambers while tossing the weapon jauntily from hand to hand, and then 2) cocking it again to expose and fill the remaining two chambers. You can also chamber a single shell and cock the weapon, if you don’t have time for a full reload, which means when you load another four shells and fire them, there’ll be an empty chamber to reckon with midway through the next burst. That empty chamber has gotten me killed a dozen times, I think.</p><!--more-->

<p>Somebody poured love into that reloading animation. Love and a certain spitefulness. This is Metro 2033, 4A Games’s spiritual successor to S.T.A.L.K.E.R., which takes place in the Moscow underground after the nukes. Ammo is also currency here, and the dingy rails teem with bandits and mutants. There is no time to get poetic about shotguns. Today, 15th April, you can experience all that love and spitefulness for free. The Redux edition is 100% off on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/metro_2033_redux">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/286690/Metro_2033_Redux/">Steam</a> till tomorrow to mark the game’s 15th birthday.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-metro-2033">the RPS review of the original Metro 2033</a>, Alec Meer (RPS in peace) was wooed but not wowed, calling attention to “a jarring disconnect between the excellence of its appearance and the adequacy of its action. 

"It’s a good enough shooter, but it looks like it should be a phenomenal one,” he went on. “In a perfect world, there’ll be a mod that fiddles with the balance, maybe ups the human count and lowers the mutant count, and definitely leaves a few more gas masks lying around.” </p>
<p>The 2014-released Redux version <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/metro-redux-review">adds a bunch of modes and graphics features</a>: as Christopher Livingston summarised, “if you enjoyed Metro 2033, I strongly suspect you'll like it even more on the new engine, especially since the options for a grueling, hardcore experience are still there despite the revamped stealth and improved AI making things a little easier for you.”</p>
<p>The typical question to ask of any 4A Games news piece is: which 4A Games, exactly? The studio began life in Ukraine in 2006, but in 2014, a portion of the team split off to found a new studio in Malta. While they've collaborated on Metro for years, the two studios are now totally separate: 4A Games in Ukraine have rebranded as Reburn, and are now developing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/la-quimera">La Quimera</a>, while Metro remains in the hands of the Malta studio, who are still owned by Embracer.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A shining beacon of indie ingenuity that proves the only thing you need to achieve global stardom as a lone developer is a singular vision and the willpower to execute.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That would be a colossal misconception.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During a recent chat with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> publisher Playstack, communications director Wout van Halderen explains that when the company first tweeted about signing the project two years ago the post received a mere smattering of likes. In short: nobody cared.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He says the company still jokes internally about the narrative that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> essentially materialized out of thin air when the publisher spent months carefully constructing a "Wheel of Attention" to give the project the&nbsp;best chance of success. What appears like a sudden ascent to fame and fortune was actually the result of a painstakingly intentional marketing campaign that acknowledged the title's weaknesses and played to its strengths.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How do you sell a game that shines brightest in the hands of players?">How do you sell a game that shines brightest in the hands of players?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">PlayStack marketing director Liz Cheng-Moore recalls how finagling a marketing strategy for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was "tricky" because, although the title seems to click with players when they're able to go hands-on, the UI-heavy visuals and delicious joker-jostling gameplay doesn't lend itself to conventional trailers.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/playstation-platformer-astro-bot-dominates-2025-bafta-game-awards" target="_self" data-discover="true">PlayStation platformer Astro Bot dominates 2025 BAFTA Games Awards</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Van Halderen explains Playstack initially tried cutting together a trailer focused on gameplay but found it lacking. When that didn't work, a voiceover was added that still didn't quite hit the mark. Next they dialed in on the jokers themselves. Even then, there was something amiss and visuals alone couldn't showcase the buzz of piecing together that perfect run.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Playstack realized it had to fail fast and pivot. "I think the next best thing to playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is watching someone else playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and seeing the genuine reactions that they're having to the gameplay," says van Halderen. "You see the enthusiasm."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The publisher placed streamers in its sights, but rather than blindly pitching to the biggest names in the biz, chose to start small and expand methodically.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Van Halderen explains Playstack was "super specific" in its initial approach. He saw overlap with other popular deck-building and "highly-mechanical" titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Slay The Spire</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Super Auto Pets</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Binding of Isaac</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The next question, then, was who are the top streamers playing those specific games?</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/want-to-know-the-best-way-to-gain-attention-on-steam-add-a-demo-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Want to know the best way to gain attention on Steam? Add a demo.</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After compiling a finely-tuned outreach list, it was time to start pitching with the knowledge that, at the very least, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would likely pique their interest—and crucially, the interest of their viewers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I would have loved it if Markiplier played our game—but I had no evidence that would be the case. He eventually did around a year later, which was amazing, but if you put all of your eggs into that one basket you're not going to get a lot of results," says van Halderen.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"But if you pitch to 300 smaller streamers you'll get the same kind of numbers and a lot more word of mouth. You get all those communities who are now saying 'oh, my favorite streamer played so I'm going to download it and now I want to chat with out players'—so we're building community at the same time."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He explains that burgeoning community will likely be vocal on social media and other platforms like Discord or Youtube—and may even encourage other steamers they follow to play the game.

I can show you that people are clicking on articles.' I'm very aware that media is not out there to sell my game. I get my coverage, you get your clicks. So we're both happy," continues van Halderen, who notes that data generation is also vital when courting the press.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If people are hungry for more information [...] we can answer questions like 'how long are people playing? How many people are playing?' We would see that thousands of people were spending six to eight hours just on the demo, which is huge. So if I go to press and say 'hey, we got 100,000 downloads on the demo and look how much they played,' then the SEO gears start turning and they will start to think 'maybe there's something here. Maybe we'll do a guide and a few thousand people will click on that.'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's at this stage the "Wheel of Attention" comes into focus. The media feeds into the influencers. The influencers feed the community. The community stokes more conversation.

            <p>
A Minecraft Movie has now amassed more than $550m (£415m) globally since its launch less than two weeks ago.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/a-minecraft-movie-500-million-the-amateur-china-global-international-box-office-1236367389/">Deadline</a> reports that $270m (£204m) of the film's haul comes from overseas, with the UK its biggest market outside of the US, followed by China, Germany, Mexico and Australia.
</p>
<p>
The viral success of the film has caused it to overperform expectations despite limp critical reviews. In short: kids love it, and have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movies-viral-chicken-jockey-moment-is-causing-chaos-in-cinemas">loved going to throw popcorn in the air during its meme-tastic Chicken Jockey scene</a>.
</p>
<p>
But while Minecraft is proving popular, there's still some way for it to go to beat The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which wound up earning $1.3bn (£982m) during the same spring release window back in 2023, setting the record for the highest-grossing film based on a video game. 
</p>
<p>
Can Minecraft beat Nintendo's mascot? Possibly - it seems like Minecraft still has plenty of life left in it yet, even though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-now-shows-warning-following-disruptive-chicken-jockey-trend">the film does now include a warning message asking audiences to behave</a>, in an attempt to curb feral behaviour (and possibly because Warner Bros doesn't want a lawsuit involving animal cruelty after someone brought a live chicken to a showing).
</p>
<p>
Regardless of where A Minecraft Movie ultimately ends up, it's happy days for Warner Bros, which is reportedly already in talks over a potential sequel. And, as is the norm for movies hoping to become franchises these days, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-sequel-discussions-are-already-happening">A Minecraft Movie naturally ends with a teaser for what could come next</a>.
</p>
<p>"Lovely performances elevate a movie that captures Minecraft's many bits and pieces but not its creative spirit," Christian Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-review">Eurogamer's A Minecraft Movie review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A former developer who worked on the cancelled PlayStation console exclusive Concord has called out online commenters comparing it with Bungie's recently showcased Marathon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">Bungie revealed more about its next shooter at the weekend</a> including its release date: 23rd September. Yet the lack of marketing and mixed response to its visual style has sparked comparisons with Concord, and claims that Marathon will be Sony's next flop.</p>
<p>The anonymous developer and artist took to reddit to respond to the comments, asking players to not "punish others for our mistakes".</p>

<p>"Many players know about Concord, and what happened with that project. Concord failed to inspire players, and the message was heard loud and clear," the developer admitted.</p>
<p>"It was gut wrenching to see our project fail, and be the laughing stock of many online. I have learned that failure is what drives me to succeed. No one feels as bad as the people who put their time on the line, hoping it will entertain the masses of gamers across the globe. I am not asking for pity, or even sympathy because, after all this is the name of the game, you win or lose. The margin for success is very thin. I took a chance, and lost.</p>
<p>"Some of you probably smell blood in the water, and probably want to roast me for no longer lurking, and exposing myself. I hope you don't, and see that people create these projects, and work very hard to be the next big thing. Seeing the faces of the developers on the Bungie stream, gave me hope, and excitement for what is to come for Marathon.</p>
<p>"I commend them for taking a chance, trying something foreign to them, that isn't proven, nor guaranteed to succeed."</p>
<p>The developer concluded: "I worked on Concord, and did my best. We came up short, please don't punish others for our mistakes. We are all human beings who are trying to create something special, and Marathon is no different. Be kind, and be cool, as video games are meant to be fun."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/why-is-the-pawn-shop-not-working-in-schedule-1-pawn-shop-guy-missing-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Pawn Shop’s doors were opened in Schedule 1 in April 2025. It offers a new way to manage your inventory, make money, and cause chaos. This guide runs through everything you need to know, including overcoming the missing pawn guy scenario.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-april-7-update-adds-pawn-shop-boutique/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">April 7 update</a> was a big one for Schedule 1. The developer added a lot more content to the drug-dealing game, such as the Bleuballs Boutique, wall-mounting features, and the Pawn Shop. The latter allows you to sell goods for money and not have to waste goods by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-drops-items-in-schedule-1-discard-items-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropping them on the floor</a>.</p>



<p>However, we first need to find the Pawn Shop, work out why the owner is sometimes not there, and how to use it.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-is-the-pawn-shop-in-schedule-1">Where is The Pawn Shop in Schedule 1?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Follow the circle. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Pawn Shop is directly south of the Motel Room location—and is one building across the road from it.</strong></p>



<p>Again, worst case, you can consult our <strong>map screenshot above</strong> for the precise location of the Pawn Shop. <a href="https://www.scheduleonegame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Schedule 1</a> doesn’t signpost everything like in other RPGs. But we like this as it’s quite liberating and encourages you to explore. </p>



<p>But if you want the Pawn Shop, follow these instructions:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <strong>Motel Room in Northtown</strong> (which you unlock for $75).</li>



<li>Exit the room and walk forward.</li>



<li>Turn right at the<strong> ATM</strong>.</li>



<li>Walk in a straight line past the bus stop.</li>



<li>Cross the road.</li>



<li>You’re at the Pawn Shop!</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-why-is-the-pawn-shop-guy-not-there-in-schedule-1">Why is the Pawn Shop Guy Not There in Schedule 1? </h2>



<p><strong>If the Pawn Shop guy isn’t there when you go in, the game has glitched, and you need to save and reload the game to make him appear.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-pawn-shop-guy-is-missing">Pawn Shop Guy is Missing</h3>



<p>It’s well-known that the development team for Schedule 1 is very small. Glitches and bugs will get into the system from time to time. The Pawn Shop guy going AWOL is a common occurrence for Schedule 1 players.</p>



<p>If this happens, do the following:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the Pawn Shop, and if it’s open, check if the guy is behind the counter.</li>



<li>If he’s not, you need to save your game.</li>



<li>You do this by <strong>sleeping or using the Intercom device</strong>.</li>



<li>Once it’s done, close down Schedule 1.</li>



<li>Boot it up again.</li>



<li>When you’re back into the action, head to the Pawn Shop again.</li>



<li>Hopefully, the Pawn Shop person should be there.</li>



<li>If he’s not, <strong>rinse and repeat these instructions until it works</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<p>This bug surely has a fix in development by TVGS. For now, this is a simple workaround.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-the-pawn-shop-in-schedule-1">How to Unlock The Pawn Shop in Schedule 1</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I see you’re here today. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Pawn Shop is automatically unlocked in Schedule 1, but you need to make sure you arrive between 6 AM and 6 PM.</strong></p>



<p>Pawn Shop guy gives you a generous 12-hour window to visit the establishment. If you arrive out of hours, the shop is closed, leaving you unable to benefit from its services. Come back at the right time to trade in your trinkets.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-roadmap-all-future-content-fishing-shooting-mini-games-bribery-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1 roadmap</a> is exciting and gives us a sneak peek into the content TVGS is cooking up.

<p><span><span>The </span></span><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/13/ps5-price-to-rise-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/"><span><span><span><span>announcement on the PS Blog</span></span></span></span></a><span><span> does not give a single concrete reason for the price hike, instead citing "a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates." While similar announcements might precede the price change by days or weeks, this increase was put in place nearly immediately and was set in stone today, April 14. While some regions will only see increased prices on the Digital Edition, others, like Australia, have price increases across the board. However, the price of the PS5 Pro will remain unchanged.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The blog listed some of the price updates in different parts of the world but left out specifics for the Middle East and Africa, instead pointing people to consult local retailers. Prices for other regions are listed below.</span></span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-season-2-viewership-increase/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been revealed that the first episode of the second season of HBO’s The Last of Us saw a viewership boost of 10% over the first season. In a report, it was mentioned that 5.3 million same-day US cross-platform viewers were recorded, which is up 10% from the 4.7 million viewers who tuned into the first episode in 2023.</p>



<p>The first season went on to be the largest audience for an HBO debut season <strong>ever</strong>, so the running expectation is that the second season of The Last of Us will go even further.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-return-of-the-apocalypse">Return of the Apocalypse</h2>



<p>The Last of Us is one of the most iconic post-apocalyptic franchises in gaming history. It emerged in 2013 as a single-player, narrative-driven title from Naughty Dog, the creators of Uncharted. It turned heads back then on the PlayStation 3, and it continues to do so today.</p>



<p>In 2020, Naughty Dog released The Last of Us Part II, which is the game that season two of the HBO live-action adaptation is centered on. The first season covered the events of the first game, but the second game is heftier and will take <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-season-two-first-half/">multiple seasons to cover in full</a>.</p>



<p>In a recent report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/the-last-of-us-season-2-premiere-viewership-hbo-1236368374/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, more viewers have tuned into the second season than the first – 10% more, in fact.</p>



<p>It’s indicative of the growing popularity of the series, which has an uncertain future at Naughty Dog. It was suggested by Neil Druckmann, the franchise’s creator, that there won’t be another game, but he later backtracked on those comments.</p>



<p>The television series has drawn unfortunate criticism, mostly aimed at Bella Ramsay, who plays the lead role of Ellie Williams. It has long been said that they’re not the best representation of the character, and their <strong>youthful appearance </strong>isn’t accurate compared to the game character that they’re based on.</p>



<p>It’s a sticking point, but viewership is up, and that’s all HBO really cares about.</p>



<p>Taking advantage of the popularity of the show, Naughty Dog recently released <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-complete-ps-store-ps5/">The Last of Us Complete</a>, a special edition that is comprised of <strong>both </strong>The Last of Us and The Last of Us Part II, exclusively on PS5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/video-game-blogs-old-media-2000s<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some people looooooooove to talk shit about Kotaku, a publication that all of us here at Aftermath used to work at. Over the last 20+ years the site has been at the vanguard of changing tastes and practices in video games journalism, which means that while it has done (and continues to do!) some amazing work, it has also made its fair share of mistakes and missteps along the way.</p><p>That's what happens when you're always trying to do something new. It's also what happens when you're a small and overworked group of human beings and you work at a larger company where leadership has its own ideas. For all of people's continued teeth-gnashing about the site--much of which is rooted in culture war bullshit--the site was also part of a trend in video game journalism, particularly in the mid-to-late-2000s, that I think has permanently altered how readers understand video game news.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite this intro, I am not going to be singling out any one person or website for criticism here. I led with Kotaku, and will mention it a few more times as an example, because I used to work there and so have the most experience with it. But you can substitute its name for any of its competitors, from Joystiq to Destructoid to VG247 to early-days Polygon, and the story will be the same. Like so many other issues with video games media--and all media, really--the problems I'm going to be talking about here are systemic, which maybe makes them easier to handwave away, but also more difficult to address. And the problem with sites like Kotaku, in the 2000s especially, is that they helped utterly devalue the way we consume news about this medium.</p><p>For much of Kotaku's early life (we're talking roughly 2004-2010ish), it had an intentionally basic site design. Instead of trying to mimic the format of a newspaper or traditional (for the time) website, with little pictures and headlines all over the place, Kotaku was built entirely around a chronological feed of blogs, each post going down the page in order and rewarding readers who sat around mashing F5 with fresh new content every 30-60 minutes. When a new story was published, it slid the top of the page, bumping the last post down. After a day or two, news that normal people might still have been learning about organically had moved off the front page altogether.</p><p>(We actually have, for the true Aftermath sicko who hits F5...2-3 times a day,<a href="https://aftermath.site/all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> our own version of this</a>).</p><p>This is why I was hired! Living in Australia, I was awake during the twilight hours in the US, and so could just keep the machine rolling 24/7 until my American colleagues woke up the next morning. We would publish blog after blog, every 20-30 minutes until the dying of the sun. For those addicted to the news cycle, who felt like they needed to know everything about video games, it must have been incredible: even 20 years ago, Kotaku had hundreds of thousands of devoted, regular readers.</p><p>At the time, for those of us running the site and making money off it, this felt perfect. It was everything we could have wanted from the still-kinda-new internet age.<a href="https://aftermath.site/the-new-games-journalism-same-as-the-old-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Video games media at the time was obsessed with breaking from the past, with treating the medium and its industry more seriously</a>, and so a single website finding space for both the irreverent and the important all on the one page was, even by 2005-06, a <em>huge </em>success.</p><p>On a longer timeframe, though, the relentlessness of Kotaku and its competitors' coverage ended up equating the irreverent <em>with </em>the important. When everything was published on the same site in the same format on the same schedule and given roughly the same prominence, how was anyone supposed to know what was truly important? If you scrolled down the page of a 2000s video games blog you'd see a story about 300 layoffs followed by a Tekken trailer followed by a photo of a Mario cake. It created a news landscape where lots of things were happening all the time, but everything looked just as newsworthy and important as everything else.</p><figure><figcaption>"50 posts in the last 24 hours" - Kotaku's masthead from 2008</figcaption></figure><p>This firehose approach to coverage helped foster a culture, now decades-old, where <em>everything </em>happening in and around video games is deemed important simply for existing, from the most inane press release to a game's third trailer to a quote from a CEO nobody really needs to be listening to. The fast pace of the site’s updates gave everything a sense of urgency that was like feeding a reader’s addiction to the news cycle, giving them endless ammunition to fight pointless console wars and pore over the most meaningless details.</p><p>That's some ruinous shit! Nobody needed to be kept up to date on the barbs thrown by bickering executives; nobody needed to be drip-fed bullet points from a marketing campaign. And it was strange for the subjects of our coverage too; <a href="https://aftermath.site/tweet-roundup-buzzfeed-kotaku-internet-culture" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as we've recently discussed</a>, nobody needed to have their personal thoughts on something fed into an international news cycle, while many developers lived in fear of saying <em>anything </em>in public, lest it be seized upon and posted, quite often entirely out of context, just because some blogger thought it sounded like an interesting soundbyte.</p><p>By the end of the 2000s the video games media landscape was covering so much “news” on a daily basis you could go mad if you stared directly at it for too long. It meant video games had fallen into a familiar hole; the dawn of cable news had the same disruptive effect on TV, and everyone from Gawker to Buzzfeed were doing the same thing to other types of websites. Even mainstream news outlets have struggled in the modern age to properly contextualise their work when so much of it relies on algorithms and social media sharing.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking back, I can't find any one person to blame. Nick Denton had us all working like dogs in the early days of Kotaku--paying bloggers $10 per post in 2006 instead of a salary sure did incentivise us to find any old shit to toss on the website--but our rivals were structured in much the same way. Kotaku's early leadership weren't expressly seeking to devalue news either; we honestly believed at the time that we were showing all the sides of an exploding scene and industry, giving people everything they could want to learn, see or know about video games.</p><p>(It should be noted that while by the 2010s nearly every major video game website had moved its staffers into salaried positions, the pay-per-post model still exists today at networks like Gamurs and Valnet, <a href="https://aftermath.site/freelance-video-game-journalism-rates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whose own reliance on tips, guides and a non-stop “news” cycle perpetuates many of those 2000’s problems for whole new generations</a>).</p><p>The system did what systems do, though, and it's only with the benefit of hindsight that I've been able to look back and really survey the wreckage. I can at least apologise for my part in that system: For every developer or executive quote I lifted into a headline because it would "do numbers", for every benign E3 announcement I treated like it was actually important, for every Reddit or Twitter drama I elevated from personal squabble to international news.</p><p>I can only hope that given a fresh start here at Aftermath, and with the perspective of all the work we've done in the past, we can do something better for the future. Something that operates at a slower pace, that gives us as writers the luxury of deciding if something really is worth covering. Something that’s able to properly contextualise an event so readers can better understand if it’s a fun distraction in their day or something major they need to take their time with. We still think there’s space for all kinds of stories on a video game website, but we want just that–<em>space</em>–so we can help readers understand the video game landscape and leave our worst habits where so much of that 2000s games coverage belongs: forgotten.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/carlo-acutis-gamer-saint"><h3>The Politics, Theology, And Hype Behind The First Gamer Saint</h3></a><p>Teenager Carlo Acutis, set to be canonized at the end of this month, will be the Catholic Church's first millennial saint</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xalavier-nelson-interview-strange-scaffold-el-paso-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles"><h3>How Xalavier Nelson Does It</h3></a><p>"The systems you set up give you the life that you live in.

<p>You would be hard-pressed to find a bigger video game success story in 2025 than Schedule 1. The drug-dealing simulator has taken over the industry, but can you play Schedule 1 on Steam Deck? </p>



<p>Schedule 1 puts you in the shoes of a drug dealer as you work your way up in the world and build an empire. The breakout title is a hit, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-is-a-sleeper-indie-hit-dominating-steam-with-nearly-half-a-million-concurrent-players/#:~:text=Schedule%201%20is%20a%20Sleeper,Million%20Concurrent%20Players%20%2D%20Insider%20Gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassing 412,000 </a>players at its peak just 10 days after launch. The momentum shows no signs of slowing down, as there is a steady stream of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-creator-gives-console-port-update-after-imitations-appear-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updates</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-roadmap-all-future-content-fishing-shooting-mini-games-bribery-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new content</a>.</p>



<p>Despite being so popular, Schedule 1 isn’t available on all platforms. Here is everything you need to know about Steam Deck compatibility. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-schedule-1-playable-on-steam-deck">Is Schedule 1 Playable on Steam Deck?</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>No,</strong> <strong>Schedule 1 is not playable on Steam Deck. </strong></p>



<p>Despite Schedule 1 being on Steam, the game isn’t compatible with the Steam Deck. </p>



<p>Steam Deck users aren’t the only ones left behind. Clones of Schedule 1 have appeared on the PlayStation Store, but the real game isn’t available on consoles.</p>



<p> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-creator-gives-console-port-update-after-imitations-appear-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tyler1</a>, the leading developer at TVGS, cleared up any confusion and said, “As you may be aware, there have been some games on the PlayStation store appearing over the past few weeks with the name ‘Schedule I’ in them. Just confirming these are not affiliated with me in any way.” </p>



<p>He continued, “I’d love to port Schedule I to console when the game is at the right stage for that, but I will announce it to the Schedule I community well before it happens.” </p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-schedule-1-coming-to-steam-deck">When is Schedule 1 Coming to Steam Deck?</h2>



<p><strong>Schedule 1 has no official Steam Deck release date but is in development. </strong></p>



<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/503947989263319048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">April 10 update</a>, Tyler1 revealed, “I’m also looking into improving optimization. I’d like to get Steam Deck officially supported as soon as possible, so that’ll act as my performance benchmark.” </p>



<p>Tyler1 did not provide a timeline for improving optimization, but ‘soon as possible’ means fans won’t have to wait too long. </p>



<p>We will provide an update when Steam Deck users can finally join in on the fun. </p>



<hr>



<p>It’s not the best time to be a fan of handheld gaming. Leaks suggest that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/portable-ps6-wont-be-as-powerful-as-ps5-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">portable version of the PlayStation 6</a> won’t be as powerful as the PS5. In addition, the Nintendo Switch 2s from China could face a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2s-manufactured-in-china-reportedly-subject-to-145-us-tariff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">145% US tariff</a>, which could raise the price, and games are believed to cost <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breath-of-the-wild-and-its-dlc-is-90-on-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upwards of $90</a>. </p>

            <p>
FromSoftware's seminal action-RPG Dark Souls now has seamless co-op, courtesy of the modder behind similar co-op overhauls for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a>.
</p>
<p>
Modder Yui initially <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510">made headlines through their work on Elden Ring</a>, stripping away some of its co-operative faff so players could adventure and battle bosses together seamlessly. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ahead-of-elden-ring-nightreign-dark-souls-3-modder-adds-seamless-co-op-overhaul-nine-years-after-release">similar mod arrived for Dark Souls 3</a> earlier this year, and now it's the turn of FromSoftware's stone cold classic Dark Souls, which gets seamless co-op some 14 years after its original release.
</p>
<p>
Dark Souls' Seamless Co-op mod is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksoulsremastered/mods/899">available to download now on NexusMods</a> and works very much like Yui's earlier mods, introducing a special custom item used to summon up to five additional players into a game. Once in a multiplayer session participants will notice some major differences compared to how things work in the base game.

<figcaption>Here's a look at the Dark Souls Seamless Co-op mod in action.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqdZ1-uk9h8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
If a players dies, for instance, they'll spawn at the last bonfire they visited rather than being booted from the session, and clearing areas or defeating bosses won't disband play either. Additionally, when one player rests at a bonfire, the world will reset for everyone; NPC dialogue and events are synchronised for all players; all fog walls and barriers designed to restrict multiplayer zones are removed, and game progression made during a multiplayer session will also progress the game in your own world.
</p>
<p>
Yui has also implemented configurable multiplayer difficulty scaling for all enemies, and says that while seamless co-op makes Dark Souls "significantly easier", the mod's default scaling settings should be enjoyable while 'somewhat preserving the game's challenge'. Notably, players can't immediately spawn back into a boss fight on death - they'll instead be turned into a spectator until either everyone in the party is defeated or a player rests at a bonfire.
</p>
<p>
Dark Souls' seamless co-op mod - which also supports Invasions - is currently at the alpha stage, meaning it's "very likely" to contain bugs. Using it won't, however, result in a ban, given it utilises an overhauled peer-to-peer connection system rather than FromSoftware's servers. The mod even creates a different save file to keep things separate in case you want to play the vanilla game at the same time - although Yui warns that attempting to revert a mod saved file to a vanilla save <em>will</em> likely result in a ban.
</p>
<p>
Yui's Dark Souls mod comes ahead of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush">FromSoftware's multiplayer-focused Nightreign</a>, in which up to three players can work together to defeat <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-will-feature-enemies-from-dark-souls-director-confirms">new and familiar challenges from Elden Ring and other From games</a> - including The Nameless King from Dark Souls 3. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Nightreign</a> launches for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 30th May - and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> is also getting its own bit of FromSoftware multiplayer in the form of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-is-bloodborne-meets-sekiro-meets-dark-souls-with-jetpacks-and-dinos-thrown-in">recently revealed The Duskbloods</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/schedule-1-early-access-review.1164270/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/schedule-1-review-early-access<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you’re quitting your office job to grow a farm in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-review-2024"><u>Stardew Valley</u></a> or setting aside your warrior days to work at a tea shop in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wanderstop-review"><u>Wanderstop</u></a>, sometimes you just want to take a break and embrace a simpler way of living. I didn’t expect to find this same sense of cozy escapism in a game about manufacturing and selling drugs in a grimy city, but with Schedule 1, that’s exactly what I got. Instead of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/16/grand-theft-auto-v-review"><u>GTA</u></a>-like chaotic romp through the criminal underworld I anticipated, I found myself peacefully packaging homegrown ganja into tiny baggies, building bonds with my local community by handing out free samples, and experimenting with new and novel narcotic recipes while my expanding drug empire flourished. The 40 hours it took me to perfect my dope dealings did have some downers mixed in with the uppers though, as I encountered plenty of bugs and an unfinished endgame as of this Early Access launch – both signs Schedule 1 is still<em> </em>getting baked. But I overwhelmingly enjoyed my surprisingly zen time as a friendly neighborhood poison pusher regardless, and can’t wait to see how it continues to evolve.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This goofy, first-person management sim asks you to turn your burgeoning small business of peddling drugs into a massive enterprise that employs dozens of hardworking chemists, botanists, and dealers. After finding yourself down on your luck in an unfamiliar city, you do the only thing your scoundrel of a main character has ever been good at: slinging that OG kush, of course. What starts out as a solo operation where you’re growing maryjane in a crummy hotel room can eventually become a fully automated manufacturing and distribution process that moves large volumes of high quality narcotics. As you spread the tendrils of your illicit venture throughout the city, you’ll meet and build relationships with the extremely impressionable locals, learning their pharmaceutical preferences and supplying their fix, which unlocks new dealers to help push your product and suppliers who can hook you up with new raw materials – and that process of building stacks of cash and finding ways to improve, expand, and optimize your business operations is as satisfying as any of the best management sims I’ve played.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Running around town expanding your network by introducing yourself (and your product) to the locals, then converting them into repeat customers who text you for their next hit, is habit forming in more ways than one. And since you can improve your chances of converting a stranger into an ongoing customer by understanding the high they’re looking for and cooking up something to match that preference, you’re encouraged to try out daring mixtures back home to see what new flavors you can concoct. Maybe mixing adderall from the local gas station with crystal meth will result in an energizing product, or perhaps mixing your fancy purple cannabis with *<em>checks notes*</em> horse semen will be a good idea? Amusingly, the names of the resulting product variants seem to be randomly generated by mashing two vaguely drug-sounding words together, so you could end up selling a product called Dream Queef or Aspen Smegma – juvenile humor, I know, but just dumb enough to fit well with Schedule 1’s extremely silly vibe.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Even repetitive tasks like harvesting reefer are oddly enjoyable.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even repetitive tasks like harvesting reefer and packaging it into little jars for distribution are oddly enjoyable. Watering crops, mixing ingredients, and breaking a freshly baked tray of crystal all feel really satisfying and lulled me into a contented meditative state that almost made me forget I was committing numerous felonies. Eventually though, you’ll develop the means to automate a lot of this and effectively never have to touch the production pipeline with your own two hands ever again, except to sell those goods (and even that you can mostly offload to your subordinate dealers). This is where Schedule 1 dips its toes into automation found in the likes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/satisfactory-review"><u>Satisfactory</u></a> – a pivot that replaces the quiet meditation of bagging hemp with becoming an efficiency obsessed floor manager that appealed to my love of logistics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s unexpectedly absent from this felonious undertaking is any kind of pushback from law enforcement, who act as a flimsy guardrail to keep you from doing your dealings out in the open more than anything else. They’ll set up street barricades that you can simply walk around, or try to arrest you if you deal drugs right in front of them – but they are woefully unequipped to actually catch you as they run slowly, won’t shoot you, and give up the chase almost as soon as you disappear around a corner. This seems to be an intentional move to keep things light while maintaining the illusion of your actions having real stakes, but you’ll never actually find yourself at risk of exposure. The cops don’t bust down the doors to your very obvious drug facilities, even if they see you run away inside them, and there aren’t any rival gangs or saboteurs to worry about breaking up your operations. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Theoretically, you <em>could</em> buy a gun and decide to go on a rampage around town harassing the cops, but you’re given no incentive to do so, and Schedule 1 seems to make you go out of your way to play this way if you want to. In fact, I never even got close to getting myself arrested, and never found any use for the baseball bat or revolver I had in my safehouse. I kept waiting for things to take a horribly violent turn, but as of now, that doesn’t appear to be the focus of Schedule 1, and I’d say it’s all the better for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, you spend your time indoors harmoniously tending to your garden of hallucinogenic flora and cheerfully skateboarding around town to deliver your goods, and the surreal dichotomy between Schedule 1’s subject matter and how tranquil it feels to actually play never stops being hilarious. Honestly, it has a whole lot more in common with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-for-switch"><u>Animal Crossing</u></a> than GTA, except instead of playing as a villager indebted to a malevolent raccoon, you’re the one putting the unenviable financial squeeze on your neighbors, like an entrepreneurial Walter White shouting “I am the one who Nooks.” You can even make your cozy schemes collaborative by inviting a friend to join you in co-op to help out around town! What’s more heartwarming than you and a buddy dealing bricks of cocaine on the streets together?</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite Felony Simulators</h3><p>If you're looking for a less risky way to satisfy your lawbreaking instincts, here are the top games I recommend.</p></div><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite Cozy Games</h3><p>If you're looking for a game that pairs well with a warm blanket and a hot cup of tea, look no further than these TieGuyTravis-approved recommendations.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The main issue with Schedule 1 is a familiar one for many Early Access games, which is that I ran out of things to do somewhat quickly. After unlocking the last of the three currently available base drug types with about 20 hours of optimizing my business, I didn’t have a whole lot to shoot for other than stockpiling stacks of cash with nothing meaningful to spend it on. Sure, I could buy a better skateboard, a car to drive around in, or some legitimate businesses to launder my money through, but there’s little reason to do so beyond vanity after a certain point. Presumably, there will eventually be some kind of endgame added with more reasons to keep playing, but I was able to unlock all the properties, dealers, and suppliers that are here now in short order, then spent the rest of my time just grinding – until I took a look at the progression menu and saw there wasn’t anything in the latter half of it yet. The minimal story about your colleague showing you the ropes of becoming a drug kingpin drops off after a while as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the same Early Access vein, Schedule 1 also has bugs, performance issues, and some of the other usual jankiness you’d expect, though none of it is particularly egregious – in fact, I’d say this is actually  fairly above average compared to the many the work-in-progress games I’ve reviewed. I ran into some framerate issues and had my dealers bug out and stop selling product until I reset the world twice, but most of these problems were pretty minor and had minimal impact on the glee I felt while pulling off my criminal dealings.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Schedule 1 is a crime sim that mashes its dark subject matter and dirty jokes with surprisingly cozy management mechanics in a way that works really well, resulting in an extremely unique and highly amusing crafting game I happily sunk 40 hours into. Befriending my neighbors while getting them hooked on addictive substances grown in an apartment above a chinese restaurant is a goofy, satisfying hook, and leveling up my enterprise scratched an automation itch I don’t get to scratch often enough. This Early Access launch inevitably runs out of reasons to keep you playing since it’s quite clearly missing the back half of its campaign for now, and it has some bugs that give it a decidedly unpolished feel, but I still had a blast being an absolutely terrible human in the comfiest way possible.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Raven Software revealed a plan to prevent players from ruining the experience for others in Warzone Casual. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-warzone-black-ops-6-april-11-update-patch-notes-dragon-breath-shotguns-removed-shattered-veil-boss-adjustments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone</a> Season 3 marks the long-awaited return of the battle royale’s original map, Verdansk. So, For many who have flocked back, this is the first time they have played the battle royale in months, if not years. To help ease players back in, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-out-of-warzone-bootcamp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone Bootcamp</a> is a refresher and shows you the ropes. </p>



<p>Once players are ready for real action but aren’t quite prepared for a standard battle royale match, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-warzone-casual-in-call-of-duty-battle-royale-mode-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone Casual</a> is a new game mode with <strong>28 real players</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>120 bots</strong>. As the name suggests, the game mode caters to casual players, and Raven Software wants to keep it that way. </p>



<h2 id="h-warzone-devs-push-back-against-sweats-taking-over-warzone-casual">Warzone Devs Push Back Against “Sweats” Taking Over Warzone Casual</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Warzone Casual is easy for anyone to pick up and play. Image via Activision </figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>In an interview with&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-has-given-call-of-duty-warzone-a-shot-in-the-arm-and-its-developers-say-its-not-going-anywhere" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>IGN</strong></a><strong>, Raven Software’s Warzone game director, Pete Actipis,</strong> <strong>assured players that the devs will take action if Warzone Casual no longer lives up to the name. </strong></p>



<p>“The whole spirit of the Casual mode was to give people that were scared about getting into a time commitment or a game commitment or a skill commitment with Warzone, but do it on their terms,” Actipis said. “So if we see sweats come in there wrecking the whole server, then we will have to come up with plans against that.” </p>



<p>Actipis did not reveal how the team plans to prevent it from becoming an issue, but Casual mode fans can rest easy knowing that Raven Software is aware of it. </p>



<hr>



<p>Warzone Casual isn’t the only feature that helps casual players. In the same interview, Raven Software admitted that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-devs-address-fast-time-to-kill-concerns-on-verdansk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fast-time-to-kill speeds</a> are designed to help less-skilled users, and the devs also provided an update on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-devs-provide-update-on-how-long-verdansk-will-stay-for/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how long Verdansk will be around.</a> </p>

      <p>
        Razer took an open source app and made it simpler. A lead dev is all for it.
      </p>

      
    </div>

    <div>
                      
                      
          <p>Razer, maker of green-hued gaming hardware and accessories, has entered the game-streaming space with its new—but not entirely new—app, <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-software/razer-pc-remote-play">PC Remote Play</a>. It's based on very good existing streaming tech and makes connecting a PC to mobile devices fairly simple. It's worth checking out unless you have a hard-and-fast policy about avoiding software "utilities" from RGB-obsessed gaming companies.</p>
<p>That, or you're already using and comfortable with <a href="https://moonlight-stream.org/">Moonlight</a>. Moonlight and <a href="https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine">Sunshine</a> are the open source game-streaming client and server that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/nvidias-gamestream-is-dead-sunshine-and-moonlight-are-better-replacements/">wonderfully picked up where Nvidia's Gamestream left off</a>. PC Remote Play is based on Moonstream's open source code, and Razer has <a href="https://github.com/razerofficial/Razer-PC-Remote-Play-android">made much of its own version's code available</a>.</p>
<p>You're getting a few small upgrades when using PC Remote Play:</p>
<ul>
<li>You do not need to set up a Sunshine server on Windows and give it the proper permissions, pair it with codes, or the like</li>
<li>Razer's app creates a virtual display that matches your phone or tablet and turns off your PC's screen</li>
<li>Easier connection for playing remotely, outside your home network (presuming the app's traversal techniques slip past your router)</li>
<li>If you're using certain Razer peripherals, like the <a href="https://www.razer.com/mobile-controllers/razer-kishi-ultra">Razer Kishi Ultra</a> or <a href="https://www.razer.com/mobile-controllers/razer-kishi-v2">Kishi V2</a>, you'll get advanced rumble feedback and other upgrades (though mostly on Android)</li>
</ul>
<h2>It mostly just works (and wants to install things)</h2>
<p>I tested out PC Remote Play on my home network, streaming&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/avowed-review-wait-are-we-the-baddies/"><em>Avowed</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/satisfactory-now-has-controller-support-so-theres-no-excuse-for-your-bad-lines/?comments-page=1#comments"><em>Satisfactory</em></a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/11-standouts-from-steam-next-fests-thousands-of-free-game-demos/">the&nbsp;<em>Monster Train 2</em> demo</a> from my Windows PC to an iPad Air (5th generation/M1). To get there, I had to pair a Bluetooth controller (Xbox One wireless) to my iPad and install Razer Remote Play on it, and <a href="https://www.razer.com/cortex">Razer Cortex</a> on the PC. Razer would also like you to install other Razer apps on each device, like the <a href="https://www.razer.com/mobile/razer-nexus">Nexus game launcher</a> on mobile, and something like two to three other tools on PC. With attention and small effort, you can skip past those things, make the two apps see each other, and start playing.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          


<p>I intentionally touched as few settings as I could on each device (minus a curious poke or two at the "Optimize" option), and the experience was fairly streamlined. I didn't have to set resolutions or guess at a data-streaming rate; Razer defaults to 30Mbps, which generally provides rock-solid 1080p and pretty smooth 1440p-ish resolutions. My main complaints were the missing tricks I had picked up in Moonlight, like holding the start/menu button to activate a temporary mouse cursor or hitting a button combination to exit out of games.</p>
<p>Razer's app is not limited to Steam games like Steam Link or Xbox/Game Pass titles like Remote Play and can work with pretty much any game you have installed. It is, however, limited to Windows and the major mobile platforms, leaving out Macs, Apple TVs, Linux, Steam Deck and other handhelds, Raspberry Pi setups, and so on. Still, for what it does, it works pretty well, and its interface, while Razer-green and a bit showy, was easier to navigate than Moonlight. I did not, for example, have to look up the launching executables and runtime options for certain games to make them launch directly from my mobile device.</p>
<p>Streaming-wise, I noticed no particular differences from the Moonlight experience, which one might expect, given the shared codebase. The default choice of streaming at my iPad's native screen resolution and refresh rate saved me the headaches of figuring out the right balance of black box cut-offs and resolution that I would typically go through with Steam Link or sometimes Moonlight.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<h2>Let a thousand streaming forks bloom</h2>
<p>How would the folks at Moonlight feel about Razer getting their glowing-green hands on their hard-won streaming tech? Great, it turns out. Cameron Gutman, one of the founders and lead developers on Moonlight, told me by email that he was "very supportive of individuals and companies building on top of our software, provided that they respect the terms of the GPL (<a href="https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-qt?tab=GPL-3.0-1-ov-file#readme">GNU General Public License 3.0</a>)."</p>
<p>Gutman noted that a number of forks of Moonlight already exist, covering&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ClassicOldSong/Apollo">seamless virtual display integration</a>, <a href="https://github.com/DuoStream">multi-session support</a>, and <a href="https://www.harmony-developers.com/p/moonlight-app-for-harmonyos">support for non-US devices</a>. And what Razer looks to be delivering here is a more user-friendly UI, Gutman wrote (he had not personally tested the software as of last week). That's something from which Moonlight, and other open source projects, can often benefit.</p>
<p>"As with many open-source developers and projects, we can tend to write software that caters to more technical users (sometimes unintentionally), which leaves a gap for someone like Razer to come along with a team of UX designers and Product Managers to take things back to basics and tackle some of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_cut_bug">papercuts</a> that impact the experience of ordinary folks," Gutman wrote.</p>
<p>I'm still using Moonlight and Sunshine because I'm comfortable messing with the nitty-gritty settings and also capable of setting up my own solution for remote access. But as a tool that covers the biggest PC gaming platform and portable devices, PC Remote Play is not a bad tool to keep in mind for gaming away from a PC desk.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Former Dragon Age series lead writer David Gaider says that during his later years at BioWare, the studio's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard/">Dragon Age</a> team and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mass-effect-legendary-edition/">Mass Effect</a> team did not get along--nor did the team making Anthem.</p><p dir="ltr">"For a long time it was basically two teams under one roof: the Dragon Age team and the Mass Effect team," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidgaider.bsky.social/post/3lmqqa5tm4s2p" rel="nofollow ">Gaider said on BlueSky</a>. "Run differently, very different cultures, may as well have been two separate studios. And they didn't get along."</p><p dir="ltr">According to Gaider, BioWare knew of the tension between the teams, but despite the fact that various attempts had been made to fix it (including transferring developers between teams), nothing seemed to work.</p><p dir="ltr">"The company was aware of the friction and attempts to fix it had been ongoing for years, mainly by shuffling staff between the teams more often," Gaider wrote. "Yet this didn't really solve things, and I had no idea until I got to the [<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/anthem/">Anthem</a>] team. The team didn't want me there. At all."</p><p dir="ltr">Gaider said BioWare had asked him to write a "science fantasy" story, but his work was frequently rejected and declared too Dragon Age-like.</p><p dir="ltr">"Until this point, [Anthem] had been concepted as kind of a 'beer &amp; cigarettes' hard sci-fi setting (a la Aliens), and I'd been given instructions to turn it into something more science fantasy (a la Star Wars), Gaider explained. "Yet I don't think anyone told the team this. So they thought this change was <em>my</em> doing."</p><p dir="ltr">"I won't go into detail about the problems except to say it became clear this was a team that didn't want to make an RPG," he continued. "[They] were very anti-RPG, in fact. Yet they wanted me to wave my magic writing wand and create a BioWare-quality story without giving me any of the tools I'd need to actually do that."</p><p dir="ltr">The tension between the Dragon Age and Mass Effect teams combined with the friction within Gaider's Anthem team was stressful--stressful enough that Gaider tried to ensure that at the very least, he wouldn't be put in the same situation again post-Anthem.</p><p dir="ltr">"I saw the writing on the wall," he wrote. "This wasn't going to work. So I called up my boss and said that I'd stick it out and try my best, but only if there was SOMETHING waiting on the other side, where I could have more say as Creative Director. I wanted to move up. I was turned down flat, no hesitation.</p><p dir="ltr">Ultimately, after 17 years at BioWare, Gaider walked in 2016, leaving the studio behind despite his fear of losing financial stability.</p><p dir="ltr">"After my last day, [I was] literally having a nervous breakdown, wondering what kind of idiot gives up a 'good job.' How was a writer, of all things, with no real interest in business supposed to start his own studio? It felt apocalyptic. Within a year, however, I was on my way."</p><p dir="ltr">Today, Gaider is the creative director at <a href="https://www.summerfallstudios.com/" rel="nofollow ">Summerfall Studios</a>, an indie outfit he co-founded.</p><p dir="ltr">"We make games with character," reads the studio's website.</p><p dir="ltr">As for BioWare, the entirety of the development team is currently at work on the next entry in the Mass Effect series, which was announced in 2020 but currently has no release date.</p>

of skills, weapons, and equippable items. Blizzard gave a few examples in the <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24188046/enter-the-stadium-get-ready-to-battle/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> and accompanying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9tUpO0BTQY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overwatch 2 Stadium trailer</a>, including Reinhardt sending lava across the battlefield with his hammer strike, Kiriko cloning herself, and Moira launching three Biotic Orbs instead of just one. The skill system lets players choose what augments they think will work best, though Blizzard will include some build suggestions as well.</p><p dir="ltr">These upgrades cost Stadium Cash, which Blizzard says you'll earn based on how well you score in each match. There are a couple of balancing features Stadium includes to help those who might be struggling, though. Skills purchased in the first, third, and fifth rounds are free, and there's a bounty in each match--a player on the opposing team who's performing particularly well--that rewards bonus Stadium Cash if you defeat them.</p><p dir="ltr">Overwatch 2 Stadium's launch coincides with Season 16 and the debut of new damage character Freja. Freja won't be playable in Stadium initially, but Blizzard said future updates will add more heroes to the Stadium roster.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're keen to see more of Stadium in action, check out our hands-on preview, where we said it's the mode where <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-finally-earning-the-2-in-its-name/1100-6529616/" data-ref-id="1100-6529616">Overwatch 2 finally earns its sequel status</a>, after almost two years.</p>

<p>Sanfall Interactive’s debut project,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur Expedition 33</a>, is set in a universe centered around a paintress. Every year, she paints a descending number on a monolith, and people of that age turn to smoke and fade away. </p>



<p>Other expedition groups have tried and failed in the past to stop the paintress. Yet, before she can paint 33, another team sets out to finally end her reign of terror and save the rest of humanity. Without further ado, let’s look at who voices each expedition member. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-voice-actors-in-clair-obscur-expedition-33">All Voice Actors in Clair Obscur Expedition 33</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Renoir is one of the leading figures in Expedition 33. Image via Sandfall Interactive </figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Clair Obscur Expedition 33</strong> <strong>has 10 voice actors for the English cast.  </strong></p>



<p>The Expedition 33 team features five primary characters, each with a role. Gustave is the group’s lead engineer, and Lune is the expedition’s chief researcher. In addition, <a href="https://www.expedition33.com/post/meet-our-english-voice-cast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sandfall Interactive</a> revealed five supporting characters with a mix of friends and foes added to the mix. </p>



<p>You can check out every actor and who they play in Clair Obscur Expedition 33 below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Split Fiction Voice Actor</th><th>Character Name</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Charlie Cox&nbsp;</td><td>Gustave</td></tr><tr><td>Andy Serkis </td><td>Renoir </td></tr><tr><td>Jennifer English </td><td>Maelle </td></tr><tr><td>Kirsty Rider </td><td>Lune </td></tr><tr><td>Shala Nyx </td><td>Sciel </td></tr><tr><td>Ben Starr </td><td>Verso </td></tr><tr><td>Rich Keeble </td><td>N/A </td></tr><tr><td>Maxence Cazorla </td><td>N/A </td></tr><tr><td>Devora Wilde </td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Tracy Wiles </td><td>N/A</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Marvel fans will be familiar with Charlie Cox and Andy Serkis. Cox famously portrayed Matt Murdock in Daredevil and recently reprised the lead role in Daredevil: Born Again. Meanwhile, Serkis was Ulysses Klaue in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and appeared in Avengers: Age of Ultron and Black Panther. </p>



<p>Serkis is known for his iconic voice work as Gollum in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and Caesar in the Planet of the Apes series. He also portrayed Alfred Pennyworth in The Batman. In addition, Serkis portrayed Kino Loy in Andor and Snoke in the Star Wars sequel trilogy themes. </p>



<p>Sandfall Interactive also recruited several veterans from the video game industry. Ben Starr is known for his role as Clive Rosfield in Final Fantasy XVI, and Jennifer English was in Baldurs Gate 3 and Elden Ring. </p>



<p>When asked about the role in an interview with <a href="https://www.expedition33.com/post/meet-our-english-voice-cast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sandfall Interactive</a>, Starr said, “It was so appealing to be able to explore his subtle yet simmering dramatic inner life with the amount of freedom that the Sandfall team gave me.”</p>

                <p>Mouse Work is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> game that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/shovel-knight-dig/" data-ref-id="5000-501664">Shovel Knight Dig</a> developer Nitrome announced shortly after the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a>. It's a party game specifically built around the fact that Joy-Con 2 controllers can also be used as mice. There's just one catch: Nitrome doesn't have a Switch 2 development kit yet.</p><p>Dev kits are necessary for a game studio to release their game on a platform like Switch 2. Nintendo has reportedly been quite restrictive in distributing Switch 2 development kits prior to its launch this June, which puts indie developers like Nitrome in an awkward situation. Games that get on a new system early are often closely associated with the platform for its lifespan, which can majorly benefit indie titles.</p><p>"We recognize that there is an opportunity there if you get something new out of the gate or close to launch, and [if] you use some of the features, there's going to be a decent audience there that wants to try it," studio founder Matthew Annal told me in an interview.</p><p>In reality, it's not Nitrome's decision if that gets to happen because a game like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mouse-work/" data-ref-id="5000-671693">Mouse Work</a> can't cross the finish line until Nintendo gets the studio a development kit. Situations like Nitrome's serve as a reminder of just how much power Nintendo holds in what the rollout of Switch 2 and its library of games looks like.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdhvAqS4bjA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RdhvAqS4bjA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>According to Annal, Nitrome first became intrigued at the idea of developing a game for Switch 2 when the team saw the console's January announcement, which hinted that it'd have some form of mouse support. Annal's initial idea was to bring a classic Nitrome Flash game, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-paint/" data-ref-id="5000-17544">Mario Paint</a>-inspired <a href="https://nitrome.fandom.com/wiki/Pest_Control" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pest Control</a>, to Switch 2. Annal felt Pest Control's design was too "dated," though, and decided it'd be more creatively fulfilling to build a game for Switch 2 from the ground up. That's when Mouse Work was born.</p><p>Mouse Work's mouse-control-driven minigames range from closing pop-up ads to guiding climbers up a mountain. Annal cited <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pico-park/" data-ref-id="5000-454006">Pico Park</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/part-time-ufo/" data-ref-id="5000-479012">Part-Time UFO</a> as major inspirations. Mouse Work is made in the game engine Unity, and Nitrome is currently working within a development environment that allows them to use multiple mice on one desktop. As the X video below shows, they're simply strapping Joy-Cons on top of these mice to test the game's feel for now.</p><p>Outside of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/drag-x-drive/" data-ref-id="5000-671279">Drag x Drive</a>, it's one of the only confirmed Switch 2 games to be completely built around the use of mouse controls and the capability of simultaneously using multiple controllers in mouse mode while playing. It's a game that feels solely made for Switch 2, which is why it's shocking to learn that Nitrome had not even contacted Nintendo for a dev kit before announcing it.</p><p>While Nitrome has released games like Shovel Knight Dig and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bomb-chicken/" data-ref-id="5000-479956">Bomb Chicken</a> for Nintendo Switch, Nitrome didn't think they'd be granted a Switch 2 dev kit if they just reached out with a cold call pitch for Mouse Work.</p><p>"We thought that if we tried to reach out, there would be no chance that they'd actually get back to us because they'd say we haven't got a project. We thought, 'Let's just get it together, get a video, and aim for just after the next Direct because, for all we know, there might be something about the mouse that's different from what we're assuming'…We thought [that] having something to show would give [Nintendo] more reason to give us a dev kit."</p><p>Annal believed there was a chance that Nintendo could have a mouse-themed title for launch and was ultimately relieved when no such games appeared in the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct. After three months of development without even contacting Nintendo, Nitrome unveiled Mouse Work publicly on April 7 and subsequently reached out for a dev kit.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4476032-%2897%29mouseworkrevealtrailer%281%29.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4476032" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4476032-%2897%29mouseworkrevealtrailer%281%29.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4476032"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4476032-%2897%29mouseworkrevealtrailer%281%29.jpeg"></figure><p>Mouse Work's trailer did not disclose that Nitrome did not yet have a Switch 2 dev kit, so it got attention like any new Switch 2 game. Unfortunately for Nitrome, Nintendo still has not yet guaranteed the studio a dev kit. Annal has heard back from Nintendo of America, but needs Nintendo of Europe to get the ball rolling so Mouse Work on Switch 2 can become a reality.</p><p>"We've made things for Nintendo Switch, so we have some Nintendo contacts. We reached out to them, but most people are [being] really silent. No one wants to get back to you all of a sudden. So maybe they're really busy or maybe they're being told: 'Don't talk to anyone who wants dev kits,'" Annal explained. "I did hear from a couple of people, but they were from the US side and their advice was 'You need to talk to the European side because you're in Europe,' so that wasn't especially helpful."</p><p>For now, that's where Mouse Work remains. It's still in active development as Nitrome continues to flesh the experience out with new minigames, colorblind-friendly features, and more. Ultimately, Nintendo must reach back out to Nitrome for Mouse Work to hit Switch 2's ever-so-valuable launch window.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4476033-%2897%29mouseworkrevealtrailer%282%29.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4476033" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4476033-%2897%29mouseworkrevealtrailer%282%29.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4476033"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4476033-%2897%29mouseworkrevealtrailer%282%29.jpeg"></figure><p>Once the dev kit is in Nitrome's hands, Annal doesn't think it'll cause much of a delay in development. He hopes Nitrome will have a version of Mouse Work to submit "within a few weeks" of getting a dev kit. Annal says Mouse Work could launch as early as July if Nitrome gets dev kits in time, but admits that "it really depends on when we get dev kits."</p><p>Much of Mouse Work's appeal comes from the fact that it feels tailor-made for Switch 2, which is why it's a shock to learn that Nitrome does not have a dev kit yet. At some point, the doors for Switch 2 dev kits have to blow wide open, and the Switch 2 eShop can become as packed with indie games as the Switch's eShop currently is. It’s worth remembering that the eShop was similarly restrictive during the early days of Nintendo Switch, resulting in a few key indie titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/snake-pass/" data-ref-id="5000-459128">Snake Pass</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/snipperclips-cut-it-out-together/" data-ref-id="5000-461292">Snipperclips: Cut it Out, Together!</a> really standing out.</p><p>As Nintendo Switch 2 approaches launch, Nintendo is being just as restrictive with indie games again, only allowing select ones like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deltarune/" data-ref-id="5000-576112">Deltarune</a> on the platform. The power to bring games to Switch 2 is ultimately in Nintendo's hands, even when the game in question feels as tailor-made for the platform as Mouse Work.</p>

		<p>Star Wars Zero Company has been revealed by EA, which is a brand new single player turn based tactics game being developed by BitReactor and Respawn. There is not much detail yet as EA has stated that the full reveal will be coming on April 19th during Star Wars Celebration. The game has been rumoured for a while, with leaks suggesting Star Wars Zero Company will play like X-Com games.</p>



<p>Going by the artwork this looks like Clone Wars era Star Wars with Zero Company being a mix of characters including a Jedi, bounty hunter, clone trooper, droid, and rogue. What we don’t know yet is if the timeline of Zero Company will explore the entirety of the era from up to the conclusion of Order 66, or whether it will stop short of that defining event.</p>
<p>We will have to wait until April 19th to get a proper look at Star Wars Zero Company, and learn more about the actual story of the game.</p>

HBO’s approach to <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>’s story has stripped away a lot of the mystery and tension present in the game, but I do want to give some props to the team behind the show for faithfully recreating one of the best moments in Naughty Dog’s post-apocalyptic drama, even if it showed up much earlier than fans were probably expecting.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“Future Days,” the first episode of season two, takes place almost entirely in the Jackson settlement that Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) have been living in for the past five years. The two have found places in the community of survivors protected from the infected horde, though Ellie is clearly jaded toward the notion of working with others for a larger purpose. To her, all these town walls do is keep her from reaching her true potential as someone who can fight against the infected, and she cares little for most of the civilians in this town. The one person she does seem to care about is Dina, played by Isabela Merced in the show. The two girls are best friends, and it’s clear that Ellie harbors some feelings for Dina, and every now and then, she gets a sense that it might not be one-sided.</p><p>Years of romantic tension between the two bubbles over at a dance in Jackson. Ellie is a wallflower, while Dina is the life of the party, dancing to Crooked Still’s “Little Sadie” and putting on a show. Then things start to slow down as the folk group’s melancholy, religious ballad “Ecstasy” begins to play. Dina drags a hesitant Ellie to the dance floor, and they begin to slow dance.</p><p>I wasn’t expecting to see this scene recreated in the show this early, as this moment originally appears as a flashback in the final hours of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>. But before the game launched in 2020, the dance was one of the first scenes we ever saw, being featured at an E3 presentation way back in 2018. Even before I met Dina when I finally played the game two years later, I was already captivated by her effect on Ellie. This was an older version of the girl we’d met in the original game, and it was clear that everything she’d been through had left her more world-weary, perhaps aging her as much as the passage of time itself. Dina, meanwhile, was downright chipper, comparatively. She is playful where Ellie is always on guard, and she brings out those sparks of passion and excitement in Ellie that seemed to have been drained from her.</p><p>This moment on the dance floor is one of the best snapshots of the two’s dynamic, and I was frankly terrified that it would fall victim to the show’s inferior writing style. As I’ve laid out in my review of season two and recap of the first episode, I can’t stand the show’s tendency to overexplain and justify every action and thought these characters have. It gets downright painful for me to watch in some episodes, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that the show kept this exchange almost exactly as it was in the PlayStation 4 game.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Ellie: Every guy in this room is staring at you right now.</p><p>Dina: Maybe they’re staring at you.</p><p>Ellie: They’re not.</p><p>Dina: Maybe they’re jealous of you?</p><p>Ellie: No reason to be. I’m not a threat.</p><p>Dina: Oh, Ellie. I think they should be terrified of you.</p></blockquote><p>Then Dina kisses Ellie in the middle of the dance floor. Sure, I might not like the way the show’s actors deliver these lines as much I love the way they’re said in the game, but even so, the back and forth does such an excellent job of illustrating Ellie’s beaten-down self-esteem. She doesn’t think Dina could ever view her this way, even though they are leaving no room for Jesus as they sway back and forth together. Dina, meanwhile, tells Ellie that she is so much more than she realizes, even though she doesn’t see it. If words aren’t enough to convince her, maybe actions will be.</p><p>Ellie will chalk the flirtation and the kiss up to drunken shenanigans on Dina’s part for a bit, further showing how deep her insecurity goes; even when she’s liplocked with a girl, she still doesn’t believe she can have this. But, then, Ellie has had nearly everything she’s ever wanted taken from her, so why would she believe this situation with Dina could be any different? How she handles that is a thread we’ll unravel as the season (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-part-2-season-3-4-ellie-abby-1851521708&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-part-2-season-3-4-ellie-abby-1851521708">or multiple seasons, rather</a></span>) continues, but at this moment, she gets what she wants, and she can start to believe that someone in this town sees her as something more than the angry girl who lives with Joel.</p><figure id="" data-id="59fbc26bcc3dfc9d3c8cc58e8332dfb8" data-recommend-id="image://59fbc26bcc3dfc9d3c8cc58e8332dfb8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie and Dina dance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie and Dina dance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="59fbc26bcc3dfc9d3c8cc58e8332dfb8" data-recommend-id="image://59fbc26bcc3dfc9d3c8cc58e8332dfb8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie and Dina dance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The moment is cut short, however, as the town bigot Seth (Robert John Burke) interrupts the moment of ecstasy with judgemental scolding and a slur for good measure. Joel intervenes and shoves him to the ground, which leads Ellie to lash out in embarrassment. The two clearly have some baggage to unpack, but that’s a conversation for another episode.</p><p>Most of <em>The Last of Us</em>’ second season just made me appreciate the original game all the more for its stellar performances and understated writing. The dance scene had a similar effect, but it was also a nice break from all the overexplaining and monologuing that plague the show. Sometimes, the script you started with is perfect and doesn’t need any additional notes. Though they are few and far between, I’m glad that <em>The Last of Us </em>has at least a few moments where it recognizes that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
