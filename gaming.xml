            <p>
Alan Wake developers Remedy have announced their very first multiplayer game, a three-person co-op <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> set in the world of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control">Control</a> and thereby, the Remedy Connected Universe. Previously codenamed Condor, it's called FBC: Firebreak - and I am going to immediately recommend they shorten it to Firebreak, because that caps-into-colon combo is going to wind me up when I'm writing news posts at speed. While I'm throwing my weight around, let me also <em>instantly</em> rebut the pedants who are even now racing to leave a comment saying that, actually, Remedy did work on Smilegate's multiplayer shooter CrossfireX. Yes, they did, but only the single player bits. 
</p>
<p>
Anyway, Firebreak! Here's the announcement trailer.

As detailed by <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/17/fbc-firebreak-control-xbox-partner-preview/">an Xbox Wire post</a>, Firebreak casts you as a first responder working for the Federal Bureau of Control - that is, a crack paranormal exterminator who must stop extra-dimensional terrors invading the FBC's shape-shifting Brutalist headquarters, the Oldest House. Firebreak members can equip Overwatch-style "ultimates" in the shape of Altered World objects that have "paranatural" properties.</p><p>These are to be used more carefully than the average video game ultimate, according to Remedy comms boss Thomas Puha. "I like to think of them as a jaguar in a box," he told the Wire. "You carry the box, you point it at something, you open the box, and you just kind of hope the jaguar doesn't turn around and eat you or your friends instead."
</p>
<p>Schrödinger's Jaguar, then? Yes, this is commendably Control-esque.</p>
<p>
Firebreak will evolve over time with post-release content, but Puha is reluctant to call it a game-as-a-service, with all the associated baggage. "FBC: Firebreak should be easy to get into and quickly understandable, not feel like a second job or that you have to spend an hour setting up your loadouts etc. before you get into a session," he told the site. "This is not that game. It's a pick-up-and-play experience [about] having fun with your friends when you have the time. That's not to say that FBC: Firebreak doesn't have deep player progression and things to unlock, it does, but this isn't about logging in every day for some loot or fear of missing out on materials."</p>
<p>Firebreak does have some kind of narrative component - it's set after the events of Control, and as such, presumably harkens forward to the events of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a>. It'll try for a similar balance of absurdity and horror in its writing and atmosphere. But it's not the same kind of story-driven game. 
</p><p>
"For the people who are keeping up with the single-player journey, we wanted to make sure that FBC: Firebreak was a legitimate and impactful part of that history and lore," game director Mike Kayatta comments in the Xbox Wire piece. "The narrative style you've seen in our previous games just wasn't ever going to work here, for this kind of game. When you think about these differences in FBC: Firebreak's gameplay - world over story, multiplayer over single-player, voice-chatting with your teammates, action over exploration and so on - you can probably see why it was important that we made FBC: Firebreak a stand-alone experience."
</p>
<p>
"That said, you will see more of Control's world," he went on. "More of the Federal Bureau of Control. Meet more of the people who work there. Explore more of the Oldest House. Run into more weird stuff. And importantly, experience this world, old and new, from a completely different perspective."</p>
<p>What do you make of it all? Much as I dread anything halfway live-servicey these days, I've always felt the Oldest House would be a natural setting for such a game - it's a monstrous labyrinth that slops between realities in a way germane to the introduction of new foes, stories and areas. Just, please don't ruin it by turning it into a content factory.

                <p>Dbrand's Darkplates are among the best third-party console covers for the PS5. Up until now, Darkplates have only been available for the original PS5 and PS5 Digital, but now PS5 Slim users can change the look of their console with Darkplates, too. The <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15048490%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Flimited-edition%2Fps5&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fdbrands-awesome-ps5-console-covers-are-now-available-for-ps5-slim%2F1100-6527213%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new PS5 Slim Darkplates</a></strong> are only available in black at the moment, but you can purchase add-ons to give your PS5 Slim a unique look, including skins to wrap around the middle of the console, lightstrips, and a custom-designed stand. Dbrand is offering a launch deal that drops the starting price for a pair of Darkplates to $60 (was $70) for PS5 Slim and PS5 Slim Digital.</p><hr><h2>Dbrand PS5 Slim Darkplates</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4386304-ps5plates.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4386304" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4386304-ps5plates.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4386304"></a><figcaption>Dbrand PS5 Darkplates</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4386304-ps5plates.jpg"></figure><p>Given the company's <em>colorful </em>interactions <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-threatens-legal-action-against-custom-ps5-plate-company-that-asked-for-it/1100-6497163/" data-ref-id="1100-6497163">with Sony and its legal team</a> in the past, Dbrand says these console covers are "indisputably" original when compared to the standard white ones on a PS5, and they feature a few welcome tweaks as well.</p><p>First up, Dbrand's covers don't feature extra panels like the PS5 ones do--allowing for a cleaner appearance overall--and the horizontal stand uses a durable set of magnets to attach to the PS5 instead of the notoriously flimsy plastic pegs Sony currently offers. As an added bonus, you can complement your Darkplates with additional accessories that'll further alter your console's look.</p><p>The middle skins are made of high-quality microfiber cloth and cost $15 right now (was $25). We haven't tested the skins for the PS5 Slim Darkplates, but we've been impressed by the quality of the skins for the launch-model PS5. They are cut to sit flush against the the glossy middle portion of the PS5 and don't interfere with any buttons or ports. After applying our first skin, we waited a few weeks before removing it and were pleased to see it didn't leave any residue or marks. Then we stuck a new skin to the console, which we have kept on it for over a year without any signs of peeling.</p><p>There are six middle skins to choose from. One of the coolest options is a graphic showing what your PS5 looks like under an X-Ray machine. You can choose between dark and light X-Ray renders. Other standout options include the Warzone skin, which has a blue foundation accented by swirling red lines, and Obsidian, a black skin with a pearlescent look. If you want to keep things simple while still removing the glossiness from your PS5 Slim, Matte Black and Triple Black skins are available, too.</p><p>If you want to change the color of the lighting effects along the edges of your console, two-packs of lightstrips in red, purple, green, and blue are available for $10 each (was $12). A combo pack featuring Vapor Pink and Wave Blue lightstrips is $15 (was $18). There's also the Retro Pack for $16, and this one comes with sets of lightstrips in Fire Orange, Ice Blue, and Atomic Purple.</p><p>Dbrand's stand is $10 and can be used to display your PS5 Slim sideways or upright.</p><p>You may be wondering if Dbrand's Darkplates for PS5 Slim Digital will work with the PS5 Pro. The answer seems to be no, but the official console covers for PS5 Slim aren't expected to be compatible with the PS5 Pro either. Sony hasn't announced alternative console cover options for its upcoming console, so if you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-preorders-live-at-amazon-walmart-and-best-buy/1100-6526406/" data-ref-id="1100-6526406">preorder the PS5 Pro</a>, you will likely need to rock the default white console covers until PlayStation or third-party manufacturers like Dbrand release new designs.</p><p><strong>Where to preorder PS5 Pro</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Preorder new DualSense Chroma Controllers ahead of next month's launch</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4386035-darkplates-attachedstand.png" data-ref-id="1300-4386035" data-ratio="0.66650390625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4386035-darkplates-attachedstand.png" data-ref-id="1300-4386035"></a><figcaption>Dbrand Darkplate for the slimmer PS5</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4386035-darkplates-attachedstand.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4386036-darkplates-digitaledition.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4386037-darkplates-frontview.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4386038-darkplates-hero.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4386039-darkplates-lightstrips.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4386040-darkplates-packaging.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4386041-darkplates-standalonestand.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4386042-darkplates-vents.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4386043-darkplatesfortheps5slim.png" data-ref-id="1300-4386036,1300-4386037,1300-4386038,1300-4386039,1300-4386040,1300-4386041,1300-4386042,1300-4386043" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4386036-darkplates-digitaledition.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4386037-darkplates-frontview.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4386038-darkplates-hero.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4386039-darkplates-lightstrips.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4386040-darkplates-packaging.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4386041-darkplates-standalonestand.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4386042-darkplates-vents.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4386043-darkplatesfortheps5slim.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4386036-darkplates-digitaledition.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4386037-darkplates-frontview.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4386038-darkplates-hero.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4386039-darkplates-lightstrips.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4386040-darkplates-packaging.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4386041-darkplates-standalonestand.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4386042-darkplates-vents.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4386043-darkplatesfortheps5slim.png"></figure><p>While there's no Darkplate for the PS5 Pro yet--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-preorders-live-at-amazon-walmart-and-best-buy/1100-6526406/" data-ref-id="1100-6526406">after all, it's only out next month</a>--you can pick up some DarkPlates that have a retro-influenced design. <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-15048490%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Flimited-edition%2Fretro-darkplates%3Fcategory%3Ddisc&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fdbrands-awesome-ps5-console-covers-are-now-available-for-ps5-slim%2F1100-6527213%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">These translucent covers</a> are available in purple, blue, and smokey black, and are on sale for $69 (was $79).</p>

            <p>
Double Eleven, the long-time steward of Paradox Interactive's Prison Architect series before the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-developer-double-eleven-parts-way-with-paradox-after-nine-years-on-series">two companies parted ways</a> earlier this year, has announced its next project: multiplayer shooter Blindfire, which launches into early access for Xbox Series X/S and PC today.
</p>
<p>
Blindfire is a team-based arena shooter for up to eight players, that, as far as its basic narrative goes, sees players entering an illicit bloodsport run by the ultra-wealthy in order to secure riches and glory. Thankfully, its action is considerably more inventive, with Blindfire aiming to set itself apart by having the whole thing take place in absolute darkness.
</p>
<p>
Double Eleven, introducing Blindfire on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/17/blindfire-xbox-partner-preview/">Xbox Wire</a>, says the pitch-black twist emphasises "slower, more tactical play", with kills "less about pure shooting prowess, and more about clever use of environmental cues". To help navigate the darkness and locate opponents, players can utilise their room-scanning Echo mechanic, briefly revealing the outline of their surroundings. However, there's more to consider when simply firing a weapon - triggering a loud gun shot and muzzle flash - immediately reveals an attacker's position.

<p>
And there's more to be mindful of too; as a round unfolds, light elements are slowly brought into play, starting from the outer walls of the arena to its centre - flushing out players camping in secluded corners and forcing everyone into closer confines.
</p><p>
Central to Blindfire is Bodycount mode, which features Free-For-All and Team variants, and challenges player to score the most points across five rounds. Skilful play - such as headshots, multi-kills, first blood, or surviving without taking damage - awards bonus points, but combatants need to be cautious as they only get one life per round. On the plus side, eliminated players gain access to night-vision cameras, revealing the arena in all its vibrant, blacklit glory. And at this point, they're able to manipulate its traps to influence a match or to seek revenge.
</p>
<p>
Double Eleven plans to add new weapons throughout Blindfire's early access development, but the initial version only features two: The Mantis, an "accurate, powerful pistol", and the rapid-fire Abolition shotgun. The studio says its current goal is to focus on Blindfire's unique tactical elements, with victory coming from strategy and execution rather than gear.
</p>
<p>
And if the promise of murderous shenanigans in the dark has you at all intrigued, Blindfire launches into Xbox Series X/S and PC early access today <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/blindfire-game-preview/9NR81PCSLLB6/0010">via the Microsoft Store</a>. It's reasonably priced too, costing just £7.99, but if you'd rather try before you buy, a free trial is also available.
</p>
<p>
Double Eleven was previously developing Prison Architect 2 for Paradox Interactive, having taken the reins of the popular management series in 2019. However, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-must-refocus-to-rebuild-trust-and-survive-bosses-say-after-life-by-you-cancellation">increasingly erratic</a> Paradox <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-developer-double-eleven-parts-way-with-paradox-after-nine-years-on-series">parted way</a> with Double Eleven back in May, saying it "could not find a commercial agreement that worked for both parties". Since then, Prison Architect 2 seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-2-indefinitely-delayed-by-paradox">repeated delays</a>, with no release date currently in sight. Blindfire will be Double Eleven's first original IP.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/17/fbc-firebreak-brings-three-player-co-op-to-the-federal-bureau-of-control/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Remedy Entertainment shared a first look at FBC: Firebreak (codename <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/project-condor">Condor</a>) their very first multiplayer game that looks to explore the Control universe from a new direction.</p>
<p>FBC: Firebreak is coming to Xbox Series X|S, and PC in 2025. It’s day one on applicable tiers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>. It should also be coming to PS5, based on the old Project Condor announcements, but that was not featured in this reveal.</p>
<p><iframe title="FBC: Firebreak – Official Announcement Trailer | Xbox Partner Preview October 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tBO__RWUbKM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Expanding on the Remedy-verse, FBC: Firebreak takes place within the Federal Bureau of Control and is set after the events of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control">Control</a>, giving teams of three players daring missions to undertake against dark threats to the supernatural institution that is The Oldest House. You’re part of a team of first responders within the bureau, racing to take on paranormal threats.</p>
<p>A lot is still being kept under wraps, such as player progression and how you’ll deal with the dangers, but speaking to <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/17/fbc-firebreak-control-xbox-partner-preview/">Xbox Wire</a>, Communications Director, Thomas Puha did illuminate slightly: “What I can say is that the Firebreak crew has been cleared to carry ‘paranatural augments,’ which are Altered Items engineered into tool attachments.</p>

<p>“Like the Garden Gnome you saw in the trailer. These are more or less our take on ‘ultimates’ and are not to be taken lightly. I like to think of them as a jaguar in a box [laughs]. You carry the box, you point it at something, you open the box, and you just kind of hope the jaguar doesn’t turn around and eat you or your friends instead.”</p>
<p>One important aspect is that Remedy will aim to be mindful of gamers’ time. Puha said, “FBC: Firebreak should be easy to get into and quickly understandable, not feel like a second job or that you have to spend an hour setting up your loadouts etc. before you get into a session. This is not that game. It’s a pick-up-and-play experience [about] having fun with your friends when you have the time. That’s not to say that FBC: Firebreak doesn’t have deep player progression and things to unlock, it does, but this isn’t about logging in every day for some loot or fear of missing out on materials.”</p>
<p>While looking to avoid the Game as a Service tag, FBC: Firebreak will have post-launch content with a steady stream of updates for players that will aim to keep the game fresh and give good reasons to return. I assume we can think more Helldivers 2 or Deep Rock Galactic than the all-consuming time sinks of Destiny 2 and World of Warcraft.</p>

In addition to new features like tools that let developers to target mobile web, the game engine maker is also promising that it will dedicate “long-term” resources to “to enhance feature sets and deliver new functionality while maintaining ease of upgrade and continued stability,” <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241017906915/en/Unity-6-Launches-Globally-Next-Gen-Game-Development-Platform-Delivers-Enhanced-Performance-and-Stability/?feedref=JjAwJuNHiystnCoBq_hl-RqSGyeNvWF-qZ8hKEMz48Z5g0wAIXjK73252wRUvTxLWJT50v2g3Ei-19qH0fyPszGrim8IhAkVNXbaI1AGppOzkqEXpa07kut2m9xviGvGKzEpgVj8oZTJfPwAW_-x3g==">according to a press release</a>.</p><p>Unity is a widely-used game development engine powering games like <em>Among Us,</em> <em>Hollow Knight</em>, and many more, but the release of Unity 6 follows a turbulent period in the company’s history. Unity charges developers on a per-user basis, but in September 2023, the company announced a new pricing scheme that charged developers per install of their games after a certain threshold. The change could have potentially added significant costs for developers, and many expressed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/14/23872330/unity-developers-react-new-pricing-model">significant frustrations</a>.</p><div><p>While Unity made <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/22/23882768/unity-new-pricing-model-update">some changes</a> to the planned per-install model in response to the outcry, CEO John Riccitiello <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/10/23911338/unity-ceo-steps-down-developers-react">announced his retirement shortly after</a> and was replaced in May by former Zynga and EA exec <a href="https://investors.unity.com/news/news-details/2024/Unity-Appoints-Matthew-Bromberg-as-New-CEO/default.aspx">Matthew Bromberg</a>. Then, last month, Unity announced that it was canceling its plans for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242937/unity-runtime-fee-cancelled-subscription-pricing">runtime fee entirely</a>.</p></div><p>“With the release of Unity 6, we’re interested in reconnecting with customers and help them understand that it’s our commitment to deliver what matters to them, and that we’re going to be a fundamentally different company in that regard,” <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/17/unity-releases-unity-6-ceo-matt-brombergs-first-big-product-launch.html">Bromberg says to CNBC</a>.</p><p>Unity also needs to stay in the good graces of developers as it faces continued competition from Epic Games’ Unreal Engine.

If you don’t optimize your city layout, choose the correct research, or top up supplies frequently, your run ultimately ends in disaster. <em>Frostpunk 2 </em>innovates and expands upon the core premise of the original game, but streamlines much of the experience with its new district-building system. For some, it’s an unforgivable mistake.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/arma-4-bohemia-2027/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>During the company’s 25th anniversary celebration, Bohemia Interactive revealed that Arma 4 is coming in 2027. It has been more than a decade since Arma 3 was released, and since then, the team has kept the game chugging along with content drops and expansions. It’s one of the most beloved tactical shooter franchises ever, and in 2027, it’ll <strong>evolve</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-long-time-to-wait">Long Time To Wait</h2>



<p>Bohemia Interactive has pulled off a Bethesda Game Studios and announced a game <strong>years </strong>before it’s set to launch. Who remembers the Elder Scrolls VI trailer? This is the same – Bohemia flashed up the Arma 4 logo while panning over a landscape.</p>



<p>It’s at the latter end of this video, which is a two-hour-long orchestral performance hosted in celebration of Bohemia’s quarter-century anniversary:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="25th Anniversary Concert" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cC-uT5rc9HQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Fortunately, Arma 3 has barely aged a day, so you’ve got plenty of meat on the bones of that game to keep you on ice until Arma 4 arrives in 2027.</p>



<p>This news comes around two years after Bohemia Interactive revealed it was working on Arma 4, and it was about the same time that the firm released Arma Reforger. This was an attempt to test the waters with a new Arma engine, and modders <strong>ran wild </strong>on the platform. Now that the groundwork has been laid, Arma 4 has a release window – even if it’s a drastically wide one.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Bohemia Interactive recently celebrated the launch of DayZ’s Frostline expansion, in case you’re interested.</p>

Remedy have released the first proper in-game trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>'s second expansion, The Lake House. It's billed as even more of a horror experience than the base game, and takes place in a research facility run by the Lynchian ghostbuster organisation you may have encountered in Remedy's paranormal shooter Control. As such, the expansion forms a direct connection between the games, and may - read: definitely will - harbour a few clues about the story of the forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a>.

<p>
In The Lake House you play Federal Bureau Of Control agent Kiran Estevez, who appears briefly in the main game. She's travelled to the Lake House to make inquiries about Wake, but arrives to find the place smashed-up, flooded and full of gawky Slender Man-esque munsters, the Painted. You'll be able to access the expansion's missions directly from the main menu, if you've already completed Alan Wake 2. If you haven't, you'll find them woven into the base campaign.
</p>
<p>
Where Alan Wake 2's first expansion was more of a compilation of weird vignettes, The Lake House is all about scares. "When we originally came up with the concepts for [first expansion] Night Springs and The Lake House, we knew that they would be quite different tonally," Kyle Rowley explains in <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/17/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-expansion-xbox-partner-preview/">an Xbox Wire post</a>. "Night Springs episodes were all about these kind of crazy 'What If?' scenarios where we could explore some rather unique ideas that were sometimes quite a dramatic tonal shift from the main experience in Alan Wake 2. With The Lake House, we wanted to again lean into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> side of things." The best comparison from Alan Wake 2's main storyline is the Valhalla Nursing Home section, apparently. As for the plot connections to Control, Remedy suggest that Control character Dylan Faden may be involved.
</p><p>
The new Painted monsters have a knack for getting behind you. According to Rowley, they "can move in and out of the supernatural paint on surfaces, hunting the player as they do so and have devastating melee attacks that deal significant amounts of damage." As for what Estevez brings to the party, she doesn't have the same abilities as Saga and Alan, but she does have "a new FBC-specific weapon" which is tailored towards spooks. Her base weapons also deal more damage than Saga's.
</p>
<p>
Where the previous Night Springs was more broken-up, this will play more like a "traditional survival horror game", Rowley says. "There is a large open structure for the player to explore, secrets to discover and dangerous enemies to try and survive against. Narrative obviously plays a large role in the expansion - as it did in the main game - so it is definitely worth exploring and trying to locate the many narrative objects scattered throughout the environment." 
</p>
<p>
So when's it out? 22nd October 2024 - oh hey, that's next week. I still haven't 100% finished Alan Wake 2. Time to get the lead out. As for Control 2, as of August it had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/control-2-condor-and-the-max-payne-remakes-are-shaping-up-just-fine-say-remedy">"progressed to the production readiness stage"</a>, after the development team turned in "a build of the game showcasing several important features in playable form".

The big contamination suits, chunky guns, and welding mask give it a light but undeniable <em>BioShock</em>-vibe in my opinion. There’s no release date just yet, however.</p><p>Take a look:</p><p>Players spent <em>Control</em>’s story campaign navigating the Oldest House, a serpentine homage to brutalist architecture and bureaucracy-infused horror. <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> will bring them back, taking place after the events of the original game, to play what seems to be a clean up crew who need to purge the Hiss—otherworldly evils—from its various office cubicles and underground labyrinths. Players will also get to harness powerful artifacts on their missions. </p><p> “What I can say is that the Firebreak crew has been cleared to carry ‘paranatural augments,’ which are Altered Items engineered into tool attachments,” Remedy communications director Thoma Puha said in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/17/fbc-firebreak-control-xbox-partner-preview/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/17/fbc-firebreak-control-xbox-partner-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an announcement</a></span> on the Xbox Wire blog. “Like the Garden Gnome you saw in the trailer. These are more or less our take on ‘ultimates’ and are not to be taken lightly. I like to think of them as a jaguar in a box [laughs]. You carry the box, you point it at something, you open the box, and you just kind of hope the jaguar doesn’t turn around and eat you or your friends instead.”</p><figure id="" data-id="24ae53c6aaca805d19cba9af037ca671" data-recommend-id="image://24ae53c6aaca805d19cba9af037ca671" data-format="jpg" data-width="1900" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A clean up crew prepares to fight horrors.

The goal is to make it easy to hop in and experience new stuff without making it feel like a second job. “It’s a pick-up-and-play experience [about] having fun with your friends when you have the time,” Puha said. “That’s not to say that<em> FBC: Firebreak</em> doesn’t have deep player progression and things to unlock, it does, but this isn’t about logging in every day for some loot or fear of missing out on materials.</p><p>If the spin-off can leverage the haunting environments and beautifully creepy vibes of <em>Control</em> to deliver some fun co-op action, that might be enough.

The set itself opens up and contains several modular sections, with areas that include Jean Grey’s Lab and the Danger Room. Then there’s the Sentinel attacking the school from the outside.

                <p>The God of War TV series at Prime Video is undergoing a major change. A new report confirmed that Sony Pictures TV and Amazon MGM Studios are starting over on the show from scratch after a trio of the show's key creative team left the project.</p><p><a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/god-of-war-sony-executive-producers-depart-new-writers-joining-1236118075/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deadline </a>reported that showrunner and executive producer Rafe Judkins has left the series, alongside executive producers Hawk Ostby and Mark Fergus. They are said to have submitted multiple scripts for the show, and one source said the scripts were "praised by both Sony and Prime." However, the decision apparently came down to "move in a different creative direction."</p><p>The God of War series was announced in December 2022 but never got any meaningful development updates since then, prompting fans to wonder and worry about its status.</p><p>Going forward, the report said Sony and Prime are now looking to hire a "whole new writers room" for the show, and given that, no one should expect the God of War show to debut anytime soon. However, Deadline said God of War continues to be an "important asset" for Prime.</p><p>As for the god of War game series, 2022's God of War Ragnarok was the latest entry in the series, and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-ending-the-norse-saga-after-two-games-is-like-the-lord-of-the-rings-box-set-barlog-says/1100-6496283/" data-ref-id="1100-6496283">wrapped up the Norse saga</a>. It's one of Sony's most popular and beloved franchises, so it's likely not a matter of if but when a new game is announced.</p><p>Beyond a new God of War game, developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-developer-sony-santa-monica-is-reportedly-working-on-a-new-ip/1100-6525531/" data-ref-id="1100-6525531">Sony Santa Monica could be making a new IP.</a></p>

<p>A new trailer shown during today's Xbox Partner Showcase provided the first look at the very first multiplayer game developed by the Finnish development studio which, in no way, is a Control DLC and not its sequel, according to Game Director Mike Kayatta.</p>
<p><iframe title="FBC: Firebreak – Official Announcement Trailer | Xbox Partner Preview October 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tBO__RWUbKM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><em>FBC: Firebreak is a 3-player cooperative first-person shooter set within the enigmatic Federal Bureau of Control (FBC). As the Bureau’s headquarters faces a deadly and prolonged siege by otherworldly forces, only Firebreak—its most adaptable response unit—has the skills and courage to restore order.</em></p>
<p>In a new preview posted on&nbsp;<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/17/fbc-firebreak-control-xbox-partner-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Wire</a>, Remedy Communications Director Thomas Puha provided a quick overview of the game, saying that FBC Firebreak will be a game that will be easy to get into, featuring multiple hectic co-op missions that will showcase Remedy's creativity fans have come to know over the years.&nbsp;While taking on paranormal threats as the responders of the Federal Bureau of Control, players won't fail to notice how the studio's DNA will be evident right from the start, despite the game not looking that different from other modern co-op FPS games.</p>
<p>FBC Firebreak will launch sometime in 2025 on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. The game will also be available from day one on Xbox Game Pass.</p>

            <p>
Developers Unknown Worlds and publishers Krafton have given us our first proper look at their next open world exploration sim, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>, which will launch on PC via Xbox Game Preview in 2025. It'll support four player co-op, alongside the returning singleplayer survive-o-buildy experience, and it'll take place on a brand new planet. Here's the reveal trailer.

"Whether you're bringing the experience of your previous adventures with you, or are new to the Subnautica games, you'll get to explore lush new environments, encounter fascinating creatures around every corner, and uncover the secrets at the core of this mysterious planet," comments a post on the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/17/subnautica-2-xbox-partner-preview/">Xbox NewsWire</a>. "But as familiar as things might seem to seasoned players at first glance, Subnautica 2 will offer new and unique experiences that will keep you on your... fins."
</p>
<p>
As for the "hotly requested" co-op multiplayer, it'll come with the initial Xbox Game Preview launch next year. The developers are careful to point out that if you're one of "those who prefer the eerily beautiful solitude of solo play, Subnautica 2 will still provide that familiar experience, and prove equally as challenging."
</p><p>
Beyond that, expect "new and improved tools, vehicles, and base building" and "a whole host of creatures big and small, the likes of which have never been seen before". I imagine that's one of the new critters in the trailer - a leviathan of some kind, by the looks of things, with bioluminescent fittings and tentacles.</p>
<p>Sure sounds like a sequel, doesn't it? It's nice to have this one out in the open, finally - the developers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-subnautica-2-developers-are-hiding-teaser-images-in-the-first-games-time-capsules">have been releasing teaser images of Subnautica 2 in the first game's time capsules</a>. To answer the obvious question - I don't know whether this means it's not coming to Steam, Epic Games Store or other PC storefronts, but it sounds like it's a Microsoft-only joint for the minute.

<p>During Tuesday’s Xbox Partner Preview event, Double Eleven revealed its brand new game Blindfire. In addition, the game has launched in early access on Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>



<p>The game is available for $8.99 on Xbox, Steam, and Epic Games Store. A PlayStation version will launch later this year.</p>



<p>Blindfire is a first-person arena shooter where everything is dark and overall visuals are limited. Players have to rely on their abilities and senses in order to find opponents and take them out.</p>

<p>In speaking with <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/17/blindfire-xbox-partner-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a>, lead designer Matt Dunthorne explained that the idea for the game came from one of the company’s “Shatterday” exercises where groups within the company come up with hypothetical challenges.</p>



<p>“As soon as I heard the pitch, I knew it was something special – there was electricity in the room when they spoke about it and I couldn’t get it out of my head for days afterwards,” Dunthorne said. “The beautiful thing about the concept in my opinion is how pure the core idea is, there is no fluff or excess and it can be explained in a single sentence.”&nbsp;</p>







<p>The game features a main mode called Bodycount that is played either as a team or Free-For-All. The matches support up to eight players at a time.</p>



<p>Within the game, Blindfire utilizes an echo mechanic that shows the outline of your immediate surroundings to help find enemies and keep your bearings in order. There’s also a “Last Known Position” ability that will show the latest steps of opponents. </p>



<p>Regarding weapons, Double Eleven has every player using the same abilities and weapons at the start of early access. There is a pistol call the Mantis and a shotgun called Abolition. More weapons will be added as the game develops, but the goal is to not have what they call traditional loadouts for players.</p>
