            <p>Back in April, I wrote about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/esa-lawyer-frets-about-some-sort-of-terrifying-online-arcade-if-preservation-is-made-easier">a hearing that took place</a> between representatives <a href="https://gamehistory.org/">Video Game History Foundation</a>, the <a href="https://www.newmuseum.org/pages/view/rhizome">Rhizome project</a>, and the <a href="https://www.softwarepreservationnetwork.org/">Software Preservation Network</a>, in which they argued the case for a DMCA exemption that would allow researchers to remotely access out-of-print games in libraries and archives. Representatives from the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Access_Content_System">AACS</a> were in opposition, with ESA legal representative Steve Englund at one point fretting about some sort of hellish "online arcade that (he’d) been warning about for the last several proceedings".</p>
<p>Last Friday, <a href="https://gamehistory.org/dmca-2024-statement/">as per a statement</a> released by the VGHF and spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/us-copyright-law-forces-researchers-to-explore-extra-legal-methods-for-game-preservation-say-historians-who-are-disappointed-after-being-denied-a-dmca-exemption">PC Gamer</a>, the US Copyright Office officially denied the exemption.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><em>*Checks our editorial policy on commenting on such matters</em>*. Tossers! Ah well - the VGHF aren’t too fazed, at least.</p>
<p>"While we are disappointed by the Copyright Office’s decision, we have no regrets about going through this process," write the VGHF. "Over the last three years, working on the petition has helped us generate important research, notably our Survey of the Video Game Reissue Market in the United States report, which proved that around <a href="https://gamehistory.org/87percent/">87 percent of video games</a> released in the United States before 2010 remain out of print."</p><p>"The game industry’s absolutist position—which the ESA’s own members have <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-piracy-fears-are-keeping-some-researchers-from-accessing-the-games-they-need">declined to go on the record to support</a>—forces researchers to explore extra-legal methods to access the vast majority of out-of-print video games that are otherwise unavailable," they continue. "We’re not done fighting here. We will continue our advocacy for greater access and legal allowances for video game preservation and working with members of the game industry to increase internal awareness around these issues."</p>
<p>"We might be coming full circle back to piracy being something that we need to be literate in, in order to be able to access the things that we love," The VGHF’s Frank Cifaldi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/piracy-preservation-and-the-devs-who-dont-mind-if-you-have-to-pirate-their-game">told me in January</a>. "Digital streaming scooped everything up and we all got content with it. We're already seeing things wiped from existence before our eyes."</p>
<p>Back in May, Warren Spector <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deus-ex-creator-warren-spector-has-literally-dumpster-dived-to-help-with-game-preservation">wrote about how</a> he’d "literally dumpster dived" to help with game preservation.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-gets-newest-patch-6-update-focusing-on-performance-improvements-for-older-amd-cpus/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>God of War Ragnarök PC has received a new patch update, explicitly focusing on performance improvements for AMD's "older" CPUs, notably Zen1 and Zen2.</p>
<p>God of War Ragnarök was indeed a significant port by Jetpack Interactive when it comes to debuting with optimized performance and a bug-free experience, and with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-patch-4-frame-generation-improvements/">constant patch updates released by the developers</a> post-launch, it certainly has made the title a refined piece, especially when compared against other PC ports. Now, the latest Patch 6 (via <a href="https://steamdb.info/patchnotes/16143442/">SteamDB</a>) has brought in further refinements, explicitly focusing on consumers with older AMD CPUs, and has provided performance improvements in areas where the game was "CPU limited."</p>
<h4 id="updates"><em><strong>Updates</strong></em></h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed a crash in UI when opening certain Journal pages</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed a crash that could happen when controllers get disabled or enabled in rapid succession</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed a crash that would occur in various locations in Vanaheim</em></li>
<li><em>Improved performance of AMD Zen1 and Zen2 processors in areas where the game was CPU limited</em></li>
<li><em>Increased tessellation in Realm Between Realms back to PS5 quality</em></li>
<li><em>Note that the performance issue related to tessellation is resolved in NVIDIA drivers 565.90 or higher</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where lock on would rapidly bounce between targets when using mouse. It will now be more "sticky" requiring more effort to change targets</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where attack indicators would not look correct when using frame generation</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where cinematic dialogue audio would be lower volume than intended</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from the performance improvements, the new Update 6 also brings fixes to crashes in locations such as Vanaheim and enhancements to the UI of certain Journal Pages. There have also been optimizations with Frame Generation, so the update is constructive for improving user experience. We haven't seen the improvements the new update has brought in with older AMD CPUs, but we shouldn't expect out-of-the-roof bumps in performance.</p>
<p>Steam will automatically download the update when you get the title running next time, and if you haven't experienced the game yet, you can learn more about the latest entry in the series by checking out our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/">&nbsp;review.</a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/mrbeast-allegations-fbi/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rosanna-pansino-sends-mrbeast-allegations-to-the-fbi.1020765/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/mrbeast-allegations-fbi/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Rosanna Pansino’s crusade against Jimmy ‘MrBeast’ Donaldson and his team has reached a new level as she forwarded her recent allegations to the FBI for further investigation. It started with Pansino slamming MrBeast’s new ‘Lunchly’ line for containing mould, and now, she has obtained and shared details of a claimed ‘official MrBeast work chat’.</p>



<p>In this chat, thousands of messages are revealed, many of which are ‘inappropriate, especially for a company that targets children’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-another-one">Another One</h2>



<p>Earlier this year, MrBeast came under scrutiny when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ava-kris-tyson-predator-allegations/">‘Ava Kris Tyson’</a>, a close member of his team, was outed by allegations of ‘sexual messaging with a minor’, which the creator partially admitted to before leaving MrBeast’s production team.</p>



<p>One of the most damning claims from Pansino is that MrBeast <strong>must have </strong>known about Tyson’s behaviour given the nature of some of the messages and memes shared in the chat she obtained. Per her report in a recent video, she has ‘verified the legitimacy of these chats’, but some MrBeast fans have claimed it’s nothing more than a smear campaign.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have reported what I found and my concerns to the authorities <a href="https://twitter.com/FBI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@FBI</a>.  Hopefully they will look into these  MrBeast Telegram Company Chats Logs and other concerns. <a href="https://twitter.com/YouTube?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Youtube</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TeamYouTube</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mrbeast?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#mrbeast</a></p>— Rosanna Pansino (@RosannaPansino) <a href="https://twitter.com/RosannaPansino/status/1850650883027239117?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>In August, it was revealed that MrBeast’s channel suffered a monumental revenue and performance decrease as various controversies surfaced. After the news about Ava Kris Tyson, other participants in MrBeast’s videos came forward to make claims of human rights abuses and poor working conditions while working with the super-sized creator.</p>



<p>It was estimated that in August 2024, amid the scandals, his channel lost around $2.6 million in expected revenue, based on estimations and prior performance. </p>



<p>MrBeast’s team is yet to respond to Rosanna Pansino’s allegations.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/tim-walz-crazy-taxi-aoc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since we found out back in August that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/us/tim-walz-coach.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tim Walz’s wife made him give up his Sega Dreamcast</a>, folks have been obsessed with the idea that the Democratic vice presidential nominee is a fan of <em>Crazy Taxi</em>. We’ve had <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vp-candidate-tim-walz-was-a-big-dreamcast-fan-and-we-think-weve-found-his-favorite-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investigations</a> into the matter, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/crazy-taxi-dreamcast-tim-walz-fan-sega-mod-kamala-vp-1851647426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">modders</a> adding him to the game. Today, Walz played <em>Crazy Taxi</em> on a stream with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p><p>Walz and AOC were mainly streaming <em>Madden</em> (unlike his stream of <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tim-walz-stream-twitch-play-world-of-warcraft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>World of Warcraft</em></a> earlier this month, Walz was actually playing), when they took a break to play some <em>Crazy Taxi</em> with Walz at the wheel. Before the game started, Walz <a href="https://x.com/Tim_Walz/status/1850685533464244276" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explained</a> that since he was a school teacher at the time he got the Dreamcast, he thought the recently-released <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> might be “a little bit harsh, so there was a game similar to it: <em>Crazy Taxi</em>.”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Tim Walz Plays Crazy Taxi with AOC #trending #explore" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UGZa1Mgb-GE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>“Am I getting really punked hard on the comments?” he asked, before detailing how he bought a Dreamcast because it was “the first time I had a real job, I was like an adult, and I had money.” He continued that his wife didn’t approve, “so I brought it to the office, and my wife said ‘you need to get rid of it and be like a real person’ or whatever, and I put it on Facebook or whatever, and the intern picked it up.”’ That intern, I presume, was Tom Johnson, who told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vp-candidate-tim-walz-was-a-big-dreamcast-fan-and-we-think-weve-found-his-favorite-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN</a>’s Rebekah Valentine that after Walz brought the Dreamcast into the office, Johnson ultimately took it with him to college. Johnson seemed to remember the console having a copy of <em>Crazy Taxi</em>, which is where this whole obsession started.&nbsp;</p><p>“I don’t remember exactly how that story went,” Walz explained of the discrepancies in the narrative, before worrying playfully, “I probably should: The Republicans will, like, accuse me of never having a Dreamcast or something, you know how they are.”</p><p>“I don’t think anyone can watch you play this and say you never had a Dreamcast,” AOC said of Walz’s performance, having watched him mow through pedestrians and smash into buildings. </p><p>"Our politics can be joyful, fun, everybody can participate," Walz said after his run ended. Then they both wondered if Walz would be the first Vice President to play games, with Walz saying "I don't think Dan Quayle was gaming." I look forward to Reb's investigation into that question.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/league-worlds-grand-final-t1-bilibili/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Following an intense knockout stage that has unravelled over two weeks, the grand finalists have been revealed in the League of Legends World Championship 2024. For the trophy, and the $445,000 grand prize, <strong>Bilibili and T1</strong> will face off on November 2, live in London at the O2 Arena.</p>



<p>This could be the ultimate opportunity for Faker to secure his <strong>fifth </strong>world championship title, forever cementing him as one of the greatest esports competitors of all time.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-heavy-is-the-crown">Heavy is the Crown</h2>



<p>It has been one hell of a journey to get this far. This year’s League of Legends World Championship event started on September 25, and there’s still just under a week until it’s all wrapped up. When that day comes, either Bilibili Gaming will have claimed its first LoL Worlds trophy, or T1 will have secured its <strong>fifth </strong>championship.</p>



<p>The last barrier for T1 to get this far was Gen.G, and social media managers were quick to promote the contest between T1’s Faker and Gen.G’s Chovy.</p>



<p>In the numbers, Faker and Chovy are putting out similar win-loss records, and their head-to-head figures over the years have ebbed and flowed dramatically. This year, Chovy was proving to be a thorn in Faker’s side, but when it counted most, Faker was able to gut up and push Chovy and his team out of League Worlds.</p>



<p>In 2022, the pair competed side-by-side during the Asian Games.</p>



<p>Now, all that stands between Faker, T1, and a fifth world championship trophy is Bilibili, an organisation that’s yet to secure a T2 finish at Worlds. Not one member of the all-Chinese team has claimed a League Worlds trophy yet, and despite a lacklustre Swiss Stage, Bilibili has recouped some momentum and stormed through the Knockout Stage.</p>



<p>One series is all it’ll take to decide this year’s champion.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-ksv-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment.1020615/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-ksv-loadout-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The KSV is a meta SMG in Call of Duty <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> and gives great results in close-range combat. The best thing about this gun is it’s available early in the game. You can get started with it and tweak the loadout from there on.</p>



<p>However, to get the most out of the weapon, here’s the best KSV loadout in BO6 with the right set of attachments, Perks, and Equipment.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-ksv-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-ksv">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-secondary-for-ksv">Best Secondary for KSV</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-how-to-unlock-ksv-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock KSV in Black Ops 6</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-is-the-ksv-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the KSV any good in Black Ops 6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-alternatives-to-the-ksv-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-ksv-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best KSV loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Long Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Quickdraw Grip</li>



<li><strong>Stock</strong>: Infiltrator Stock</li>



<li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Flip Mag</li>
</ul>



<p>Starting with the <strong>Suppressor</strong>, this attachment not only suppresses the firing sounds but also hides you from the mini-map. It unlocks at level 2 which is very easy to do.</p>



<p><strong>Long Barrel</strong> increases the firepower of the SMG by increasing the damage range. It unlocks when the KSV reaches level 3 and helps deal with more damage in medium-range combat. Right after this one, the <strong>Quickdraw Grip</strong> will unlock at level 6, attach it immediately. This attachment significantly increases the Aim Down Sight speed of the gun and helps you aim faster, enhancing its handling.</p>



<p>The <strong>Infiltrator Stock</strong> unlocks at level 8 and will improve your mobility by enhancing the Aim Walking Movement Speed. Lastly, get the <strong>Flip Mag</strong> after reaching weapon level 17 to improve the reload speed of the KSV.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-ksv">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for KSV</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Ghost</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Tracker</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Cold-Blooded</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4</strong>: Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Tactical Insertion</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Ghost</strong> leaves you undetected by Scout Pulse or UAV and <strong>Tracker</strong> allows you to see enemy footsteps. Use <strong>Cold-Blooded</strong> as the third Perk to remain undetected under thermal optics. These perks will activate Recon – the ability to see enemies through walls briefly.</p>



<p>Use the fourth Perk slot to equip <strong>Gung-Ho</strong>. This will increase Sprinting speeds while reloading or using Equipment. <strong>Semtex</strong> will add more firepower to the loadout while <strong>Stim Shot</strong> will help you heal up quickly. For the Field Upgrade, use the <strong>Tactical Insertion</strong> for custom spawn points in the map.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-ksv">Best Secondary for KSV</h2>



<p>The ideal secondary weapon options for the KSV are Stryder .22 and GS45.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-ksv-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock KSV in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You can unlock the KSV after reaching player level 7 in Black Ops 6. You don’t need to wait too long for this weapon as only a few multiplayer matches would unlock the weapon and you can start grinding from there on.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-ksv-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the KSV any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Yes, at the time of writing, the KSV is one of the meta weapons in BO6. Although it comes with a high recoil, controlling it is easy and on the positive side, you get a fast TTK and high mobility with it – two crucial aspects for intense multiplayer lobbies.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-ksv-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the KSV in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-jackal-pdw-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jackal PDW</a> is easily one of the best alternatives to the KSV. However, if you want to try something different, a weapon that’s slower but hits hard, give the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-tanto-22-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tanto .22</a> a try.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/outlast-trials">The Outlast Trials</a> developer Red Barrels has shared an updated roadmap following a <a href="https://redbarrelsgames.com/news/an-important-message-from-the-red-barrels-team/">"cyber incident"</a> that caused a "significant "hit" on production. It confirms a new lobby game, a fresh MK-Challenge, and a new Geister event are all on the way.</p>
<p>The team said it was "working hard" to deliver "fresh content" to keep Murkoff fans happy throughout the holidays, but stopped short of sharing a definitive release date for the second major update to the chaotic cooperative horror. The last one dropped in July, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outlast-trials-newest-villain-is-a-freakish-big-baby-obsessed-with-his-pacifier">introducing new enemy Franco "II Bambino" Barbi</a>.</p>

<p>To tide us over, Red Barrels says The Outlast Trials Geister event will once again come to the Sinyala facility later this week - expect a "new unexpected twist!" - whilst Season 2's new map, catalogue, MK-Challenges, Rig, enemy NPC, and storylines will follow, along with a new festive event, Winter Kills.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="546"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OutlastTrials/comments/1gbbv4y/new_roadmap_just_dropped_on_twitter/">New roadmap just dropped on twitter</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mt_Incorporated/">u/Mt_Incorporated</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OutlastTrials/">OutlastTrials</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>"Following the recent cyber incident, our team has been focused on developing Season 2, the new features that will come with it, as well as some new aspects of the game coming next year," the team explained.</p>
<p>"We genuinely appreciate our community's patience and understanding during this challenging time. We’re working hard to deliver fresh content for everyone to enjoy throughout the holidays!"</p>
<p>Red Barrels says the security issue it encountered earlier this month has been investigated, and the exploit "contained". It says no players' data has been impacted by the event, but acknowledged that its internal IT systems were compromised and a third-party had accessed "some of its data".</p><p>"The Outlast Trials is excessive and frantically enjoyable - but can occasionally tip over into frustration more than fear," I wrote when I reviewed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outlast-trials-review-a-unique-obscene-spin-on-the-horror-staple">The Outlast Trials</a> back when it was released in early access last year, awarding it three out of five stars.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Dont Nod's studio creative director has hit out at "hateful" comments about Deck Nine's take on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> franchise.</p>
<p>Talking on X/Twitter, Michel Koch said that whilst he hadn't played the game yet and "have no idea where [Deck Nine] are taking the story", "nothing justifies hating on people".</p>

<p>"I didn't play the game yet, and I have no idea where they are taking the story. But what I know is that nothing justifies hating on people for how they wrote their game!</p>
<p>"You can be disappointed, you can want other narratives for those characters you love, or different stories… but ultimately creation is hard and very subjective and if [Double Exposure's] story does not please you, it does not erase what you imagined."</p>
<p>When challenged by someone insisting it should be okay for players to feedback "healthy criticism", Koch agreed that whilst "constructive criticism and civil disagreement is good", he was specifically "talking of violent messages and harassment I've seen".</p>

<p>Wonder Weapons are bonafide difference makers in Black Ops 6 Zombies—and most installments of game mode. Some classic Wonder Weapons return, but there is also some fresh blood added to the mix, making for both a familiar and refreshing Zombies experience.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> has a fun and fresh Campaign, another exhilarating multiplayer marathon to embark on, and the return of Zombies. It’s proper Zombies though: Round-based, Easter Eggs, different maps, and Wonder Weapons.</p>



<p>As usual, Wonder Weapons are quite hard to get in Black Ops 6. But when you get one, the feeling is unmatched, and they’re well worth trying to track down.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-wonder-weapons-are-in-black-ops-6-zombies">How many Wonder Weapons are in Black Ops 6 Zombies</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 Zombies currently has <strong>four Wonder Weapons</strong>: The Ray Gun, Beamsmasher, Thrustodyne Model 23 AKA Jet Gun, and the Wunderwaffe DG-2.</p>



<p>You might recognize the Ray Gun, Thrustodyne Model 23, and Wunderwaffe, but give a warm, undead welcome to the <strong>Beamsmasher</strong>—a new, mega-powerful weapon of mass destruction.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-wonder-weapon-in-black-ops-6">Every Wonder Weapon in Black Ops 6</h2>



<h3 id="h-ray-gun">Ray Gun</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Hello, old friend. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Ray Gun is surely bound for the gaming Hall of Fame as it’s one of the best weapons in history. Its design is iconic, and the engineering is likely complex, but the end result is a satisfying, striking, nuclear bolt of deadly energy. It’s akin to classic alien death rays from B-movies of a bygone era, but it still works in 2024—trying to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-ray-gun-in-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get a Ray Gun in Black Ops 6 Zombies</a> is as tough as ever though.</p>



<h3 id="h-beamsmasher">Beamsmasher</h3>



<figure><figcaption>No-nonsense death beam. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>As far as I’m aware, the Beamsmasher can only be obtained on the Terminus Zombies map—so bear this in mind when you’re trying to obtain one. Other than this, there’s not much else to say about the Beamsmasher that the above screenshot doesn’t already tell you about the new toy. It fires a single, devastating, zombie-eviscerating beam and is great for concentrating on bringing down Elite Zombies.</p>



<h3 id="h-thrustodyne-model-23-jet-gun">Thrustodyne Model 23 / Jet Gun</h3>



<figure><figcaption>It’s obnoxiously big, and I love it. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>I would say “Thrustodyne Model 23” doesn’t quite roll off the tongue like “Jet Gun” does—so I’m going to refer to it as the latter. The Jet Gun gives off an evil cartoon vibe (you can’t tell me those dials aren’t deliberately evil-looking eyes) and it’s making its first appearance since its debut in Black Ops 2. It sucks up Zombies and recycles them into a fine paste—and I feel it delights in doing so. </p>



<h3 id="h-wunderwaffe-dg-2">Wunderwaffe DG-2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A classic returns. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Finally, another legendary Wonder Weapon comes back with a vengeance, and it’s none other than the Wunderwaffe DG-2. Apart from the Ray Gun, the Wunderwaffe DG-2 has featured about as much as any Wonder Weapon down the years, and Black Ops 6 is very accommodating.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-wonder-weapon-in-black-ops-6-zombies">How to get Wonder Weapon in Black Ops 6 Zombies</h2>



<p>There are various ways to get Wonder Weapons in Black Ops 6 Zombies: Get lucky with the <strong>Mystery Box</strong>, get them as loot from <strong>Armory Lockers or Safety Deposit Boxes</strong>, use <strong>Legendary Gobblegums</strong> for lucrative rolls, and you can also <strong>craft the Beamsmasher</strong>.</p>



<p>Using 950 Points on the Mystery Box is the easiest way to get a Wonder Weapon—and the odds increase the higher the round count you reach—in Black Ops 6 Zombies. You can also secure Loot Keys from Elite Enemies and open Lockers and Safety Deposit Boxes to see if they contain a Wonder Weapon.</p>



<p>Furthermore, certain Gobblegums can reroll Mystery Box drops—the Wonderbar! Gobblegum guarantees a Wonder Weapon—and the Beamsmasher can be crafted.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-4s-creator-explains-what-makes-a-good-remake<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p data-cy="paragraph">Video game remakes are everywhere these days. We’ve just had a new version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-2024-review">Silent Hill 2</a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">Final Fantasy 7 remake trilogy</a> is in full swing, and a recreation of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-the-first-preview">Metal Gear Solid 3</a> is on the horizon. But few people know remakes quite as well as Shinji Mikami. The co-creator of Resident Evil has watched teams craft highly-successful recreations of his own games, and back in 2001 even helmed the remake of the first project he ever headed up - making him the director of both Resident Evil <em>and </em>Resident Evil.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, if there’s anyone who knows what makes a good remake, it’s Shinji Mikami. “I think the comprehensive and fundamental understanding of what it was that made the original work in the first place is probably the most important point of a good remake,” he tells me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Everything from the ground up, basically,” he explains. “There's a few examples of that with certain series that Capcom has put out.” He is, of course, talking about the recent run of Resident Evil remakes, the most recent of which is the almost universally-celebrated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-4-remake-review">Resident Evil 4</a>. Mikami has played it and offers glowing praise for the team at Capcom. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I thought that it was really well-made,” he says. He’s particularly impressed by how the remake handles the more nuanced details of combat, such as the timing between aiming and shooting, which in the original was finely balanced to ensure mounting pressure and tension. “I thought that they showed a really good understanding of that element,” he tells me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Another thing I thought was really well done was the way they took the half-assed scenario that I just wrote up in two weeks and really built up on that and really fleshed it out,” he adds. “They showed that they really understood the characters and their interactions. They showed a good understanding of the backbone of each character. And they took not just the scenario itself, but even the dialogue, and they improved all that stuff so that was really great.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The comprehensive and fundamental understanding of what made the original work in the first place is probably the most important point of a good remake.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">My conversation with Mikami was part of his promotional work for Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered, a spruced-up version of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/06/21/shadows-of-the-damned-review">cult classic he produced back in 2011</a> (amusingly, Mikami notes that “I personally don't really have any interest in remasters” during the chat, so a passion project to revive Shadows this isn’t). We were also joined by Goichi Suda (AKA Suda51), Shadows of the Damned’s writer and CEO of developer Grasshopper Manufacture. Suda has more interest in remasters than Mikami; alongside this new version of Shadows, Grasshopper has also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-the-first-13-minutes-of-gameplay-4k-60fps">remastered Lollipop Chainsaw this year</a>, and had previously restored No More Heroes and Killer7 for modern platforms. But Suda varies his approach when returning to his old games. Sometimes a remake is needed.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One thing that really stands out about remaking The 25th Ward was, at the time when we did the remake, it was completely unplayable,” Suda explains. “It was originally only available on Japanese flip phones. And, on top of that, it never actually ended. The original version didn't have a proper conclusion or ending to it.” These factors ensured that, instead of a remaster, The 25th Ward was totally remade in 2018 to both suit the PlayStation 4 console and to finally provide players with a conclusion to the story. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For Shadows of the Damned, Mikami and Suda have chosen to remaster rather than remake. Instead of expanding and reinventing aspects of their 2011 game, which sold poorly but garnered a cult following, the duo have stuck closely to the original version. The approach allows modern audiences to experience the game as it was released back on the Xbox 360 and PS3. Nevertheless, there are some new elements to ensure long-term fans are rewarded. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I wanted to keep the game as close to the original as possible, but there were definitely things that I wanted to add on and emphasize or accentuate this time around,” says Suda. “For example, there's some new costumes for the main character, there's the new game plus mode. There's a few things that we wanted to use to boost the experience a bit. But yeah, we certainly wanted to keep it as close to the original as possible.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Personally, I'm more interested in remaking Killer7 than I was in remastering Shadows of the Damned.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But, as noted earlier, Mikami isn’t all that interested in remasters. That’s not to say he’s not interested in revisiting the past, though. “Personally, I'm more interested in remaking Killer7 than I was in remastering Shadows of the Damned,” he tells me. “If I got to choose, I'd rather do a sequel to Killer7 or something.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Released in 2005, Killer7 was an incredibly stylish action thriller. Its complex story, following the exploits of an assassin with multiple personalities, was co-written by Mikami and Suda. It’s another project from the duo with a cult following, and one that has largely been lost to time: aside from a 2018 PC remaster, Killer7 was only ever made for the GameCube and PS2, with no modern console re-releases available. As such, the game’s small but loyal following has long cried out for a sequel or remake.  </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/10/killer7-1728568546687.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Killer7 had stylish art direction and a unique approach to action game mechanics.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Reflecting on the original, Suda says “I was constantly really, really conscious of the fact that I was making an action game together with Mikami, the guy who made the Resident Evil series. And with that, [he] revolutionized the way action games are made.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Another thing that I was constantly conscious about was the fact that we were trying to make a game to put out to the whole world, not just domestically. All the new ideas that we had, for example, controller inputs and the gameplay and the action itself, we tried to make this stuff as new and original as possible. If we were to do another Killer7 thing, that's something that I'd like to return to. Making something completely new and original and putting a bunch of revolutionary stuff in it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Mikami likes the idea of returning to Killer7, he feels that his vision for the game’s art may clash with modern expectations. "I feel that, at the time, the art that we used for Killer7 matched really well with the specs of the time,” he says. “And if we were to make a new version of it nowadays, people would probably be expecting something a lot more realistic. And that would just feel funky and weird. That's not really what the game was about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If we were going to redo it, if we were going to do something new with it, there would be a whole lot that would have to be changed,” he theories. “Everything from background settings and the art itself, it would have to be pretty much redone from the ground up.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This isn't any kind of promise that we're going to be making a sequel or a remake or anything,” he quickly adds. “It's just two dudes shooting the shit.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though it’s just two dudes shooting the shit, the conversation gives us a good insight into what one of the most celebrated directors in gaming thinks makes a good remake. The best are ground-up recreations that study and dissect the components that made the original game work so well, and then use that understanding to expand on the good and enhance any weaknesses. It’s a simple recipe that requires a deep, intricate understanding of the original game in question. Thankfully, Mikami’s work has inspired such dedication, and the result has been the Resident Evil remakes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the remakes yet to come, let’s hope they’re based on original projects that also inspire such close study and appreciation for every little detail, right down to the microseconds between aiming and squeezing the trigger. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
