            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>People online seem tired of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-crossover-skins-rick-morty-call-of-duty-1851786919">crossover skins and silly cosmetics</a> in games like <em>Call of Duty </em>and <em>Battlefield.</em> And now one of the lead devs behind online shooter <em>Arc Raiders</em> has promised that you won’t see Santa Claus or dinosaur outfits in the newly released live-service game.</p> <p>The latest big hit on Steam is multiplayer extraction shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-extraction-virgil-watkins-interview-2000639879"><em>Arc Raiders</em></a>. It launched on October 30 on consoles and PC and <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-steam-ai-server-connection-error-launch-2000640110">quickly racked up over 200k concurrent players on Steam</a>. And being an online game in 2025 means offering up cosmetics for players to earn or purchase. <em>Arc Raiders</em> is no exception, selling players skins if they so desire. But this year has also marked a turning point online in regard to in-game cosmetics. Players seem less willing to put up with silly crossover skins and goofy cosmetics. This has led to a whole ongoing skin saga involving <em>Battlefield 6</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-goofy-skins-call-of-duty-nicki-minaj-2000614447">which has promised not to include those kinds of items</a>, and <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-skins-black-ops-7-blops-6-carry-over-battlefield-6-2000620379">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>,</em> which arguably <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912">started the backlash</a> we are seeing and has backpedaled on allowing silly skins from <em>BLOPS6</em> to move forward into the upcoming FPS. And now the design director for <em>Arc Raiders</em> has weighed in on the topic and claimed the team is “protective” of the shooter’s visual identity.</p>

 <p>“What I believe to be true is that we will maintain the current aesthetic that we have,” <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/skins-cosmetics-interview"><em>Arc Raiders</em> design director Virgil Watkins told <em>PCgamesN</em></a> when asked about silly skins. “[Cosmetics] will fit within our sensibilities of how these things look and fit within the world and inside the fiction.” And while the devs and artists at Embark want to provide players with “as much freedom as possible” to express themselves, there are limits.</p>

 <p>“I think it was said a little while ago in a meeting [that] we would never, say, make a Santa Claus outfit,” explained Watkins.</p> <p>“But we may make something that is of our own tone and our own aesthetic that evokes Santa Claus. That’s not even a statement that we will have a Santa Claus outfit, but I think that’s kind of the line you can draw. We’re pretty protective of making sure that anything that goes into the game fits within the visual identity, fits within the tone, fits within the setting. I think because so much of our game is strong around that element, it would be really unfortunate to upset that by injecting, I don’t know, a T-Rex costume running around suddenly – I don’t think the novelty is worth the trade.”</p>

  <p>Watkins’ answer highlights the problem of trying to walk the line between not disrupting your game’s visual identity while also still offering skins people are willing to buy. This is a problem <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-season-one-small-map-battle-royale-reactions-negative-review-ea-2000639948"><em>Battlefield 6</em> is facing right now as it enters its first season.</a> While many of the skins added to the game in the recent update look pretty realistic to me, many other players online are furious about all the colors. One skin even had its neon green toned down after players complained enough. While that might be seen as a victory for some, it leads to a strange situation where other players might not want to buy the game’s battle pass or spend money on new skins because they’re too boring or plain.</p> <p>Threading that needle is proving tricky for EA, will likely be challenging for <em>Black Ops 7</em>, and I suspect it will be a problem for<em> Arc Raiders,</em> too. <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-battlefield-6-skin-is-causing-community-meltdown-grounded-ea-2000638294">All it takes is one skin to be a bit too silly</a> or colorful, and suddenly, the community might turn on you and use your own words against you. Good luck to all devs working on live-service games in 2025. It sounds like a nightmare.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> can be played solo, but its unforgiving post-apocalyptic landscapes can be even more challenging when you're by yourself. Not only can the game's dangerous enemies put an end to you quickly, but groups of other raiders can be roaming the wasteland, ready to take you down and steal all of your loot. Having a good team can help ensure that you extract safely. But what if your friends don't play on the same hardware as you? Let's take a look at whether ARC Raiders offers cross-play and cross-progression.</p><h2>Does Arc Raiders have cross-play?</h2><p>If you're looking to play with friends on other platforms, you're in luck. <strong>Arc Raiders offers cross-play with every platform</strong>, allowing you to team up with your pals even when they're in a different ecosystem. To play together, simply add your friend's Embark ID in the Friends menu by selecting Add Friend. This ID will include four unique numbers at the end, so be sure to include those, too.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4593137-arcraiders_16-9_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593137" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4593137-arcraiders_16-9_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593137"></a><figcaption>You can brave the conditions together using Arc Raiders cross-play.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4593137-arcraiders_16-9_04.jpg"></figure><p>Cross-play is enabled by default, meaning you won't need to turn on any additional settings when you're ready to team up. To disable crossplay, go to <strong>Settings &gt; Gameplay &gt; Cross-play</strong> and toggle it off. This will ensure you only play with players that are within your ecosystem. As such, you'll need to turn this back on again if you decide to play with friends on another platform.</p><p>Once you're ready to go on with your pals by your side, don't forget to take our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-tips-15-things-to-know-before-you-play/1100-6535635/" data-ref-id="1100-6535635">Arc Raiders tips</a>, too.</p><h2>Does Arc Raiders have cross-progression?</h2><p>There's more good news for those setting out into a post-apocalyptic Earth: <strong>ARC Raiders has full cross-progression support</strong>. This means that you can carry your progress across every platform. If you start on PS5, for instance, you'll be able to use the same save on PC or Xbox so long as you're signed into the same <a href="https://careers.embark-studios.com/connect/login" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Embark account</a>.</p><p>However, it's important to note that playing across different platforms will require you to purchase the game multiple times. If you've bought the game on PS5 and want to play on PC or Xbox, be prepared to dish out an additional $40 to transfer that save over. Luckily, you can swap between these platforms at any time with no issues, so you'll never have to worry about losing your progress.</p>

<ul><li><span>1 Special Fredrik Miniature</span></li>
	<li><span>1 Special Alchemist Miniature</span></li>
	<li><span>1 Nepenthe Collection Lore Booklet</span></li>

</ul><p>Both of the <em>Conquest Nepenthe Campaign</em> packs will release within one month of each other. The Campaign Pack is set to release in November 2025 and will be sold at an MSRP of $59.99. The Two-Player Deluxe set will be available in December 2025 at an MSRP of $299.99.</p>

<p>The latter, while pricier, is a cheaper alternative to buying and assembling an army piecemeal. The going price for everything included is more than $600. In that context, plus it coming out around the holiday season, might just bring curious minds into this game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Did you know that several of the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380"><span>Mega Evolutions in </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a> <span>have some element of the letters “X” or “Y” in their designs? It’s true! While they don’t literally look like the letters in most cases, some aspects of their designs resemble the names of the 3DS </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games they originally debuted in back in 2013. When one </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>pixel artist and commentator called TAHK0 pointed this out on </span><a href="https://x.com/TAHK0/status/1892649080213422279"><span>X</span></a><span>, he was bombarded with hateful responses. Where some people would retreat and try to ignore the harassment, TAHK0 instead made a two-and-a-half-hour-long video breaking down how almost every one of these superpowered transformations has some part of their design that is based on “X” and “Y.” If that’s not commitment, then I don’t know what is.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">it has been over 15 years and pokemon fans and fakemon artists have yet to catch on that pretty much all mega pokemon up to this point have been shaped like an x or a y</p> <p>will this continue to go unnoticed when new mega pokemon start becoming z shaped stay tuned</p> <p>— TAHK0 ☕️ (@TAHK0) <a href="https://twitter.com/TAHK0/status/1892649080213422279?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>In an interview with </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>, TAHK0 says he didn’t expect this observation to be as controversial as it was, and that by the time he realized people were mad about it, he’d already spent some time joking with detractors.</span></p>

 <p><span>“It was just like any other throwaway half-joking over-exaggerated tweet I wrote after waking up, and I only realized things were going wrong after about an hour afterward when things started taking off,” he says. “I had thought after pointing it out, it would be clear to everyone, so I was originally replying with jokey answers since I thought they’d be in on it like an upside-down Mega Camerupt— But everyone was taking it very seriously and were very angry. That’s when I knew it was out of control.”</span></p> <div> <p>Welcome to Exp. Share, <em>Kotaku</em> ’s <em>Pokémon</em> column in which we dive deep to explore notable characters, urban legends, communities, and just plain weird quirks from throughout the <em>Pokémon</em> franchise.</p></div> <p><span>Several of the arguments, as TAHK0 points out in his video, seem to be rooted in the assumption that this design motif means that Pokémon must literally be shaped like an X or Y–think a letter puppet from </span><i><span>Sesame Street</span></i><span>–while others pointed to specific images of the Pokémon</span> <span>in question in which this quality is de-emphasized in an effort to “debunk” the theory, rather than looking at the Pokemon’s design as a whole. But TAHK0 is correct. Sometimes it’s best seen when viewing a Pokémon from the front, rather than the side as some artwork depicts them. In the video, TAHK0 points to the </span><a href="https://creativerevolution.io/aphantasia-a-blind-minds-eye/"><span>Aphantasia Test</span></a><span>, which illustrates how people’s abilities to imagine objects in their mind vary, and for some, looking at a piece of art which, out of necessity, depicts an object (or, in this case, a Pokémon) from a particular angle can make it difficult to envision how it looks from all angles, resulting in some of the disagreements people have had with this theory online. The key to a complete takedown is anticipating all the bad-faith arguments someone is going to make, as well as the honest misunderstandings some may have, and as someone who has less patience than he used to for people willfully misinterpreting the things I say, I gotta hand it to TAHK0 for addressing just about every argument in good spirits.</span></p>

 <p><span>The video goes through all the Mega Evolutions that were revealed prior to </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s launch, and also breaks down lore elements like how Mega Evolution originates from </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span> mascots Xerneas and Yveltal, who are distinctly and intentionally shaped like their respective letters. Some monsters, like Metagross with its four arms or Absol with the wings on its back, are very obviously shaped like an X or Y, while others, like Sableye, have a hidden element of their character design that references letters. Watching the video was fascinating for me, as someone who was largely willing to buy the theory, but hadn’t stopped to look at every Mega Evolution to verify. Some I hadn’t even considered caught me off guard.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>TAHK0 says he felt “discouraged” after the initial pushback, but as new Megas from the then-unreleased </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span> were revealed, like Mega Dragonite and Mega Malamar, which both have pretty noticeable Y silhouettes, he felt more emboldened that it wasn’t all, as some detractors said, a “giant coincidence.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“After the tweet left my audience, I remember addressing most arguments pretty early on, but it got such a viral reaction that I couldn’t keep up with answering everyone, and not everyone would see my responses to others, so then their responses started being about how I wasn’t responding to anything,” he says. “My own initial jokes were being taken seriously, so being light-hearted wasn’t the play, and any disagreement on my part was taken as me having my head up my own butt. So responding to every possible argument I could, while being light-hearted to make sure this time it was clear it’s not that serious, seemed like the only way I could ‘get out alive,’ so to speak. People were originally way more quick to believe a confident argument against me than anything I could respond with, which unfortunately is how the internet has worked for a long time now.”</span></p>

 <p><span>While TAHK0 was working on his feature-length response for his YouTube channel, perhaps the biggest piece of evidence in the Pokedex was revealed: Mega Raichu X and Y. These long-overdue Mega forms for the final stage of Pikachu’s evolutionary line are set to join </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>in the RPG’s </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC, and their very obvious “X” and “Y” silhouettes have essentially been the silver bullet for the whole discussion, and TAHK0 notes that the onslaught of jokes at his expense on unrelated posts and content have “vanished” overnight.</span></p>

  <p><span>“When Mega Raichu X and Y were announced, I remember being so excited while simultaneously so relieved with how obvious and clear they made [the X and Y shapes],” TAHK0 says. “If you go back and watch my reaction, I actually couldn’t form a sentence. It was a lot all at once after dealing with a not-so-good time for eight months. Also, Pikachu is my favorite Pokémon, so it was pretty fitting.”</span></p> <p><span>TAHK0 says his breakdown of every individual Mega Evolution has changed some minds, and that he sometimes gets a nice comment from randos saying they’re now “a believer.” Now that </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> is out and brought with it several new Mega Evolutions, it looks like Game Freak isn’t holding as tightly to the design motif, though Dragonite, Raichu, and others do keep that spirit alive. The game even goes out of its way to show that Mega Zygarde, one of the last Mega forms the player receives in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, has a distinct X, Y, and Z on the cannon it holds after it transforms. So if </span><i><span>X</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Y </span></i><span>set the stage for this design motif, </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> is driving it home. Will these obvious examples be enough for those who are still digging their heels into the ground over it? Maybe not. But in the meantime, TAHK0 says he’s open to “non-threatening” discussion and disagreements. Especially with at least a few more Mega Evolutions still on the way when </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>launches.</span></p> <p><span>“Obviously, now I would prefer they stick to the letter theming, but I’m pretty indifferent,” he says. “I’m a big fan of creator’s intent, so [new Megas] could be whatever-themed and I would still be excited. Learning about their design and lore decisions is the fun part for me.”</span></p>

<figure data-uuid="c9b2ee915f944"><a title="Dragon Quest I HD-2D Remake" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c9b2ee915f944/dragon-quest-i-hd-2d-remake.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Square Enix has dropped a day one patch for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a>, which is out now on Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>The patch is a pretty small one, admittedly, but it does make a few small tweaks — adding in a few more voice lines, adjusting enemy AI behaviour, and the usual "bug fixes". It's available to download now on all platforms, so make sure you grab it ASAP.</p>
<p>For the full rundown, here are the <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/documents/notice-of-dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake-updates">patch notes for Version 1.0.1.0</a>:</p>
<h3>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake - Version 1.0.1.0 Patch Notes</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Update content:</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="GReZx3uoZNA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GReZx3uoZNA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytGReZx3uoZNA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GReZx3uoZNA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GReZx3uoZNA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed640b4erzwjgy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div><blockquote>
<p>- English voices have been added to some event scenes.<br>
- More Traveller's Tips (i.e. tutorials) have been added.<br>
- The Anti-Freeze Earrings and Asbestos Earrings have been added to the obtainable accessories in DRAGON QUEST I.<br>
- Some adjustments have been made to the "Tactics" AI and enemy behaviour AI.<br>
- Miscellaneous changes, minor bug fixes and stat adjustments, and performance optimisation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So yeah, a little light, but some crucial additions — those accessories will likely come in handy in DQI. And we're happy that there's more English voice work too, as the dub here is excellent.</p>
<p>As a bit of a refresher, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_i_and_ii_hd-2d_remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a> <em>is</em> available on Switch 1 and Switch 2, <em>but</em> there's no upgrade path. So if you buy the Switch 1 version, you're stuck with it. So, if you want the Switch 2 version (the physical of which is a Game-Key Card), make sure you buy the correct one.</p>
<p>That's been made a bit more complicated thanks to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dragon_quest_-_hd-2d_erdrick_trilogy_collection">DRAGON QUEST - HD-2D Erdrick Trilogy Collection</a>, also available on both consoles. This bundle includes the newly released I &amp; II Remake along with 2024's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_iii_hd-2d_remake">III HD-2D Remake</a>. Now, Dragon Quest III <em>doesn't</em> have a Switch 2 version, <em>but</em> it does have a free Switch 2 patch which adds some extra visual and performance options.</p>
<figure data-uuid="b21108a95d37b"><a title="Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake messages" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b21108a95d37b/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake-messages.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Messages from Yuji Horii and Masaaki Hayasaka celebrating the game's release. — <em>Image: <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/1983549559948329272">Square Enix</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, basically, the Switch 1 bundle contains the Erdrick Trilogy all as their Switch 1 editions, and the Switch 2 bundle contains the Switch 1 version of Dragon Quest III and the Switch 2 version of Dragon Quest I &amp; II.</p>
<p>Oh, and one last warning: If you're planning on streaming the new duology, <a href="https://www.dragonquest.jp/guideline/dq1-2/hd2d/">Square Enix has advised</a> players to refrain from showing anything after rolling credits. At least for the first month.</p>

It’s a neat nod to one of the coolest parts of the 2002 <em>Animal Crossing</em> on GameCube, except that this time around it’ll require a paid subscription to access. Boo!</p> <p>It was a neat surprise going about your business in <em>Animal Crossing</em> and randomly discovering a game like<em> Excitebike</em> for the NES. No, it wasn’t just for decoration. You could actually activate it and play Shigeru Miyamoto’s original 1984 racer <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gamecube+animal+crossing+emulator+kotaku&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1089US1089&amp;oq=gamecube+animal+crossing+emulator+kotaku&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQABiABDIICAIQABgWGB4yCAgDEAAYFhgeMggIBBAAGBYYHjIICAUQABgWGB4yCAgGEAAYFhgeMgoIBxAAGAoYFhgeMggICBAAGBYYHjIICAkQABgWGB7SAQg1OTk2ajBqNKgCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">via a fully-functioning in-game NES emulator</a>. A bunch of other classics were available to collect as well. Some, like <em>Punch-Out!!!</em>, were only available through special codes. Others, like <em>Ice Climber</em>, required special e-reader cards.</p>

 <p>Imagine winning a random raffle or shaking a tree and being blessed with a free copy of the original <em>Donkey Kong.</em>&nbsp;Back in 2002 there was both the novelty of playing one game within another game and the appetite for older games that weren’t otherwise backwards compatible on modern hardware. Maybe your mom buried the NES up in the attic or sold it to help buy the SNES. Maybe <em>Balloon Fight</em> got lost when the kid down the street never gave it back.</p>

 <p>I booted up <em>Animal Crossing</em> so many times&nbsp;<em>just</em> to go back and play <em>Punch-Out!!</em>, which even at the time felt strangely nostalgic (and also a pain on the GameCube controller).</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We can see the playable Super NES and Super Famicom games will be F-Zero and Panel de Pon, respectively <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AnimalCrossing?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AnimalCrossing</a> <a href="https://t.co/mpmH0wQjsL">https://t.co/mpmH0wQjsL</a> <a href="https://t.co/vGBmTDbKcR">pic.twitter.com/vGBmTDbKcR</a></p> <p>— André (@AndreSegers) <a href="https://twitter.com/AndreSegers/status/1983926022752874971?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>So it’s a rad idea to bring that feature back for <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, but a huge bummer that these games will only work with Switch Online where…you’ve already been able to go and play them for years. It doesn’t even sound like the full suite of NES classics will be injected into <em>Animal Crossing</em> when its free update arrives on January 15.</p>

 <p>Nintendo stresses you’ll only be able to play a “select classic game on each system,” and for the purposes of the trailer at least, it only confirms Famicom, NES, and Game Boy furniture pieces. So you’ll have access to the handheld version of <em>Dr. Mario</em>, but no word on if something like <em>Super Metroid</em> will be available with a possible SNES your Villager can buy from the Nook kids (some eagle-eyed fans <a href="https://x.com/AndreSegers/status/1983926022752874971">have spotted <em>F-Zero</em></a> in one brief moment from the trailer).</p> <p>Why not just make these games free for people who own <em>New Horizons</em>? I have no idea. Got to protect the value proposition of titles that came out over three decades ago and which Nintendo has sold multiple times before across half a dozen different platforms, I guess. Here’s to whichever poor kid accidentally buys <em>Ice Climber</em> in <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> next year and gets instructed to input their parents’ credit card information when they try to play it without a subscription.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="08d8e91bb5349"><a title="Pokemon Legends: Z-A" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/08d8e91bb5349/pokemon-legends-z-a.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/56527">Famitsu</a>'s weekly software and hardware sales charts have dropped, and the king is still on top, as expected.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> tops the charts for the second week in a row, with the Switch 1 version selling a further 195,849 copies, while the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> shifts a further 71,991. Both pretty big drops from those mammoth numbers last week, but as a reminder, these are only physical sales, and the Switch 2 version comes in a bundle too. So all things considered, It's doing solid.</p>
<p>There was simply no catching Pokémon this week, seeing as both versions sold a combined 267,840 units. But <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has remained steady in third place, with a further 35,176 copies sold this week. That means the Switch 2's launch title is just 35,000 copies shy of reaching the 2 million mark, at least in terms of physical sales in Japan. That's pretty darn good.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2LcP6TZzqhM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59qmuxnt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>In terms of other new releases on Nintendo consoles, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/once_upon_a_katamari">Once Upon a Katamari</a> has shifted a solid 17,289 units on Switch (and a further 4,596 on PS5) in its first week, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> comes in at seventh with 6,778 sales. Donkey Kong Bananza, however, has slipped out of the top ten for the first time since its release.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough of us for now — here's the top ten physical sales in Japan for the week of 20th to 26th October 2025.</p>

<hr>
<p>Obviously, with a drop in Pokémon sales comes a drop in Switch 2 sales — but it's still way out in front, selling 65,434 units to get ever closer to that 2.5 million figure. That attach rate for Mario Kart World is <em>nuts</em>.</p>
<p>The three Switch 1 SKUs shifted 25,109, with the OG model actually being outsold by all three PS5 models, though cumulative sales for Sony's current console sit much lower at 10,503 this week.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a> out now, it'll be interesting to see those sales in next week's charts and see how that release affects things.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The third anniversary of Goddess of Victory: Nikke arrives in November, and today it launched its biggest in-game event yet that includes the culmination of the main “Rapture Queen” storyline and the largest-scale battles the game has seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don’t know about Goddess of Victory: Nikke, it’s a free-to-play third-person idle shooter from Korean developer Shift Up that’s available on Android, iOS, and PC. Downloaded more than 45 million times since its launch in November 2022, it has a roster of more than 160 “Nikke,” android soldiers who you take into battle in an effort to reclaim the overworld from a vicious race of aliens called Raptures who forced humanity to flee underground.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That conflict comes to a head in this new story event, which will see players face off in a final battle against the evil Rapture Queen. But that’s just scratching the surface of what’s coming in the anniversary update. The other big addition is the new Surface Beta mode, which features large-scale simulation-style battles where you assemble Nikke squads, fight Raptures, collect resources, and capture strongholds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And, of course, it wouldn’t be a major update without new recruitable characters. New SSR characters Nayuta and Liberalio will be recruitable through the normal gacha system, while SSR Chime will be a free anniversary event character. Nayuta and Liberalio will take center stage in the new story content, with Nayuta rallying her Pioneer Squad against the Rapture Queen, who Liberalio reveres as a mother figure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The anniversary event adds a new gacha costume for Red Hood and pass costumes for Crown and Siren. Plus, it’s bringing back a re-run of the powerful Pilgrim characters, letting you choose one of Modernia, Dorothy, or Red Hood as your exclusive event pull. And there will be limited-time challenges like new boss fights, a new Union Raid, Solo Raid, and multiple minigames and events.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With the third anniversary fast approaching, we chatted with game director Yoo HyungSuk. He’s a 15-year veteran of the Korean gaming industry who started his career as a combat planner on MMORPGs. His previous work also includes being the director/planning director for games like Overhit and Lost Ark. He joined Shift Up in 2020, when he was named game director of Goddess of Victory: Nikke. We talked to him about the game’s successful three-year run, how the dev team approached the new anniversary content, their plans for the future, and more.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>According to your livestream, the new anniversary story content leads to what is a "final battle." Could you explain why such a storyline is being launched at this point?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> Since launch, Nikke has had a considerable number of stories that are spread in all directions. We realized the need to slowly gather the stories that have branched out over the past three years into a single storyline, and the third anniversary is the starting point of this plan.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Nayuta, the featured character for the third anniversary update, is unique compared to previous Nikke characters. Can you talk about the concept behind the development of this character and the different abilities they have?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> All members of the Pioneer squad are based on classic JRPG parties. Snow White is the heavily armored knight and tanker. Scarlet is the agile swordswoman and DPS. Rapunzel is the priest who heals. That's how it works. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nayuta is the fourth member, so she was designated as the monk who supports. We didn't want her to be stronger than the other three members in combat, so we developed her to focus on utility, which led to the abilities she has now. Her main ability is using her clones to learn massive amounts of information. As a former D.E.E.P. member, she's also familiar with over-technology.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/29/nayuta-1761773266918.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>You’re also introducing a new gameplay mode called Surface Beta to launch alongside the third anniversary. Can you tell us more about it?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> As its name suggests, the Surface Beta content allows players to explore the biggest world in Nikke. To make the experience more immersive, we decided to adopt a simulation-style battle system instead of the existing shooting battle format. We incorporated fun elements across the expansive field, such as uncovering hidden areas and solving puzzles. Mainly, we want players to experience the battles against Lord-class Raptures. As Raptures have basic gimmick patterns based on the surface, it is important to choose the squads' locations wisely. We will also introduce even stronger bosses in the future, so stay tuned for more!</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Your dev team has consistently created new minigames throughout Nikke’s three-year run. What factors are usually considered when deciding what type of minigame to develop?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> In major events like this anniversary, minigames are not mini. Given how important this update is, we put more effort into the game mode, with this one featuring a never-before-seen genre with unique visuals and an impressive scale. It's a management simulation-style game where you restore Eden, which was destroyed for a mysterious reason.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/29/surface-beta-1-1761773387145.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Just the fact that we’re here celebrating the three-year anniversary shows how successful the game has been and how it’s maintained a connection with the community. What do you think are the reasons for that success?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> We think our Commanders enjoy unique content and stories that are different from other games. In this age of content overload, providing gameplay, visuals, and stories similar to other titles would be nothing short of boring.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of our game have a deep understanding of our content and stories. Since we have to keep delivering excellent content and narratives without disappointing them, we really try to emphasize to the whole development team that they should truly love the game and then it's not just work. We will continue keeping this in mind and work harder to make our game better, so please stay tuned.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Since Nikke first launched, what have been the biggest difficulties you’ve run into and how did you overcome them?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> In the past three years, our biggest problem has been figuring out how to adapt to this fast-changing era and deciding what content and stories we should deliver to bring players for maximum fun. This issue has persisted for three years and will continue into the future. We are game developers, and fun is the core value of any game, so it's only right that we face this challenge and keep bringing more fun and new content to our players. So it's both a joyful and difficult journey.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>That’s an interesting perspective. Do you think needing to adapt to that change has helped keep the dev team engaged? I imagine it can sometimes be difficult working on the same game for years even after release, dealing with complacency or burnout. But do you think having those consistent challenges to overcome helps with that?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> Yes, when we set endless goals it's indeed possible to encounter problems like job burnout. Like boxers, we need to constantly compete, prove our ability, and have strong mental resilience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is why, from the very beginning, we've emphasized to the development team that, rather than aiming for zero mistakes, what matters more is learning from the mistakes and growing. After adopting this mindset, we noticed that continuously setting goals actually helps improve the team's focus.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/29/queen-1761773303922.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>You’ve been able to collaborate with some big franchises, from Evangelion to Stellar Blade to Nier: Automata to the recent Resident Evil. What’s the process in deciding who to collaborate with?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> Collaborations are decided through various discussions, but recently, we've focused on finding IPs that players who like Nikke will enjoy, even if they're not familiar with it. We designed the Resident Evil minigame with this perspective in mind, and we hope players are having fun with it.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Nikke has also shown up at some surprising real-life events, like the San Diego Padres baseball game and on the Hudson River in New York. Will we see Nikke at other real-world events in the future?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> Of course! Bringing multifaceted enjoyment that goes beyond the game to our Commanders makes us happy. In particular, seeing Rapi throw the first pitch at Petco Park in San Diego was especially an honor for us. We'll continue to do our best, so please keep watching us.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Speaking of the future, what does Shift Up have planned for Goddess of Victory: Nikke in 2026?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> In 2026, we will continue to work hard to give you fun experiences, both in-game and beyond. We're preparing various events and updates to surprise you, and we're ready to bring more special surprises for the 3.5 and fourth anniversaries. I'm already excited now. In 2026, we also plan to improve the quality of our operations to provide a more stable experience. Hope you all enjoy the game.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Since the third anniversary’s story is centered around the “final battle” theme, could you give us a hint about what comes next?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> We hope in 2026 our story could move on to the next stage. We plan to gather the countless stories we've told so far, converge them into one culminating point, and then move forward.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Nikke has built up quite a following of passionate fans around the world in its three years. As we celebrate the anniversary, is there anything you want to say to the players who’ve been on this journey with you?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> This year, we participated in the LA Anime Expo with Cosmograph and had the opportunity to talk to American players in person. Many of them expressed their gratitude, and some even shed tears of excitement upon meeting us. This left a lasting memory in my heart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"> For those of us who spend all day in the office, this opportunity to meet players in person is extremely invaluable. Being able to personally feel the love from fans is truly blissful. Although developing the game and providing live service is sometimes hard and exhausting, the support from players pushes us to overcome difficulties and pick ourselves back up over and over again, and come up with more exciting and fun events.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Goddess of Victory: Nikke is available to download for free on the game’s <a href="https://nikke-en.com/?pid=MKT&amp;af_click_lookback=517d&amp;c=NA2thANNI&amp;af_adset=PR&amp;af_ad=IGNarticle" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>official website</u></a>, or on the App Store or Google Play.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/theres-a-new-thief-game-coming-out-this-year-though-only-for-vr-devices/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/there%E2%80%99s-a-new-thief-game-coming-out-this-year-though-only-for-vr-devices.1339702/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>UK-based studio Maze Theory (which previously made several Doctor Who VR games and Peaky Blinders: The King's Ransom) and publisher Vertigo Games have just announced the release date of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2800080/Thief_VR_Legacy_of_Shadow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thief: Legacy of Shadow</a>, a new stealth action game coming out on December 4. Unfortunately, the game will only be available for virtual reality devices, which still comprise a minuscule portion of the overall gaming industry. That said, if you are a VR aficionado, chances are you already have a PlayStation VR2, Quest 2 or 3, or a Steam VR-compatible headset.</p>



<p>Legacy of Shadow will bring players back to The City eleven years after the 2014 reboot by Eidos Montréal. Just like in previous Thief games, The City is a place of shadows, ruled by the powerful and feared by the oppressed. Its rooftops form a maze above the narrow, winding streets. The City Watch prowls the streets relentlessly, enforcing the iron will of Baron Ulysses Northcrest — a tyrant who crushes any hint of rebellion.</p>



<p>In Thief: Legacy of Shadow, you won't play as Garrett, the protagonist of the franchise's previous entries. Instead, you'll step into the shoes of Magpie, a cunning thief who was orphaned by Northcrest's brutality and then shaped by the streets. Stealing is Magpie's only means of survival. That is, until she uncovers a legendary artefact holding a legacy from the past. That's when she is forced to unravel The City's darkest secrets and expose the sinister conspiracy looming over its very foundation.</p>



<p>The developers have implemented immersive VR-centric game mechanics to allow players to steal, evade and outsmart the forces controlling the city. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Players can look forward to pickpocketing guards, prying open hidden compartments, and bypassing locks using tactile VR interactions. Thief: Legacy of Shadow promises players a range of arrows and tools to distract, disable, or eliminate threats through immersive VR archery. Additionally, Maze Theory stated that every heist offers multiple paths and playstyles, allowing players to decide whether to sneak past guards unseen or take them down from the shadows.</p>

			<p>Today, Deadline <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/taylor-sheridan-peter-berg-call-of-duty-movie-1236602997/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a> that the Call of Duty movie has secured a director and a writer: Peter Berg and Taylor Sheridan. Berg will direct and also co-write alongside Taylor Sheridan.</p>



<p>Berg is known for directing several action thriller movies, including 2007's The Kingdom, 2013's Lone Survivor, and 2018's Mile 22. Sheridan, on the other hand, is primarily known as the creator of the Yellowstone franchise (as well as Mayor of Kingstown, Tulsa King, and Lioness), but he also wrote the two Sicario movies. Berg and Sheridan worked together on Hell or High Water, the acclaimed 2016 crime drama film that garnered four Academy Award nominations.</p>



<p>Presumably, the news means the Call of Duty movie adaptation is being fast-tracked. That is because the rights were picked up by Paramount, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-movie-in-the-works-paramount-skydance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as confirmed last month</a>, and Sheridan's time with Paramount will come to an end in 2028. From January 1, 2029, he will be busy working on film and TV shows for NBCUniversal as part of a five-year deal. Still, there is no official news on casting yet, so it may be a while before we hear who Berg and Sheridan have in mind for their story. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Call of Duty is preparing to launch Black Ops 7 <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-launch-november-14-no-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on November 14</a>. The game features a story campaign that picks up the narrative thread of Black Ops 2. Set in 2035, the story will follow JSOC Commander David 'Section' Mason (played by actor Milo Ventimiglia) and his Specter One team as they investigate the return of the deceased Nicaraguan terrorist Raúl Menéndez, who threatens to 'burn the world down' in three days. Specter One also includes operatives Mike Harper (Michael Rooker), Eric Samuels (John Eric Bentley), and Leilani '50/50' Tupuola (Frankie Adams), as well as Colonel Troy Marshall (Y'lan Noel), who oversees JSOC's Tier 1 operations. Also involved in the Menendez investigation is 'The Guild', a former criminal organisation turned technology corporation, led by its CEO Emma Kagan (Kiernan Shipka).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Activision has officially announced its plans to make a <em>Call of Duty</em> movie. It will be written and directed by<em> Friday Night Lights</em> creator Peter Berg with some writing help from <em>Yellowstone’s</em> creator Taylor Sheridan. No release date was shared.</p> <p>On October 30, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/taylor-sheridan-peter-berg-call-of-duty-movie-1236602997/">following an initial report from <em>Deadline</em></a>, Paramount and Activision confirmed that after signing a deal in <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-movie-paramount-activision-2000622362">September to work together</a> on a future <em>Call of Duty</em> movie, the companies have settled on a director for the live-action war movie based on the popular first-person shooter franchise. Peter Berg is directing, writing, and producing the <em>Call of Duty</em> movie through his studio Film 47. Berg’s past work includes films like <i>Lone Survivor</i>,&nbsp;<i>Deepwater Horizon</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Patriots Day.&nbsp;</i>Taylor Sheridan is co-writing the movie and will help produce it. In recent years, Sheridan has become one of the biggest names in TV, creating shows like <em>Yellowstone</em>, <em>Mayor of Kingstown</em>, and <em>Tulsa King</em> for Paramount’s streaming platform.</p>

 <p>No plot details were shared in a press release announcing the<em> Call of Duty</em> movie’s director and writers, but Paramount did claim that the live-action film will be “designed to thrill its massive global fan base by delivering on the hallmarks of what fans love about the iconic series, while boldly expanding the franchise to entirely new audiences.” In other words, Paramount claims its new <em>Call of Duty</em> movie will be good and everyone will love it.</p> <p>Paramount likely sees Berg as a perfect fit for this project, as he has a history of making gritty action and war movies. And teaming him up with Sheridan makes sense as the two are friends in real life and have worked together before on movies like <em>Hell or High Water.&nbsp;</em>No casting announcements were made by Paramount, but considering Berg has used Mark Wahlberg in five different movies, it seems at least quite possible that the actor (who previously portrayed Max Payne) will be involved in the upcoming <em>Call of Duty</em> movie. Well, assuming it gets made. Activision has been trying and failing for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty#Films">a decade now to make a <em>CoD</em> movie</a>. But maybe this time…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Peak developer has announced that a new biome, called ‘Roots’, will be arriving on November 5, 2025. </p>



<p>Landfall and Aggro Crab’s co-op physics-based climbing title, Peak, has been a major success since its release. The title had already approached the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peak-sold-nearly-2-million-copies-last-week-during-steam-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million sales mark</a> a few months ago, thanks to a boost in sales from Steam. Now, the developers are introducing a new biome to provide additional content for players. </p>



<h2 id="h-peak-s-next-biome-is-going-to-be-forest-themed">Peak’s Next Biome is Going to be Forest-Themed</h2>



<p>Announced through a new update on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3527290" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, the next Peak biome has been named Roots, and it evokes a truly foresty vibe. In the trailer, we see two characters hiding atop a tree trunk, with one character sliding in while holding a vine. As the duo seems to be planning their next move, one of the characters is abducted by a spider, and the teaser ends at that moment, revealing the November 5 release date. Check out the teaser for Peak’s Roots biome below: </p>

</p></figure>



<p>The last biome added was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peaks-first-major-update-adds-a-new-biome-items-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mesa</a>, which featured sandy terrain and massive mountains. This time, it seems like players will be scaling massive tree trunks rather than mountains and hills. Similar to Mesa, Roots might take over on its arrivals and then be rotated randomly with Mesa and Alpine; however, developers have not confirmed these plans. Moreover, players can also expect new items to keep them safe, new resources to make climbing each other, and new obstacles to make their lives more difficult. </p>



<p>In other news, Peak developers announced a brand-new co-op arcade racing game this month, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peak-devs-announce-a-new-co-op-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crashout Crew</a>, and its demo is now available.

		<p>Maze Theory has announced that Thief VR: Legacy of Shadows will be launching on December 4th, and the studio has released two gameplay videos. One shows Thief VR: Legacy of Shadows running on PSVR 2, while the other shows it running on Meta Quest. It is the same sequence for both, but if you want to compare you can watch both videos below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow - Gameplay #2 Trailer | PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7QdiMNE_dM8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>The description for Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow says,&nbsp;<em>“The City is a place of shadows, ruled by the tyrant Lord Ulysses Northcrest. You are Magpie, a cunning thief orphaned by Northcrest’s brutality and shaped by the streets, who steals as the only means to survive. That is until you uncover something greater: a legendary artifact holding a legacy from the past. Use immersive VR mechanics to steal, evade, and outsmart the forces controlling The City. Unravel its darkest secrets and expose a sinister conspiracy that looms over its very foundation.”</em></p>
<p>In a blog post on the PlayStation blog website Steven Gallagher (Creative Director at Eidos-Montréal), that this was not the first attempt at doing a Thief game in VR. He said, <em>“Towards the end of Thief (2014), Eidos-Montréal tried creating their own playable VR demo as part of Sony’s Project Morpheus, the first iteration of PlayStation VR”, Steven reveals. “Unfortunately, we weren’t particularly experienced in making VR back then, so the overall product ended up being a bit hard to play.”</em></p>

<p>Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow will feature non-linear levels so players have quite a lot of freedom in how to tackle the scenarios they find themselves in. Stealth and sneakily taking things are the main ways of success as combat is not going to be your strong point. Players will need to carefully plan routes and actions to pull of the heists properly.</p>

<p>And that fps might explain why</p>

<figure data-uuid="f94d289e8ff53"><a title="Animal Crossing Switch 2 Price" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f94d289e8ff53/animal-crossing-switch-2-price.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The prices have been revealed for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> and its upgrade pack, and they are slightly lower than you might have expected.</p>
<p>As listed on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2950861.html">Switch eShop</a>, the full Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is now available to pre-order for <strong>£54.99 / $64.99</strong>, while the upgrade pack is a measly <strong>£4.19 / $4.99</strong>. Just in case the headline wasn't enough of a giveaway, that's the cheapest Switch 2 Edition we've seen from Nintendo.</p>
<p>For reference, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> set you back £58.99 / $69.99 for the Switch 2 Edition or £7.99 / $9.99 for the upgrade path. Both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> were £66.99 / $79.99 or £16.99 / $19.99 on new hardware, and while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a>'s upgrades were available for free to NSO subscribers, those who weren't signed up had to pay £66.99 / $79.99 or £7.99 / $9.99 for the full next gen experience.</p>
<p>In short, Animal Crossing is a fair bit cheaper than we would have initially expected. But then, when we think about it, perhaps we should have expected exactly this. ACNH makes for a nice Switch 2 package, with Mouse Mode integration, improved resolutions and GameChat features to boot, but the whole thing feels a little slight compared to other S2 upgrades, no?</p>
<p>The frame rate, for example, remains at 30fps — the first Switch 2 Edition to not contain a boost in this department. There's a fresh Megaphone item, but almost all of the new content is tied to the ver. 3.0 update, which is coming to Switch 1 <em>and</em> 2. Compare that to Kirby or Mario Party, where the upgrades contained new modes and levels, and the reduced price makes a little more sense.</p>
<p>So, are we pleased that New Horizons isn't quite as expensive as the NS2 Editions that have come before it? Yes we are. But can we see why? Hmmm, probably.</p>
