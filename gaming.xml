			<p>The high price ($699) of the PS5 Pro remains a hotly debated subject in the industry. While many fans are still disappointed with the pricing, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-at-700-is-for-superfans-could-sell-13-15-million-in-total-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysts </a>and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-price-is-not-that-bad-says-zampella-youre-not-getting-the-same-performance-from-a-700-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game developers</a> have publicly said it makes sense, considering the market and what's in the hardware.</p>
<p>As for Sony itself, the company recently commented on the topic of pricing (and the decision to leave the disc drive as a separate purchase) in an interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/interview-ps5-pro-toshi-aoki-specs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with IGN</a>. PlayStation Senior Principal Product Manager Toshi Aoki said:</p>
<p><em>Well, the technologies that I just mentioned that we are putting in to deliver new experiences for game players, and also not just the technological differences, but the SSD, the Wi-Fi 7, and the new technologies that surround the gameplay as well. So it's more of a full package that will give that exceptional value to the players... the most engaged players that we're targeting.</em></p>
<p><em>With the PS5 Pro, we are offering all these new tech innovations, and we added the two terabyte SSD, as well as the Wi-Fi 7. We believe as a full package that it offers for the most players. For the disc drive, it is an option for players. Not all players have discs, even though most players may...but we have the option for being able to add that for those players. So I think it's more of the balance of the value proposition that we're giving.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, Aoki also confirmed that Sony had been working on the PS5 Pro even before the base console launched in November 2020.</p>
<p><em>We started discussing it before the PS5 actually came out...because the PS5 specs were already locked in. We were ready to launch and everything. We knew, of course, as you mentioned, technologies evolve every year.</em></p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro will be released on November 7 for $699 / £699 / €799, featuring 67% more Compute Units than the base PS5 as well as the machine learning DLSS-like antialiasing reconstruction technique called PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR). Moreover, its ray tracing capabilities are vastly superior, thanks to improved ray tracing technology borrowed from unreleased AMD graphics cards <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-motivated-amds-development-of-advanced-ray-tracing-says-mark-cerny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following Sony's push</a>.</p>

			<p>Developer Shift Up has <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1839678161963114954" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> update 01.007.000 for Stellar Blade. This patch improves certain visual elements, mainly body collision for the protagonist, and adds a few quality-of-life features listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can still enjoy the "Summer Event" at the Oasis by turning on/off the summer event content toggle.</li>
<li>The summer event BGM (Don't Forget Me) is now available at the camp.</li>
<li>You can mark pins on the map by pressing □ button on the map.</li>
<li>You can use favorites feature on EVE's equipment.</li>
<li>New item "Ammo Package" is now available for purchase, which allows you to stock up on all ammunitions to max at once.</li>
<li>Purchase confirmation pop-up will be shown when spending over 15,000 golds to prevent any unintentional spend.</li>
<li>Visual improvements of conflicts between EVE's body.</li>
<li>Various other bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Shift Up and Sony were recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-and-stellar-blade-developer-gets-sued-for-trademark-infringement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeted by a lawsuit</a> in the United States. The owner of StellarBlade.com, Griffith Chambers Mehaffey, has shared the following statement via his lawyer:</p>
<p><em>Mr. Mehaffey registered the&nbsp;<span>stellarblade.com</span>&nbsp;domain in 2006 and has used the STELLARBLADE name for his business for nearly 15 years. Given this long-standing and public use, it's difficult to imagine that Shift Up and Sony were unaware of Mr. Mehaffey's established rights before adopting their identical mark. We believe in fair competition, but when larger companies disregard the established rights of smaller businesses, it's our responsibility to stand up and protect our brand. The defendants’ far superior resources have effectively monopolized online search results for STELLARBLADE, pushing Mr. Mehaffey's long-established business into digital obscurity and threatening the livelihood he's built over more than a decade.</em></p>
<p>So far, neither Shift Up nor Sony have commented on the lawsuit. Meanwhile, the Seoul-based studio is <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preparing DLCs and a PC port</a> for Stellar Blade following a <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-developer-is-now-worth-as-much-as-koei-tecmo-in-market-capitalization-following-huge-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly successful IPO</a> (initial public offering).</p>

		<p>It’s Zelda O’Clock in Nintendoland, with the release this week of Echoes of Wisdom and the first actual Zelda-centric game in the series. It’s a lovely time, if you ask me, though sure to be a slightly acquired taste for the shift in gameplay style.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/blood-bowl-spike-journal-18-first-look-fire-breathing-little-freaks<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For many a&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl</em>&nbsp;fan, half the fun of the game is waiting to see what new armies will be brought out onto the pitch in a new issue of <em>Spike Journal</em>. And this time around, <em>Spike Journal 18</em>&nbsp;is truly playing to the crowd with the inclusion of Chaos Dwarfs into the game! Games Workshop provided us with a copy of&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl Spike Journal 18</em>&nbsp;to check out ahead of its release, so read on for our quick-look preview!</p>
<h2>Chaos Dwarfs Shine Like Hot Rocks</h2>
<p>Let's jump right in and talk about the Chaos Dwarfs, and the role they'll be playing in&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl</em>. Fresh from the forges of Zharr-Naggrund, the Chaos Dwarfs erupt onto the field ready for some serious carnage. In fact, they're so good at duking it out with their opponents that they often forget to move the ball around. Luckily, a Chaos Dwarfs team can also field Hobgoblins, who do a lot of the ball carrying.</p>
<p>A Chaos Dwarfs team can employ the following units:</p>
<ul><li>0 - 16 Hobgoblin Lineman</li>
<li>0-2 Hobgoblin Sneaky Stabba</li>
<li>0-4 Chaos Dwarf Blocker</li>
<li>0-2 Chaos Dwarf Flamesmith</li>
<li>0-2 Bull Centaur Blitzer</li>
<li>0-1 Minotaur</li>
</ul><p>They also feature a brand new trait, "Breathe Fire (trait)," which states that Once per activation, instead of performing a Block action (either on its own or as part of a Blitz action), this player may perform a Breathe Fire Special action. When you do so, you choose one Standing opposition player and roll a D6, with a good enough roll, you can light them on fire and knock them down!</p>

In addition, the Claws skill cannot be used when making an Armour roll against this player."</p>
<p>I really love the flavor seen throughout the&nbsp;<em>Journal</em>, as we get a ton of lore and history around Chaos Dwarfs in the world of <em>Blood Bowl</em>. As always, the&nbsp;<em>Journal&nbsp;</em>is full of that classic wit and good sense of humor that adds some levity to this wonderfully ridiculous game.</p>
<h2>Star Players Make The Grade</h2>
<p>Contained within the pages of&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl Spike Journal 18</em>&nbsp;are three Star Players from the world of the Chaos Dwarfs! They each bring something unique to the game. Let's start with Zzharg Madeye, a Thrower who's a master of tinkering with the blunderbuss. His special ability, "Then I Started Blastin'!", gives him the opportunity to try and take a shot at an opposing player.</p>
<p>There's also H'thark the Unstoppable, a Bull Centaur Blitzer with the "Unstoppable Momentum" special ability that allows him to re-roll a single block die when he blitzes. I really like the look of this player, and love how the Chaos Dwarfs let you get some Bull Centaurs onto the field.</p>

Rashnak is a Sneaky Stabba who's special ability allows him to add to his injury roll if he successfully breaks armor with a Stab action, because he's bringing poison onto the field. Each of these three Star Players of course also feature great stats, and a range of impressive Skills and Traits. All in all I think Zzharg Madeye is likely the most exciting of the group, but each plays a great role on the field.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Pro Playbook Helps You Score</h2>
<p>Also of note is the very helpful Pro Playbook toward the back of the book, which helps you get to know the Chaos Dwarf crew and is useful in thinking about how to field your team. This is especially appreciated as, and even the&nbsp;<em>Journal</em>&nbsp;itself admits this, Chaos Dwarf teams can be tricky to field at first because of all the different moving parts.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blood-bowl-spike-journal-18-.jpg?itok=C3sPsUKl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blood-bowl-spike-journal-18-.jpg?itok=QDowLRSL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Because some of the players on a Chaos Dwarf team will invariably be slow (aka Dwarfs) while others are quite fast (like Centaurs and Hobgoblins), keeping your group more or less together will be key to success. With advice for how to field on offense (crunch the defense and then have your speedier players gain forward momentum) and defense (let none pass your little shield wall of stocky dudes), the Pro Playbook is extremely helpful.</p>
<p><em>Blood Bowl Spike Journal</em>&nbsp;<em>18</em>&nbsp;also features rules for&nbsp;<em>Dungeon Bowl</em>, tons of lore, and a classic comic strip. If you're interested in building up a Chaos Dwarf team, <i>Spike Journal 18</i>&nbsp;is a must!</p>

		<p>A new trailer for <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-8-remake">Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake</a> has debuted ahead of the game’s upcoming release with preorders now live. <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/koei-tecmo">Koei Tecmo</a> will bring the reinvigorated grand strategy game to PS4, PS5, PC, and Nintendo Switch late next month on October 24th.</p>
<p><iframe title="ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS 8 REMAKE - Second Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6L-YjfVkQPc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The latest trailer gives fans an overview of the many systems and features at play. For those completely new to Romance of the Three Kingdoms, it’s an ongoing series of historical grand strategy titles that originated in 1985, allowing players to command armies during ancient China’s Warring States period. It’s the same setting used in Koei’s flagship <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dynasty-warriors">Dynasty Warriors</a> franchise which is being rebooted early next year with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/27/dynasty-warriors-origins-release-date-confirmed-watch-23-minutes-of-gameplay/">the launch of Dynasty Warriors: Origins in January 2025</a>.</p>
<p>ROTK fans each have their own favourite in the series, though 8 remains one of the most pivotal and popular instalments. Koei and developer Kou Shibusawa seem to think so, with Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake receiving more than just a simple remaster treatment. New content and features have been added to the game, deepening the web of strategic and roleplaying options, as well as the number of playable scenarios.</p>
<p>The newly added Wisdom trait will offer an additional layer of player progression that not only increases as you participate in battles, but also when you interact with fellow officers. The popular Duels features has also seen a significant upgrade, now complemented by Debates which allow shrewd strategists to take part in non-combat political showdowns.</p>

<h3>Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake Key Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Every officer can be the hero! The “All Officers Play” of ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS VIII returns.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>More than 55 scenarios spanning over 80 years and featuring the largest number of officers in the series, from rulers to free officers. Play through a vast, deep, and turbulent Three Kingdoms period as you choose.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vivid depiction of the drama between officers. A variety of fascinating new features!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Many new features have been added to portray a variety of human dramas, such as “Tales” in which players can choose which events unfold. In addition, you can be linked by “Destiny” with other officers, and gain special relationships.</p>
<p>The relationship or “Links Forged” between each officer greatly affects how the gameplay unfolds. Changes in that relationship can be ascertained from the “Relationship Chart”.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Graphical enhancements</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to newly drawn officer graphics, the scenic beauty of the game is depicted using ink paintings, combining 2D visuals and 3D depth to create a beautiful visual experience of the world of the Three Kingdoms.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-trading-card-games-worth-getting-into.995076/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tcgs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Today, card games are everywhere, but in 1993, the trading card game (TCG) genre was born with just one: <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/magic-the-gathering-trading-card-game">Magic: The Gathering</a>, created by Richard Garfield. I became a fan a few years later, in 1996, during the release of the Fourth Edition core set.</p><p>Once I got the hang of the game, I was hooked for nearly three years. The artwork drew me in, and the flavor text – often witty, dark, and sarcastic – kept me entertained, but what I loved most was playing. The tactile thrill of placing a card on the table, imagining myself as a powerful planeswalker commanding forces beyond mortal comprehension, was unbeatable.</p><p>Though other trading card games existed back then, my loyalty to Magic: The Gathering consumed both my attention and my budget. Fast forward to today, and the landscape is even more crowded. The old titans of the genre are still thriving, while countless newer games vie for attention, each bringing something unique to the table. </p><p>With that in mind, here are the 10 best trading and living card games to dive into in 2024 – games that are fun to play, boast active communities, and have the potential for long-term growth. Whatever you decide to try out and play, make sure you have a community to share it with: either a local one where you live or an online one that is supportive. The community surrounding the game is as important as the game itself.</p><h2><strong>The Big Three</strong></h2><p>These are the established choices for anyone who's deciding on a trading card game.</p><h3><strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong></h3><div catalogid="c3ff5053-f2c1-4f32-ad5c-f8565776ad6e" id="205115"><div id="205115" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Magic: The Gathering 2021 Arena Starter Kit</h3></p><div><p>Start small with this affordable starter kit.</p></div></div><p>The original trading card playing experience, Magic: The Gathering established so many norms that we take for granted today. Plains, Swamps, Forests, Mountains, Islands – these were the lands you drew power from, to call angels, demons, zombies, orcs, goblins, and enchanted creatures to your side. The benefits of picking up Magic: The Gathering now, nearly 30 years into its run, are the same as the drawbacks: It's just so big at this point. There's a lot to explore and play with, but it can be intimidating and overwhelming to learn it from scratch. As was true back when I started playing, the best way to learn is not by reading the instruction booklet that comes with every starter deck, but by having a friend walk you through a match.</p><p><em>You can check out our guide to all of the </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-full-release-schedule-2024"><em>upcoming MTG releases</em></a><em> coming in 2024 and beyond.</em></p><h3><strong>Pokémon TCG</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="8a5b9f41-9977-449d-9c9e-ac7ca8f498bf" id="201934"><div id="201934" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet— Temporal Forces Elite Trainer Box</h3></p><div><p>The Elite Trainer Box includes cool card sleeves featuring Walking Wake or Iron Leaves, high-quality accessories, 9 booster packs, and much more.</p></div></div><p>Still popular after all these years, Pokemon TCG started in 1996. Its cards in America were originally published by Wizards of the Coast, the same company that published Magic: The Gathering. Pokemon's fan base has always been more collector-heavy than player-heavy, but this has been especially true in recent years, as the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-check-value-of-pokemon-cards">value of Pokemon cards</a> has continued to go up. (Most famously in 2021, Logan Paul <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-most-expensive-pokemon-cards">paid $5.27 million</a> for a Grade 10 Pokemon Illustrator card, which he occasionally wears around his neck when he wrestles in WWE.) Beyond this, there's an appealing simplicity to Pokemon, in that your turn is largely your own; you aren't overlapping moves or playing over your opponent's turn, which makes things a lot more streamlined.</p><p><em>You can check out our guide to all of the </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-release-full-release-schedule-2024"><em>upcoming Pokemon TCG releases</em></a><em> coming in 2024 and beyond.</em></p><h3><strong>Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="14a77cec-3191-46e6-b5e7-9e18c747b1f5" id="207823"><div id="207823" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG: 25th Anniversary Tin</h3></p><div><p>Pick up a starter set of Yu-Gi-Oh cards at an affordable price.</p></div></div><p>Recognized in 2009 by Guinness as the highest-selling trading card game in the world, Yu-Gi-Oh! popularized chains as a gameplay mechanic, and it was considerably more chaotic than its predecessors. You're often countering and making significant moves during your opponent's turn in addition to your own, and on its highest levels, the victor can be determined on a starting hand and who goes first. Your enjoyment will largely depend on who you learn from, especially if you're coming into the game cold.</p><h2><strong>The Newcomers</strong></h2><p>The seven TCGs below might not have the decades-long legacies of the Big Three, but they're making plenty of noise and are worth checking out.</p><h3><strong>Digimon TCG</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="b8f18be2-486d-4463-9908-3a3f68f29806" id="207827"><div id="207827" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Digimon Card Game Starter Deck: Dragon of Courage</h3></p><div><p>Comes with a total of 54 cards.</p></div></div><p>Newly revamped for 2020, Digimon's main draw is its progression: Hatch an egg, have it undergo Digivolution (which allows you to improve upon your Digimon's stats), and move it to the Battle Area to attack your opponent. It is still a newer TCG game, relatively speaking, which means that it doesn't have the legacy baggage of the prior three. The community is notably welcoming and open to new innovations, and the metagame is diverse and still in the process of being defined.</p><h3><strong>Netrunner</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="34758424-cc74-4a65-a7ef-1def5b44aef7" id="207829"><div id="207829" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Android Netrunner LCG: True Colors Data Pack</h3></p></div><p>Set in a cyberpunk dystopia, <a href="https://nullsignal.games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netrunner</a>, which pits hackers against a faceless corporate entity, has a long, complex history. The original physical card game came out in 1996, and it was revamped and released as Android: Netrunner in 2012. Today, it currently exists as an ongoing fan project. Non-profit game publisher Null Signal Games releases new starter and expansion sets, and the PDFs are all available on a pay-what-you-want basis. These new sets are also compatible with the prior Android: Netrunner sets, and everything, from the artwork to the new mechanics, feels legitimate and true to form.</p><h3><strong>Disney Lorcana</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="80627262-4d23-4f43-b7ab-b5b35d71d061" id="207002"><div id="207002" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Disney Lorcana: The First Chapter TCG Captain Hook Deck Box</h3></p></div><p>When Disney commits to something, they go full throttle. <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/disney-lorcana">Disney Lorcana</a>, which draws from over 100 years of Disney animated history, takes full advantage of the nostalgia and sea of creative properties inherent in its brand. Instead of land, you summon with ink, and true to Disney's family-friendly image, you accumulate 20 points instead of decimating your opponent's life to win. There are currently over 600 different cards in print between the starter set and the two expansions. The newest expansion, Chapter 4: Ursula's Return, launched on May 31.</p><h3><strong>Marvel Champions: The Card Game</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="432139cf-826e-468c-922a-f9287d84bfd2" id="157793"><div id="157793" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Marvel Champions: The Card Game</h3></p><div><p>The base set includes 343 cards.</p></div></div><p>Name recognition goes a long way. In Marvel Champions, select the specific Marvel superhero that you want to play. Then, team up with other players and work through different scenarios, in which you defeat villains and foil their schemes. The Core set starts you with five different selectable heroes: Iron Man, Black Panther, Spider-Man, Captain Marvel, and She-Hulk. Subsequent Expansion packs give you prebuilt decks that allow you to play as over 30 additional characters and face additional villains with different storylines. It's among one of our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-marvel-board-games">favorite Marvel card games</a> available.</p><h3><strong>Arkham Horror: The Card Game </strong></h3></div><div catalogid="d2a8ea61-6747-4491-9e52-13b0b8d8a9e9" id="204554"><div id="204554" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game</h3></p><div><p>You can choose to add on various expansions.</p></div></div><p>Inspired by the 1981 horror RPG <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-cthulhu">Call of Cthulhu</a>, Arkham Horror is a supernatural, Lovecraftian mystery game. It puts you in the shoes of an investigator, who must work through a creepy horror scenario and emerge with their body and sanity intact. You start by choosing an investigator: a Guardian, Seeker, Rogue, Mystic, Survivor, or Neutral, each of which has its specific strengths and weaknesses. Then, you investigate missing people, creepy cults, rumors of a lost ancient city, and more. It's all very evocative and tentacled. It's a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-rpg-board-games">great RPG card game</a> worth getting into</p><h3><strong>Star Wars Unlimited</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="7a2d5b6c-bfd8-490b-be68-902394a3ad16" id="196833"><div id="196833" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Star Wars: Unlimited</h3></p><div><p>See all of the available options.</p></div></div><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-unlimited">Star Wars: Unlimited</a> is a brand new card game, but the established pre-existing universe of Star Wars makes this an excellent place to start; its longevity is nearly guaranteed, given the franchise's popularity. You play as a leader of your respective faction – the starter set includes Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. Then you wage war, sending out droids and troops or using Force powers until one base is destroyed. The current set, Spark of Rebellion, focuses largely on the events of the original trilogy. The most recent expansion set, Shadows of the Galaxy, focuses on the criminal underbelly of the galaxy, and features mercenaries and bounty hunters.</p><h3><strong>Flesh and Blood</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="2178cfb3-a6dc-44f6-986f-684b5d2eca17" id="207824"><div id="207824" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Flesh and Blood: Part The Mistveil Blitz Deck Collection</h3></p><div><p>A great starting point for newcomers.</p></div></div><p>The creators of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/flesh-and-blood">Flesh and Blood</a> are traditionalists; they designed their game to be played in person – hence, in “Flesh and Blood” – rather than an online format. The game is fantasy-themed, and you have a hero who falls into one of 11 classes: Assassin, Brute, Guardian, Illusionist, Mechanologist, Merchant, Ninja, Ranger, Runeblade, Warrior, or Wizard. You equip your hero, build a deck around them, and send them into battle with spells, blows, and counterblows at the ready.</p><p><em>Kevin Wong is a contributing freelancer for IGN, specializing in LEGO and Card Games.

<p>You deserve to play a game that runs smoothly whenever you boot it up. Unfortunately, that’s not often the case. More frequently than developers care to admit, modern video games launch unoptimized and buggy. But with a few tweaks, you can run the hottest MMORPG blowing up on Steam. Here are the best PC settings to improve performance in Throne and Liberty!</p>



<h2 id="h-recommended-pc-graphics-settings-for-throne-and-liberty">Recommended PC Graphics Settings for Throne and Liberty</h2>



<p>If you find that Throne and Liberty, the latest MMORPG published by Amazon, doesn’t run as smoothly as you’d like on PC, then you have plenty of graphical settings options to tweak. There’s a lot of choice here, allowing you to tweak the game and how it looks to your liking. These are recommendations, though.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>FSR/DLSS Upscaling</strong>: Performance or Ultra Performance</li>



<li><strong>Resolution</strong>: Native</li>



<li><strong>Frame Rate Limit</strong>: No Limit</li>



<li><strong>VSync</strong>: Off</li>



<li><strong>Resolution Rate</strong>: 100%</li>



<li><strong>Optimize Large-Scale Combat</strong>: On</li>

<li><strong>Visual Fidelity</strong>: Medium or Low</li>



<li><strong>Character Count</strong>: Low</li>

</ul>



<p>Nearly every other setting in the game, go ahead and change to suit your preferences and system hardware!</p>

<h2 id="h-throne-and-liberty-settings-tips">Throne and Liberty Settings Tips</h2>



<ul>
<li>To control your character and camera, I recommend using <strong>Classic Mode</strong> for greater precision and that old-school feel, especially if you’re coming from an MMORPG like World of Warcraft or EverQuest 2!</li>



<li>Turn off “<strong>Auto-Move to Interactive Target</strong>“; otherwise, you risk misclicking in the middle of combat and making a costly mistake.</li>
</ul>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/nhl-25-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nhl-25-review-in-progress.995046/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nhl-25-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Despite some enhancements, so far this doesn’t seem like the current-gen hockey game fans have waited for.</h2></div><section><p>Every year I get my hopes up thinking, “This is it: This’ll be the year that EA’s NHL finally gets it together and delivers on its full potential,” only to then spend dozens of hours playing a game that is almost fundamentally the same as the one I played the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nhl-24-review"><u>previous year</u></a>. There are rare exceptions to this; even though I had my issues with NHL 24, the Sustained Pressure System and Exhaustion Engine at least added something new to the overall gameplay, and NHL 21’s Be a Pro Mode has become a staple. Unfortunately, it seems like NHL 25 isn’t going to be one of those exceptions. Keep in mind that these are just my initial, early impressions of NHL 25 after just a few hours on the ice. But you only get to make one first impression, and right now I’m not feeling too optimistic.</p><p>Mechanically I’ve yet to see a lot of meaningful changes, but on the surface level, at least, it’s clear right from the start that NHL 25 is the first game in the series built exclusively for current-gen consoles. The graphics are sharp and the action looks better than ever. Animations are smoother and there’s something satisfying about seeing how much wear and tear you put on the ice. Players now look much more like humans and less like animatronics, so zoom-ins on faces will hopefully no longer provide a lot of nightmare fuel. We can’t say there’s been no positive steps made.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>However, Franchise is the only mode that’s been given a significant overhaul relative to last year’s version. The most immediately noticeable change is that the newly redesigned hub menu is sleeker and easier to parse. But there have also been actual gameplay additions, too. For example, GMs must convince free agents to sign with their team if the player’s interest in the organization is too low. </p><p>How they go about doing that is up to them. Maybe it’s by promising to let them play on the first line. You can attempt to charm them, but if it fails it might kill their interest in your offer entirely. And players can actually negotiate no-movement or no-trade clauses into their contracts, which is a feature that the NHL playerbase has been requesting for a while now. </p><p>GMs can also discuss what the team should be focusing on during the offseason with head coaches, which essentially provides season-wide buffs and debuffs for the team. Players can also be approached with the conversation system to let GMs develop them individually. Seasonal goals and on-ice plays can be assigned, which will lead to boosts if the player is successful. I haven’t had the time I’ve needed yet to see how much impact these types of decisions will actually have in a Franchise playthrough, so I won’t be able to say for certain if these are meaningful until my final review.</p><p>You might be wondering how Be a Pro is different this time around. Well, it’s not. Even the intro cinematics seem to be identical, which is doubly bad because I had this same complaint last year. The entire mode just seems shoehorned into each installment with the bare minimum of care or attention. I would love to have some type of story mode that was more than just text bubbles and choosing a response like in those annoying mobile game ads, but I guess that’s just not going to happen anytime soon.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It seems like it’s still stuck in the same last-gen rut.</p></div><p>So you can say I’m not wowed by what I’ve seen so far, but we’re still in the first period here: I’ve yet to touch the online modes at all, though I did briefly open a HUT Pack only to have NHL 25 crash midway through the lootbox animation. Hopefully I won’t encounter too many more glitches like that. I’ll be upfront and admit that Franchise Mode has never appealed to me too much because that type of sports sim management is not what I’m personally looking for in a hockey game – I prefer to be out on the ice than in the office – but I do plan to give it a fair shot and see if that mode finally clicks with me thanks to the new changes.</p><p>Based on what I’ve played so far, though? I’m just not feeling very impressed by NHL 25. For being the first NHL game exclusively for current-gen consoles, it’s a shame that it seems like it’s still stuck in the same last-gen rut.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/explaining-and-fixing-igns-face-off-controversy</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/explaining-%E2%80%93-and-fixing-%E2%80%93-igns-face-off-controversy.995043/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/explaining-and-fixing-igns-face-off-controversy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Over the past few days you might’ve caught wind of some controversy stemming from IGN’s community game of the year Face-Off. It’s become a full-on drama, complete with literal ups and downs, shocking twists, and accusations of foul play flying. There’s also quite a bit of confusion, so to clear it up a bit I’m going to walk you through how we got here, and how we’re making it right.</p><p>Early this year IGN rolled out a new version of our Face-Off tool, and it’s become a pet project of mine to use it to get our community to create ranked lists of games, movies, TV shows, and literally everything else that people have opinions about. It works by showing you two things and letting you pick whichever you think should win, whether that’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/faceoffs/face-off-what-is-the-best-star-wars-movie-or-tv-show">The Empire Strikes Back vs Attack of the Clones</a>, or <a href="https://www.ign.com/faceoffs/whats-the-best-call-of-duty-game-of-all-time">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (2011) vs Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (2023)</a>. It then generates a list of your personal rankings, while also mashing your votes together with everybody else to create a community ranking. It’s far from perfect, and we hope to iterate on it so that it becomes a better experience that creates a more accurate personal list for you in fewer matches. Even so, it’s been a lot of fun to mess with and find interesting ways to use it – and to watch people agonize over tough choices between two things they love.</p><p>On February 22, after a few big 2024 games had launched, I started the <a href="https://www.ign.com/faceoffs/whats-your-game-of-the-year-2024-so-far">What’s Your Game of the Year So Far? Face-Off</a> as an experiment to see how the running tally would look if we’re adding new games as they come out. Importantly, this was an informal test that asked a casual question about how people are feeling in the moment, and it was never presented as our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-community-awards-2023">official Game of the Year community vote</a>. We still plan to do that the old-fashioned way later this year, and it will be entirely separate from this. (To answer the frequently asked question of why Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is on the list when it’s a DLC expansion and not a full new game: Because there are no rules and I wanted to see what would happen! I’ll put Starfield: Shattered Space on there next week, too.) This use case technically wasn’t what the tool was built for, but I wanted to see if it would work – and the results have been promising. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This was an informal test that asked a casual question.</p></div><p>How the list shakes out is proving to be very interesting because the community ranking is based on the win/loss ratio, rather than the sheer number of votes a game receives. That means a new entry added in November can outrank something added in May simply because it wins more often, as opposed to more times. For instance, something that’s chosen as the winner in 6,500 out of 10,000 matches will outrank another item that wins 60,000 out of 100,000 matches. (It’s very silly when you add something new and it’s #1 with a 100% win ratio for a brief moment, but that quickly evens out.) So, while the hot new thing might get a lot of wins shortly after it comes out, after the honeymoon period expires and people move on to other games its ranking might fall if it’s more of a flash in the pan than something that sticks with you for a long time, as truly great games do. Ideally, people would only vote on games that they’ve actually played and disqualify the rest (using the little X in the corner of each card) so they’re not voting against something they don’t have an informed opinion on, but realistically I know the overwhelming majority is not going to do that. This is purely a popularity contest.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Even so, it’s been a treat to watch how things have played out, and the resulting ranking is a fascinating melding of thousands of different people’s opinions. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth had held a steady lead most of the year, but Shadow of the Erdtree was nipping at its heels for months. (See? People wanted to vote for it.) When Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, Helldivers 2, Space Marine 2, Astro Bot, and Black Myth: Wukong, and other popular games came out, they shot up into the top half of the list and jockeyed for position. There were no hard rules (again, Face-Offs are a wild west territory for us!) but I mostly added games that either scored 8 or above on IGN or had proven themselves popular or at least interesting elsewhere. At the same time, I periodically pruned low-performing games from the bottom of the rankings that looked like they were never going to recover to make way for new entries and prevent the list of games from becoming unmanageably long – Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League didn’t make it, I’m afraid. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Then, late last week, it dramatically blew up.</p></div><p>Until recently, the GOTY So Far Face-Off wasn’t exactly lighting the world on fire in terms of traffic numbers (not a ton of people are looking for Game of the Year content in April). Still, it had been humming along nicely, racking up hundreds of thousands of votes, and I think there’s a lot of potential for it in the future. </p><p>Then, late last week, it dramatically blew up: The Black Myth: Wukong fandom discovered the Face-Off page and, seeing that their favorite game was within striking distance of the top of the list, rallied around it. We saw a massive influx of traffic from Chinese and other Asian sources to that page, and over the weekend Black Myth’s win percentage went from a very respectable showing in the 60s all the way up to an absolutely astronomical 90.4%, blowing past Rebirth’s relatively meager 72%. We never saw that coming, and what had been a relatively stable list was upended so quickly our scheduled social media repromotion of a Playlist built to reflect the top games – as they had been – was caught flat-footed and caused major confusion because it hadn't been updated yet. Face-Offs are dynamic and react to the community; Playlists are not and must be manually updated. We’ve learned from this that the two probably should not mix!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Aside from that wrinkle, this response to Face-Offs is exactly what I hoped would happen… but on an intensity level I hadn’t imagined. Our goal is for Face-Offs to be fun, and by golly, people were having an absolute blast with it – some were even livestreaming as they refreshed the page to see how high Black Myth could go! For the record, we don’t consider it cheating at all for fan communities to champion their game and support it by voting, and it’s actually encouraged for people to run through multiple times. (The double-bracket system we currently use means that a single run could possibly eliminate a #3 choice early on, and everything is not matched against everything, so more data gives a better picture of your preferences.) We were thrilled that so many Black Myth fans noticed the Face-Off and participated in force, and we’d love nothing more than for other fandoms to join in the fray. Friendly rivalries like that would be the best-case scenario for us, and we’d find out what other games those groups are into in the process by seeing how the rest of the list shook out. In the past few days we've gotten nearly twice as many votes on this Face-Off than it'd racked up in the previous six months.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This response to Face-Offs is exactly what I hoped would happen… but on an intensity level I hadn’t imagined.</p></div><p>But of course, this is the internet, and on the internet we know certain immutable truths. One is that online polling is not secure. Just about anything can be manipulated if someone puts their mind to it, especially if you’re not creating multiple layers of security and identity verification to lock it down. Face-Offs aren’t intended to be taken super seriously, so we don’t even require you to create an IGN account to participate – as we do with our traditional Community Game of the Year vote – because we want as many people to join in as possible. (We’d love it if you did create an account, though – it’ll save your progress on a run and your personal vote count if you’re signed in.)</p><p>Another truth is that the more people pay attention to something, the more likely it is that a bad actor tries to ruin the fun. In this case, it appears that someone – probably fully aware of how closely this page was being watched – figured out a way to quickly dump tens of thousands of votes against Black Myth: Wukong into the system, dropping it back down into the high 60s in a matter of hours. If trolling the Black Myth: Wukong fanbase during a moment of triumph was the goal here, it was extremely effective. We’ve seen a lot of anger and accusations of altering the results leveled at us, which is disappointing because again, this was all supposed to be for fun.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This was all supposed to be for fun.</p></div><p>To be explicitly clear, <strong>no one at IGN tampered with the results of this Face-Off in any way</strong> during this period. We’ve spent the past few days investigating what happened, and how we can keep Face-Offs making people happy instead of mad going forward. Here’s what the voting activity looked like on September 21 through 24, by the hour, from the top regions where people were participating. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/graph2-1727477329030.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>You can see the massive, sustained influx of pro-Black Myth: Wukong voters who pushed it to the top of the list, followed by a short but potent spike. That corresponds to the period where it fell back down.</p><p>The fact that Black Myth’s vote total so quickly surpassed that of games that had been accruing votes for months before it was added to the list of games strongly suggests that someone exploited the system to allow them to vote only on one specific game – something the randomization of matches is intended to prevent. Likewise, that double-elimination bracket system means you should only be able to vote against a game twice in a run before it stops showing up, since it clearly wasn’t going to be your favorite, but that also seems to have been bypassed to achieve this volume of losses in such a short time. </p><p>Unfortunately, since Face-Offs aren’t limited to logged-in users it’s not obvious which votes are real and which are fake, so we can’t simply delete the exact number of suspicious votes. However, in the interest of fairness, we’ve decided to remove all of the negative votes from the period that the Black Myth: Wukong community and our engineers have identified as the most likely to be fraudulent, during which the win percentage fell at what should’ve been an impossible rate – a total of 46,000 losses. As of this writing, that change <strong>moves Black Myth: Wukong back into the #1 position on the list</strong>, with a 76% win rate. It’s unfortunate to lose any valid votes that were caught up in the mix, but this is the best solution we have given the information available. </p><p>Over the next few months we’ll keep an eye on this Face-Off to guard against other efforts to manipulate the results. This being the internet, there’s no realistic way to prevent someone who knows what they’re doing from playing dirty tricks on a anonymous online poll, but we’ve taken steps to at least mitigate their effectiveness going forward, and we hope to continue to improve Face-Offs in a lot of different ways to make them even more fun to engage with. I hope you continue to enjoy them!</p><p>In the meantime, our What’s Your Game of the Year So Far? Face-Off continues: Yesterday I added The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom (to both this Face-Off and our <a href="https://www.ign.com/faceoffs/the-legend-of-zelda-which-game-is-the-best">Zelda-specific</a> one), so if you’re playing and have an idea of where it belongs relative to other 2024 games, we’d love to have your vote. If you’re passionate about <a href="https://www.ign.com/faceoffs/whats-your-movie-of-the-year-for-2024-so-far/results">movies</a> or <a href="https://www.ign.com/faceoffs/whats-your-tv-show-of-the-year-for-2024-so-far/results">TV shows</a> this year, check out our Face-Offs for those as well.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-if-there-are-no-opportunities.995025/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/games-media-journalism-layoffs-gamurs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Whenever there are games media layoffs these days--<a href="https://aftermath.site/gamurs-group-has-more-shitty-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and really, what day aren't there any</a>--there's a certain cadence to the news. Those with their ears to the ground, or anyone following the affected writers on social media, hear about things first because a site's owners are usually too cowardly to make a public announcement. Then websites like this one report the news to a wider audience.</p><p>Then, outside of the news cycle, there's the wash. The tweets and Linkedin messages that come after. I've seen so many of them over the years that there's a definite pattern to them, all of them opening with something like "my time at GamesPub has sadly come to an end after my Slack access was removed without notice, and everything I ever wrote for the site has been deleted", and all of them ending with some variation of "I'm now open to opportunities", or "please consider me for any openings".</p><p>As someone who left the commercial side of this industry very recently, I know how important those closing lines can be. If you suddenly find yourself without a job, and you've been doing that job for years, you naturally want to keep doing that job!<a href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-industry-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> But just as we wrote about recently with game developers</a>, when your industry is contracting as rapidly as games media is, there just aren't enough jobs to go around.</p><p>Whole networks are collapsing or being gobbled up by larger ones, and even the few big sites left routinely shed staff, to the point where it feels like there are more writers <em>out </em>of work than there are working. For the 30 people laid off at Gamurs this week, for example, what's out there? Not 30 paying jobs in games media, that's for sure. There are maybe a handful of openings worldwide, each of which probably has hundreds of applicants. Which is why those parting messages from laid off staff are always so heartbreaking: they're not being laid off from a job, but often from their <em>career</em>. </p><p>This contraction not only massively impacts those laid off, it has knock-on effects on the sites you can still read and the people who work there. Experienced leadership in the field is being thinned as callously as younger writers, while pathways for fresh talent are being bottlenecked because the few jobs that <em>are </em>out there inevitably go to more experienced, displaced writers.</p><p>This is maddening for the toll this takes on individual writers, but it's exponentially so considering how we as an industry got here. It's usually always the same story: inept ownership over-commits to an industry, sets unrealistic growth targets, misunderstands the field and the medium or, in the most explosive cases, it's all of the above. And when things inevitably go bad, it's not the bone-headed owners being "re-adjusted" or seeing their jobs "restructured". It is, like it always is, the workers paying the price.</p><p>Games media is in many respects a pretty shitty job, at least these days. It tends to be underpaid, full of abuse, exploits young writers and subjects most to the soul-crushing drudgery of posting SEO and algorithm-friendly garbage. Yet writers persist, if not for the love of writing then for the love of the medium and the hopes that <em>someone</em> out there appreciates what they've written.</p><p>And those are the challenges facing a stable job! Throw in the uncertainty and anxiety over your position at a more perilous site--or even entire network--and you can see how much of a knife's edge the entire medium of professional, written games coverage is.<a href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-game-development-ign-kotaku" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> It's no wonder there's a pipeline of writers fleeing to games development</a>; the latter might be an industry on fire, but when your own is already engulfed in flames, why not?</p><p>Everyone laid off from <em>any </em>job deserves better, but I think--and this is given my own experiences of course--being laid off from a games writing job because your owner is bad hits especially hard. Most of these sites were successful for their scale, with loyal readerships, so I can only hope that at some point in the future we can stop writing about how much this all sucks for affected writers and start writing about sites, networks, and owners who actually know what they’re doing.&nbsp;</p><p>To everyone who has been laid off this week, last week or any week and found new work in the space: I'm happy you got to keep doing what you love. But for the many more who <em>haven't</em> been able to return to games media, I at least hope you've found some kind of happiness working somewhere safer, more stable and that (probably) pays better.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A kid with a tiger cub pal named Noah finds him, and before long, Majima finds himself beating up a pirate captain and taking over his ship (or so it’s implied.) I got my first hands-on with the latest in the Yakuza franchise, and I’d love to tell you about it.</p><p>I played a short portion of Pirate Yakuza when Majima, Noah, and friends arrived in Infinite Wealth’s familiar locale of Honolulu, but this was very much constructed as a demo, so I can’t be certain of how similar the next series of events would be to the full game. First, a short combat tutorial on mechanics potentially unfamiliar to Infinite Wealth players: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii isn’t a turn-based RPG like Infinite Wealth, but instead an action beat-em-up like the original Yakuza games. This short tutorial primarily described Majima’s two fighting styles: Majima’s classic Mad Dog Style and the new, aptly pirate-themed Sea Dog Style. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>In Sea Dog Style, Majima wields dual cutlasses, a long-range hand cannon, and a wire hook that allows you to pull in close to a targeted enemy. A cutlass can also be thrown as a boomerang if a button is held down. Combat is engaging and fun, and I can see it being varied enough to keep things interesting with just its two different styles. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Dragon Kart mini-game is basically Yakuza Mario Kart, complete with boosts, drifting, coins, and items.</p></div><p>After the basic tutorial, I could choose whether to go to the fabled Madlantis to continue the story, or do one of a few side activities: Karaoke, Dragon Kart, Crazy Delivery, and fit check (change clothes). </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>I don’t have quite enough experience with these mini-games in previous Yakuza games, so I couldn’t comment on whether anything substantial had changed about them, but they were all fun and worthy of spending time on for the entertainment factor alone. I can tell you that long-time Yakuza fans will definitely recognize at least some of the songs available in karaoke, though. </p><p>Yakuza: Like a Dragon’s mini-game Dragon Kart wasn’t in Infinite Wealth, making it the most far-removed of the side activities available during the demo. This absorbing mini-game is pretty built out in its own right and is basically Yakuza Mario Kart, complete with boosts, drifting, coins, and items. You can also go to a changing room to switch out Majima’s clothes for both his regular and pirate styles.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In between side-activities, I became best friends with a little bird named Joseph and used the new Wire Hook while out exploring to gather a high-up butterfly. Apparently you can swing around Hawaii with it, but I didn’t see any obvious points to trigger this when I played. </p><p>Finally, for the main event, I got to see a bit of the brand new location of Madlantis. This grungy yet lively ship-graveyard-turned-mini-city-inside-a-cave-in-the-middle-of-the-ocean looks like a worthy hub. It’s at least home to Pirate Colosseum, where, in the full game, you’ll be able to engage in “intense ship battles” as the Goro Pirates. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Unfortunately, I didn’t get to try out any sort of ship battle in the demo, which was a little disappointing to say the least, but Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is ship-shaping up to be a seaworthy spin-off with a fin-favorite at its helm. (Sorry, I couldn’t resist.) </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Right now you can get it for $1069.00, which is easily the lowest price we've seen thus far for this particular size and model. The LG Evo C4 is an outstanding TV that has won top spots in several of our buying guides, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-high-end-4k-tv">best 4K TV</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tv-for-gaming">best TV for gaming</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tvs-for-ps5">best TV for the PlayStation 5</a>. This is an especially good buy if you picked up the new <a href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, since the updated hardware will be able to run more games at a consistent 4K @ 120fps.</p><h2><s>5</s>5" LG Evo C4 4K OLED Smart TV: The Best PS5 TV</h2><div catalogid="4ea589e3-03a7-4c66-a69b-010ea4e2b7b6" id="207856"><div id="207856" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>55" LG Evo C4 4K OLED Smart TV</h3></p></div><p>The C4 is the current generation 2024 model among LG's highly vaunted C-series OLED TV lineup. It's an incremental upgrade over the 2023 C3, with the most noticeable improvements being an upgraded processor,  newer WebOS smart interface, support for DTS audio, and a higher 144Hz refresh rate. This is a true OLED TV, which is the best type of TV you can get right now. Compared to a traditional LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times. The C4 uses LG's Evo panel, which offers higher brightness levels than traditional OLED TVs. Because of these advantages, the OLED TV excels at displaying 4K HDR content in all of its intended glory. Compared to other OLED TVs, LG has the most generations of updates and improvements so we're keen to choose this brand over others.</p><p>The C4 also has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV. It has four HDMI 2.1 ports all capable of up to 144Hz refresh rate at 4K resolution. That's great news for PS5 (and now PS5 Pro), Xbox Series X, and PC gamers, since several games can be played at frame rates of 120fps and beyond. The C4 also supports variable refresh rate (VRR) including NVIDIA G-SYNC and auto low latency mode (ALLM). When connected to a PC, it supports chroma 4:4:4 for better text legibility.</p><p>A particularly nice feature that isn't advertised often is the surprisingly light weight of the C4. The 55" TV weighs in at only 31.1 pounds without the stand. That's because the rear cabinet housing is made of a composite fiber that's lighter than the plastics most TVs use. It might not matter much in the long term, but this is a welcome advantage when you are first setting up your TV, especially if you plan on wall mounting.</p><h3>Should You Buy Now or Wait for Black Friday?</h3><p>Although this is an extremely good discount for one of our favorite gaming TVs, you may be wondering if you should wait until Black Friday to make a purchase. We can honestly say that it's very possible <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday 2024</a> will have lower prices on the LG C4 TV in general, however we almost never see a 55" LG OLED TV sell for under $1,000, even on older models. If you are looking for another size, waiting for Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals is probably the right call. But this discount makes this easily one of the<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tv-deals-labor-day-2024-sales"> best TV deals happening right now</a>.</p><p><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

                <p>Seven years after its initial release, Horizon Zero Dawn is getting a remastered version that upgrades its visuals and adds rebuilt and re-recorded dialogue scenes, bringing the original PlayStation 4 game more in line with its PS5 sequel, Horizon Forbidden West. If you've never played the first Horizon game, Sony will soon sell a <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1854857059163533354%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fheres-how-to-get-horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-for-20-if-youre-a-new-player%2F1100-6526779%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">physical edition of Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a></strong> for $50--but if you take advantage of its current upgrade track, you can nab a digital version of the remaster for a mere $20.</p><p>The trick here is to purchase the digital version of the original Horizon Zero Dawn. Sony offers an upgrade to Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered on PS5 for just $10, so instead of paying full price for the new game, you can buy the older, cheaper version and upgrade it.

It's slightly more expensive at $20 at GameStop, so with the upgrade, it brings your total to $30--but still cheaper than buying the remaster itself. And of course, if you already own Horizon Zero Dawn either on PS4 or PC, you're already eligible for the $10 upgrade. Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered is set to launch on October 31.</p><p>It's been a big week for the Horizon series. Alongside the announcement of Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered during Sony's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-september-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5793/" data-ref-id="2900-5793">State of Play livestream</a>, the publisher also announced Lego Horizon Adventures, a Lego game take on the franchise. That synergy makes sense, as Horizon is already big among Lego fans, thanks to a bunch of sets that let you build its iconic robot creatures--and they're pretty impressive.</p><p>Leading the pack is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-horizon-zero-dawn-tallneck-set-restocked-before-lego-horizon-adventures/1100-6526690/" data-ref-id="1100-6526690">1,222-piece Lego Tallneck</a>, which is only available at Amazon. You can get it for $105, which is a little more than the $90 it cost when it was first released. The increase appears to be part of Amazon's exclusivity, but the set is Prime-eligible for free shipping, and is still cheaper than trying to get it from a reseller.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4375321-horizontallnecklego.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375321" data-ratio="1.0141987829615" data-width="1479" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4375321-horizontallnecklego.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375321"></a><figcaption>Lego Tallneck from Horizon Forbidden West</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4375321-horizontallnecklego.jpg"></figure><p>The Horizon franchise also has action figures, graphic novels, and board games to keep you busy.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve-removes-arbitration-from-steam-agreements-disputes-can-now-go-forward-in-court.994983/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/valve-removes-arbitration-from-steam-agreements-disputes-can-now-go-forward-in-court/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As of today, <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-hits-all-time-record-38-3-million-pc-players/">millions of Steam</a> users woke up with a new notice from Valve, saying that the Steam Subscriber Agreement has been updated, removing a requirement that disputes must go to arbitration rather than court.&nbsp; If you have a dispute that isn't solved via Steam Support, you are now required to take the company to federal or state court. According to legal experts, this is a huge win for Steam users, although most who have a dispute would never take Valve to court. In most situations, consumers are required to arbitrate and not sue after accepting agreements, especially in the United States.</p>
<p>For a long time, Valve forced any dispute into arbitration, which is when a third party reviews the issue to try and resolve it outside of the legal system. This new update from Valve also removes the class-action waiver, meaning that class-action lawsuits from a party with the same complaint are now able to proceed.</p>
<p>In a news release, Valve stated, "We've eliminated the requirement that disputes be resolved by individual arbitration. As always, we encourage you to contact Steam Support when you have any issues, as that will nearly always be the best way to reach a solution. But if that doesn't work, the updated SSA now provides that any disputes are to go forward in court instead of arbitration. We've also removed the class action waiver, as well as the cost and fee-shifting provisions, that were in prior versions of the SSA."</p>
<p>This is a pretty groundbreaking decision to make, as most service agreements do contain an arbitration clause. Although it's not been stated why Valve has gone ahead and changed their Steam Subscriber Agreement, it is possible that it has to do with the case of Jeffrey Piccolo suing Disney after his wife died during an allergic reaction after dinner. However, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cr7r9djxj0do" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disney responded to the lawsuit</a> by saying that Piccolo "waived his right to sue when he signed up for a Disney+ streaming account in 2019 and when he used the Disney World website in 2023." With how this particular case was received by the public, it led Disney to backpedal, allowing the suit to continue in court.</p>
<p>Whether the choices made by both Disney and Valve will cause more companies to follow suit remains to be seen, but it is entirely possible that more companies will begin to change their arbitration clauses. However, it is unlikely, as most companies will want to settle out of court and avoid the legal process if possible.</p>

			<p>Yet again, there are more layoffs. This time, Activision Blizzard are the ones responsible, and they will soon be laying off nearly 400 people in the mobile gaming divisions of their company, which are located in Santa Monica and Irvine. By doing this, it eliminates redundancies among the staff after their expensive merge with Microsoft last year, which cost $75.4 billion.</p>
<p>It's hardly surprising anymore when <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-layoffs-ftc-complaint/">Activision Blizzard lays off staff</a>, as they have already laid off 1,003 staff in the past year, with staff being from Novato, Foster City, and Southern California, as stated by filings with the Employment Development Department.</p>
<p>Activision Blizzard has told the EDD that 140 jobs were to be scrapped beginning October 11 at the <a href="https://careers.blizzard.com/global/en/irvine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blizzard Entertainment studio in Irvine</a>. The jobs that are being eliminated in Irvine cover a large variety of positions in the company, according to a letter filed by Leslie Campbell, who is the Director of Activision Blizzard's Human Resources department. The jobs being eliminated include accountants, software engineers, the Director of HR for World of Warcraft, artists, game producers, and many more. The jobs eliminated weren't exclusively junior roles either, as a Game Director and Vice President were also on the list of those being laid off from Activision Blizzard.</p>
<p>Activision Blizzard spokeswoman Delay Simmons said that the company was unable to share additional details about "which teams were impacted and their locations," which she pointed to the slew of media reports on the two previous rounds of major layoffs.</p>
<p>January saw 1,900 layoffs made within the Microsoft Gaming divisions Activision Blizzard, Xbox and ZeniMax. Then earlier in September, Microsoft Gaming announced a further 650 layoffs.</p>
<p>Regarding the most recent layoffs, she states, "The 400 roles you're seeing in the system are part of the recent news and are not new; the roles that were impacted include mostly corporate and supporting roles and some impacts to gaming teams." The layoffs are said to be coming in waves, with the first happening at Irvine and Santa Monica studios on October 11 and Playa Vista layoffs happening in November. It's said that all layoffs at the three locations should be completed by the end of the year.</p>
<p>With Microsoft's current finances from their gaming divisions specifically, it's possible that there will be even more layoffs in the future, but it can only be hoped that this doesn't happen. There have already been an astounding number of layoffs this year, and there are still three months left in the year, which could see the number rise even higher.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/gi-joe-wrath-of-cobra-review-running-out-of-quarters<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>GI Joe: Wrath of Cobra</em> keeps inching up to being a great time. It has all the retro energy and pop of a retro arcade brawler. Its pixel art and style are pure Saturday morning cartoon cheese. But it's an energy and drive that can't be sustained. It leads to an experience that, despite having some novel replay value, lacks that extra something to make it stellar.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gi-joe-wrath-of-cobra-opening-screenshot.jpg?itok=kz13sCSl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gi-joe-wrath-of-cobra-opening-screenshot.jpg?itok=D-3DPh__ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's decent in stills, but that's about it.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>GI Joe: Wrath of Cobra Review</em> – Are You A Good Enough Joe To Beat Cobra High Command?</h2>
<p>The opening of <em>GI Joe: Wrath of Cobra</em> is a microcosm of the game's overall presentation. The intro cutscene is animated in the style of a 1980s GI Joe cartoon and features a brand new heavy metal theme song that is pretty awesome. But as the cutscene continues, it falls into a weird nostalgic uncanny valley. It starts with VHS distortion effects and bombastic military spectacle. Then it ends with some stiff animations that are less cheesy and more cheap. As for that new intro, it gets abruptly cut off by the main menu music.</p>
<p>The Story Mode is a tissue-thin Greatest Hits album of the cartoon. Cobra wants to take over the world, go stop them. You play as one of four characters: Duke, Scarlet, Roadblock, or Snake Eyes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gi-joe-wrath-of-cobra-character-select.jpg?itok=1_BxX8b_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gi-joe-wrath-of-cobra-character-select.jpg?itok=5Qa_pXr2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Alright, time to go punch all of terrorism in the face.</figcaption></figure><p>Like most recent retro revivals, each character has unique attacks and a special super move. Duke has straightforward drop kicks and a devastating air strike. Scarlet can flip, power slide, and fire paralyzing crossbow bolts. Snake Eyes has wide-sweeping sword slashes and can summon his wolf, Timber, to help. And Roadblock has ground slams and can pull out a gatling gun.</p>
<p>As for the game feel, it is (sorry, not sorry) quite punchy. There's a satisfying amount of juice packed with each hit, punctuated better with just the right amount of gamepad rumble. Enemies are launched with strong hits and ping around the screen like ping-pong balls. Mini-bosses crumple and explode like robotic confetti.</p>
<p>If you can imagine a licensed button-basher developed for the Sega Genesis, <em>GI Joe: Wrath of Cobra</em> is what it would have looked like.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gi-joe-wrath-of-cobra-snake-eyes-on-cobra-ship.jpg?itok=e0WasKbC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gi-joe-wrath-of-cobra-snake-eyes-on-cobra-ship.jpg?itok=lzSlLcjH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Conservation of Ninjutsu states these mooks are going to have a bad time.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>GI Joe: Wrath of Cobra</em> Review – Porkchop Knuckle Sandwiches</h2>
<p>There are twelve levels in <em>GI Joe: Wrath of Cobra's</em> story mode. And for roughly half of those levels, I was having a good time. There was a steady stream of health items and weapon pick-ups: assault rifles, shotguns, and grenade launchers. Plus, the game's soundtrack is catchy thanks to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/sonic-mania-review-breaking-cycle" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Sonic Mania</em></a> composer Tee Lopes.</p>
<p>Enemy encounters escalated naturally, introducing at least one new enemy type at each level. Each fight against Cobra High Command felt thematic and challenging. A personal highlight is that Tomax and Xamot share the same health bar.</p>
<p>But that forward momentum goes from a brisk sprint to a laborious hike. After it reaches a natural climax in a fight with Cobra Commander, the game goes for about four more levels. Each one feels like the kind of artificial difficulty designed to drain quarters in an arcade. Palette swapped enemies. Annoying, hard-hitting overlapping attacks. Uninspired “dark” versions of the Joes as boss fights. They're all here, and it all feels like killing time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gi-joe-wrath-of-cobra-roadblock-shooting-mech.jpg?itok=jnbsSKT2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gi-joe-wrath-of-cobra-roadblock-shooting-mech.jpg?itok=IRiEUpQC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time to break ol' Painless out.</figcaption></figure><p>As these later levels drag on, they draw attention to the small but crucial ways <em>GI Joe: Wrath of Cobra</em> treads water. Despite each level referencing memorable storylines from <em>GI Joe</em>, they're mostly set dressing; nostalgic wallpaper lining interchangeable corridors full of mooks. Fighting a bunch of Cobra Trubble Bubbles and Viper tanks happens the same way in Springfield as it does on Cobra's moon base. &nbsp;</p>
<p>While the combat is satisfyingly simple, the overall presentation doesn't escalate or dramatically change. No vehicle or turret sections. No ticking clock escape sequences. No vertical elevator sections. It's just corridor fistfights end to end.</p>
<p>These criticisms may seem unfair. After all, there's not much you can do with a sidescrolling beat 'em up. Their simplicity is part of their charm. But with its appeals to nostalgia and modern spins on old gameplay, <em>GI Joe: Wrath of Cobra</em> compares unfavorably to another retro love letter: <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tmnt-shredders-revenge-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge</em></a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gi-joe-wrath-of-cobra-shop-screenshot.jpg?itok=NcJfoptN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gi-joe-wrath-of-cobra-shop-screenshot.jpg?itok=r2HN3dYS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I would need help, but I wouldn't say no to this modifier.</figcaption></figure><p>The one silver lining to the game is it has unlockable extras. As you play, you will pick up floppy discs, which can be used in the game's shop to unlock new modes. These include game modifiers like a one-hit mode, an arcade mode, and a boss rush mode. You can even unlock two more playable Joes: Ripcord and Gung Ho.</p>
<p>But unlocking everything will take a while. I have played through the entire Story Mode twice and got enough floppy discs to buy two things. It's a grind, but the additional features do add some replay value to the whole experience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gi-joe-wrath-of-cobra-cobra-commander-boss-fight.jpg?itok=Hqnpqn5Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gi-joe-wrath-of-cobra-cobra-commander-boss-fight.jpg?itok=wsTN1Hc- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>One of these days I'll learn to block.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>GI Joe: Wrath of Cobra</em> Review – Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The developers of <em>GI Joe: Wrath of Cobra</em> have stated they have plans to release free updates for the game after launch. Given how much the game loses its luster in the second half, I hope they can refine the game into something great.</p>
<p>But as it stands right now, it's a competent arcade throwback that runs out of steam, falls back on old ideas, and overstays its welcome. If you're in the mood for some classic <em>GI Joe</em> action, there are worse ways to spend an afternoon.</p>
<hr><p><em><strong>GI Joe: Wrath of Cobra</strong> was reviewed on PC with a copy provided by the developer over the course of six hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review</em></p>

                <p>The Nintendo Museum is preparing to open in Kyoto, Japan, and it looks to be an incredible collection of Nintendo ephemera. But it is <em>also</em>, perhaps inadvertently, a way to settle age-old internet disputes, and it has already supplied a definitive answer to the question: Is Yoshi's Island (aka Super Mario World 2) a Yoshi game or a Mario game?</p><p>According to Dan Ryckert's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/my-visit-to-the-nintendo-museum-made-my-life-flash-before-my-eyes/1100-6526764/" data-ref-id="1100-6526764">impressions from a special press preview</a> of the museum, one exhibition room has space dedicated to specific franchises, separated into individual categories. The Mario franchise display was by far the largest, encompassing not just the plumber's solo adventures but also the various spin-offs like kart racers and sports games. But he also noticed that Yoshi's Island is not actually in the Mario display, and is rather included in a separate Yoshi franchise display.</p><p>So there you have it. According to Nintendo's official categorization, in a space dedicated to careful cultivation of its own history, Yoshi's Island is not a Mario game. If you had $20 riding on this very unlikely bet, now is your time to collect.</p><p>Granted, Ryckert also vowed to incessantly bother his Nintendo contacts until this so-called mistake is rectified, and we wouldn't underestimate his ability to annoy anyone into compliance. So it's very possible that Nintendo will recategorize, or just include Yoshi's Island in both franchises, as space allows.</p><p>Yoshi's Island stars Yoshi (or a series of Yoshis) as they ferry a baby Mario across colorful islands. It's available as part of the Super NES library on the Nintendo Switch Online service, so you can play it there to judge for yourself which franchise it best fits into.</p><p>For more on the Nintendo Museum, be sure to read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/my-visit-to-the-nintendo-museum-made-my-life-flash-before-my-eyes/1100-6526764/" data-ref-id="1100-6526764">detailed Nintendo Museum impressions</a>, and check out a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/behold-the-nintendo-museum-in-all-its-glory/2900-5804/" data-ref-id="2900-5804">gallery of the Nintendo Museum displays</a>.</p>

                <p>Red Candle Games has confirmed that its Sekiro-inspired metroidvania, Nine Sols, will be launching on PlayStation, Switch, and Xbox on November 26. The studio released a brand-new trailer, and the game is confirmed to be coming to Game Pass on release day too.</p><p>Nine Sols follows Yi, a hero who aims to overthrow the nine Sols, tyrannical rulers in the realm of New Kunlun. The developers have called the aesthetics of Nine Sols as "Taopunk," which combines futuristic cyberpunk elements with eastern fantasy and mythology. While the game features challenging parrying mechanics, there are options to modify damage dealt and damage received, making it much more approachable and less frustrating than the game it's inspired by.</p>
