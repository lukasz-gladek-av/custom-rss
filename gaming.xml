			<p>Nacon has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1249970/view/538859942242681786?l=english">announced</a> the Year 2 roadmap for Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown, detailing the highlights that will be a part of each season, including this week's Season 4, all the way up to Season 8, which will debut in July 2026. </p>



<p>KT Racing and Nacon put together an hour-long developer update that digs into what's to come, along with a short retrospective on how things have gone since <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown/">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a> launched last September.</p>

<iframe title="Behind the Scenes: The Future of Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K88Nrddj4fw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Starting with what's to come in the short term, Season 4 is launching this coming Wednesday, July 23, 2025, and with it five new cars, new content like Casino, a new currency for players to earn called Diamonds, and other enhancements to the game. </p>



<p>There's also a key community feature that's live from now until August 4, 2025, which is that players will be able to vote on which new mission type will be added to Solar Crown. Detective, Delivery, Photography, and Adrenaline are the four types players can choose from, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdV49jCWe1BvGaZpkgYEpdY0tTJOSYappAnQj0V06ZYg7gEuQ/viewform">you can submit your vote until August 4th at this link</a>.</p>

<p>Season 5 will arrive in October of this year, which is also when Year 2 will officially kick off. That's when taxi missions will be making their return, and when a new online store will be introduced. There will also be re-balances to the in-game economy, new vehicles, and a bevy of performance and graphical boosts that'll be directly from the KT Engine getting its own upgrade. </p>



<p>Season 6 kicks off January 2026, and it's also when the mission players voted for will be added to the game, among the other usual features like new cars and improvements to the game.</p>



<p>Season 7 arrives in April 2026, bringing along with it the introduction of Official Racing Centers, dedicated racing venues for Hong Kong Island and Ibiza City, and a revamping of live events and the premium Solar Pass. Finally, Season 8 arrives as previously mentioned in July 2026, which will be highlighted by the return of Housing and Real Estate, two elements missing from Solar Crown that players loved in the first two Test Drive Unlimited games. It'll also add Extreme missions and Passenger mode, along with the rest of the usual suspects. </p>



<p>Beyond Season 8, Nacon and KT Racing are committed to continuing to update and improve Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown, as the team is already considering adding elements like bikes and yachts.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ranking-all-the-mtg-edge-of-eternities-commanders.1249191/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's not Universes Beyond, no&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>&nbsp;has gone to outerspace, with&nbsp;<em>Edge of Eternities</em>. A science-fantasy type of set with a take on the Space Opera, it's a very different set than what we've seen in the Magic universe before. As a new set, it means there's plenty of new options for players, and here we'll be ranking all the new&nbsp;<em>Edge of Eternities</em>&nbsp;Commander options.</p>

<p>With&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/mtg-edge-of-eternities-preview-cards-revealed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" MTG Edge of Eternities Preview Cards Revealed"><em>Edge of Eternities</em>&nbsp;comes a rule change to Commander</a>: any legendary card with power and toughness in the bottom right corner can be your commander. Practically this means that legendary vehicles from past sets (there are none in this set), and legendary spacecrafts in this set are also commander options, along with legendary creatures.</p>

<p>After going over all of the over <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-of-magic-gathering-final-fantasy-legendary-creatures-part-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Ranking ALL of Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Legendary Creatures Part 1">150 Legendary Creatures in&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>, I'm relieved to say that there are a few less legendary options in&nbsp;<em>Edge of Eternities.&nbsp;</em>There are in fact only 22 cards capable of being your Commander in the set, as the high amount of legendaries in Universes Beyond sets has Wizards of the Coast pulling back some on in-universe sets. Unlike the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>&nbsp;list, this list is Commander specific, and is not considering other Constructed (like Standard or Modern) or Limited play.</p>

<h3>22. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/225/sami-ships-engineer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Sami, Ship’s Engineer">Sami, Ship’s Engineer</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sami-ship-engineer.jpg?itok=I9jkvhP- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sami-ship-engineer.jpg?itok=OXkPcUkF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Someone has to come last, and it's perhaps no surprise that it's one of the uncommon legendary creatures. Sami in this form is pricey, undersized, and makes modestly sized tokens if you jump a couple of hoops. While Sami synergizes with vehicles and spacecraft, that isn’t near enough for the cost in commander.</p>

<h3>21. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/232/syr-vondam-the-lucent" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Syr Vondam, the Lucent">Syr Vondam, the Lucent</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/syr-vondam-the-lucent.jpg?itok=zmh43CcN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/syr-vondam-the-lucent.jpg?itok=cyBjRjRW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A&nbsp;5 Mana go wide leader, Syr Vondam is worse in his role than many other commanders who provide pumps for the team. Clearly designed for limited, this iteration of Syr Vondam will have trouble breaking the 99 in general, but if you need to give deathtouch to your creatures in white and black there are worse options.</p>

<h3>20. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/218/haliya-ascendant-cadet" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Haliya, Ascendant Cadet">Haliya, Ascendant Cadet</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/haliya-ascendant-cadet.jpg?itok=eNARFukE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/haliya-ascendant-cadet.jpg?itok=mjaO1-KO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>We continue our stroll through the uncommon legends with Haliya, Ascendant Acolyte. Haliya in this version is clearly aimed at limited play as a 5 mana 3/3 who brings a +1/+1 on enter or attack. Paired with a minor card draw ability, overall this is a card left out of your deck in commander.</p>

<h3>19. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/212/alpharael-dreaming-acolyte" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Alpharael, Dreaming Acolyte">Alpharael, Dreaming Acolyte</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alpharael-dreaming-acolyte.jpg?itok=b2hVEuOo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alpharael-dreaming-acolyte.jpg?itok=lTLfQ0Hq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Alpharael, Dreaming Acolyte provides a decent enters&nbsp;card draw, especially for artifact decks, and can load up a graveyard for future turns. The deathtouch on your turn is situationally useful, but Alpharel isn’t that impressive, but in a blinking artifact deck it might have some use.</p>

<h3>18.&nbsp;<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/19/haliya-guided-by-light" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Haliya, Guided by Light">Haliya, Guided by Light</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/haliya-guided-by-light.jpg?itok=2Et0GGD9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/haliya-guided-by-light.jpg?itok=A3SvKqi1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Each of the uncommon legends also has a rare iteration of them later in life, and Haliya is the first of them we're seeing. Haliya is essentially <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ltc/12/the-gaffer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Gaffer">The Gaffer</a> + a <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=otag%3Asoul-warden-ability+type%3Acreature" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Soul Warden Ability Creatures">Soul Sister </a>in a creature, but somewhat worse than either. The combination is useful, and card draw is important, but I think this is likely to be in the 99, and only after The Gaffer has made a list.</p>

<h3>17.&nbsp;<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/231/syr-vondam-sunstar-exemplar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Syr Vondam, Sunstar Exemplar">Syr Vondam, Sunstar Exemplar<strong> </strong></a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/syr-vondam-sunstar-exemplar.jpg?itok=k5NjuQQX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/syr-vondam-sunstar-exemplar.jpg?itok=V2-JaM7f 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Probably better in the 99 of aristocrat decks then at the helm of his, but this iteration of Syr Vondam is a payoff for killing your own guys and there are some neat things you can do with ‘scam’ type cards and removing opposing permanents.</p>

<h3>16. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/238/dawnsire-sunstar-dreadnought" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dawnsire, Sunstar Dreadnought">Dawnsire, Sunstar Dreadnought</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dawnsire-sunstar-dreadnought.jpg?itok=v7fO6jR4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dawnsire-sunstar-dreadnought.jpg?itok=V8aJlC8G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As we reach 16, we get our first legendary Spacecraft, and it's a doozy of a ship. The Dawnsire is undeniably splashy with that potential 20/20 size and 100 damage to creatures, but Its high station count is a challenge. As your Commander, Dawnsire's colorless identity is another major limitation, but in the 99 of a Spacecraft deck it can be a flashy, if pricey top end.</p>

<h3>15. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/233/tannuk-memorial-ensign" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Tannuk, Memorial Ensign">Tannuk, Memorial Ensign</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tannuk-memorial-ensign.jpg?itok=L3nJhVXi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tannuk-memorial-ensign.jpg?itok=oEoyoefS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A new Landfall commander, Tannuk isn’t going to challenge the higher tier of landfall commanders, even in its own colors but the damage pinging and card draw will make him an acceptable budget option. In many ways, Tannuk is a color shifted and appropriately weakened take on <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/247/tatyova-benthic-druid" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Tatyova, Benthic Druid">Tatyova, Benthic Druid</a>. Also he is the first and only legendary Kavu other than his other version (changeling things excluded).</p>

<h3>14. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/35/the-seriema" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Seriema">The Seriema</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-seriema.jpg?itok=lrVRbqFp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-seriema.jpg?itok=fploQVMO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With a lower mana cost of 3, and a lower station cost of only 7, the Seriema provides value at all stages. At the start it is a legendary creature tutor and points you in a direction for the deck. Once it gets 7 station points, it’s a 5/5 flying that protects all your other legendary creatures when they are tapped and lets them rule in combat. Still, it feels likely to be better in the 99 of other legendary matters commanders, which is why it's up here.</p>

<h3>13. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/127/xu-ifit-osteoharmonist" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Xu-Ifit, Osteoharmonist">Xu-Ifit, Osteoharmonist</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xu-ifit-osteoharmonist.jpg?itok=57R0v8RG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xu-ifit-osteoharmonist.jpg?itok=l17K0IaS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>An odd commander, Xu-ifit wants you to have interesting creatures without abilities or that you can do something else with, as they become skeletons without anything else. This also makes him an interesting leader for a skeleton deck, or a way of taking advantage of creatures with significant downsides.</p>

<h3>12.&nbsp;<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/87/alpharael-stonechosen" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Alpharael, Stonechosen">Alpharael, Stonechosen</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alpharael-stonechosen.jpg?itok=AinVn1J0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alpharael-stonechosen.jpg?itok=tfGKWgcq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Alpharael might be a bit undersized, but the ability to chop off half someone’s life on an attack trigger is highly potent, becoming a killer move along with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/113/wound-reflection" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Wound Reflection ">Wound Reflection </a>and others. Ward isn’t hexproof, but a random discard may discourage people from dealing with Alpharael before they have to.</p>

<h3>11. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoc/4/szarel-genesis-shepherd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Szarel, Genesis Shepherd">Szarel, Genesis Shepherd</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/szarel-genesis-shepherd.jpg?itok=QVYq4TYR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/szarel-genesis-shepherd.jpg?itok=YlUq9lsg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Our first card from the <em>Edge of Eternities</em>&nbsp;Commander decks is this jund-colored land and aristocrats bug who's in competition with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/c18/43/lord-windgrace" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Lord Windgrace">Lord Windgrace</a> for fighting over jund land decks. The need to buff his power to get the most does make this a three things to do commander, making it busy and it’s not as novel as you have other cards like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoc/117/the-gitrog-monster" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Gitrog Monster">The Gitrog Monster</a> that also play around with lands and sacrificing.</p>

<h3>10. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoc/1/hearthhull-the-worldseed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Hearthhull, the Worldseed">Hearthhull, the Worldseed</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hearthhull-the-worldseed.jpg?itok=eYX9JiWv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hearthhull-the-worldseed.jpg?itok=PCgx5Mtb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>We enter the top 10 with the alternate commander for the RGB (jund) deck, which is a spacecraft. Like Szarel, Hearthhull is a jund-colored land aristocrat's commander, but it comes down cheaper, albeit with the need to be stationed before you can do much with it. The ability to sacrifice and payoff the land sacrifice in and of itself make it really good, and I think I slightly prefer the spacecraft over the insect.</p>

<h3>9. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/219/infinite-guideline-station" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Infinite Guideline Station">Infinite Guideline Station</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinite-guideline-station.jpg?itok=kTxoyl0s 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinite-guideline-station.jpg?itok=3ob20Z_S 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A five color Spacecraft commander, that also rewards playing a lot of multicolored permanents. Even before you charge it up, the Infinite Guideline Station will provide you with Robots for your gold board, and then it can give you a lot of cards once it starts firing its lasers.</p>

<h3>8.&nbsp;<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/216/dyadrine-synthesis-amalgam" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dyadrine, Synthesis Amalgam">Dyadrine, Synthesis Amalgam</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dyadrine-synthesis-amalgam.jpg?itok=FsWv4s-E 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dyadrine-synthesis-amalgam.jpg?itok=GOfEpeBb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>An interesting +1/+1 counter commander, Dyadrine takes advantage of any and all mana you have to spend on it, avoiding the issue with X costs. Dyadrine wants a friend with counters as well, so that it can make tokens and draw cards for you, though note it can work from get go, not needing to attack itself.</p>

<h3>7. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/221/mmmenon-uthros-exile" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Mm’menon, Uthros Exile">Mm’menon, Uthros Exile</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mmmenon-uthros-exile.jpg?itok=E1WGDgOm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mmmenon-uthros-exile.jpg?itok=6ZwUvvXK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The final uncommon commander option makes a run deep into the top 10, as this version of Mm’menon is an interesting commander, because you can grow any of your creatures when you have artifacts enter. It notably lacks any of the restrictions we see sometimes on cards like this like ‘once per turn’ or ‘non-token’ which would stop it from being able to go crazy. Instead the Uthros Exile invites all the treasure craziness, all the artifact shenanigans and everything else for even a potential voltron approach.</p>

<h3>6. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoc/2/inspirit-flagship-vessel" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Inspirit, Flagship Vessel">Inspirit, Flagship Vessel</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/inspirit-flagship-vessel.jpg?itok=f1uPXkDi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/inspirit-flagship-vessel.jpg?itok=RiL7uHet 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A strong commander for Spacecrafts, Inspirit lets you put charge counters on other artifacts or grow creatures so they can station (or attack) better. The 3 mana cost is low, and the single point needed to get the base station level up is very little. Later on, it becomes a 5/5 flying protector for all your other artifacts, putting it in play to lead your fleet to victory.</p>

<h3>5. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/68/mmmenon-the-right-hand" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Mm’menon, the Right Hand">Mm’menon, the Right Hand</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mmmenon-the-right-hand.jpg?itok=Dp1-atDo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mmmenon-the-right-hand.jpg?itok=wVrytzJZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Starting off our top 5, we have a far fairer example of a blue artifact commander than Urza, Lord High Artificer. Mm’menon lets you cast artifacts from the top of your deck, and use artifacts to fuel casting them from the top, or with other cards from spots other than your hand.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>4. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/224/ragost-deft-gastronaut" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Ragost, Deft Gastronaut">Ragost, Deft Gastronaut</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ragost-deft-gastronaut.jpg?itok=rdRXhdM8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ragost-deft-gastronaut.jpg?itok=m8mI0jnF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A cheap and effective food commander in different colors then we often see food running in (red food decks aren’t common!) Its ability to lob food at opponents, while untapping each turn if you gained life gives it a fair amount of strength. It can fuel off any artifacts you have, letting you make them in many ways and take advantage of various death triggers and other neat tricks in his spicy restaurant.</p>

Granting everything haste is something red already wants to do, and is often willing to pay 3 mana to do that and nothing else, while the Warp ability for any red and artifact cards is just begging for abuse as cost cheating is very powerful.</p>

Blue is also the color of untapping, and letting you do this more than once a turn.</p>

While Sami's uncommon card was highly unimpressive for commander play, the mythic rare version backs quite a wallop. While the body is a touch undersized, the double strike makes up for that, but it's really the ability after that which is most interesting. Granting all your spells affinity for artifacts is something that is highly breakable, and something with which many an interesting, or distinct thing can be done with across a variety of power levels.</p>

<p>And that's how I saw the&nbsp;<em>Edge of Eternities&nbsp;</em>Commander options. Some of them have me quite interested to build around or try out different decks, including seeing how spacecrafts play in reality.</p>

<p>Are there any <em>Edge of Eternities&nbsp;</em>commanders that interest you particularly or disagree with a placement on this list? Tell us in the comments below!</p>

While that made it sound like <em>No Rest for the Wicked</em> could skip Microsoft’s platform entirely, he was quick to foll0w up clarifying that the grimdark fantasy adventure will hit Xbox eventually.</p><p>“There’s nothing to officially confirm yet,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/thomasmahler/status/1947340601781051493&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/thomasmahler/status/1947340601781051493" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added on X</a></span>. “We want to support consoles and just looking at the numbers, PS5 makes the most sense at the moment.  Ultimately we’ll ship on all platforms, but likely not at the same time!”</p><p>With PS5 currently sitting at around 80 million consoles sold, the Xbox Series X/S, whose hardware revenue within Microsoft falls precipitously every year, is estimated to have sold less than half that. The Switch 2 only just launched, but is already breaking launch records and is expected to continue the momentum of its 155-million-unit-selling predecessor. So if you’re a small team allocating limited resources for porting your PC release, the case for prioritizing Xbox is becoming harder and harder to make. </p><p>The problem’s been pronounced enough that Microsoft published a developer blog post last fall <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games-skipping-xbox-microsoft-asks-devs-studio-why-ps5-1851663611&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games-skipping-xbox-microsoft-asks-devs-studio-why-ps5-1851663611">asking studios for feedback</a></span>. “If you are making video games, we’re interested in hearing from you,” it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2024/09/how-xbox-research-is-shaping-the-future-of-game-development/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2024/09/how-xbox-research-is-shaping-the-future-of-game-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read</a></span>. “If you aren’t on Xbox, we’d love to know why. And honestly, if you are using our competitor’s products, you probably have a great perspective we could learn from!”</p><p>The case of <em>No Rest for the Wicked</em> is especially striking, though, given the size of the team (estimated at over 80 people) and Moon Studios’ history with Xbox. <em>Ori and the Blind Forest </em>was a 2015 exclusive that proved to be a bright spot for the Xbox One as it recovered from its rough launch. The follow-up, <em>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</em>, did the same for the Xbox Series X/S. While both games have since been ported to Switch, neither was ever made available on PlayStation. </p><p><em>No Rest for the Wicked</em>, which swaps snappy 2D platforming for weighty top-down dungeon crawling, will now reverse that trend. I guess there’s no Game Pass deal on the table this time around. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ori-no-rest-wicked-console-port-souls-rpg-xbox-ps5-1851786659]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Oh, snap! Second Dinner has officially announced the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-snap/">Marvel Snap</a>: <a href="https://pressreleases.triplepointpr.com/2025/07/18/marvel-snaps-golden-gauntlet-world-championship-series-gives-players-a-new-way-to-compete-connect-and-shine/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Golden Gauntlet World Championship Series</a>, a global tournament initiative launching on August 9, 2025. This free-to-enter competition is open to all players regardless of rank or experience and is aimed at bringing together the community and showcasing players' creativity. The series will be broadcast live on the game's official Twitch and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/marvelsnap" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> channels.</p><p>Registration links will be shared on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/marvelsnap" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official Discord</a> ahead of each event, along with full rules, format, and support in dedicated channels. </p><p>The Golden Gauntlet Series will include three regional "Open Qualifier" tournaments, leading up to a global finals event in November called the Golden Gauntlet Worlds. Each regional event will follow a standardized format: Six rounds of Swiss-style playing (a fixed number of rounds, with pairings based on performance rather than elimination), followed by a top 16 single-elimination bracket, with prizes awarded to the top finishers.</p><p>After that, players who end those rounds with a 5-1 record or better will earn a spot in the final event. These qualifiers are scheduled for August, September, and October, each focusing on different global regions, ensuring as many players as possible.</p><p>Aland Failde, SVP of marketing at Second Dinner, emphasized that the tournament is a way to give back to fans and creators who have shaped the game's journey.</p><p>"From day one, Marvel Snap has been shaped by its players, and the Golden Gauntlet is our way of supporting and amplifying that passion," Failde said in a statement. "Huge shoutout to Game On Events for helping us host this event and to all the incredible community members who've helped bring this to life--this series wouldn't exist without their dedication, creativity, and love for the game."</p><p>Snap players might remember when the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-snap-gets-caught-up-in-tiktok-ban-currently-unavailable-in-the-us/1100-6528894/" data-ref-id="1100-6528894">went temporarily offline</a> this past January due to the implementation of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA). The legislation banned software owned or published by ByteDance, which owns the game's then-publisher Nuverse. The restrictions were later removed, and the developers announced that they would work with US company Skystone Games to bring publishing duties in-house.</p><p>Similarly, Matthew R.--also known for his gamertag ItsGuestGaming--co-founder of Game On Events, highlighted the tournament's evolution from grassroots efforts to a full-fledged world championship.</p><p>“Our goal with this series is to bring the community together to celebrate Marvel Snap's competitive scene while showcasing the fast, high-stakes nature of its matches," he said. "It's been exciting to watch tournaments grow from grassroots events to the Golden Gauntlet World Championship Series. Whether you've been playing for two months or two years, we're thrilled to host a tournament that honors Marvel Snap's amazing community."</p><p>The grand finale, Golden Gauntlet Worlds, will take place on November 8, 2025, featuring over 300 qualified players from the three open tournaments. This final event will consist of nine rounds of Swiss play, culminating in a Top 16 playoff to determine the ultimate champion. </p><p>As of now, there are no cards banned, but it wouldn't surprise me if they treat this like High Voltage-style and ban cards like Galactus and Magik just to speed things along.</p><p>The tournament will start a week after the last of the Fantastic Four: First Steps cards drop, giving players some time to decide if their already perfect deck could be better.</p>

            <p>
Stop Killing Games figurehead Ross Scott says "serious accusations" and "false claims" have been filed against the game preservation movement's European initiative, accusing the campaign of violating EU rules. All this comes as support continues to gain momentum, with the official EU petition having now surpassed 1.4m signatures.
</p>
<p>
Scott <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQN_ZA5WRpo">discussed the latest developments</a> in a video update on YouTube, revealing the <a href="https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2024/000007_en">Stop Destroying Videogames EU initiative</a> - which he reiterated is separate from the US-based Stop Killing Games campaign and has its own organisers, despite often being discussed under the same banner - had "received a serious accusation from an anonymous source".
</p>
<p>
Specifically, Stop Destroying Videogames has been notified of a Transparency Complaint, claiming its campaign violates EU rules by failing to "provide clear, accurate and comprehensive information on the sources of funding for the initiative exceeding EUR 500 per sponsor". Stop Destroying Videogames is accused of including a "false 'no funding' declaration" on its petition and of "systemic concealment of major contribution".
</p>
<p>
Stop Destroying Videogames, for context, makes use of the European Citizens Initiative, an official EU mechanism designed to provide a way for citizens to propose a legal act to the European Commission. In Stop Destroying Videogames' case, the aim is to convince the EU to pass regulations preventing "the remote disabling of video games by the publishers, before providing reasonable means to continue functioning of said video games without the involvement from the side of the publisher." 
</p>
<p>
Stop Destroying Videogames' petition has <a href="https://x.com/accursedfarms/status/1947025316452454853">now surpassed 1.4m signatures</a>. That's well above the 1m needed for it to be submitted to the EU for verification and then, potentially, either progress to a public hearing or full debate session at the European Parliament - and, it's hoped, well above the threshold needed to ensure it stays above 1m after mistakes or deliberate spoofing are filtered out. However, a complaint potentially marks a bump in the road.
</p>
<p>
The gist of the complaint is that Scott's work as a volunteer on the EU initiative "far exceeds any reasonable volunteer threshold" and that "professional time investment constitutes quantifiable in-kind contribution under transparency regulations". The complaint also provides "evidence" - based on several seemingly off-the-cuff statements made by Scott and some imaginative maths - that his involvement equates to €63,000-147,000 in professional contributions, and, as such, a failure to declare this supposedly significant source of funding violates EU rules. 
</p>
<p>
The trouble is, the figure mentioned in the complaint is entirely speculative, based on an assumed hourly rate of €50-75, generated from an imagined 12-14 hours work a day across "many" weeks - an assumed workload Scott scoffed at, saying "that would have killed me", despite admitting to focussing on Stop Killing Games 12-14 hours a day on at least a "some" occasions. "Maybe that would mean something if I was a professional and had a rate for anything," he added, noting "nobody was hiring me for this, it's all volunteer time". Scott also stressed he's just a "promoter" of the EU initiative, and has "no actual authority" over the decisions its organisers make. "It's only my perception that this is my one chance to fix the problem of destroying games that's pushed me so hard," he said.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, Scott rejects the claims made in the anonymous complaint, noting he's spent zero Euros on financial support. Moreover, he claims Stop Destroying Videogames' organisers "literally asked EU representatives if it was okay for me to assist them in the capacity I have been back in spring 2024... [and] they said what I've been doing is fine". The big question, though, is what impact, if any, the complaint could have on the EU initiative. Despite Scott's suggestion of potentially "serious" ramifications, the <a href="https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/how-it-works/faq_en">Citizens Initiatives website</a> only says the Commission will "contact the organisers of the initiative to establish the facts and ask them to correct any inaccuracies on funding/support", with no talk of specific penalties for violations.
</p>
<p>
The rest of the video sees a clearly frustrated Scott discussing what the complaint means for the future of the campaign, his own involvement, and how supporters can respond. Much of it, however, is based on Scott's apparently unsubstantiated assumption the complaint was filed by a games industry representative, despite admitting, "We'll never know [where the complaint came from], it's anonymous".
</p>
<p>
"I'll just say the timing of this is awfully hot on the heels of an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-proposals-for-game-preservation-prohibitively-expensive-major-publishers-insist">industry lobby group giving some very bad statements about the movement</a>," he continued, "in some cases I think outright lying about it. But I don't know it was them; maybe it was a different lobbying group or maybe it was just some political hatchet man hired by the industry. But someone was trying to kill the initiative, filing paperwork to the European Union accusing the initiative and myself of violating the rules, maybe even committing a crime, I'm not sure. That's not small thing. This is the industry playing dirty now."
</p>
<p>
The sense, perhaps, is the campaign's escalating visibility is starting to make Scott uneasy - "I am so out of my league on this...," he says at one point, "I have never been a political target before, so this is all uncharted territory for me" - but he ends on an upbeat note to supporters, highlighting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-stop-killing-games-momentum-continues-top-eu-politician-offers-support-a-game-once-sold-belongs-to-the-customer">a number of European parliament members are now among them</a>. "I have no idea what's coming down the pipeline now," he concluded, "but all this resistance means we're throwing around some real power to fix things so let's keep at it."
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-aims-to-mount-political-and-legal-challenges-to-games-going-offline">inadvertently kickstarted the Stop Killing Games campaign</a> when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">took The Crew offline</a> last year, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-own-shareholders-demand-response-to-the-stop-killing-games-consumer-movement">recently asked about the initiative</a> during a shareholder meeting. "We are doing our best to make sure that things go well for all players and buyers, because obviously, support for all games cannot last forever," Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot ventured in response. "But clearly this is a far-reaching issue, and we're working on it."

                <p dir="ltr">For years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> players have been wondering when the game would take them to a location teased way back before the original Destiny was even released: Old Chicago. With the release of its latest expansion, Edge of Fate, it looks like we might have at least a vague answer: soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Echoes of Fate seems subtle on this point, at first. Though the story is set on Kepler, a new location flung way out toward the edge of the solar system, it deals a lot with time-bending looks back into the past, and a few hints toward the future. You get your first hint about Chicago when Lodi, the expansion's new character, gets a glimpse of the future. He mentions standing with the Guardian, Destiny's player character, on the shores of Lake Michigan--the Great Lake on whose shores Chicago is found.</p><p dir="ltr">And then there's the train. The campaign's opening cutscene sees series mainstay Ikora Rey nearly getting run over by a subway train seemingly zapped across time to appear in Destiny 2's far-flung futuristic post-apocalypse. Trains are all over the expansion, acting as a story touchstone, a sort of reality-bending entry point for different areas in the new location of Kepler, and the expansion's defining image.</p><p dir="ltr">That train car sure looks like Chicago's "El" train, the elevated railway that runs throughout the city, once you're primed to look for it. And if you zoom in on the Edge of Fate key art, you can see the train's destination printed above the door. It says "Ravenswood," a north Chicago neighborhood.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4535477-edgeoffate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535477" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4535477-edgeoffate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535477"></a><figcaption>See that train car in the middle of the image?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4535477-edgeoffate.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But any sleuthing becomes unnecessary when things get really explicit later on, as you near the end of the campaign. In one of the final missions, Destiny 2 mainstay Ikora Rey literally says something to the effect of, "Maybe soon we'll go to Chicago."</p><p dir="ltr">Old Chicago is a big deal to Destiny players who have been around for a while. The location has been wondered about, discussed, and even teased for years. Bungie first dropped the possibility of visiting Old Chicago back <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/02/17/bungies-destiny-a-land-of-hope-and-dreams" rel="nofollow ">before the original Destiny was even released</a>. Since then, references to the city have come up time and again in lore and story. When Bungie first showed off images of its 2022 expansion, The Witch Queen, players speculated the location in its first trailer might be <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22518875/destiny-2-witch-queen-expansion-old-chicago-screenshot-tease" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the swampy outskirts of Chicago</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">It'd be a significant location to visit, because while Destiny 2 has destinations set on Earth, they're fairly nondescript. The European Dead Zone, or EDZ, takes players to a destroyed, fictional European town called Trostland. There's also the Cosmodrome, an airplane and spaceship graveyard and control facility located somewhere in Russia. But both locations are invented for Destiny 2--they don't really reference anywhere specific from our world.</p><p dir="ltr">Chicago, on the other hand, <em>would</em> be a recognizable place from our reality, and it would be the first. While the old cities of Earth are all destroyed hundreds of years before the events of Destiny 2, surely the city will still <em>look</em> like the Chicago we expect, and seeing it in its ravaged, post-alien invasion state would be interesting in and of itself.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4535476-destinychicago.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535476" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4535476-destinychicago.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535476"></a><figcaption>A cutscene during Edge of Fate's campaign shows a distant city that's also the location of the Department of External Observation. Based on the landscape and the highway sign, it could be Chicago.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4535476-destinychicago.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It'd also be the first American location to get Destiny 2's futuristic treatment, so we'd get to see how Bungie might play with the city and change it through the course of both hundreds of years of progress and hundreds of years of decay. That's to say nothing of what gameplay opportunities the ravaged city might afford, or story implications of the possibility of any humans still eeking out a living there.</p><p dir="ltr">There are hints within the Edge of Fate campaign that Chicago could be an important location as Destiny 2's story develops, too. Cutscenes in the expansion jump back in time to Earth in what appears to be the 1960s, and one includes a distant city skyline. That city is also the apparent location of the Department of External Observation, a government agency from the past focused on the possibility of alien contact and abduction, which plays a significant role in the expansion. So if Chicago is, in fact, a future destination, it seems very likely the DEO is too.</p><p dir="ltr">That's a lot of speculation, but it really seems like Edge of Fate is setting up Chicago as its next big destination. If that's the case, it'll be the culmination of waiting and speculation that's lasted all of Destiny's life--almost 12 years.</p>

This wasn’t a member of the pop-rock band being involved in some extramarital affairs; it was the band accidentally exposing an allegedly cheating couple at its July 15 Foxborough concert by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-internet-cant-stop-laughing-at-the-cheating-couple-from-the-coldplay-concert/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-internet-cant-stop-laughing-at-the-cheating-couple-from-the-coldplay-concert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">projecting them onto a Jumbotron</a></span> while they were embracing, leading to the two quickly looking away from the camera. Coldplay frontman Chris Martin remarked that the couple was either “having an affair or they’re just very shy,” but the internet did what it does best and found out who they were, and the entire thing has played out very publicly and invasively. And now that the footage has been seen by millions, it’s being parodied at sporting events that have a kiss cam.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Footage from several sporting events has been showing up online in the days since the Coldplay show, with some venues rebranding their kiss cam as the “Coldplay Cam.” Normally, these crowd shots displayed on a huge screen give couples a chance to express their love for one another for all to see. Sometimes, there are awkward misunderstandings where the folks behind the camera capture siblings or friends, and they have to flail about so everyone knows they’re not a couple. But right now, all anyone seems to want to do is run away from the camera to reference the now-infamous scene. Some venues are even encouraging it, searching for couples who are embracing the same way the caught couple was at Coldplay’s show. One of the funnier examples was when the Phillie Phanatics’ mascots unexpectedly re-enacted the whole thing shot for shot.</p><p>The whole situation has split the internet.

                <p>After a three-year silence, a developer behind the ambitious Fallout: Bakersfield has revealed a new trailer for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-1993/" data-ref-id="5000-815">Doom</a> total conversion mod that transforms id's shooter into the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout/" data-ref-id="5000-929">Fallout</a>, and it almost looks too good to be true.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer Alexander "Red888guns" Berezin is one of the leading developers behind the project. The mod looks to recreate Fallout 1's Ghoul city of Necropolis as a FPS campaign using GZDoom, a modified version of Doom that supports modern features like dynamic lighting, high resolution textures, better rendering, and more not possible in id's original game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e8WrmOibpM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6e8WrmOibpM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">It's immediately clear that Berezin knows the look and feel of the first two Fallout games inside and out, as the new four-minute Fallout: Bakersfield trailer perfectly captures not only the visual style and aesthetic but also the tone of original Fallout games.</p><p dir="ltr">Better yet, the trailer shows how Berezin has blended the iconography of Doom and Fallout seamlessly together, with a UI that is immediately reminiscent of Doom (complete with a guy's face in a little box in the middle of the screen) but brilliantly melded with the Pip-Boy aesthetics of Fallout. There's even a neon green text box in the left corner of the screen that displays environmental information and damage dealt, just like in the original Fallout.</p><p dir="ltr">The mod is a non-commercial project and will be playable for free, though it might still be a while before players can get their hands on it. The end of the trailer reveals various stats about the project and estimates it to be around 60% complete. A release date shown in the trailer flickers with various question marks that slowly transform into a year. While at first it looks like the year "2027" will be displayed, it quickly swaps back to a question mark, perhaps implying that Fallout: Bakersfield's release date is still in flux.</p><p dir="ltr">While the wait for Fallout: Bakersfield might be a long one, the wait for official new Fallout games may be longer. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-is-now-reportedly-fully-greenlit/1100-6533153/" data-ref-id="1100-6533153">Fallout 5 was reported to have been recently greenlit</a> but is likely still many years away.

                <p>2023's Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is still getting new updates, and the next one is a big one.

		<p>Ubisoft has announced that the next update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> will bring a third-person update, New Game + and more to the otherworldly action game when it arrives on… 5th December 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - 3rd-Person Update" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bej3ockJuIc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Yes, that’s right, Ubisoft has announced a patch and given it a firm launch date four and a half months ahead of time. I’m not really complaining about this, and it’s great to know that there’s more updates and content coming to this game, but it’s a bit odd to be so specific so far in advance. The reason is that this forthcoming update will arrive shortly before the release of Avatar: Fire and Ash, the third film in James Cameron’s blue person film franchise.</p>
<p>The third-person mode is seeing Massive Entertainment completely overhauling character animations, tweaking controls and audio, and the camera to adapt the game from first person to third person, in a shift that’s not too dissimilar to the work needed for Capcom’s third-person mode for Resident Evil Village.</p>
<p>Beyond that, a New Game+ mode will be added, letting you replay the story and keep inventory and skills, while facing tougher enemies. It’s standard stuff.</p>

<p>“We’ve always envisioned Avatar Frontiers of Pandora as a living world that evolves with our players,” said Omar Bouali, Creative Director at Massive Entertainment. “This update is a celebration of our community’s passion and we’re thankful to our players for their support—it means the world to our team.”</p>
<p>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora has been well-supported by Ubisoft, with two story packs – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/10/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-the-sky-breaker-dlc-launches-in-july/">The Sky Breaker</a> and Secrets of the Spires – being released alongside quality of life updates that added <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/24/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-gets-40-fps-performance-mode-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs/">a 40FPS mode</a>, rebalanced combat and more.</p>
<p>We loved Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora when it launched late last year. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/19/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-review/">our review</a>, Dom said, “Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is an astonishing achievement, with exquisite visuals and a remarkable balance between pacifism and action. This is an enthralling alien world that plays host to a unique FPS.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Rematch has surpassed 5 million unique players across all platforms, developer Sloclap announced. It's a strong milestone for the game, just one month after launch, even with it missing key features like crossplay support, which it will continue to miss for another 6-9 weeks, according to Sloclap.</p>



<p>Sloclap announced the milestone with a <a href="https://x.com/sloclap/status/1947325700681159130">post on its official account on X</a>, where it thanked players for the support and reiterated its commitment to "<em>make Rematch better</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Like any live game, that process is going to take time, but it's perhaps taking longer than players would have expected, with crossplay support being the hot-button topic, due in part to how Sloclap handled the lack of crossplay.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-rematch-wont-support-cross-play-at-launch/">Hours before it was set to launch</a>, Sloclap let players know that Rematch would be launching without crossplay. Sloclap had tried to prepare it for launch but decided far too late to let players know that it wasn't going to happen. Later, Sloclap apologized for the error, as Rematch also launched with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-pushes-hotfix-for-rematch-network-stability-issues-as-rematch-hits-1-million-unique-players-in-first-24hrs/">bevy of bugs and matchmaking issues</a> that it was focused on fixing, but made sure to emphasize that crossplay functionality was at the top of its priority list.</p>



<p>In the studio's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2138720/view/534356176690741599?l=english">latest developer update</a>, Sloclap went over a number of features it is working on based on player feedback, while also apologizing for the problems some players continue to face, even as the game is in a much better state than it was a month ago.</p>



<p>In the short-term future, Rematch is getting a patch sometime this week that will enable players to remap controls while playing with a controller, add colorblindness options as an accessibility update, and fix a number of bugs. There's also netcode fixes to come, though there's no exact timeline as to when all these updates will arrive. Best to keep an eye on the game's social accounts if you want to know exactly when everything goes live.</p>



<p>New ranked queues, improvements to keyboard and mouse controls, the ability to report toxic players, regional server fixes, and overall upgrades to matchmaking and its ranking system are also all under review from Sloclap as it continues to work on Rematch. It doesn't seem like there's a specific timeline for any of this, but some of the issues players are reporting, such as complaints about the structure of the current ranking system, take time and experimentation to be fixed, and even then, it still won't please everyone.</p>



<p>Needless to say, while it's great for Sloclap that Rematch has had such a strong launch month, with more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/rematch-suprasses-1-million-units-sold-and-3-million-unique-players/">1 million copies sold</a> and now more than 5 million players having checked out the game with more than 60 million hours played across the globe, that will all be for nothing if it can't stay on top of its issues. </p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">I reviewed Rematch for Wccftech</a>, it was clear to me that the gameplay was very tight and highly polished, something that didn't really come as a huge surprise from the team that made such a solid melee fighter in Sifu. But its technical issues and structural issues beyond what happens on the pitch are what bring it down. I've still been playing a game of Rematch every day or so, but it would be nice to have a gameplay session where I don't lose a game because my tackle didn't register and the opposing team was able to score. Or one where we didn't have to scramble to protect our net because suddenly the keeper couldn't pick up the ball.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll start to see these fixes come in soon, and for the sake of the player base and matchmaking, crossplay will arrive closer to that six-week mark than nine weeks. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the heart of the great forests, within long-buried lairs, and at the very edges of the world, they wait. Ravening hordes of inhuman creatures biding their time, plotting the downfall of every ordered kingdom, salivating in anticipation of the bountiful slaughter soon to come.&nbsp;In this dark and bloody age, bold deeds and great courage are called for.</p>

<p>You have chosen to take up a hopeless fight, to stand when the coward would flee and the wise would kneel. You must oppose the swelling tide of strife and war, of flame and fury, or be smothered by it. Let others wallow in their false peace, let them hate you trying to drag them from it. For if you are skilled and lucky, if you choose worthy allies, take up stalwart arms or master perilous magics, you may even live to see your grim work done. Welcome to <em>The Old World RPG</em>, and your journey starts with the&nbsp;<a href="https://cubicle7games.com/warhammer-the-old-world?utm_campaign=Reviewer+&amp;utm_content=+&amp;utm_id=The+Old+World&amp;utm_medium=Reviewer+&amp;utm_source=Reviewers+" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer The Old World RPG</em> Player's Guide</a>.</p>

<p>This is the first release planned for the <em>Warhammer The Old World RPG</em>, but we have covered several of Cubicle 7's other <em>Warhammer</em> RPGs in the past, including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay Starter Set</a>, and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/age-of-sigmar-soulbound-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">Warhammer Age of Sigmar Soulbound Starter Set</a>.</p>




<h2>The Older World</h2>

<p>For those new to the setting, it's worth noting the differences between the various Cubicle 7 fantasy <em>Warhammer</em> RPGs, for which there are now 3. <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar Soulbound</em>&nbsp;is set in the latest edition of <em>Warhammer, Age of Sigmar, </em>or<em> AoS </em>for short, the current setting of Games Workshop's fantasy wargame. Here things are slightly different from the original <em>Warhammer</em>, and the narrative has moved on, and some race names have changed (along with some new races added, and some races removed).</p>

<p><em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em>, <em>WFRP</em> for short, is set in the original <em>Warhammer</em> fantasy setting, which no longer has an active wargame supported by Games Workshop. <em>The Old World</em>&nbsp;is set 300 years before the original <em>Warhammer Fantasy</em> setting, prior to the rise to power of some races. This makes it a prequel setting for <em>Warhammer</em>, like the <em>Horus Heresy</em> is to <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>. Both the <em>Horus Heresy</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-old-world-review-hit-refresh" rel="nofollow">The Old World</a> have wargames currently produced by Games Workshop, and Cubicle 7 has announced an upcoming RPG set in the <em>Horus Heresy</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Warhammer The Old World RPG</em> Player's Guide provides players with the background for life in the Old World, with a focus on the Empire, and in particular, Talabecland, and within it, the town of Talagaad, which is the core setting for the initial <em>Old World</em> products. It details the other provinces of the empire, and the lands beyond, as well as a large section on religion and magic, but the core focus is character creation and the rules, and if it's going to be anything like <em>Soulbound</em> or <em>WFRP,</em> there will be plenty of supplements detailing the various areas of the Old World.</p>

<p><em>Warhammer The Old World RPG</em> uses a D10 system, which is entirely different from the D6 system that <em>Soulbound </em>and<em> Wrath and Glory</em> use, or the D100 percentile system that <em>Imperium Maledictum </em>and<em> WFRP</em> use. In<em> The Old World RPG,&nbsp;</em>players&nbsp;roll a number of 10-sided dice (D10) equal to their characteristic, like weapon skill, reason, strength, etc. Each score that rolls under their skill number is a success. So if you had a melee skill of 5 and a weapon skill characteristic of 3, you would roll 3 dice, and each score of 5 or less would be a success.</p>

<p>What I like most about the system is that there's a load of Lore skills that your character can take, and each can provide bonuses to tests if the lore can be leveraged. This can be as simple as knowledge of a city when making an athletics or a stealth test. You can use your knowledge of the city to your advantage when trying to outrun or sneak up on an opponent. Some skills are also dependent on lore. The use of blackpowder weapons is one example, where you need the lore skill to use the physical skill.</p>

<p>Tests are modified by adding or removing dice. If a fellow player uses their action to help you, for each success on their roll, you get an additional dice, or if you're firing a bow at someone who's in cover, you'll lose dice from your roll. Tests can also be grim or glorious, depending on whether the dark gods are working against you or if the odds are substantially in your favor. For glorious rolls, you can reroll all your failed rolls in your test, and if the test is grim, you have to reroll all of your successes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-the-old-world-roleplaying-game-players-guide-3.jpg?itok=ke3OhbzX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-the-old-world-roleplaying-game-players-guide-3.jpg?itok=u9rqS8Fg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Credit:&nbsp;<em>Warhammer The Old World RPG</em> Player's Guide.</figcaption></figure><h2>Old World Optionality</h2>

<p><i>The Old World RPG </i>character creation has a lot of options for variety in the player's guide. You can play 1 of 6 races, a human, from either the Empire or Bretonnia, a dwarf, a halfling, or a Wood or High Elf. There are then 30 careers to choose from, some of which are locked to races. Only Wood Elves can be Waywatchers, only Empire Humans can be Priests, and only Dwarves can be Brewguards, for example.</p>

<p>You can then add further detail to your character with 59 available talents. Some of these have prerequisites, like race, characteristics, or other talents. These are initially gained during character creation by rolling on a table associated with your chosen race, but they can also be bought with experience points at the final stages of character creation or during play.</p>

<p>Status also plays a huge part in the game, and each class has a tier associated with it, Brass, Silver, or Gold. This tier details your starting equipment options and assets, how much money you have to spend during game sessions, and also how other characters will interact with you. Brass NPCs may respect or fear a Gold character, but they will struggle to blend in, just as Brass characters will find Gold settings awkward.</p>

<p>Your life beyond the adventure is also featured in games, and every few sessions, players take part in endeavors, such as learning skills and spells, resting, or wandering the wilds. If you test a skill during an endeavor, each failed roll is marked on your character sheet, and when those marks are higher than your skill, your skill goes up and the marks are removed. Experience points are also gained during play, and these can be used to gain talents or increase skills, but I like the endeavor system for grounding characters and showing what their lives are like between their glorious adventures.</p>

<p>The <em>Old World RPG</em> Player's Guide is entirely aimed at the players of the game. To play the game, you will also need a Gamemaster, who will run the game, and they need the Gamemaster's Guide, which details how sessions work and provides a whole host of details on the setting and rules, and stats for NPC adversaries and monsters.</p>

<p>A big part of creating a group of characters is how they are all connected, and a Grim Portent session shows how they are and what they are facing. It's mentioned in the Player's Guide, but the Gamemaster's Guide shows how to run this session and how to tie it in to your campaign.</p>

<p>Cubicle 7 has a whole host of releases planned for the initial wave of <a href="https://cubicle7games.com/warhammer-the-old-world?utm_campaign=Reviewer+&amp;utm_content=+&amp;utm_id=The+Old+World&amp;utm_medium=Reviewer+&amp;utm_source=Reviewers+" rel="nofollow">Warhammer The Old World RPG</a> physical products. Anyone purchasing the Player's Guide now will get access to the PDF, and those purchasing the Gamemaster's Guide will get a digital copy later this month. Other physical products planned for a Q1 2026 release include character sheets, maps of the Grand Duchy of Talabec, where the initial releases are planned, and several reference card packs to save you looking through the rulebooks mid-action in-game. There are also several bundles available, including a Collector's Edition for those who want to go all in.</p>

Bison. Among them are Bison himself, Balrog, Vega, and Sagat. Each player selects a character to play as from the roster of the original eight world warriors: Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, Guile, Dhalsim, Blanka, E. Honda, or Zangief, with each character bringing their unique attacks that fans of the video games will instantly recognize.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With your character selected, you then get to choose a deck of cards that represents your fighting style – one of my favorite aspects of the game. In Street Fighter, the actions you can take on your turn are based on cards that you draw and play from these respective decks of cards, with each deck tailored to different strategies and named after common terms in the fighting game communities that have built up around the video games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take, for instance, the “Shoto” deck, which has more projectile cards, as though you are spamming Ryu or Ken’s Hadoukens. Or there's the Rushdown deck, which is more about maneuvering around opponents and hitting them hard with attacks like the Cross Up.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>With your character selected, you then choose a deck of cards that represents your fighting style – one of my favorite aspects of the game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">On each turn, players place down and activate two of these cards from their hands, rolling dice to dish out damage, and with each card adding various resources to their available pool, which can then be spent to use their character’s special abilities. These resources include punches, kicks, and my personal favorite, joysticks. The six included decks offer some sense of asymmetry to how a character can play. I wish this was pushed a little farther to highlight further the different playstyles used in competitions, but their inclusion is still a neat easter egg that I appreciate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Games of Street Fighter V take place in one of four possible stages that you build from poster-board tiles that come with the game. Each stage has some unique rules that go with it, as well. It would be too easy if the big bad were out from the get-go for you and your friends to take out. Instead, you need to prove yourself first and get strong by taking out various minions that spawn on the board, or fighting your rival (an AI-controlled Street Fighter character assigned to each player at the start of the game). Taking out these enemies earns you EX bars that can be used to upgrade your character's abilities, putting you in a better spot for when the Nemesis boss character appears.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bison, Balrog, Sagat, and Vega – the Nemesis characters – each have their own set of abilities that are triggered depending on what is pulled from the Nemesis deck, which also determines where new minions spawn. Once you and your team manage to deal enough damage to knock out the nemesis, you win – but if even one of your team is taken out, then it’s game over. The general flow of the game is pretty simple, and by the second or third turn through, everyone I played with had a good grasp on how the game worked, and things went pretty quickly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving my character around, hurling fireballs, and beating up minions was fun, which caused my friends and me to, on more than one occasion, yell out the signature moves as we performed them. The lack of enemy variety is a bit of a bummer, with only three minion factions to pick from, each with only two options. That means you will quickly run out of new enemies to fight against, made worse by the fact that each game only has you go up against one of the three factions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maps aren’t overly large, which is nice. It's never a hassle to get to the various objectives or wherever you want to go, and the additional few “Hard” Nemesis cards you can mix into the deck do increase the challenge, but I wouldn’t turn down more offerings or tweaks to increase the difficulty or complexity of the game. If you are just looking for a game to beat up thugs with your friends, Street Fighter is fine enough now and then.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I have played a good number of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">board game adaptations of popular video games</a>, from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-the-board-game-series-buying-guide">Resident Evil</a> to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/slay-the-spire-the-board-game-review">Slay the Spire</a>, and even ones like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/guilty-gear-strive-the-board-game-review">Guilty Gear Strive</a> that are also based on a fighting game. But Street Fighter V: Champion Edition - Legends feels the most disjointed and confused as to what it wants to be. Looking at just the gameplay, the concept of running around with your friends, taking out small minions before tackling the stage’s boss is far more in line with, say, Capcom’s Final Fight series of beat-’em-ups. A series, mind you, whose characters have made the jump into Street Fighter previously, such as the ninja Guy. But Street Fighter has always been about duking it out with your friend in a 1v1 fight, and by making this a strictly cooperative game, both of those core components of the game are missing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This disparity includes even those little easter eggs that I mentioned, like the various fight style decks and joystick resource on the cards. These little nods will be appreciated most by members of the fighting game community and glossed over by others who would appreciate this game more for what it is, rather than the package we got that honestly feels like it simply got the Street Fighter V property slapped on top of a different game and called it a day.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aebXZJ?object_uuid=e6b11ccc-d482-4874-8957-ed51a6171fe8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/z62n6q?object_uuid=e6b11ccc-d482-4874-8957-ed51a6171fe8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Walmart</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 21, 2025 5:22 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Playing Street Fighter is a fun and fairly straightforward affair that I found worked well as a palate cleanser between the bigger games of the evening during a game night. This is a fun game to enjoy with friends when you want to work together, beating up some thugs, but as a Street Fighter game, I found it to be subpar and missing many of the fundamentals of the franchise. This is particularly disappointing considering that Street Fighter IV has a wonderful adaptation thanks to the use of the Exceed Fighting System (which is also used by the Guilty Gear Strive board game). Street Fighter V: Champion Edition - Legends is okay. It’s a game I would be fine to play, but not one I see myself actively reaching for on my shelf or suggesting for game night. If one of my friends is interested and wants to give it a try, I’ll happily teach them and play, but that’s about as far as my interest extends.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/street-fighter-v-champion-edition-legends-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The Chinese Room, the celebrated UK developer behind Dear Esther, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/08/12/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review/">Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/17/still-wakes-the-deep-review/">Still Wakes The Deep</a>, has regained its independence after a management buyout from Sumo Digital.</p>
<p>The studio is currently at work on concluding development of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/26/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-will-now-launch-in-october-2025/">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</a> for Paradox Interactive, and now has two original IPs in development.</p>


<p>The management buyout has been facilitated by venture capital firm Hiro Capital, with studio director Ed Daly continuing to head the developer.</p>
<p>“This management buyout allows us to scratch the creative itch of continuing to work on new, original intellectual property, but also to partner with other studios on other projects when they fit in with our vision,” Daly said. “This is what we are doing and we want to carry on doing it, so we’re happy to carry on in this vein.”</p>
<p>The Chinese Room had been bought up by Sumo Digital in 2018, as Sumo went on a large expansion drive through the last decade, opening up or acquiring studios in Nottingham, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/02/sumo-digital-have-rescued-ccps-newcastle-studio-from-closure/">Newcastle</a>, Leamington, Warrington, Pune and Bangalore and more, growing to around 1,400 employees by 2023. In turn, Sumo was<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/19/british-developer-sumo-digital-acquired-by-tencent-1-3-billion/"> acquired by Tencent in 2022</a>.</p>

<p>However, the future of Sumo and all their subsidiaries were thrown into doubt earlier this year when the company issued a statement that it would <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/04/sumo-group-stops-making-original-ip-to-focus-on-partner-titles/">now refocus on third party work</a> as opposed to original IP and self-publishing. This led to layoffs and the sale of publishing label Secret Mode.</p>
<p>The Chinese Room was also being put up for sale, but with the likelihood of being acquired by an overseas entity again has been staved off. Hiro Capital is a London and Luxembourg VC fund that specialises in founding and angel funding gaming, sports and technology.</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">“The Chinese Room is a huge British success story that has rightly been recognised as a unique creative force capable of competing on the world stage,” said Spike Laurie, a partner at Hiro Capital. “From hiring British people to making games set in the UK, they’ve been one of our foremost creative studios and now they are once again in charge of their own destiny while remaining British.</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">“We are at risk of overlooking these creative gems and letting them be sold to overseas corporations,” Laurie continued. “That is a travesty for the $5.5 billion British gaming industry which has a world-renowned reputation. We need to nurture this talent and support it through difficult times, because it is one of our leading creative exports.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Critical Role has announced an official videogame partnership. The multimedia company has announced it will be collaborating with AdHoc Studio on several upcoming videogame projects. One of them is an official Critical Role videogame.</p>

<h2>The AdHoc Studio Critical Role Videogame Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Critical Role's CEO Travis Willingham discussed the reasoning behind their collaboration with AdHoc Studio. According to Willingham, he was auditioning for a role in the studio's upcoming narrative-driven superhero workplace drama game, <em>Dispatch.&nbsp;</em>Afterwards, more in-depth talks happened, resulting in a partnership which includes official Critical Role videogame development.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dispatch-game-dialogue-screenshot.jpg?itok=8hZ74aQ7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dispatch-game-dialogue-screenshot.jpg?itok=zeL7O1ub 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><blockquote>
<p>"Just from looking over the audition and game materials, I knew there was something special about what AdHoc was creating and I immediately reached out,” said Willingham. “The design, tone, style and storytelling of DISPATCH jumped off the page, and I knew given the pedigree of the folks at AdHoc, this was a team we wanted to collaborate with. Critical Role is always looking to build with people who are innovating around new ways to deliver story, character and worldbuilding, and AdHoc fits that perfectly.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As part of this partnership, Critical Role will collaborate with AdHoc on future Dispatch brand development. This will include merchandise, tabletop gaming, and more. In addition, both AdHoc and Critical Role will help co-develop the first videogame set in Critical Role's fantasy setting of Exandria, showcasing AdHoc's design strengths in deep, player choice-driven storytelling.</p>

<p>AdHoc's pedigree in videogame narrative cannot be understated. The studio was founded by several veterans of Telltale Games, the studio responsible for their critically-acclaimed videogame adaptations of <em>The Walking Dead</em> and <em>The Wolf Among Us</em> set in the <em>Fables</em> universe.</p>

<p>Considering the voice cast of Dispatch includes two other key members of Critical Role, Matt Mercer and Laura Bailey, there is clear vested interest in AdHoc from a creative and design perspective.</p>

<p>A Critical Role videogame has been something the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-confirms-video-game-is-coming" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">has wanted to do</a> for a while. Given breadth of the world of Exandria, told throughout <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-concludes-campaign-3-with-epic-8-hour-finale-new-godly-exu-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">three major campaigns</a> and several spin-offs spanning ten years, there is plenty of material to pull from.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/13/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-review/">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown’s</a> launch last year got off to a tortured analogy about a bad start to a motor race. Did it stall as the lights went out? Did it burn out its tyres with wheelspin? Did it bog down in second gear? Perhaps all of the above? KT Racing haven’t given up on their open world lifestyle racer, though, and with the imminent launch of Season 4, they’ve now opened up about what Year 2 holds for their game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Behind the Scenes: The Future of Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K88Nrddj4fw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Since last September, KT Racing has delivered two major updates, first with the Ibiza City map at the end of last year in Season 2, while Season 3 in March brought new mission types, a solo mode, more vehicles, AI difficulty selection and more. What awaits through to 2026 is more of an incremental approach to improvement, adding requested features with each season, new mission types, and continuing to engage with the community to decide the path ahead.</p>


<p>But first, Season 4 is set to arrive this month, bringing with its a bunch of new race events branded as Stock Races. There’s 20 new races and 20 redefined ones across both Hong Kong Island and Ibiza, all of which will challenge you to drive in cars locked to their stock value. Alongside that comes an overhaul of active aero for select cars that have moveable parts, with a revamp of the dynamic aero system aiming to recreate each car’s behaviour with aerobrake, DRS and deployment. In certain instances, you’ll have both automatic and manual control – your Bugatti Veyron will now have high and low drag modes, for example.</p>
<p>The UI is also getting a makeover, giving players full control over which parts of the HUD are active, adding a new quick access filter system for the world map, and catering better to groups driving together with support for up to 4 routes in the GPS and an itinerary plan for players to follow.</p>

<p>There’s also five new cars, this time arriving with the first paid Solar Pass of rewards, alongside a free rewards track. These include the Aston Martin DB11 Volante, DeLorean Alpha5 and more.</p>

<p>But perhaps most exciting for long-time TDU fans is the return of the casino. The Wintory Casino is a brand new social area which allows for up to 32 players to share the space – up from 8 or 16 players in the base game. There’s two new shops for avatar and car cosmetics here, but the big difference is that you need to buy things with casino chips, which you obviously get from gambling –&nbsp;or turning Solar Coin to casino chips at a rate of 2:1.</p>
<p>Initially there will be just the one slot machine type, but a mid-season update will bring a Golden Dragon slot machine and the ability to play poker. Get lucky enough and you could win a Mercedes-AMG GT Black Series.</p>

<p>This should hopefully tide players over to October and the start of Season 5, which brings major changes to the game with an overhaul of the KT Engine that adds new water shaders, reflections, shadowing and lighting, and aims to make better use of the CPU and GPU. There’s no details yet, but hoepfully this brings some big improvements for the game on console as well as on PC.</p>

<p>This also sees the addition of Taxi missions, where you’ll have to pick up a client and drive them to a destination following common sense road rules like adhering to speed limits and using indicators –&nbsp;this ain’t Crazy Taxi, alright? Along the way, clients might make specific requests, such as having you roll down windows or turn on the radio, and you might have to meet a dress code beforehand as well.</p>

<p>Season 6 will also add a new mission type in January, but this one will be determined by the community, with voting now active to decide between a Detective, Package Delivery, Photography and Adrenaline missions. You can <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdV49jCWe1BvGaZpkgYEpdY0tTJOSYappAnQj0V06ZYg7gEuQ/viewform">head here to vote before 4th August</a>.</p>
<p>Even further away are the Official Racing Centre hub in April’s Season 7, where players can gather at an island race track and launch ranked events together, and then houses and real estate won’t appear until Season 8, letting you throw money into buying properties that you can customise, furnish and invite friends to visit to check out the cars you’re displaying in your garage or garden.</p>

<p>There’s further things being teased, such as more Asian market vehicles appearing in Season 7, the possibility for body kits and more car customisation, car selling as well, and there are still plans for bikes at some point as well. Also high on the priority list are cross-region servers – cross-platform play less so – eight player groups and selling cars.</p>
<p>There’s a long road ahead for Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown, and while it didn’t get off to an ideal start, it is good to see KT Racing sticking with the project to build out their vision. The goal, of course, is to build up more momentum and bring both new and returning players into the game once more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Donkey Kong Bananza has been a stellar return for Nintendo's beloved ape, with the critical consensus from players and critics making it one of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/">2025's best games so far</a>, and as for its commercial success, it was reportedly at the top of the sales charts for physical games in the UK. That said, it didn't come close to hitting the heights of Super Mario Odyssey's launch.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/">The Game Business</a> founder and editor-in-chief, Christopher Dring, <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1946977090487923167">posted on X</a> that Donkey Kong Bananza was at the top of the UK's physical sales charts, and that its launch was "<em>3x bigger than the launch of Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze."</em> However, Dring reports that it was "<em>less than half of Super Mario Odyssey's</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Donkey Kong Bonanza launches at No.1 in the UK chart (physical sales) . Its launch is 3x bigger than the launch of Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze on Switch. But it is less than half of Super Mario Odyssey’s</p>— Christopher Dring (@Chris_Dring) <a href="https://twitter.com/Chris_Dring/status/1946977090487923167?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Donkey Kong Bananza was only released days ago at the time of this writing, so Dring is only reporting on the launch week sales. It's also worth noting that it's only physical sales for one region. Physical sales are still an important moniker for Nintendo games, since the only people still buying games physically seem to be Nintendo fans, but they're not yet the whole picture of Bananza's success.</p>



<p>As we get more information about Bananza's sales in the coming weeks and months, it'll be interesting to see how the game continues to take off. The comparisons to Nintendo's main mascot and the last major 3D platformer we got from Mario are perhaps a bit unfair, but relevant considering that the team who worked on DK Bananza stemmed from the same team that made Super Mario Odyssey, and that's before getting into all the gameplay similarities between the two.</p>



<p>In his review of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, Wccftech's Nathan Birch, giving the game a 9/10 said, "<em>Donkey Kong Bananza doesn’t monkey around, as it’s inarguably the biggest, most ambitious 3D platformer Nintendo has ever produced. Taking the formula established by Super Mario Odyssey as a starting point, Nintendo goes deeper, wilder, weirder, and punchier. Donkey Kong Bananza is perhaps a bit less refined than the near-immaculate Odyssey, but if you can overlook a few minor brown spots, this banana is very much worth peeling.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Prologue: Go Wayback!</em> is an unfortunate name for a video game, though on par for what I’d expect for a developer whose previous game was called <em>PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds</em>. The survival game–or survival-esque game? Or survival game-like?--has an early access release planned, but there’s currently a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam demo</a> that lets you try to figure out what exactly it is for yourself.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Prologue</em> spreads itself between survival game, walking sim, and tech demo. Each run takes place on a new huge, generated map; you’re tasked with walking from a starting cabin to a weather station somewhere out in the world, using only a compass and a paper map that doesn’t update with your position. There isn’t any wildlife or monsters out there, just nature and a few points of interest, also marked on your map, that could be cabins, lean-tos, or piles of rocks. In its current form the game has some light survival elements in terms of managing your character’s hunger, thirst, and temperature. These aren’t terribly taxing, though letting them bottom out will end your run.&nbsp;</p><p>The game’s maps are created with what <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/prologue-go-wayback-brendan-greene-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a writeup on Epic Games</a> calls “a mixture of procedural generation, machine learning, and good old-fashioned handcrafted art.” This includes in-house machine learning technology to generate the heightmap and uses data drawn from, the developer <a href="https://playerunknownproductions.net/news/guided-generation-in-prologue-ml-generated-landscapes-based-on-game-designer-inpu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">says</a>, “real-world landscape data (from public geospatial datasets).” The generation is done on the player’s machine rather than in the energy-guzzling data centers AI is known for. Developer Brendan Greene told Epic that “We try not to use generative AI for the artistic process;” while it’s not clear to me what “try” means, there’s no AI disclosure on its Steam page. The whole thing is kind of a tech test for a sort of–oh god–metaverse, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/pubg-2-prologue-brendan-greene-playerunknown-metaverse-1851765648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kotaku</a> writing that “This metaverse, a 3D version of the internet as Greene calls it, is the long-term goal, potentially 10-15 years away, guiding <em>Prologue</em>’s development like a north star.”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Prologue: Go Wayback! - Official Trailer | IGN Fan Fest 2025" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IbRDB5ygQ6U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>That’s a lot of the kinds of buzzwords I hate, and also not a lot of insight into what the thing you can download on Steam actually is. This might explain why I hadn’t realized a playable version of the game existed until YouTube put one of my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTin6ycnDWw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favorite <em>The Long Dark </em>players</a> messing with it in front of me over the weekend. I love <a href="https://aftermath.site/long-dark-survival" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Long Dark</em></a> for all the things <em>Prologue</em> has in common with it, namely wandering around in the woods, so I downloaded the demo to check it out. In my five hours with the demo I did not make it to the weather station, though I did glimpse it once in the distance before fog set in, I made some bad choices that got me hopelessly lost, and died.</p><p>In real life, I am not great with maps; I will admit that I sometimes can’t even parse a Google map without turning myself or my phone in different directions. <em>Prologue</em>’s compass and paper map setup were a huge challenge for me. The best way to navigate the demo’s world is to find the big river that crosses every map and then follow it; this also helps with your need for water, which can’t be collected from rain or puddles despite the game’s abundance of rain, puddles, and containers that can hold water. In one run, the starting cabin I spawned in was firmly between three river tributaries and a mountain; as long as I didn’t climb a mountain, I thought, it was impossible for me <em>not</em> to hit a river eventually. But then I kept <em>not</em> hitting a river <em>or </em>a mountain, stopping to look at my map and compass, asking myself if I even actually understood cardinal directions.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Aftermath/PlayerUnknown</figcaption></figure><p>When I did find a river in a run, things were going great until curiosity got the better of me and I wandered into the woods. I kept muttering “the river is behind you, just turn around” to myself until I came upon a little lean-to that thrillingly contained a new map showing my updated position. Then, a snowstorm set in, and when it ended, I somehow <em>didn’t</em> just turn around and, even with my new map, couldn’t find the river again. With the world changing each time, there’s none of the learning landmarks of games like <em>The Long Dark </em>that help you improve over time. Given that navigation is the main activity the <em>Prologue</em> demo has going for it, how much you understand the concept of where your body is in space will likely dictate how challenging you find it.</p><p>As a demo, the game struggled a bit for me tech-wise, with frequent framerate drops and some effects I had to turn off to stop the leaves on all the trees from turning into weird little strobe lights. The controls can be equally finicky, sometimes not picking things up when they should. But I didn’t mind looking past this to enjoy just wandering in <em>Prologue</em>’s world, full of shifting biomes and weird rock formations. There is spectacular weather: in one of my runs, a powerful rainstorm started up as soon as I spawned, threatening to tear the roof off my starting cabin in a roar of water and flapping wood. There are snow storms and, captivatingly, hail. There are muddy areas that slow your walk speed and fog that obscures everything, and, less frequently, solid ground and sunny skies. With no crafting and little in the way of shelter, changes in weather can spell the end of a run.</p><figure><figcaption>Aftermath/PlayerUnknown</figcaption></figure><p>You find food and items as you explore, though you have a clunky, maddeningly small inventory to contend with. You can also carry items under your arm; I mainly did this for firewood, since bigger pieces can be in short supply out in the world. The firestarting mechanic is great: using a firestriker you hopefully remembered to pick up in the starting cabin, you arrange tinder, sticks, and logs and then strike enough sparks for everything to catch. The placement of your fire items matters, as does the weather you’re trying to light a fire in, and it feels very much like starting a fire in the real world. One of my runs ended when I found myself slogging through a <em>The NeverEnding Story</em>-esque mud flat, moments from freezing to death, with the ground too wet to light a fire on.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s good that the fire mechanic is interesting, because otherwise there isn’t all that much to <em>do</em> in the demo. The landscape can become repetitive, and there’s no narrative to follow, secrets to uncover, or timer or closing circle to push you toward the weather station. I wouldn’t fault anyone who simply found it boring–its world is very beautiful, but there isn’t very much <em>in </em>it–or players with better navigational skills than me finding it too easy. Beyond mishaps with my fires, foraged mushrooms were enough to keep me fed and hydrated; my deaths didn’t feel inevitable so much as consequences of my own bad choices.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Aftermath/PlayerUnknown</figcaption></figure><p>Despite all this, <em>Prologue</em> ate up a chunk of my Saturday. In the absence of so many of the things that make video games video game-like, it has its own intriguing atmosphere that feels like it has nothing to do with metaverse cringe. It isn’t exciting, or necessarily <em>good</em>, and I can’t even say I honestly understand what it’s trying to be. But it drew me in regardless, given my love of a slow-paced wandering game and the pleasures of exploring virtual woods. <em>Prologue</em>’s eventual early access release plans to add narrative, “new ways of surviving,” and “hazards to explore,” and while it definitely feels a bit too bare bones right now, I think leaning too far into the hallmarks of standard survival games runs the risk of PlayerUnknown just making a crappy survival game. <em>PUBG</em>’s Arma mod lineage made it wonderfully, grimly clunky, and I hope <em>Prologue</em>, whatever it’s developing itself into, sticks with that feeling while improving on the parts that don’t function quite right yet.</p><p>I can’t totally say I’d recommend it if you’re not a survival game nerd like me, or even if you are. But I had a hugely particular-feeling experience in it, one that had me scooted forward in my chair with my face close to my computer screen, one that told the kinds of personal, harrowing stories only a very slow survival game can, even one as baffling as <em>Prologue</em>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/waypoint-quit-steam-vice"><h3>Waypoint Writers Quit Over Removal Of Articles Related To New Steam Policy [Update]</h3></a><p>Two articles by writer Ana Valens were removed at the demand of Vice owner Savage Ventures, the latest in multiple deletions at the site</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/warframe-old-peace-world-war-one-interview-tennocon"><h3>Warframe, Still A Space Ninja Game (Technically), Is Now Drawing Inspiration From World War I</h3></a><p>"I liken it to the moment in World War I where you have soldiers playing football on Christmas day across the trenches"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-valnet-off-the-grid-gunzilla-rip-this-sucks"><h3>🙃 [Update: 🤔]</h3></a><p>Cool, cool, cool</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/friendslop-peak-lethal-company-social-media-discourse"><h3>‘Friendslop’ Isn’t Real, But People Love Posting About It Anyway</h3></a><p>But people are still intent on dunking on the idea of someone saying "friendslop" and meaning it.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/prologue-go-wayback-demo-pubg]]></content:encoded>

Suffice it to say, it’s routinely in that sweet spot of “worth checking out for the price,” especially if you’re a <em>Far Cry</em> fan who likes hunting and taking out enemy forts using a combination of stealth and pure chaos. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/far-cry-7-assassins-creed-hexe-ghost-recon-delay-1851780674&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/far-cry-7-assassins-creed-hexe-ghost-recon-delay-1851780674">A new <em>Far Cry</em></a></span><em> i</em>s likely still a year or more away, with Ubisoft recently confirming that some of its biggest in-development blockbusters would be delayed to get the time they needed. After <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em> and <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> both struggled to makes lasting waves relative to their budgets and ambitions, Ubisoft has said it’s taking more time to make sure its games feel polished and stand out. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-woke-stop-killing-games-1851786587&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-woke-stop-killing-games-1851786587"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows,</em></a></span> out earlier this year, was a promising start. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/avatar-frontiers-pandora-cheap-third-person-new-game-1851786644]]></content:encoded>

                <p>You'll be able to earn a free skin, a Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 car body, and a Red Hot Chili Peppers jam track when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rocket-league/" data-ref-id="5000-397027">Rocket League</a> kick off their second annual Summer Road Trip event on Tuesday, July 22. Players can earn the Corvette and its matching set of wheels by playing either Fortnite or Rocket League--but you'll have to play both games if you want to get all the free rewards. The Summer Road Trip event ends on August 4 in Rocket League, and August 7 in Fortnite.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4535416-fortnitechevycorvette.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535416" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4535416-fortnitechevycorvette.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535416"></a><figcaption>You'll be able to earn the Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 for free during the Summer Road Trip event.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4535416-fortnitechevycorvette.jpg"></figure><p>On the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-party-up-summer-road-trip-unlock-the-chevrolet-corvette-zr1-bundle?lang=en-US" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fortnite side</a>, players will be given a new quest each day to gain XP while in a party in certain modes--with the quests alternating each day between Epic-created modes like Battle Royale and Reload, and user-created games. Each completed quest unlocks a new reward, starting with "The Zephyr Song" by The Red Hot Chili Peppers for completing one quest, and ending with the Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 car body for completing eight of them. Most of the rewards in between are filler items like sprays and emoticons, but there's also a high-quality wrap and a rubber ducky pickaxe.</p><p><a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/en/news/step-into-the-chevrolet-corvette-zr1-car-body-in-rocket-leagues-summer-road-trip" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">In Rocket League</a>, the event is split in half, with most of the quests and rewards available on the first day of the event, with the final quest to unlock the Corvette becoming available on July 28. But that first batch of quests also includes some rewards for Fortnite. Making 15 saves during the Summer Road Trip will unlock the Fortnite skin Hairpin, and playing a private match with mutators on will unlock a Fortnite glider that looks like a Rocket League ball. Neither of those items can be earned in Fortnite.</p><p>This year's summer road trip has slightly more rewards and significantly less controversy than last year's event, which had the maligned Tesla Cybertruck as its big prize at the end, and offered the free jam track "Holiday" by Green Day. The big new wrinkle here is having rewards for playing Rocket League that cannot be used in Rocket League--the glider and the Hairpin skin are Fortnite-specific items.</p><p>All but one of the rewards from this year's Summer Road Trip could end up in the item shop after the event ends, and it's likely that at least the jam track and the car will get that treatment sooner than later--the Cybertruck hit the item shop immediately after the event closed last August, for example. The only definitely exclusive item is the ZR1 Circuit decal for the Corvette.</p><p>The Summer Road Trip isn't the only big cosmetic news for Fortnite this week. Friday will also bring the Fantastic Four to the item shop, both in the form of skins, and as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fantastic-four-nikes-are-coming-to-fortnite/1100-6533214/" data-ref-id="1100-6533214">shoes</a>.</p>
