            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>WIth the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a> next week on 6th February, Koei Tecmo and Team Ninja have released a new demo for the game, letting you explore early areas on both PS5 and PC via Steam.</p>
<p>The new demo will let players create their custom character and make a start on the game by exploring the Warring States period and battling through to the Jakotsu-baba boss, with save data able to carry over to the full game. This can all be played solo, of course, but there’s also support for up to three players in online multiplayer, so your buddies can come give you a hand.</p>


<p>Beating the demo by 15th February will then reward you with the Twin-Snake Helmet for the full version of the game – this bonus cannot be earned by those who’s already obtained it through the PS5 alpha demo, though.</p>
<p>Nioh 3 casts you as Tokugawa Takechiyo who has been forced from the shogunate throne by his rebellious brother Tokugawa Kunimatsu, and must face him and his army of demons in battle for the ages.</p>

<p>New for this game is a quick switch to a second combat style, transforming from Samurai to Ninja in a flash. You’ll make the most of these with the yokai that you battle in the new ‘open field’ setting that greatly broadens the level style.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nioh 3 Preview –&nbsp;Ninja and Samurai enter the Bakumatsu Crucible" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YvpJk-mcR5E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I went <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/21/nioh-3-preview-bakumatsu-kyoto-ninja-gameplay/">hands on with Nioh 3 last year</a>, experiencing both this new combat style shifting and open field design. I said, “It’s undeniably fun to switch back and forth between Samurai and Ninja, or just stick with the faster, nippier Ninja in general. No doubt, this is one for fans of the series and the wider genre to pay attention to when it launches in February 2026.”</p>

            <p>After years worth of all of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-might-be-remaking-their-swashbuckling-pirateventure-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">that</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-seemingly-teased-by-actor-whos-pretty-chill-about-loose-lips-sinking-ships">this</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-will-release-in-march-2026-according-to-the-latest-whispers">that</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-rated-by-pegi-as-the-siren-song-of-remake-sea-shanties-grows-deafening">the other thing</a>, they've just randomly decided now's the time to acknowledge it. Via a Tweeter reply containing that GTA: San Andreas meme no less. I may be a weathered old sailor with cannon fuses tied into my beard and more trips up the rigging than I can count to my name, but I didn't foresee this being how Ubisoft finally acknowledged that Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag remake.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That's what they've done, though. Years of silence, and then like a well-timed broadside, boom:</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>Why now, in response to a seemingly random bloke selling an Edward Kenway-shaped plastic trinket on Vinted? Well, a man of the sea can only assume the publishers' recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">raft of cancellations and delays</a>, which reportedly included the Black Flag remake being pushed back into the financial year ending March 2027, factor in.</p>
<p>Those have been quickly followed by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">redundancy plans</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unionised-french-ubisoft-workers-put-out-call-for-an-international-strike-held-by-all-current-employees">unions calling strike action</a> against Ubisoft, with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-designer-claims-ubisoft-have-suspended-him-for-alleged-breach-of-the-duty-of-loyalty-over-new-rto-policy">real</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-just-as-if-it-never-existed-following-ubisofts-prince-of-persia-remake-cancellation-actor-discusses-losing-three-years-worth-of-work">toll</a> taken on folks lives rightly taking precedence over chatter about a pirate game.</p>
<p>Perhaps this just the way things have to go these days. The sobering reality of workers being chucked into the sun punching you right in face. Then, when you open your eyes again, the surreal sight of a corporate social media account finally tipping its cap to a long-rumoured remake's existence ages after it'd have made sense to do so is there. Immense and unforgiveable brutality, intercut with the promise of goods people might treasure conveyed in a manner so strange you can scarcely believe. Yo-ho. A pirate's life indeed, I guess.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EcoFlow Goes All-In on Portable Power Station Clearance, RIVER 2 Pro Generator Drops 40% With a 5-Year Warranty]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ecoflow-goes-all-in-on-portable-power-station-clearance-river-2-pro-generator-drops-40-with-a-5-year-warranty-2000663939</link>
            <guid>1419784</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Investing in a power station can be a smart decision if you’re often out and about or want to have a backup option during outages. The best options out there offer multiple ports and a reliable battery life, but they often don’t come cheap. That, however, is changing today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6489/">Right now, you can snag the EF Ecoflow River 2 Pro portable power station for just $315 at Amazon, after the retailer knocked 40% off its usual $529 price tag.</a> The offer is open to all shoppers, but it ends soon. Grab yours now, before Amazon decides to shoot the price back up (which can be any moment now).</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6489/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Ports for a Wide Range of Devices</h2>
<p>The River 2 Pro weighs just 17.2 lbs and features a built-in handle, both of which make it easy to carry the power station around. You’re getting a total of 11 ports, including four AC outlets, one USB-C port, three USB-A ports, two DC outlets, and one car outlet. That’s more than enough to keep all your important devices powered in cases of emergency. Think plugging your smartphone, laptop, an electric blanket, a coffee machine, and lights – all at the same time, without feeling limited.</p>
<p>The output of up to 1600W makes the thing perfectly capable of running around 80% off all your appliances, even high-wattage ones. It can recharge your phone from 0 to 100% 57 times on a single charge, and your laptop for over 10. When at home, it keeps your electric blanket powered for 12 hours, your refrigerator for five, and even your PC for over an hour. That means you can rely on it to get work done during an unexpected outage, plus keep other essentials running for extended periods.</p>



<p>When it comes to recharging the power bank itself, that doesn’t take forever either. You can power it back up via an AC outlet, a solar panel, a Type-C cable, or your car. Using an AC outlet is the fastest option, juicing it back to 100% in just 70 minutes. A 220w solar panel will take around 3.5 hours, while plugging it into a 12v/24v 8A car outlet gets the job done in about nine hours. This flexibility comes in handy when you’re camping in the wild, traveling, or dealing with electricity supply issues at home. Additionally, the LFP battery cells are long-lasting, letting you recharge the River 2 Pro more than 3000 times before dropping to 80% capacity. For reference, that’s nearly 10 years of regular use. What’s more, the power station includes advanced BMS protection that monitors voltage, current, and temperature to ensure longevity. Basically, it’s made to support all your power needs for years to come.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6489/">Included in the box are the power station itself, an AC charging cable, a user manual, and a 5-year service for added peace of mind</a>. Altogether, the EcoFlow River 2 Pro portable power station is great for anyone looking to invest in a reliable power solution without putting a dent in their wallet. This deal makes the upgrade easier than ever. Just make sure you grab the offer before it’s too late.</p>

<p>The Split Fiction game director has revealed that he has received the first draft of the upcoming adaptation’s script. </p>



<p>The movie adaptation of Split Fiction was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-movie-confirmed-with-sydney-sweeney-taking-a-lead-role/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed in April 2025</a>, less than 2 months after the game’s release. It has some big names attached to it, with Sydney Sweeney taking one of the lead roles and Deadpool &amp; Wolverine screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick writing the script. </p>







<h2 id="h-split-fiction-director-has-met-sydney-sweeney">Split Fiction Director Has Met Sydney Sweeney  </h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/split-fiction-game-director-exciting-update-sydney-sweeney-movie-3311457/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a> report, news that the first script for the Split Fiction movie has reached the game’s director comes from an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTw4CbhDZZT/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram post</a> by Moviezine. The post features a video in which Josef Fares states that he has received the “first version of the script.” However, he added that he will believe it when he sees it, due to “so much talk in Hollywood”. Fares also said that he had a conversation with the Euphoria star, and “she seems pretty chill” and “hyped for the movie”. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Split Fiction is a co-op title from the creators of It Takes Two, Hazelight Studios. It features the tale of two writers who are trapped in the adventures of each other’s stories. One of the writers specialises in fantasy stories and the other in sci-fi, and they have been hooked into a machine that steals their ideas. The game features a variety of abilities and several challenges that blend sci-fi and fantasy into a unique perspective. </p>

      <p>When the Denver Broncos season ended in a gut wrenching 10-7 loss to the New England Patriots in the AFC Conference Championship Game last Sunday, fans took to social media to vent their frustration and mourn the end of a terrific season, a common occurrence in a league with so few dynasties. For a new group of fans, however, this was their first-ever playoff heartbreak.&nbsp;</p><p>New fans adopt sports teams all the time, be it participating in family or community bonding or connecting to a new team through outside media. Thanks to the internet, the latter phenomenon has become much more common, broadening fanbases globally instead of traditional localities from which they drew support.</p><p>This season, the Denver Broncos were in the center of a unique fan experience. Slowly, starting in September, videos of highlights from the team’s wins showed up on social media, overlaid with music from the anime <em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em>, a show about girls with horse traits going to a specialized academy to learn how to compete in horse races. First, anime fans kept posting more and more edits, and more and more people started watching them. Then sports fans started getting in on the trend, adopting the styles similar to anime creators. Eventually, cosplayers who love the characters from the anime started going to Broncos games, hyping the trend up even more and cementing a new community of fans. Cosplayers in Denver routinely started going to games in character and meeting up with other cosplayers for professional photoshoots.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://matsustudios.com/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>MatsuStudios</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>“I love meeting new people, but am painfully awkward. Cosplay breaks down the uncomfortable barriers and gives you an instant connection with someone,” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/greycloudscos/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Grey, a Denver-based cosplayer</u></a> and <em>Umamusume</em> fan, said about the trend.&nbsp;</p><p>For them, sports have always been a part of their life as an avid snowboarder, but watching professional teams had never been an interest. Their family is from Philadelphia, and diehard fans of the city’s sports teams. Yet, thanks to this blossoming community, they’re showing off Broncos colors in cosplay.</p><p>“Last week, I actually turned on a [Broncos] game voluntarily because of <em>Umamusume</em>.”</p><p><em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em> was a Japanese game that released in 2021, as well as an anime series that ran from 2018 to 2023 with 39 episodes over three seasons. But interest in the series, especially globally, revived in June 2025 with the English release of the <em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em> <a href="https://aftermath.site/uma-musume-gacha-horse-racing-anime/"><u>mobile game</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Shortly after, TikTok user its.a.shyday started posting edits of <em>Umamusume</em> characters mashed up with his favorite NFL team, the Denver Broncos. These videos gained some traction online, but it wasn’t until a video posted on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@its.a.shyday/video/7556058282964684046?_r=1&amp;_t=ZP-93QOKx0FBaJ&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>September 30th</u></a> that the edits started to take off and inspire others to join in.</p><figure><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@its.a.shyday/video/7556058282964684046" data-video-id="7556058282964684046" data-embed-from="oembed"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@its.a.shyday" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@its.a.shyday?refer=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">@its.a.shyday</a> <p><a title="broncos" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/broncos?refer=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">#broncos</a> <a title="umas" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/umas?refer=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">#umas</a> <a title="umamusumeprettyderby" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/umamusumeprettyderby?refer=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">#umamusumeprettyderby</a> <a title="umamusume" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/umamusume?refer=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">#umamusume</a> <a title="nfl" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/nfl?refer=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">#nfl</a> </p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - its.a.shyday" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7556058369199573774?refer=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">♬ original sound - its.a.shyday</a> </section> </blockquote> </figure><p>At the time the Broncos were 2-2 and it was unclear how their season would go. Following that win, the Broncos proceeded to go 12-1 the rest of the regular season and make the AFC Championship Game, one game away from the Super Bowl.</p><p>“Why the Denver Broncos? Well... their mascot is a horse, which fits perfectly with the whole <em>Umamusume</em> vibe,” Shy said in an interview about his process. “It just felt natural to combine the two, and I think people have really enjoyed seeing it.”</p><p>Having first watched the anime in 2018, Shy said he first noticed a few other small accounts creating similar edits and realized there was a potential fanbase crossover. When the edits first started taking off his TikTok account had only around 200 followers, which has since ballooned to just under 10,000. He says that he thinks “at least 100” people have started watching the anime because of his edits.</p><p>“I hope it follows us into next season. I can’t wait,” he said.</p><p>Many NFL <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/08/arts/television/anime-sports-athletes-pokemon-naruto-dragon-ball.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>players are anime fans</u></a> and have embraced their inner otaku, bringing imagery from popular series and mangas to press conferences and on their gear. Teams like the Seattle Seahawks and <a href="https://www.chron.com/culture/article/texans-social-media-anime-21286614.php?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Houston Texans</u></a> have embraced anime fandom on their social media. The Los Angeles Rams <a href="https://www.therams.com/news/rams-one-piece-game-day-collaboration-sunday-december-3?ref=aftermath.site"><u>even did a gameday collaboration</u></a> with the anime <em>One Piece</em> in 2023.</p><p>With the advent of streaming services, more and more people in the United States are being exposed to anime, leading to a massive upheaval in what a stereotypical anime fan is like, said Sandra Annett, an Associate Professor in Film Studies at Wilfrid Laurier University.</p><p>“Anime and sports fandoms don't generally cross over, since anime is associated with ‘geeks’ and sports are associated with ‘jocks,’ to use the old high school categories,” she said. That being said, Arnett added that “this perception has been changing since 2020,” as more and more western media has embraced animated shows for all ages.&nbsp;</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/neon-gensis-evangelion-lehigh-valley-phantoms-phancon/"><div><p>A Hockey Team Recreated The Evangelion Intro For A Stadium Full Of Fans</p><p>Here’s how an American Hockey League team embraced anime—then went viral.</p><p><span>Nicole Carpenter</span></p></div></a></figure><p>Arnett said that another wrinkle that makes this crossover unique is how anime in Japan tends to be targeted towards a more conservative gender role, meaning that a show about horse girls racing may not have the same audience as a sports anime aimed at male viewers.&nbsp;</p><p>But in the United States, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2025/02/05/taylor-swift-nfl-fans/78050737007/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>nearly half of NFL viewers </u></a>are female, and the league claims that almost 70% of women and girls in the country are fans of the NFL. Female fans have been drivers of fandoms and fan edits across many genres in the U.S., especially when it comes to sports.</p><p>For <a href="https://www.instagram.com/waveharpcosplay/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Sammi, another cosplayer in Colorado</u></a>, being surrounded by the Broncos successes all her life and cosplaying since 2008 meant that creating her own <em>Umamusume</em>-inspired Broncos cosplay was a no brainer.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://matsustudios.com/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>MatsuStudios</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>Once the Broncos made the playoffs she created “UmaMiles,” a character based off the Broncos mascot if they were in the <em>Umamusume</em> universe. Thrifting an old Broncos jersey, Sammi, Grey and other cosplayers got together before the team’s first playoff game against the Buffalo Bills to take professional photos of their cosplays.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://matsustudios.com/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>MatsuStudios</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>“I think everyone needs a little bit of joy and laughter when things can be tough,” Sammi said about what this football season and budding community meant to her. “I hope to have more opportunities as UmaMiles, and maybe get to go to a game next season. I hope to meet more <em>Umamusume</em> cosplayers and continue this fun we have going!”</p><p>Grey says they usually cosplay as the character Manhattan Cafe from <em>Umamusume</em> with a Broncos twist, but the playoff run inspired her to create an original character based off the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mustang?ref=aftermath.site"><u>blue horse statue</u></a> outside Denver International Airport named “UmaBlucifer”.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was really fun getting to mix a piece of Colorado culture with the anime horse girl game. That’s probably part of what led me wanting to be part of the Uma x Broncos silliness,” they added.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://matsustudios.com/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>MatsuStudios</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>The Denver Broncos did not respond to requests for comments about the <em>Umamusume</em> craze, and it’s unclear if the team will capitalize on the new fanbase, something Grey says is “silly” to miss out on.&nbsp;</p><p>“<em>Umamusume</em> fans have raised <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/the-horse-girl-sickos-have-done-it-again-this-time-raising-usd800-000-for-a-farm-that-houses-some-of-umamusumes-real-life-horse-counterparts/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>hundreds of thousands of dollars</u></a> for retired race horses,” they said. “The <a href="https://aftermath.site/haru-urara-horse-death-umamusume/" rel="noreferrer">community</a> is worldwide.”</p><p>One NFL team, the Seattle Seahawks, was brave enough to acknowledge the <em>Umamusume</em> fandom on its team page, even if they were not the franchise driving the trend. Following their divisional round win over the San Francisco 49ers, the team <a href="https://x.com/Seahawks/status/2012742012383203416?ref=aftermath.site"><u>posted on X</u></a> an <em>Umamusume</em> meme about their victory. Unlike the Broncos, however, the Seahawks will be playing in the upcoming Super Bowl, hoping to be the ones crossing the finish line in the race for an NFL championship.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/umamusume-horse-expert-interview/"><div><p>Video Game Horse Expert On Umamusume: ‘I Have Supremely Mixed Feelings’ - Aftermath</p><p>The video game industry’s premiere horse game consultant, Alice Ruppert, finds herself more bemused than amused by Umamusume.</p><p><span>Aftermath</span><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure>

<p>Punch up, super star!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>After being announced for Switch 2 way back in May 2025, SEGA has today revealed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/virtua-fighter-5-r-e-v-o-world-stage">Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage</a> will mark the series' long-awaited debut on a Nintendo system on <strong>26th March</strong>.</p>
<p>For those who have missed the details up to this point, this Switch 2 release features full cross-play, so you can battle it out with pals on other consoles as well as rollback netcode support, balance updates, training tweaks, <em>and</em> new moves and combos to slip into your fighting style.</p>
<p>It serves as a pretty beefy upgrade to the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/virtua_fighter_5">original 2007 game</a>, with the drastically improved visuals showing just how far we've come in the last... 20 years *<em>gulp</em>* R.E.V.O. launched on PS5, Steam and Xbox Platforms back in October 2025, where it went on to pick up some pretty strong reviews — it currently sits at a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/virtua-fighter-5-revo-world-stage/">Metascore</a> of 78 based on 15 critic reviews.</p>
<p>If this all sounds very much up your street, the game's Open Beta Test kicks off on 18th February, designed to test "network servers and cross-play performance for the game with the other available platforms," says SEGA. You'll need a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to get involved, obviously, but it'll be a good chance to see what the game's all about.</p>

<p>If you're already certain that you're going pick it up, however, then you'll be pleased to hear that pre-orders open <em>today</em>! You can pick up the standard digital edition for <strong>$19.99</strong>, or the digital 30th Anniversary Edition for <strong>$49.99</strong>, which includes all kinds of bonuses like the Legendary and Yakuza DLC packs, the swimsuit costume set, pre-production artwork and more. As with the majority of Sega's Switch 2 output, the physical version is a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-release"><strong>Game-Key Card</strong></a>.</p>
<p>A physical release of the 30th Anniversary Edition is also available for <strong>$49.99</strong>, including all of the gubbins outlined above <em>and</em> with a double-sided poster to boot.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reports-a-9-overall-drop-in-xbox-revenue-for-q2-fy26-hardware-down-32/</link>
            <guid>1419739</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> has <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q2/press-release-webcast">published its latest financial report</a> for the company's second quarter of its 2026 fiscal year, and while the overall company revenue increased by <strong>17%</strong> to a whopping <strong>$81.3 billion</strong>, that increase was driven by its cloud and AI services. Its games division, however, saw a <strong>9% overall drop</strong> compared to last year, bringing in <strong>$623 million</strong> in revenue.</p>



<p>The biggest drop on the Xbox side came from its hardware, which saw a <strong>32% drop in revenue</strong> compared to last year. This marks the second straight quarter where hardware revenue specifically has dropped to such a degree, after its first quarter report listed a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-revenues-see-113-million-decline-amid-hardware-sales-drop-and-limited-gaming-content-and-services-growth/">29% drop in hardware revenue</a></strong>.</p>



<p>It's altogether a sizable, but unsurprising dip, considering the fact that the <strong>Xbox Series X/S</strong> consoles <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-did-so-badly-on-us-black-friday-sales-it-was-beaten-by-a-console-youve-never-heard-of">sold less than a non-big three, family and kid-dedicated console called the <strong>Nex Playground</strong></a> over Black Friday. It's also not a surprise when you remember that Microsoft raised the price on the Series X/S consoles multiple times last year.</p>



<p>Once with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">global price increase that hit the <strong>United States</strong> the hardest</a>, and then again four months later with <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">a price increase that only affected the United States</a>. Pricing your customers out of wanting to buy your console is one way to sell less hardware, and that's before we even get to the other major factor here: you don't need an Xbox to play Xbox games.</p>



<p>Speaking of those games, despite first-party Xbox titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-best-selling-game-playstation-5/"><strong>Forza Horizon 5</strong> selling like hotcakes when it arrived on <strong>PlayStation</strong></a>, revenue from Xbox content and services, which includes its <strong>Xbox Game Pass </strong>subscription, was also down compared to last year, with a <strong>5% drop in revenue</strong>. A step back from its first quarter results, which did record a revenue increase, albeit by only 1%. </p>



<p>That said, the drop is a particularly damning stat when you consider that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/"><strong>major price spike</strong> that Game Pass saw last year</a> was meant to ultimately drive more revenue from the service, even if it wasn't growing in users. Now, while we can't say for certain that Game Pass users have also taken a dive, since Microsoft hasn't presented those figures, but to see services and software drop after last quarter does add fuel to the arguments that <a href="https://wccftech.com/rising-prices-and-a-sense-of-broken-trust-will-likely-have-lasting-consequences-for-the-wider-xbox-brand-says-analyst/">Microsoft has <strong>lost the trust of players</strong></a>, and that last year's price spikes on hardware and services <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-subscription-cancel-page-overwhelmed-after-game-pass-price-hike/">had a negative impact at the time</a>, and could have a lasting impact that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-founder-game-pass-price-hike-laura-fryer/">ultimately drives users further away from the platform</a>.   </p>



<p>In an attempt to be optimistic about the overall drop in revenue in its gaming division, Microsoft chief executive officer <strong>Satya Nadella</strong> told investors, "<em>In gaming, we are committed to delivering great games across Xbox, PC, cloud, and every other device. And we saw record PC players, and paid streaming hours on Xbox</em>."</p>



<p>Later in the call with investors, chief financial officer <strong>Amy Hood</strong> said the company expects "<em>revenue to decline in the mid-single digits</em>" compared to the previous year, though she says that's only due to last year benefiting "<em>from strong content performance, partially offset by growth in Xbox Game Pass</em>." Meanwhile, hardware revenue is expected to continue falling.</p>

<p>Of course, <em>Phasmophobia </em>also has plenty of events planned throughout 2026, including a brand new one-time event and the return of old favorites like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-cursed-hollow-event" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="043f6095-0d10-420d-8bec-e56dd003d4b3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Cursed Hollow</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-crimson-eye-update" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d3faae98-97a0-41cc-b045-74499b5ceb42" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Crimson Eye</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-winters-jest-event-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dff99f7f-c6cc-4e9a-976a-8a699b4b7222" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Winter's Jest</a>.</p><p><em>Phasmophobia </em>director Daniel Knight says he's hoping that the 1.0 release of <em>Phasmophobia</em>, which still doesn't have a date attached to it, will "feel as fresh and exciting as when the game first launched back in 2020". We can but hope.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Phasmophobia</em>, it's a multiplayer-focused ghost-hunting game in which your goal is to enter haunted locations and document the phenomena that can be found within.</p><p>Each ghost type has a different method of identification attached to it, so you'll have to enter the location, discover what you're dealing with it, and grab evidence along the way.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has emerged from the giant Easter egg in which he makes games to “debunk a few myths and false assumptions” about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a>, his forthcoming sticky-fingered life sim. The good news is that he’s been “very productive” lately, though he admits that he “shouldn’t have announced the game so early”, which suggests we’ve a ways to go yet before the first proper Haunted Chocolatier trailer or info blowout.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Myth and/or false assumption number one is that Barone will ultimately abandon Haunted Chocolatier and turn the game into a chunky update for Stardew Valley - much like a patisserie chef tipping the scorched remains of a failed crème brûlée all over an award-winning dark forest gateau.
</p>
<p>
“First, I am not going to abandon Haunted Chocolatier,” Barone retorts in <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2026/01/28/update-im-still-working-like-always/">a new blog post</a>. “But even if I did, I am not going to add it to Stardew Valley. Stardew Valley and Haunted Chocolatier are separate games. It doesn’t even make sense from a technical perspective, as Haunted Chocolatier is written from scratch, it’s not the same ‘engine’ as Stardew Valley. You can’t just copy and paste Haunted Chocolatier into Stardew Valley.”
</p>
<p>
(Full clarification in the interests of public health and culinary decency: you can’t reuse spoiled crème brûlée as a dark forest gateau topping either. You will only injure your digestive system and bring shame upon your family.)
</p>
<p>
The second myth Barone wishes to rebut is that Stardew Valley updates are sneaky testing grounds for Haunted Chocolatier features. “When working on Stardew Valley, I’m not thinking about Haunted Chocolatier, and vice versa,” he clarifies. “I wouldn’t ‘test something out’ in Stardew Valley because that would be unfair to Stardew Valley, and also I don’t want to spoil ideas for Haunted Chocolatier by adding them first to Stardew Valley. Also, Stardew Valley is a different game, so you can’t really ‘test something’ for Haunted Chocolatier in it in an accurate way.”
</p><p>
Myth No. 3 is that Barone is making another Stardew Valley update because he’s “burnt out on Haunted Chocolatier”. Nay, sirrah, you do but jest! Rest assured that Barone is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/concernedape-assures-that-stardew-valley-update-17-wont-delay-haunted-chocolatier-much-it-might-even-release-first">making another Stardew Valley update</a> simply because “it’s a very popular game with a large, ever-growing playerbase, and I still have additional ideas for how to improve it.” 
</p>
<p>
Also, he didn’t say it’s not coming out until 2030, whatever you may have read on some other lousy videogame website operated by FOOLS. “I was asked in 2025 if it would come out within the next five years, and I said ‘I hope so’,” Barone writes in closing. “This is very different than saying ‘it’s coming out in 2030’. The bottom line is, I don’t want to give a release date. The game will come out when it’s done.”
</p>
<p>
I hope you’ve all learned a valuable lesson here about rumour and speculation. Remember that videogames, much like crème brûlées, benefit from extended time in the oven and, dare I say, a degree of emotional detachment. I’m trying to figure out the videogame equivalent for blowtorching the crust. Day-one hotfixing, I guess?

            <guid>1419724</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Working out with your favorite tunes in the background can really give you that boost of energy you need to get moving. If you’re tired of your current buds or over-ear headphones falling off when things get a bit intense, you need an open-ear option that’s designed specifically for workouts.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6941/">Shokz makes some of the best options on the market, and you can grab its OpenMove headphones at a 38% discount at Amazon today.</a> This offer brings the price of this $80 option to just $50, saving you $30. All color options, including grey, blue, and pink, are discounted, so you can pick the one that suits your aesthetics the best. One thing to note here is that the deal is a limited-time one, so we’re not expecting it to last long. Grab it now to avoid paying the full price later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6941/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Secure Fit</h2>
<p>Open-ear bone conduction headphones feature a wraparound headband and sit outside the ear canal. These rest on your cheekbones just in front of the ears, and transmit sound through vibration to your inner ear directly. Your ear canal stays open to keep you aware of your surroundings, while the lightweight frame makes it easy to have the headphones on for longer periods.</p>
<p>The OpenMove headphones offer a secure fit with the wraparound titanium frame. Whether you’re taking a walk around the town or just running some early morning errands, these stay in place. They’re also ultralight at just 29g, which ensures all-day comfort. As for the performance, Shokz has packed OpenMove with a patented 7th-generation bone conduction technology that pushes deep dynamic stereo sound for all your favorite tracks. Everything from LoFi music to energy-packed songs and even podcasts comes through clearly.</p>



<p>There are dual noise-cancelling microphones that eliminate external noise while isolating yours. The result? Clear phone and video calls, even when you’re in a packed subway or a busy cafe. You won’t have to constantly repeat yourself or apologize for the background noise. Additionally, the open design keeps you aware of what’s happening around without having to take the headphones off completely.</p>
<p>Sweaty workout sessions or light rain won’t be a problem either, thanks to OpenMove’s IP55 rating. Battery-wise, a single charge offers up to 6 hours of continuous listening. It’s not massive, but it’s still enough to support you through daily workouts, runs, and walks. Recharging is made easy with the included USB-C cable, which juices them back up in no time.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking to treat yourself to open-ear headphones that not just offer a stable fit but also deliver powerful sound, the Shokz OpenMove sport headphones are an excellent option to consider. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6941/">On a regular day, you’d pay around $80 for these, but you can pick one today for just $50.</a> Again, the offer won’t be around forever. It’s best to place your orders before it’s too late!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/tomodachi-life-gay-nonbinary-nintendo-switch-2000664147</link>
            <guid>1419721</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Since the wacky life sim series kicked off in 2009, Nintendo’s </span><i><span>Tomodachi Life</span></i><span> has been like a big, beloved dollhouse where players watch their Miis get into the weirdest relationships possible. There’s just been one caveat: until today, Miis have never been allowed to be gay.</span></p> <p><span>Just seconds into Thursday’s </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_0kl1WiSPg"><i><span>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream </span></i><span>Direct</span></a><span>, Nintendo confirmed that players will finally be able to make their Miis queer through a surprisingly inclusive settings menu that occurs during the usual Mii creation process. Players can pick each Mii’s “dating preferences,” allowing them to date and marry multiple genders (or none at all).</span></p>

 <p><span>Possibly more impressively was the game’s use of the word “nonbinary” as a third gender option, which comes as a surprise for fans—in recent Nintendo games like </span><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span>, the developer has evaded the topic by including two ambiguous options called “styles” that are still tied to traditional perceptions of gender. Adding the term, and an entire third gender option, is a </span><i><span>massive </span></i><span>step forward for the developer.</span></p> <p><span>In 2014’s </span><i><span>Tomodachi Life</span></i><span>, Miis were forced to be heterosexual and be solely male or female, so queer players resorted to using various mods. Another common workaround for the marriage issue, and my personal favorite, was setting one Mii up as the other gender and just ignoring the game’s pronouns (and annoying little comments on them disliking any gendered clothes they wore).&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000664149" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000664149"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000664149">Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Nintendo’s decision to leave gay marriage out of </span><i><span>Tomodachi Life</span></i><span>, the first game in the series to be released outside of Japan, drew quite a bit of criticism. In 2014, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fighting-for-gay-marriage-in-a-nintendo-game-1572026032"><span>fans petitioned for Nintendo to add gay marriage</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-responds-terribly-to-gay-marriage-petition-1572973952"><span>Nintendo responded pretty harshly</span></a><span>. At one point, there was even </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/rumor-nintendo-ending-gay-marriage-bug-in-popular-game-504266729"><span>a rumored bug</span></a><span> that allowed gay marriage, and a strange translation of some Japanese patch notes made fans believe Nintendo had cruelly patched it out.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Just a few days after its first statement, however, Nintendo circled back with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-apologizes-for-not-putting-gay-marriage-in-tom-1574185262"><span>a slightly more empathetic promise</span></a><span>: “We pledge that if we create a next installment in the Tomodachi series, we will strive to design a game-play experience from the ground up that is more inclusive, and better represents all players.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Players have anticipated the addition of gay marriage to the game since then, so it wasn’t exactly a surprise. Still, after nearly 12 years of anticipation, it’s just a huge relief that we got some confirmation today (with the added bonus of a nonbinary option, which nobody seemed to expect). I’m not the only person who’s relieved after today’s announcement—the livestream’s comments were flooded with gay flag emojis, and a quick glance in the game’s Subreddit makes it pretty clear that </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tomodachilife/comments/1qq9fnw/we_wonnnnnn/"><span>everyone else is delighted</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>I personally cannot </span><i><span>wait </span></i><span>to have a more diverse island, and I’m honestly thrilled to make my poor little Miis get into some even messier relationships when </span><i><span>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</span></i><span> releases on April 16.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Esports Nations Cup Reveals Insane $45 Million Commitment to Competitors]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/esports-nations-cup-insane-45-million-commitment/</link>
            <guid>1419715</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Esports World Cup Foundation has today unveiled a monumental $45 million commitment to the players, teams, and organizations participating in the upcoming Esports Nations Cup. The event is set to unravel in Riyadh in November, and it’s in addition to the staggering <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/esports-world-cup-2026-prize-pool-75-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$75 million Esports World Cup</a>, which begins in July.</p>



<p>While the Esports World Cup is centered around traditional organizations fielding teams across multiple games, the Esports Nations Cup is a country-based competition circuit that encourages national pride, amongst other things.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-ewcf-has-pledged-120-million-to-esports">The EWCF Has Pledged $120 Million to Esports</h2>



<p>The headline here is that the Esports World Cup Foundation, backed by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, has pledged an eye-watering $120 million to the esports space this year alone.</p>



<p>From November 2 to November 29, a host of countries will send their squads to Riyadh to compete across a slew of games, fighting for prize pools, recognition, and geographical bragging rights. In a press release, the $45 million pledge was broken down accordingly:</p>



<ul>
<li>$20 million in prize money, spread across 16 titles</li>



<li>$5 million in Club incentives for clubs that release and enable their professional players to participate in the ENC</li>



<li>$20 million through the ENC Development Fund, supporting partners with logistics, travel, marketing, and growth</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s hard to see a downside to this venture, as $20 million being set aside to help organizations get to this global stage is admirable, if nothing else.</p>



<p>In the release, the CEO of the EWCF, Ralf Reichert, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>National teams bring a powerful new layer to esports, one that is accessible, intuitive, and rooted in identity and pride. Clubs are the cultural backbone of esports. Nation-based competition expands the stage, creates new rivalries, and gives more fans a reason to care from day one. </p>



<p>Our prize model is designed to keep competition fair and sustainable, rewarding performance while supporting the long-term development of players, Clubs, and national programs.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Thus far, the EWCF has announced only a few titles out of the 16 coming to the Esports Nations Cup:</p>



<ul>
<li>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</li>



<li>Trackmania</li>



<li>Dota 2</li>
</ul>



<p>More games will be announced in the coming days.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty’s iconic map has made its way into Hytale thanks to the hardworking modders. </p>



<p>Hytale is still in early access; however, modders have been hard at work to make the experience as enjoyable as possible. Over the past few days, we have seen the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-is-coming-to-hytale-through-mods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-minecraft-crossplay-mod-has-been-created/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minecraft crossplay</a>, and more make it to the title. Now, Activision’s iconic FPS franchise has joined the fray as well. </p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-now-has-call-of-duty-s-hijacked-and-cod-like-zombies-mod">Hytale Now Has Call of Duty’s Hijacked and Cod-Like Zombies Mod</h2>



<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/pc-gaming/hytale-modders-have-recreated-call-of-duty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WindowsCentral</a>, Call of Duty mods have now been integrated into Hytale. One modder has successfully added maps, including Hijacked from Black Ops 2, among others. Additionally, this mod transforms Hytale into a genuine first-person shooter, allowing players to engage in intense deathmatches with bullets flying from every direction. It also tracks kills and deaths, making the experience as close to a traditional first-person shooter as possible.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Moreover, there is a <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/cod-like-zombies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">COD-like Zombies</a> mod that will add “a simple, configurable Zombies’ waves game mode.” The mod will feature round-based waves, automatic round progression, intermission delay &amp; chat announcements, configurable spawn points, proximity-based zombie spawning, and multiple zombie variants. Which other game do you want to see modded in Hytale next? </p>

Previous updates including Chronicle and our upcoming Player Character update have all been steps in fulfilling our vision, and we hope the 1.0 launch will feel as fresh and exciting as when the game first launched back in 2020.”</p><p>Here are the details:</p><blockquote><p>2026 will bring a number of major updates to the game, kicking off with the player character update landing in the first quarter.

        <p>Two map reworks will also be on the way as Tanglewood and 13  Willow Street  will both be getting revamped. Whilst Tanglewood’s map layout will remain similar to the original, players can expect a range of new interactions, a few small layout changes and more. For those with a keen eye, there’s also a mystery lurking in the shadows of 6 Tanglewood Drive waiting to be uncovered.</p><p>That’s not all, as there will be plenty more spooktacular surprises in store. A new map and one time event is also set to roll out, alongside the return of fan favourite seasonal events with Cursed Hollow, Crimson Eye and Winter’s Jest all returning for the year.</p></blockquote><p><em>Phasmophobia</em> is currently in Early Access for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,286 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> with <a title="Platforms > PS VR2 [273 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps-vr2">PlayStation VR2</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,640 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [25,368 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/phasmophobia-2026-roadmap-announced]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Nintendo dove deep this morning on its upcoming simulation game, Tomodachi Life: Living The Dream. The Switch game (notably not Switch 2, though Nintendo reminds that you can play it on Switch 2) is a sequel to the 3DS game Tomodachi Life that released in North America in 2014 for 3DS. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/tomodachi_life/b/3ds/archive/2014/06/06/tomodachi-life-review.aspx">You can read our review of that game here</a>. Tomodachi Life: Living The Dream releases April 16.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K_0kl1WiSPg"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K_0kl1WiSPg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In the game you create Miis and watch them live out their lives on Yoomian Island as you interact with them and create scenarios for the characters to meet and interact. The original game was renowned for being bizarre, and though Living the Dream's reveal teased some of that strangeness, today's presentation focused on the more typical parts of the game.</p><p>You create the characters using familiar Mii creation tools and can dictate their gender (male, female, or nonbinary) as well as their dating preferences. Unlike previous Mii creation tools, you can now create elements like face paint, and that customization seems to extend to nearly every facet of the game. You can design the exteriors of buildings, the ground, clothing, and even draw pets for the Miis to have. The presentation showed one Mii walking with a hand drawn dog.</p><p>Once you have Miis you can select elements of their personalities, gift them quirks like the animations they use to eat, and even dictate familiar phrases they will use. You can also play god and place your Miis next to each other to force them to interact and hopefully become friends. You can even choose what they talk about by typing in topics, which an automated, robotic voice will dictate. You can also push characters to become roommates with up to eight characters being able to live together in one large house.</p><p>You can also witness elaborate romantic scenarios. Miis can develop crushes on each other, profess their love, and even be turned down. A scenario in the presentation showed one character being confronted by multiple suitors and having to choose. The way the game works is the Miis are meant to be characters with their own agency so even though you choose elements like where they go and how they do something, like profess their love to their crush, it will be up to the characters to make the final decisions.</p><p>At the end of the presentation, Nintendo showcased a wedding scene, and even showed a baby crawling on the ground. It's unclear if those elements will just be performative visual moments, or if there will be opportunities to create families that birth children who grow up to become their own Miis. The game happens in real time (meaning your Miis will be living their lives even when you're not playing), so it remains to be seen how that part of the game will work.</p><p>Alongside all the character interactions, Nintendo also showed off how much control you have over the design of the island. It feels very Animal Crossing in this way. Different stores sell food, clothing, offer photo gallery opportunities, there is a news station that gives frequent updates, and you can also build and relocate everything on the island, and even change the land mass.</p><p>In a complimentary way, it looks like Nintendo is trying to merge elements of The Sims (creating and watching characters live out their lives) and Animal Crossing (living on and designing an island while witness to interpersonal character interactions). We will see if the game can live up to the reputation of either of those franchises when it releases on April 16.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/29/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-teases-weddings-and-babies-releases-in-april]]></content:encoded>

<p>Stellar job, Frasers Group</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="e149f2fb65f93"><a title="GAME" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e149f2fb65f93/game.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>UK retailer GAME has reportedly filed a notice of intention to appoint administrators in a clear sign that the firm is once again on the brink of collapse.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-28/frasers-owned-game-retail-signals-it-s-on-the-brink-of-collapse">Bloomberg</a> and <a href="https://www.thebusinessdesk.com/eastmidlands/news/2106649-frasers-owned-gaming-chain-hits-pause-and-alerts-administrators">The Business Desk</a>, GAME – which is owned by Frasers Group – has appointed law firm RPC to oversee the 10-day protection period from creditor action while it considers any potential next steps. What those steps might be at this stage is unclear.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn't the first time GAME has fallen into administration – it happened before back in 2012, resulting in the closure of 277 stores in the UK and 2,104 job losses. You might remember shortly before this that several major game publishers refused to provide stock for GAME, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/mass_effect_3">Mass Effect 3</a> being a particularly high-profile release that simply wasn't available at the retailer.</p>
<p>Private equity firm OpCapita purchased GAME one week after it fell into administration, subsequently selling the business to Frasers Group in 2019. Since then, standalone stores across the country have been closing down in favour of concession stores within Sports Direct. Additionally, GAME no longer stocks pre-owned games, and its reward scheme has gone the way of the Dodo.</p>
<p>To cap it off, the Basingstoke Head Office fully closed down in 2025.</p>
<p>We'll keep an eye on how things pan out with GAME over the coming days and weeks, but we're not wholly convinced anybody is going to be keen on saving it this time around. Nothing would thrill us more than to see GAME pulled from the brink and transformed into a thriving specialised retailer that stocks unique, bespoke physical games. But that's probably wishful thinking at this stage.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Moon Beast Productions, a studio founded by a group of veterans from the <em>Diablo </em>series, has announced its inaugural project <em>Darkhaven</em>, a "next-generation action RPG" that promises to offer a dynamic and reactive world.</p><p>As you'd probably expect from folks who've worked on <em>Diablo</em>, <em>Darkhaven </em>is quite similar to Blizzard's ARPG series. Moon Beast says the game "returns to the genre's roots while pushing it forward", which is a pretty ambitious goal.</p><p>According to Moon Beast, <em>Darkhaven </em>will accommodate "solo play, co-operative adventures, and high-stakes PvP-enabled realms", and will be designed around all three of them. It's safe to say this one is reaching for the moon, as it were.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Darkhaven </em>isn't shy about its similarities to <em>Diablo</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The world of <em>Darkhaven </em>will apparently be "procedurally generated, fully dynamic, and persistent", meaning that you'll be able to deform terrain and build upon it if you want to.</p><p>Moon Beast is promising seasons that change, weather that "alters combat and traversal", and world-altering events that leave "permanent scars" upon the world. We will, of course, have to wait and see just how substantial those promises are.</p><p>In combat terms, <em>Darkhaven </em>is perhaps promising a more holistic experience than <em>Diablo </em>or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/path-of-exile-2-hands-off-preview-ranger" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ae9db8ce-ce51-4048-811d-7be0b0523331" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">other descendants like <em>Path of Exile</em></a>. Since you can "jump, climb, swim, dash, and traverse the world freely", combat takes on an extra dimension "rarely seen in the genre", Moon Beast says.</p><p>Perhaps most intriguingly, Moon Beast says <em>Darkhaven </em>will reject what it calls the "incrementalism common in many modern titles" in favor of a loot system that's "bold [and] expressive", with each item being "capable of redefining builds rather than merely optimizing them".</p>
<p>At the very least, <em>Darkhaven </em>has a solid pedigree behind it. Moon Beast's staffers include the likes of <em>Diablo II </em>programmer Peter Hu and lead artist Philip Shenk, as well as Erich Schaefer, a designer on both <em>Diablo II </em>and its predecessor.</p><p>Right now, <em>Darkhaven </em>doesn't have a release date, but the devs are planning to <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moonbeastproductions/darkhaven-an-action-rpg-with-dynamic-worlds" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">launch a Kickstarter campaign</a> soon to help them bring the project into Early Access. While you wait, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3571870/Darkhaven/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">wishlist the game on Steam</a> if you want to keep up with its progress.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

The new full-size mechanical keyboard with a Stream Deck fused to its side is the result of a <em>lot </em>of things coming together over the years. Corsair’s gaming business is more refined than ever, and Stream Deck’s wide ecosystem of plug-ins makes the dedicated hardware useful to just about anyone, even if they have little interest in streaming. The fusion makes sense.</p><p>The possibilities with a Stream Deck were already vast, and the Galleon makes it easier to feel like a power user. I can turn my Philips Hue lights on and off throughout my apartment with one of its dials, and I can pause, skip, and fave tracks in YouTube Music with its buttons. I can launch <em>The Verge</em>, declutter a mess of windows on my screen into a tidy grid, and so much more with a single button press — all without taking my hands off the keyboard.</p><p>Anyway, here’s a quick history lesson on how we got here: The Galleon is the result of acquisitions and another company’s misfortune. After Corsair bought Elgato in 2018, it acquired a majority stake in iDisplay, the company that already produced tiny screens for the Stream Deck. And it’s possible none of this would have happened if iDisplay hadn’t been asked years earlier to supply OLED screens for each key of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/features/24191410/elgato-stream-deck-art-lebedev-optimus-maximus-keyboard-retrospective">Art Lebedev’s groundbreaking, yet ultimately flawed, Optimus Maximus</a> keyboard, which sold for $1,490 at launch in 2008. So here we are.</p><p>The Galleon is reasonably priced at $350. Yes, you can pay about $60 for a Deck Mini and then buy a very good keyboard; perhaps both will cost you less than $350. But it’s fun to use a product that’s both a good, polished keyboard and a great bundle of customizable buttons and dials.</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODY5NTYx"><p><span>$<!-- -->350</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Fused, single-cable design looks great.</li><li>It’s a good keyboard attached to the best Stream Deck.</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>It’s pricier than just buying a Stream Deck and a good keyboard.</li><li>Keyboard and Stream Deck use different software. </li><li>I wish it was modular.</li></ul></div></div></div><p>The Stream Deck integration is the big draw with the Galleon. It has 12 buttons, a non-touch screen, and two rotary dials, all of which can be customized. The LCD screen behind the keys is Elgato’s highest-resolution screen in a Stream Deck so far (it’s a 5-inch 720 x 1280 IPS display). You can drag and drop commands and plug-ins through the Stream Deck app, giving you easy access to day-to-day niceties, like commonly used emoji to use during video calls, as well as more powerful integrations.</p><p>Elgato developed official Stream Deck plug-ins for several popular services, including Philips Hue, Apple Mail, Slack, Zoom, Photoshop, YouTube, Spotify, and more. There’s a vibrant community of developers who submit their own plug-ins as well. The rabbit hole goes really deep, not just for plug-ins, but for the customizable app icons you can assign to each button, and the backgrounds you can use on the larger screen. Some of them are real time-savers, like this <a href="https://marketplace.elgato.com/product/helldivers-2-stratagem-0c648333-25a0-403f-9894-22c5f6b1ff89"><em>Helldivers 2</em> profile</a> that lets you execute Stratagems with the push of a button, as opposed to frantically hammering directional keys while enemies are encroaching.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</strong><span><cite>Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>The keyboard attached to the Stream Deck is good, too, even if it’s not the center of attention here. It looks slick and subdued, with per-key RGB LEDs that can be configured in Corsair’s browser-based Web Hub app. You don’t need to use the software, but you need the Stream Deck app to get the most out of the buttons and dials. The chassis has an aluminum housing, and a large wrist pad can be attached magnetically near its bottom keys. The Galleon connects to your PC (or game console — it officially supports Xbox and PlayStation) with a single USB-C-to-A cable. If you have an extra accessory to connect, you can plug the second included USB-C-to-A cable into your PC for data or charging passthrough. Then, attach your gadget to the USB-C port.</p><p>The design isn’t that different from <a href="https://go.corsair.com/c/482924/490888/8513?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.corsair.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fc%2Fkeyboards%2Fvanguard-gaming-keyboards" rel="sponsored">Corsair’s Vanguard series of keyboards</a>. The Galleon includes gasket mounting and multiple layers of dampening. Typing sounds and feels satisfying and bouncy, yet controlled. Its MLX Pulse switches have a pronounced “thock” sound and don’t require much force to actuate. One of the few missed opportunities is making the Stream Deck modular, so that left-handed typists can easily access its buttons and knobs. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22996700/mountain-everest-max-keyboard-review-gaming">Mountain Everest Max</a> did this years ago, and it’s all the more puzzling given Corsair hired that company’s founder, Tobias Brinkmann, as the VP of its gaming division responsible for building this very keyboard. Corsair’s marketing manager Andrew Williams shared with <em>The Verge</em> that it’s because development on the Galleon had already begun by the time Brinkmann was hired, and followed the statement with “Who knows? Maybe we will iterate on this. :)”</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</strong><span><figcaption>The Galleon has two USB-C inputs, one of which enables a passthrough port for data or charging.</figcaption> <cite>Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>Coming off of recently testing the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/821355/asus-falcata-review-hall-effect-switches-split-ergo-gaming-keyboard">Asus Falcata keyboard</a>, which uses the longer-lasting, more customizable Hall effect switches that are both quieter and significantly faster to actuate (too fast for me until I set actuation point thresholds), the MLX Pulse feels more like what I’m used to typing on with my Kinesis Freestyle Edge RGB split ergonomic keyboard. If you have a preferred switch, you aren’t locked to using Corsair’s. The Galleon supports hot swapping switches, so long as it’s a 3-pin or 5-pin switch. A tool is included to make it easy to deconstruct each switch down to the bottommost layer covering the PCB.</p><p>I’ll only ever scratch the surface of what’s possible with the Stream Deck. The device started out as a companion for streamers on Twitch, so there’s a bevy of resources — ready-made drop-in assets to make your stream look more professional, some for free, some for a fee — from Elgato and other developers. For just being a set of buttons and knobs, the possibilities with this mature cross-platform ecosystem are vast, and those who really tap into it will get a lot out of the Galleon.</p><p>Even for those who use the Stream Deck more casually, $350 for the convenience of a two-in-one product is not a terrible price. It’s a luxury I don’t think is worth upgrading to if you’re already happy with your keyboard or your current Stream Deck. If you need one of the ingredients, or both, this all-in-one, single-cable gadget is just a really cool thing.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/869542/corsair-galleon-stream-deck-gaming-keyboard-review]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A group of tinkerers working on reviving Bioware's Anthem via private servers following its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/biowares-anthem-will-finally-shut-down-in-early-2026-just-shy-of-its-seventh-birthday">shutdown</a> earlier this month have now offered more insight into how that project's going so far. While a video <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anthem-private-server-experimentations-underway-as-the-shooters-subreddit-mods-rethink-retirement-plans">posted last week</a> got hopes up that a return could be relatively imminient, the group say there's plenty of work to be done yet, with the main potential stubling block being efforts to figure out the quirks of EA's Frostbite engine.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This group working on trying to get Anthem back online with private servers, likely in a similar fashion to the fan-revived version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fan-made-the-crew-revival-gets-a-release-date-a-year-and-a-bit-on-from-the-ubisoft-racers-controversial-shutdown">released last year</a>, have chatted to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/why-reviving-the-shuttered-anthem-is-turning-out-tougher-than-expected/">Ars Technica</a> about the current progress. The short version is that while last week's video of a basic private server setup running was a milestone, this group working out of a Discord server called The Fort’s Forge still face a big hurdle that they reckon'll dicate how the project plays out.</p>
<p>According to a team member with the handle Ness199X, the group have so far managed to break the services that make Anthem tick into three parts. There's EA’s Blaze server to handle basic player authentication, a web server called Bioware Online Services which tracks things like inventories and quest progression, and finally the Frostbite multiplayer engine which handles loading levels and tracking players in them. The video showed off "quick and dirty" efforts to emulate the first two.</p>
<p>How to handle getting the Frostbite element and its level data to work in fashion that doesn't rely on the servers EA have shut down is something the group are "exploring", but say has been complicated by Anthem sometimes behaving in quirky ways that are different to other Frostbite games. "For example, when we try to load most maps, no NPCs spawn, but in some maps they do," Ness199X explained. "And we have yet to determine why." They reckon the “fairly extensive amount of player data the game keeps as part of its online RPG nature" might be part of this, but at this point aren't "entirely sure how deep the differences go, other than that the engine didn’t behave how we expected it to."</p><p>As a result of that uncertainty, whether the group will be able to pull on all the Frostbite threads they'd ideally want to for a revived Anthem and how long that'll take remain up in the air. Ness199X said they're currently about 75% sure that'll be doable, and it'll dictate whether reviving the game takes "months, or less even, depending on motivation" or ends up with "the amount of work increases fairly exponentially" to the point the group might not be motivated to slog through it.</p>
<p>Either way, the group are still keen to emphasise that it's early days yet, so not to expect they'll definitely have more progress to show off or put out in short order.</p>

            <p>Do you miss the good old days of Diablo, before Blizzard’s hellish clickfest megamorphed into a live service Beezelbub owned and operated by stinky uncle Microsoft? Be upstanding, perhaps, for Darkhaven – a new action RPG from a studio founded by a trio of Diablo 1 and Diablo 2 veterans, who have some questionable notions about weaponising volcanos.</p>
<p>Said veterans are Diablo 2 lead character artist Philip Shenk, Diablo 2 programmer/designer/lead Peter Hu, and the original Diablo’s senior designer, art director, and story writer Erich Schaefer. So, <em>actual</em> veterans then, rather than people who sneezed in the presence of some Sanctuary concept art while delivering pizza to Blizzard North, back in the 90s.</p><!--more-->

<p>Darkhaven is an isometric (whatever that currently means) dark fantasy affair set in a world of fallen empires, overgrown ruins, and supernatural predators. Some kind of terrible evil is on the up and up, and it’s your job as Chosen One (or Chosen Several, if you’re playing co-op) to bop it on the hooter.</p>
<p>If Darkhaven is channelling the auld Blizzard North energy, it also sounds somewhat like a 4am <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/noita">Noita</a> playthrough, in that the world is chaotic and modifiable. </p>
<p>“Designed for solo play, cooperative adventures, and high-stakes PvP-enabled realms, Darkhaven is set in a procedurally generated, fully dynamic, and persistent world,” explains a press release. “Terrain and structures are deformable and buildable, allowing players to dig through earth, tunnel through dungeon walls, drain lakes to uncover buried ruins, redirect lava flows to reshape battlefields, or rebuild shattered fortresses. Seasons change, weather alters combat and traversal, and world-altering events leave permanent scars. Every action contributes to a shared, evolving history.”</p>
<p>As Shenk summarises in the press release, “we’re building a world that remembers what you’ve done, bears the scars of your victories and failures, and tells stories that only your playthrough can create.” </p>
<p>It doesn’t sound like it’ll hinge quite as heavily on gear quality and progression as classique Diablo, either, let alone the wildly incontinent loot walrus that is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo IV</a>. Characters will be able to “jump, climb, swim, dash, and traverse the world freely, introducing a new layer of action and skill rarely seen in the genre”, with victory in combat “not just a function of stats, but of movement, timing, and terrain awareness”.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>“It’s not just about numbers fighting numbers anymore,” Schaefer comments in the press release. “It’s much more engaging. For me, it becomes more about skill, finding flow, and making smart decisions in the moment. I’ve never had more fun making and playing an ARPG.”</p><p>There is plenty of gear to acquire, but they’re apparently rejecting the “incrementalism” of certain modern ARPGs in favour of “bold, expressive loot – items that feel powerful, sometimes surprisingly so, and capable of redefining builds rather than merely optimizing them”, as the press release continues. Hu comments that “finding something powerful should be exciting and inspiring, not something that gets smoothed out into tiny percentage gains.”</p>
<p>All of which is very much speaking my language, as a serial incremental loot hater, with the caveat that they’re funding it via <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moonbeastproductions/darkhaven-an-action-rpg-with-dynamic-worlds">Kickstarter</a>, ahead of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3571870/Darkhaven/">a Steam early access release</a>. I am newly suspicious of crowd-funding, in the wake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/enormously-disappointing-darkest-dungeons-boardgame-port-is-dead-but-red-hook-are-giving-away-game-files-to-backers">the Darkest Dungeon boardgame bullshit</a>. Still, as Diablo successors go, this one has more of a pedigree than most.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-game-key-cards-size-nintend-2000664117</link>
            <guid>1419643</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-pokopia-game-key-card-2000642940">Game key cards</a> were one of the more deflating aspects of the Switch 2’s launch year. While digital downloads are now ubiquitous, some of Nintendo’s most devoted (and loudest) fans still prefer physical games for the purposes of collecting or preservation, or just because they look nice. A cartridge that doesn’t actually have the game on it just isn’t the same. Yet despite all the uproar over the issue, a new survey suggests people are buying game key cards anyway.</p> <p>Deku Deals, an aggregator of sales and discounts for physical games, shared some new data about its users that shows game key cards are selling just fine. “Of the 1,070 Deku Deals users who have added one or more third party physical releases to their collection, 735 of them own one or more Game-Key Card titles,” the site wrote in <a href="https://www.dekudeals.com/articles/are-switch-2-owners-buying-third-party-game-key-card-releases">a new blog post this week</a>. There’s even a pie chart to show the disparity.</p>

 <p>The site also listed the most popular Switch 2 games among its users. Six of them are game key cards (the bolded ones):</p> <ul> <li><em>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</em></li> <li><em><strong>Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster</strong></em></li> <li><em>Hades II</em></li> <li><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em></li> <li><em><strong>Star Wars Outlaws Gold Edition</strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut</strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Street Fighter 6 Years 1-2 Fighters Edition</strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Persona 3 Reload</strong></em></li> <li><em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</em></li> </ul> <p>Of course, it’s worth noting that the&nbsp;<em>majority</em> of Switch 2 physical games are actually game key cards. So if you’re someone who just buys a bunch of games in general, or are one of those hyper-fans who wants to own all of the Switch 2’s launch library, you’re going to end up with a bunch of game key cards by default. At the same time, the survey at least suggests that people who would buy physical in the first place are still opting for game key cards&nbsp;over just buying the game digitally from the eShop. That’s probably the sentiment that led Nintendo to launch game key cards in the first place.</p>

 <p>At launch, companies reportedly only had access to the 64GB card sizes for physical Switch 2 games. The extra expense is what steered so many to opting for game key cards instead. <em>Hades 2</em>, for example, is $50 for the Switch 2 cartridge but only $30 if you buy it in the eShop. Other companies have just eaten the loss on margins. That’s seemingly what CD Projekt Red did with<em> Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</em>.</p>

 <p>Fortunately, it sounds like that is no longer a restriction for companies moving forward. <em>R-Type Dimensions 3</em> publisher Inin Games accidentally leaked that more cartridge sizes had become available back in December before <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-dev-explains-why-its-ditching-game-key-cards-thanks-to-nintendo-2000654878">deleting its post on the subject</a>. Game key cards will still be necessary for some games. The file size for <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> on Switch 2 is too big to fit on a cart, and developers for open-world games like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> have argued that loading data off of a physical cartridge is too slow to yield decent performance. We’ll see if players stop opting for game key cards if and when they become less prevalent.</p>
