            <p>The advertising bonanza formerly known as E3 continues into its second day with another set of streams. The Wholesome Direct was today's highlight, in my mind. The yearly collection of games that may or may not be cosy, but which definitely do not involve stabbing men in the neck, always contains some games worth keeping an eye on. This year was no different, and you'll find the archived stream below.

<p>It's a full hour and hot damn it includes a lot of games:

<p>I like the dark edge of Discounty, which takes the familiar shop simulation loop of stocking shelves and serving customers and puts it to work in service of creating a sprawling - and potentially exploiting and polluting - supermarket. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2274620/Discounty/">Steam page</a> warns that not everyone wants you to succeed, which seems only sensible.
</p>
<p>I also liked Littlelands, a cute action-adventure game about catching bugs, exploring caves, and searching for treasure. It's Zelda by way of Boku no Natsuyasumi, maybe? The announcement during the Wholesome Direct above included mention of a demo that would be playable today, although sadly it seems <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2083660/view/4146206204944399615">the developers have decided to delay it at the last moment</a>.
</p>
<p>Lastly, I loved the look of Spilled!. It's a relaxing game about cleaning up oil spills in your little tugboat, then upgrading the boat, and it has had a playable demo for a while. The announcement here was that its getting a graphics upgrade later this summer, following its successful Kickstarter earlier this year.

Climb up and hold on, Brynn. Watch out for those barrel rolls!”</p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p><strong>New Flying Epic <a title="Companies > Creature [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/creature">Creature</a></strong></p><p>Following a preview of the Ark of the Forge boss fight with his massive flaming hammer last April, Yellow Brick Games unveiled a new fire-based creature in the latest trailer: the Ashpeak Drake. This colossal foe introduces a new dimension to combat mechanics, demonstrating that players can not only climb these 25-meter creatures but also battle them mid-flight as they soar around the world. So far, three fire-based Epics, each with distinct styles and abilities, have been revealed. Six more creatures remain to be discovered, each boasting unique appearances and different magical powers.</p><p><strong>Custom Combat Style</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The new trailer also provides a glimpse of the customized armors and weapons players will be able to craft with the loot they gather. In the constantly changing environment that is the Enclave, players will encounter environmental events like flash freezes and droughts, requiring adaptation with the right materials for combat readiness. Players can also define their own playstyle by taking on the challenge of mastering the art of ice, telekinetic, or fire magical weapons.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_890105"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The World is Your Weapon</strong> – At the heart of <em>Eternal Strands</em> is a revolutionary new system for gameplay interactions: heat spreads, cold chills, and real-time destruction allows for unprecedented reactivity in combat.

We also learned that players can get their hands on it before its August launch.</p>

<p>Dustborn stars Pax, an ex-criminal with the unusual ability to weaponize words. As in, words are literally power for her as she can fight with shouts or manipulate people in conversations. While Pax can crack skulls using a bat and create new shouts to battle enemies, the game also focuses on building relationships with her crew of misfits (who have their own special powers). Set in an alternate Neo-western version of the U.S., you’ll travel across the country to transport an important package under the disguise of a traveling punk band. Check out its new trailer below.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ogIq4hscX0" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>If Dustborn piques your interest, you can play a 30-minute demo next week during Steam Next Fest from June 10-17. Dustborn launches on August 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-silent-hill-2-remake-is-under-a-lot-of-pressure-to-succeed/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-silent-hill-2-remake-is-under-a-lot-of-pressure-to-succeed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="432" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The long road to the launch of the anticipated <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake is coming to an end, as the official <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fill-your-eyes-with-a-silent-hill-2-remake-trailer-and-its-release-date/">release date</a> was finally revealed last week (with the title, probably predictably, set to come out just weeks before Halloween). But there’s a bit of a stink in the air surrounding the game, and it seems like this modern take on one of the most influential horror releases ever is going to have to be pretty much perfect.</p> <p data-characters="421" data-current-count="421" data-injectable="true">In the current era of remakes, remasters, and re-imaginings, it can be easy to feel a little bogged down by an industry that’s too eager to tick the nostalgia box rather than deliver something fresh. However, a quick look at games like <em>Resident Evil 4</em>, <em>Dead Space</em>, <em>Final Fantasy 7</em>, and the work Nightdive Studios has been doing on classics like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/quake-iis-nightdive-remaster-is-live-right-now/">Quake 2</a></em> shows there’s still room for it in the market, it seems.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Silent Hill 2 - Release Date Trailer | PS5 Games" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sU3pyYi5hz0?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="196" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true">But despite the excitement that should be surrounding Bloober Team’s <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake, there are a number of doubts that are putting the whole project under a lot of pressure to succeed.</p>
 <h2 id="h-reigniting-the-influence" data-injectable="false">Reigniting the influence</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="476" data-current-count="776" data-injectable="true">There’s an argument to be made about not fixing something that isn’t broken. As one of the most influential horror games of all time, remaking it is surely a tall order. <em>Silent Hill</em> – especially the second one – has made its mark on the genre, preserved in the annals of gaming history as a staple of how to create something atmospheric with lashings of delicious psychological torment to go with it. To some, the second installment is the perfect horror game.</p>
 <p data-characters="467" data-current-count="467" data-injectable="true">That’s not to say it can’t be done. You only have to look at Capcom’s remake of <em>Resident Evil 4</em> to see there’s scope for revitalizing older games to give them another go in more modern eras. Much like <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, the original <em>RE4</em> has been hugely influential, which renders a potential remake a dangerous line to tread, but we know it can be done. However, there’s one thing that’s probably crossed people’s minds about it.</p>
 <p data-characters="569" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true">What’s the connection between these remade franchises: <em>Resident Evil</em>, <em>The Last of Us</em>, and <em>Dead Space</em>? They were all done by the developer who created the original. Maybe not the exact same people, but certainly the studio itself. With <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, it’s being made by a different team entirely; one that, although it has a reputation in the horror sphere – as well as being influenced by Team Silent’s work – was not even around when the original was released. Placing a remake of a beloved game into the hands of another is an exercise in trust.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">What we’ve seen so far</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="600" data-injectable="true">The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/silent-hill-transmission-october-19-2022/">Silent Hill Transmission that took place in 2022</a> had a lot of people excited. Finally, after years of speculation and dormancy, Konami’s horror series was getting new games, a new film, and more attention than ever before. Would this be the triumphant return many of us had been hoping for?</p>
 <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="296" data-injectable="false">But the outpouring since then has left much to be desired. The interactive <em>Ascension</em> has not stood as a bastion of achievement in terms of rejuvenating the <em>Silent Hill</em> name. <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/silent-hill-ascension/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metacritic</a> is currently showing a user score of 0.8 out of 67 reviews, with the likes of IGN giving it just 50 out of 100.</p> <p data-characters="468" data-current-count="764" data-injectable="true">Perhaps less tragic – though still not really noteworthy – was this year’s <em>A Short Message</em>. Although it’s done better than <em>Ascension,</em> with a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/silent-hill-the-short-message/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metacritic</a> review score of 53 and a user score of 6.3, it leaves the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake with a lot of slack to pick up. <em>SH2</em> is not a brand-new entry in the series, but it’s seemingly going to have to do more than coast on nostalgic reputation alone given what we’ve seen of the reemergence so far.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Bloober Team’s track record</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="444" data-current-count="744" data-injectable="true">Whatever your thoughts on Bloober Team, the studio has managed to make a name for itself in the horror genre, despite going up against the likes of Naughty Dog, Capcom, and even Frictional Games of <em>Amnesia</em> fame. But this esteem is not without its criticism. Bloober has a knack for visual quality and a disturbing aesthetic that has pricked up a few ears, but there are some problematic things about the developer that people can’t shake.</p>
 <p data-characters="453" data-current-count="453" data-injectable="true">This <a href="https://www.techradar.com/features/six-years-after-layers-of-fear-bloober-team-still-cant-get-mental-health-right" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TechRadar</a> article from a couple of years ago laments the studio’s inability to represent mental health in any agreeable way. The troubled artist from <em>Layers of Fear</em>, the protagonist in <em>The Medium</em> who was abused as a child; there’s a sense that the developer uses these angles as a demonizing tactic, and it’s unclear whether Bloober has learned from this. The writer of that article <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/pm86ed/can_somebody_explain_to_me_why_bloober_team_is/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">does not appear to be alone</a> in such criticisms.</p>
 <p data-characters="565" data-current-count="565" data-injectable="true">Given that <em>Silent Hill 2</em> deals quite heavily with trauma and psychological issues, there’s bound to be concern that a remake from the <em>Layers of Fear</em> studio could encounter similar backlash. However, if Bloober is aiming for a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-team-interview-faithful-dreadxp/">faithful recreation of the original</a>, then such issues should not be a problem, right? But therein lies a further question: why remake something like-for-like (only with modern visuals and control schemes) without an injection of new sensibilities, mechanics, techniques, the developer’s own flavor, etc.? Answers on a postcard.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">It’s not <em>P.T.</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Sabukaru.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="700" data-injectable="true">We all miss it. We all wonder what the final product would have been like, especially with Hideo Kojima and Guillermo del Toro’s names attached. Although it’s been ten years since <em>P.T.</em> came and went, it still hangs in the air to some extent, and it’s likely the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake will get compared to the canceled project. But maybe I’m doing Bloober a bit of a disservice.</p>
 <p data-characters="477" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="true">A game with such recognition and high praise is going to be the subject of scrutiny when it comes to releasing an official remake of it. Taking a beloved franchise and handing the reigns over to a studio that’s not without its fair share of detractors is likely going to draw a bit of ire regardless. Everyone’s going to be watching Bloober Team on October 8, and I don’t think it’s beyond the realms of possibility that some may be scathing by default.</p>
 <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true">Personally, I think some of the current negativity surrounding the remake is a little unfair, likely down to a frustrated audience that wants to see this new era of <em>Silent Hill </em>succeed. But I think – judging by some of the YouTube comments posted on the video linked above – things are in danger of bordering on nasty, maybe even verbally aggressive, from a fan base that’s hungry for blood.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="578" data-current-count="878" data-injectable="true">Maybe there’s some legitimate criticism of what we’ve seen in trailers and teasers so far. <a href="https://aftermath.site/silent-hill-2-remake-maria-outfit-sexy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This article</a> dives a little deeper into some of the design choices of the remake, with particular reference to how changing the clothes of Maria detracts from her significance as a duplicitous femme fatale who reminds James of his dead wife. How much of this is simply the wailing sound of “dudebros” upset that a female character has been modernized to look less sexual, as opposed to this new look missing the point of the original’s intent, is not clear.</p>
 <p data-characters="549" data-current-count="549" data-injectable="false">At any rate, Bloober is under a lot of pressure to make sure <em>Silent Hill 2</em> is pure and flawless; not one iota less. If it strays too far from the original, it’ll displease the older fans. Similarly, if it’s a 100% retelling of the 2001 release, it’ll feel a little pointless (see also: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho_(1998_film)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1998 shot-for-shot remake of <em>Psycho</em></a>). If it doesn’t straddle the line between freshness and nostalgia, but with a fair representation of the game’s themes, the backlash could be brutal. Honestly, it feels lose-lose at this point.</p>

			<p>At Summer Game Fest, we checked out the tactical first-person shooter game Delta Force: Hawk Ops. The game will feature a premium 'Black Hawk Down' campaign mode and two free-to-play multiplayer modes: the large-scale PvP Havoc Warfare and the extraction shooter Hazard Operations. Following <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-hands-on-preview-timi-studio-goes-next-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our hands-on preview</a>, we interviewed lead developer Leo Yao, who revealed that the game is entering early access in October with a projected release window in early 2025. It will be available on PC (where there's an Alpha test scheduled next month), consoles, and mobile devices.</p>
<p><iframe title="Delta Force: Hawk Ops | Official Summer Game Fest 2024 Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WkSYEuGzFss?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Why did your team decide on Delta Force as the franchise that you wanted to create a new title for?</strong></p>
<p>Delta Force is very popular in China's net cafes. In college, we usually played Delta Force with our friends. When we knew there was a chance that we could acquire the IP, we just rushed to get it. We think this is a very good IP.</p>
<p><strong>Can you describe the tactical gameplay that players will experience in Delta Force: Hawk Ops in a bit more detail?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Firstly, we have different Operators who have different skills. The battles are not very arcade-like like some other fast-paced FPS games. Especially in the mode you have played today, the pace is not that fast. You have to observe first, then use some of your team's skills and cooperate with your teammates. In some of the very fast-paced traditional games, like Call of Duty, you just rush and shoot, right?</p>
<p><strong>What modes of communication are there in Delta Force: Hawk Ops, whether it's voice chat, text chat, pinging on a map, or anything else?</strong></p>
<p>Sure. We have a good quality-of-life design. We have voice and text chat, and we encourage people to communicate and cooperate at all times. Also, when your teammates get down, you can revive them or move them to a more secure position.</p>
<p>Also, as part of the gameplay of the extraction shooter mode, chests can be acquired. If one of the teammates gets this, all of your team's gonna get a reward to encourage people to collaborate toward a singular goal. Furthermore, it is indeed possible to ping the locations, the items, or the bosses so that all teammates can have a mutual target.</p>
<p><strong>In the extraction mode, can you drop a weapon on the ground and have your teammate pick it up?</strong></p>
<p>Sure. But you can't drop very high-value gear to give to your teammates. The risk there is that some of the people would just help the other players by gifting them high-value items, so there's gonna be some of the limitations on that.</p>
<p><strong>To modify or customize your weapon, are you only spending in-game currency, or do you pick up new customization items, like a different scope for your weapon?</strong></p>
<p>We only use in-game currencies.</p>
<p><strong>If you have a gun, can you find a scope anywhere in the world and add it to your gun while you're playing?</strong></p>
<p>If you mean the accessories, those are only bought with in-game currency.</p>
<p><strong>Yes, but can you find the accessories during matches, as a regular item in the extraction mode?</strong></p>
<p>Sure. But in the two game modes of Delta Force: Hawk Ops, it's separated. In the large-scale PvP mode Havoc Warfare, there is a progression system where if you level up, you unlock a lot of different weapons and different attachments. In the extraction shooter Hazard Operations, you can loot some of the attachments, and then you can directly use them on your guns.</p>
<p><strong>In Havoc Warfare, as you level up, are you leveling up a specific weapon and unlocking attachments for that weapon, or are you leveling up your character as a whole, which unlocks everything?</strong></p>
<p>I think we support the weapon experience card to unlock specific weapons. So you get a lot of the weapon experience card, which we already use in Call of Duty Mobile, which is very good. People can just get a lot of the experience card after a match and can use that on any of the specific weapons to upgrade it.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have something similar to Call of Duty's Pick 10 system for your loadout, where you can only select a certain number of attachments and items to bring with you?</strong></p>
<p>No, we don't have something like that. You can have two weapons with every attachment on.</p>
<p><strong>How do players unlock or earn new Operators?</strong></p>
<p>It's through some of the events or some of the progression systems, but we don't make them premium. All operators are free. You only pay for the cosmetics.</p>
<p><strong>Will you have a battle pass?</strong></p>
<p>Sure, we have a battle pass.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have two separate tiers (free and premium)?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Yes. The premium battle pass includes a higher level of cosmetics.</p>
<p><strong>How long will a season of Delta Force: Hawk Ops last?</strong></p>
<p>For now, it should be one and a half months to two months.</p>
<p><strong>That sounds very similar to Call of Duty Mobile. With a new season, what kind of new content would you add?</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, new maps, new operators, new weapons, new vehicles. We did a lot of similar things in Call of Duty Mobile: maps, operators, weapons, and vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>What engine are you using to develop the game?</strong></p>
<p>For the Black Hawk Down campaign mode, we use Unreal 5 because we're using Lumen and Nanite. For the multiplayer modes, we use Unreal 4 because they are also on mobile and Unreal 4 is very good for cross platform.</p>
<p><strong>Will you be launching the different versions simultaneously?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, and we share the progression. For now, we don't encourage people to matchmaking across mobile and PC and console, but we do mix PC and console as the other FPS games do.</p>
<p><strong>If you purchased the premium battle pass on PC, do you get that battle pass on mobile as well?</strong></p>
<p>Sure. We share that.</p>
<p><strong>How do you unify the platforms?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Players will use a Level Infinite account.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a release window?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, early access should be in the fourth quarter, and our expectation is that the final release will be in Q1 next year.</p>
<p><strong>How can players enter the early access?</strong></p>
<p>In October, we will open early access on Steam. We also encourage people to give advice or suggestions to us as we listen to the feedback, and we will continue to polish the game.</p>
<p><strong> Can players use keyboard and mouse controls on consoles? </strong></p>
<p>Ah, that's a good question. It is always a very tough question. For now, we only matchmake controller with controller and keyboard &amp; mouse with keyboard &amp; mouse.</p>
<p><strong>Are you planning to support gyroscopic aiming on mobile?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nice. That is a very popular feature I often use in Call of Duty Mobile. Do you have a target resolution or frame rate for consoles? </strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that's a good question. I think we should support 4K. Okay. And the framerate should be 60 at least, and we support unlimited.</p>
<p><strong>Have you talked about which consoles you're supporting, whether it's just current gen PlayStation 5, Xbox Series SX, or are you also supporting PlayStation 4 and Xbox One?</strong></p>
<p>That is a very good question. So, for now we are considering PS5 and Xbox Series X. But we found there is potential to also support PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. I think we hope that we can support all of the consoles, but it's hard work because, to be honest, we didn't have much console experience before. But on PC, we can support very low-end devices like the GTX 960.</p>
<p><strong>Are you planning to make Delta Force: Hawk Ops Steam Deck compatible?</strong></p>
<p>We don't have that plan for now, but we'll surely support it in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk a little bit about the campaign? Like how long it is or how many chapters it will be?</strong></p>
<p>The campaign is basically the Black Hawk Down film. Because we have the copyrights of the film, we use some of the cutscenes from the film.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any of the actors from the film doing voice work?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, and we also have the soundtrack of the film. It's a very classic song soundtrack. At first, we only considered a single-player campaign, but now we want to support co-op, maybe at most three people's co-op. It's going to be a very hard campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have the operator system for the campaign, or are you playing one specific person?</strong></p>
<p>No, we don't share the operator from the other two game modes.</p>
<p><strong>Great. Well, thank you both very much for your time.</strong></p>

		<p>Goat Simulator 3 is set to receive its first significant DLC on June 19th, named “Multiverse of Nonsense.” Coffee Stain North announced the DLC at the Future Games Show, introducing a new realm for players to engage with, with the goal of restoring balance to the multiverse by gathering gems dispersed within rifts that lead to all sorts of places.</p>
<p><iframe title="Goat Simulator 3 – Multiverse of Nonsense | DLC Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vI5Tll-iujo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Santiago Ferrero, Creative Director at Coffee Stain North, said, <em>“We know what you’re thinking – Multiverse? No one has been bold enough to explore such a complex theme with goats just yet. But that’s what we do at Coffee Stain North. We push the boundaries of next generation goat simulation technology, and we can’t wait for our players to explore some of the most exciting content we’ve worked on since Goat Simulator 3 itself.”</em></p>
<p>The “Multiverse of Nonsense” DLC for Goat Simulator 3 takes players on a journey through various locations such as a cartoon town, a city named Goatroit, where goats act like humans and humans act like goats, and a mythological mountaintop city. This expansion introduces new gear for your goat, and a crossover with another title from Coffee Stain Publishing has been teased, though specifics remain under wrap.</p>

The reveal trailer introduces protagonist Hanna, an adolescent orphan on a quest to find her brother Herman. What follows is a sequence of events that transforms Hanna into a reluctant hero, inspiring her and her friends to rise from the gutters of Eriksholm to become symbols of change.</p><p>From a top-down 3D perspective, players will embody <em>Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream</em>’s three playable protagonists and navigate through the densely detailed streets and dreary underground of the city of Eriksholm, utilizing each character’s unique skills, tools, and weapons to overcome obstacles and solve puzzles. Players can freely move the in-game camera to survey the environment, plan their next step, and execute it with perfect timing. Even an overheard dialogue, such as context-sensitive guard chatter, could prove meaningful in finding the best strategic move to progress undetected, as challenges may have multiple solutions.</p><p><em>Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream</em> cleverly marries the art of storytelling, stealth, and strategy-based gameplay mechanics to treat players to a riveting adventure with high-production-value visuals, motion-captured performances, and engaging real-time gameplay.   </p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-clan-completes-the-final-shape-raid-unlocks-incredible-final-mission-for-all<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>A <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> clan has completed <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/destiny-2-the-final-shape">The Final Shape</a> expansion’s raid, unlocking a final mission for all players that brings to an end the series’ decade-long story that began back in 2014.</p><p><em>This article </em><em><strong>does not include any</strong></em><em> </em><em><strong>spoilers</strong></em><em> for Destiny 2 The Final Shape.</em></p><p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/destinys-decade-long-saga-is-over-after-worlds-first-raid-team-takes-19-hours-to-down-final-boss-unlocking-a-wild-12-person-climax-for-everyone-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a> has a great rundown of events up to and including this moment, but for our purposes, we’ll just say that clan Parabellum completed The Final Shape raid before any other and in the process unlocked a 12-person final mission called Excision that acts as a fitting end to everything that has proceeded it over the last 10 years.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The Witness has retreated from the monolith - but, an important battle awaits.</p><p>We'll need all Guardians available to help us defeat the Witness, once and for all.</p><p>Rally with us and launch into Excision, a newly unlocked 12-player activity. <a href="https://t.co/HhIky06Vpc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/HhIky06Vpc</a></p></div>— Destiny 2 (@DestinyTheGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1799420394207605149?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>But it looks like there is an issue with Excision that is causing players in fireteams to be unable to view all cutscenes upon completion of the Excision activity. In a post on X/Twitter, Bungie recommended players complete the activity solo to ensure they experience all the cutscenes.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">At this time, we recommend playing the Excision activity solo to experience all the cutscenes. Players who missed the cutscenes can select the Narrative version of Excision to replay them. <a href="https://t.co/lM40N6O4yC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/lM40N6O4yC</a></p>— Bungie Help (@BungieHelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1799486900719538686?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Now that The Final Shape’s main story has come to an end, Destiny 2 players are wondering what’s next. Excision leaves a number of story threads hanging out there in the galaxy, threads Bungie will probably pull at over the coming months. The developer has already announced a showcase set for June 10 at 8am PT in which it will reveal the next year of Destiny 2. That could mean it will touch on The Final Shape’s upcoming three episodes, the first of which kicks off next week. But perhaps Bungie will also hint at bigger things to come.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Destiny 2 (@DestinyTheGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1799426502766796903?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>In previous videos, Bungie developers have teased that The Final Shape is not the end of Destiny 2 or even the series, with the developer — now owned by Sony — also working on multiplayer game Marathon. This week, in a series of X/Twitter <a href="https://x.com/thislukesmith/status/1797745471521468585" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>posts</u></a> marking the release of The Final Shape, Bungie executive creative director Luke Smith discussed the road to The Final Shape’s release and the effort its developers put in to make it happen. In one of the posts, Smith mentioned the word Hope three times, each capitalized, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-cryptic-tweets-spark-destiny-3-speculation-as-expansion-the-final-shape-launches">which was enough to spark Destiny 3 theories within the community</a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Our Hope is always the same with Destiny games, expansions, seasons, DLCs, exotic missions, secret missions, in-game events, merchandise, et cetera - we genuinely Hope you enjoy the time you spend with it. Anything we've made or will make, that's the Hope. </p><p>Make your own fate.</p></div>— Luke Smith (@thislukesmith) <a href="https://twitter.com/thislukesmith/status/1797745471521468585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 3, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>For now, The Final Shape is going down well with fans, despite initial server problems Bungie <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-developer-bungie-truly-sorry-for-the-final-shape-launch-issues">ended up apologizing for</a>.

At that time, <em>Banana</em> had more players than <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diablo IV</a>,</em> <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-fallout-76/">Fallout 76</a></em>, and was close to beating the next game on Steam’s chart list, <em>Cyberpunk 2077.</em></p><p>Those were already historic numbers for such a novelty title, but things have gotten even more out of hand, as the Banana invasion has just crossed over the 142,000-player mark. Because it’s hard to look at a number and understand its real-world implications, I’ll let you know that we’re talking about a single JPEG-based game that’s <a href="https://steamcharts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">currently bigger</a> on Steam than <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring</a></em>, <em>Call Of Duty,</em> <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-grand-theft-auto-v/">GTA V</a>, </em>and is aiming to take <em>PUBG: Battlegrounds’</em> 4th position at 156,000.</p></div> <h2 id="h-so-what-s-special-about-banana" data-injectable="false">So what’s special about Banana?</h2> <p data-characters="625" data-current-count="625" data-injectable="true">To be absolutely honest, nothing. It’s not even an original game. In fact, <em>Banana</em> is pretty much the same game as <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2784840/Egg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Egg</a></em>, another JPEG clicker that somehow never managed to reach such heights. Both games are simply about clicking a still image and seeing a number above the banana go up as you click. You could wonder that people are trying to see who scores the most clicks, but that’s not it. On top of its ability to let players pass the time in a relaxed way, what makes <em>Banana</em> tick is the promise of scoring some cash. Yes, it turns out that <em>Banana</em> allows players to make some serious(ly low) amounts of cash.<br></p>
 <p data-characters="412" data-current-count="412" data-injectable="true"><em>Banana</em>‘s collectibles work like Steam’s collectible game cards, but there’s a twist. Steam gives you a limited number of cards even if you simply have a game opened on your PC’s background, whereas the bananas you can earn in <em>Banana</em> are limitless. You can earn them by playing the game for a minute, then clicking every three hours, and then you might earn a rare banana once every 18 hours. </p>
 <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="179" data-injectable="false">On top of them being worth some cash, there are various different bananas, and some of them have names and look fun enough to, at the very least, get an ashamed chuckle out of me.</p> <figure data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://x.com/blueralts/status/1790198870997164106"></a><figcaption>Image via Twitter</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="277" data-injectable="false">Most listings don’t go over a few cents, but a few of them manage to go over the two digits. We’re yet to see if this huge increase in numbers will make these values shoot through the skies, or if anyone actually buys some of the already ludicrously-priced bananas.</p>  <figure data-current-count="577" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="107" data-current-count="107" data-injectable="false">Best of all, however, is that despite what it looks like, <em>Banana</em> is completely blockchain or NFT-unrelated.</p> <p data-characters="36" data-current-count="143" data-injectable="false">You too can now go <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2923300/Banana/">Bananas on Steam.</a></p>

<p>We some a lot of truly whacky video game announcements at Summer Game Fest, including Killer Bean, Squirrel With a Gun, and Cuffbust. The latter is from the same solo developer as Choo-Choo Charles—a first-person horror game about a spider-like demonic train engine. But his latest game looks even better. Here is what we know about the Cuffbust release date!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-cuffbust-coming-out">When is Cuffbust Coming Out?</h2>



<p>While we received countless release dates during Summer Game Fest, sadly, Cuffbust wasn’t one of them. As of right now, we don’t know the Cuffbust release date. We know it’s coming in 2025 for PC, specifically on Steam, but the one-person development studio hopes it’ll launch without issue.</p>



<p>There’s a lot that can go wrong in game development, and even more as a single-person studio, but if this turns out anything like his last game, then it should be a relatively smooth, viral experience!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-cuffbust">What is Cuffbust?</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="CUFFBUST - Announcement Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eDe6_Jj_3uM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Cuffbust is a 20-player multiplayer escape game in which you’ll evade guards, plan a prison breakout, and utilize various tools and equipment to make your big break. It’s a bit zany, with plenty of explosives, soap traps, toilet bombs, and spoons in an extremely colorful universe.</p>



<p>You must work together with your team to track guards’ movements, hijack the intercom, destroy generators, disable phone lines, and, in an almost immersive sim-like fashion, find unique ways to escape from jail.</p>



<p>We can see this one becoming big on YouTube and Twitch next year, so now might be a good time to start your channel in preparation!</p>

<p>We saw a number of exciting and interesting projects unveiled at Summer Game Fest, but one stole the show. It’s an odd upcoming action-adventure title made by a single developer, and it’s called Killer Bean. In it, you play as a bean that kills. Revolutionary, right? But when is the Killer Bean release date?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-killer-bean-coming-out">When is Killer Bean Coming Out?</h2>



<p>While it’s definitely a game on everyone’s radar now, that doesn’t mean the one-man developer over at Killer Bean Studios should rush the experience out the door. As such, unfortunately, we don’t have an official release date for Killer Bean. We know it’s coming sometime this year, specifically this summer, but that’s still a large window.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Killer Bean - Slightly Extended Early Access Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/87KtMnmZWzQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>While we impatiently wait for this upcoming action game, which features both first- and third-person gameplay, enjoy the most recent Early Access Trailer, which features a whole lot of new gameplay not previously shown off!</p>







<h2 id="h-is-killer-bean-launching-in-early-access-or-full-release">Is Killer Bean Launching in Early Access or Full Release?</h2>



<p>When Killer Bean launches sometime this summer, it will do so in Early Access. The team intends to remain in Early Access for approximately one to two years, no longer and no less, while they iron out the game experience further. During the Early Access period, the team intends to add new features, such as Steam Workshop, and new content every two months.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, they revealed they have zero intention of increasing the price upon full release following the Early Access period, which is definitely not the norm. We’re thankful for that, though!</p>

<p>In an all-new trailer showcasing one of the most bizarre games ever concocted, we’ve learned something exciting. It is with great pleasure that we can confirm the release date for Squirrel With a Gun, which is launching on the Epic Games Store and Steam on August 29. </p>



<p>This inane, satirical title was revealed ages ago before going silent – but now the release date is locked in and a fresh trailer has further portrayed the depth of what we can expect as a gun-toting rodent.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-better-than-it-sounds">Better Than It Sounds</h2>



<p>Squirrel With a Gun looks like brilliant, mindless fun in the new trailer that was released recently to announce the game’s launch date:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Squirrel With a Gun - Official Release Date Trailer | IGN Live 2024" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SIwlckDwSLA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It’s arguably the most bizarre game you’ll ever play, but this ‘sandbox shooter and puzzle platformer’ will be solid for a few hours of entertainment. From August 29, the game will be available to purchase on the Epic Games Store and Steam, and later in the year, it’ll launch on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>With a range of deadly weapons at your disposal and the opportunity to control a gunslinging squirrel sitting within reach, is there really any other game that should be taking priority on your wishlist right now? </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/wholesome-direct-2024-15-of-our-favorite-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Showing off over 70 indie games with positivity and compassion at their core, today’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocV4LvEYJcg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wholesome Direct</a> had quite a few neat games to keep an eye on, whether today marked their world premiere or just the debut of a brand new trailer. A handful of games even received surprise releases, and there are quite a few more demos out right now!</p><p>From a cheese-filled decorating simulator for mice to an exploration game where you play as a house on a date (and an impressive number of games with “lands” somewhere in their titles), here are 15 of our favorite games from this year’s Wholesome Direct.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Squeakross: Home Squeak Home</h2><p>Receiving a world premiere at today’s Wholesome Direct, Squeakross: Home Squeak Home is an adorably named combination between a puzzle game and a decorating simulator. Players will solve furniture-shaped puzzles made of cheese, watch as the cheese turns into furniture, and then use it to decorate rooms for their mice. With hundreds of furniture items, stickers, and accessories available, I’m already determined to collect everything and be the best mouse parent I can be.</p><p>Squeakross doesn’t have a release window yet, but it’s headed to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2871440/Squeakross_Home_Squeak_Home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam</u></a> (and will run on Steam Deck).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Fruitbus</h2><p>In the upcoming adventure game Fruitbus, players will get to customize their own food truck, drive around and gather ingredients from an open world, and help adorable customers through cooking. While the core game loop is focused around cooking and experimenting with recipes, there’s also a narrative about the previous owner’s past to uncover, stirring up what looks to be a tasty balance between open-ended gameplay and story.</p><p>Fruitbus is headed to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2484130/Fruitbus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam</u></a> and consoles this October, and it also has a demo out now.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/08/wax-heads-1717866288910.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>WAX HEADS IS COMING TO PC.</figcaption></figure></output><h2>Wax Heads</h2><p>I’ve always been on the hunt for a game that authentically nails the feeling of just <em>really </em>caring about music, and Wax Heads seems to have it down perfectly. Set in the struggling store Repeated Records, players will help quirky customers find the perfect album to take home. Along the way, they'll play minigames, get distracted by the shop’s secrets, and learn about each musical act (like Scandinavian metal band Jarhead, which may or may not have… murdered their own singer and kept his head in a jar).</p><p>It’s headed to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2769240/Wax_Heads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam</u></a> and has a demo out right now — no word on a release date yet, though.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Building Relationships</h2><p>Flaunting what’s possibly the weirdest concept I’ve ever seen in a Wholesome Direct, Building Relationships is a dating and exploration sim where you play as… a house. While exploring a 3D island and its many biomes, you’ll search for eligible bachelor pads, fish for cars, discover secrets, and unlock movement skills that let you lumber up mountains. </p><p>Building Relationships is headed to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2666920/Building_Relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam</u></a>, Itch.io, and consoles later this year.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>POOOOL</h2><p>Sitting somewhere between last year’s viral Suika Game and GamePigeon 8-Ball is POOOOL, a tiny physics puzzler about combining pool balls with faces while saving space for more. It’s clean, colorful, and full of satisfying sound effects. It’s also just unexpectedly challenging to get the hang of, as pool balls get heavier and slower as they grow, which adds a neat dimension of skill to the growing camp of 2048-like games.</p><p>Receiving a surprise release during today’s Wholesome Direct, POOOOL is out now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2935840/POOOOL/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Littlelands</h2><p>Everything looks like a toy in Littlelands, an adventure game with detailed, stylized environments that just make the characters look… so small and cute! It’s a little bit like Animal Crossing — players can catch bugs, fish, grow berries, and befriend their neighbors — but it also has an exploration element, and players can even head to dangerous areas inhabited by goblins. </p><p>Littlelands doesn’t yet have a release window, but it’s headed to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2083660/Littlelands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Tiny Lands 2</h2><p>What’s even smaller than Littlelands? Tiny Lands 2! In this find the difference puzzle game, players will find the differences between photorealistic miniature worlds that tell their own stories. Each scene made up of big objects is inhabited by little people, whether they’re conducting traffic amid a cluttered desk full of art supplies, gathering around a fire beneath a tea kettle, or diving into a cup of coffee.</p><p>Today’s Wholesome Direct marked the world premiere of Tiny Lands 2, which is headed to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2213330" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam</u></a>, the Epic Games Store, and Switch.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Sally</h2><p>There’s a lot to do in Sally, which doubles as the name of the game as well as its subject, a magical ship that’s in search of floating islands. Players can cook, take care of animals, work in the machine room, and disembark to gather resources from floating islands, all while leading the Sally to its destination. Best of all, though, they can make friends and find a sense of community among a roster of characters that changes with every game — “everyone’s in the same boat.”</p><p>Sally has a new demo out now and is headed to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2165040/Sally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam</u></a> and Switch.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Lost and Found Co. </h2><p>Lost and Found Co. is a hidden objects game that takes place in a beautifully hand-drawn world full of personality. Alongside a cast of quirky characters, players can search for items in bustling boardwalks, restaurants, homes, gardens and more, getting to decorate their office (and restore the fame of a forgotten goddess, no big deal) as a neat little reward.</p><p>With a new demo out right now, Lost and Found Co. is headed to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2101390/Lost_and_Found_Co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam</u></a>, consoles, and mobile.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Into The Emberlands</h2><p>Into The Emberlands is an exploration game about bringing light back to a procedurally generated world engulfed by darkness (and helping bring home the villagers who got lost along the way). Once they’re home, players can help their newfound neighbors thrive by repairing houses, running errands, and expanding the village. Just don’t let the lantern light fade!</p><p>Into The Emberlands is slated for release on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2856370/Into_the_Emberlands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam</u></a> later this year and got a new demo today.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Tracks of Thought</h2><p>Tracks of Thought is a cozy mystery that’s set on a train. After the train goes through a mysterious tunnel, every bug on board somehow forgets where they’re headed. Through card battles, players (playing as a really cute ladybug) can help their fellow bugs resolve conflicts, reach a consensus, and solve the mystery, all while making their way to the control room through the train’s many different cars.</p><p>Tracks of Thought also received a surprise release today, and it’s out now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1487630/Tracks_of_Thought/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam</u></a> and the Epic Games Store.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/08/curiosmos-1717866179773.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>CURIOSMOS IS COMING TO PC.</figcaption></figure></output><h2>Curiosmos</h2><p>A solar system seemingly made out of clay is the player’s canvas in Curiosmos, an adorable space adventure game that received a new trailer during today’s Wholesome Direct. Players can chip away at planet surfaces with meteors, drag debris into black holes, and add gravity (and even life) to adorable planets with faces. While there isn’t much information about Curiosmos available yet, I’m curious to see what kind of sandbox adventure it might shape up to be.</p><p>Curiosmos isn’t yet slated to release on a specific platform, but more information can be found on <a href="https://curiosmos.space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>its website</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Rooster</h2><p>Receiving a new trailer during today’s Wholesome Direct, Rooster is a point and click narrative adventure about the animals of the Chinese zodiac. Each level has completely different gameplay that ranges from cooking and dating sims to tower defense and hidden objects (all depicted in the game’s gorgeous watercolor art style), and it all culminates in a story about helping others and sharing love.</p><p>It’s headed to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1834220/Rooster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam</u></a> and consoles early next year.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Caravan SandWitch</h2><p>Caravan SandWitch is a narrative adventure about a young woman searching the desolate world of Cigalo for her lost sister. While the trailer shows off the game’s exploration, including driving the game’s signature yellow caravan through beautifully modeled futuristic environments, riding on a zipline, and traversing through massive storms, the Steam page also promises a meaningful narrative about living in harmony despite over-exploitation.</p><p>Caravan SandWitch is headed to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1582650/Caravan_Sandwitch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam</u></a> and the Epic Games Store along with Switch and PS5, and it received a brand new demo during today’s Wholesome Direct.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/08/goodlands-1717866258147.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>GOODLANDS IS COMING TO STEAM AND ITCH.IO.</figcaption></figure></output><h2>Goodlands</h2><p>Goodlands is a game about being a dinosaur and unearthing fossils of other dinosaurs in an open world inspired by the Badlands. With an art style vaguely reminiscent of A Short Hike, players will customize their own dinosaur, clean fossils in minigames, and restore an empty museum by donating their brand new digs.</p><p>Goodlands was briefly shown off during the direct’s montage section and is headed to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1797850/Goodlands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam</u></a> and Itch.io.</p><p>Find more information on all of these games (and the rest we couldn’t fit in this roundup) on the <a href="https://wholesomegames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Wholesome Games website</u></a> or on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/35411526-Wholesome-Games-%25E2%2599%25A5/lists/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Wholesome Direct Steam curator page</u></a>.

<p data-characters="219" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Doctor Who</em> Season 14 Episode 5, “Dot and Bubble,” was released on May 31 and while it comes across in trailers as bright, colorful, and a little wacky, the message of the episode is a whole lot darker.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="370" data-current-count="370" data-injectable="false">“Dot and Bubble” is set on the planet of Finetime, which is entirely populated by rich, white, young adults aged between 17 and 27. Over the course of the episode, we are introduced to Lindy Pepper-Bean, played by Callie Cooke, who is the main ‘heroine’ of the story and must use the Doctor and Ruby’s advice to save herself from people-eating slugs.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="494" data-current-count="864" data-injectable="true">Lindy begins the episode, as do all of the residents of Finetime, stuck in a very literal bubble of social media. Imagine living inside TikTok, with all of your human contact only being done through video calls and short blogs. Lindy is entirely unlikable and incapable of even walking without the aid of the Bubble telling her where to go, and Russell T Davies <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uXz0XHdsQI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has said</a> that we’re supposed to believe that she is growing through the episode and learning how to survive outside of her bubble.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Disney Plus</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="425" data-current-count="725" data-injectable="true">However, the point of this episode is not Lindy’s personal growth or her battle for survival. The point of this episode is revealed within the last five minutes when Lindy and her fellow survivors turn on the Doctor and tell him that he “isn’t one of them” and that getting too close to him “will contaminate them”, all after taunting him for saying the TARDIS can take them away, describing it as “Voodoo”.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="183" data-current-count="183" data-injectable="false">I have to admit, the ending did not come as a surprise to me. There are signs of the overriding racism of Finetime littered throughout the episode if you take the time to notice them:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="303" data-injectable="false"> <li>There is not a single black person residing on Finetime</li> <li>Lindy is visibly disgusted when the Doctor shows himself in her Bubble for the first time</li> <li>Lindy is shocked when she discovers that Ruby and the Doctor are in the same room</li> </ul> <p data-characters="414" data-current-count="717" data-injectable="true">With all of these signs, the twist was somewhat expected. What I didn’t expect, however, was how perfectly both the Doctor and Ruby portray the moment of realization. Ruby, the white child of an adoptive black mother, looks as though she knows what’s happening but is powerless to stop it while the Doctor, knowing that he cannot change their perspective, tearfully begs them to let him help them anyway.&nbsp;</p>

Many were blown away by how well the twist was done, with some admitting that they didn’t see it coming, while others shared that they’d <a href="https://x.com/brod0815/status/1797076067561205779" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seen it coming</a> from a mile away.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="true">One thing that an overwhelming majority of viewers have in common, though, is that while we’re led to believe that the Slugs and Dot (the AI that controls the Bubbles and therefore life on Finetime) are the villains, they’re <a href="https://x.com/TenTennants/status/1796700929397338229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actually the heroes of this story</a>. Well, those and a <a href="https://x.com/StevenWritesNow/status/1796689799778119807" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lamppost</a> which does something the entire audience ends up wanting to do — bonking Lindy over the head a few times.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="247" data-current-count="247" data-injectable="false">This isn’t the first time that <em>Doctor Who</em> has tackled the issue of racism. In season 11 (with Jodie Whittaker as the Doctor), the show took on the story of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/10-best-chris-chibnall-episodes-of-doctor-who-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rosa Parks</a> and her fight for the right to retain her seat on a busy Montgomery bus.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="498" data-injectable="true">However, this is the first time that the Doctor has been the victim of this type of behavior from the humans he so desperately wants to save.

Although it gets somewhat lost in the message of the episode, we can finally say that the Doctor and Ruby are starting to realize that her face is familiar to them, with the Doctor finally recognizing her as the face of Ambulance and Ruby saying she’s “seen her somewhere else”.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-will-release-in-october-dataminer-teases">The rumours were true</a>: Bandai Namco has confirmed that Dragon Ball Sparking Zero will indeed release in October – 11th October, to be exact – and it will feature a day one season pass.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco also took the opportunity to announce four different editions – standard, digital-only deluxe, ultimate, and premium. While all will give you the base game, you'll need to purchase a deluxe, ultimate, or premium edition to get the three-day early-access period, season pass, and season pass bonus of Summon Shenron.</p>

<p>The season pass includes the first three DLC packs, which appear to include over 20 additional characters. There's also the now-prerequisite sweetener for anyone looking to pre-order the game ahead of its October street date.</p>
<p>For players with their eye on the pricey premium edition, you'll get everything above as well as an Ultimate Edition Upgrade Pack voucher code – although we don't yet know what that does – as well as "exclusive" cards, a steelbook cover, a metallic bookmark, a lenticular card, and an "exclusive" diorama (click on the image below to get a closer look). </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/delta-force-hawk-ops-hands-on-preview-%E2%80%93-timi-studio-goes-next-gen.894693/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-hands-on-preview-timi-studio-goes-next-gen/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Tencent's TiMi Studios and Team Jade recently invited Wccftech to Los Angeles to get an early look at the team's first fully-fledged console (as well as PC and mobile) title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-shows-off-impressive-unreal-engine-5-black-hawk-down-campaign-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta Force: Hawk Ops</a>. As the first new entry in the Delta Force franchise in fifteen years, Call of Duty Mobile's director Leo Yao has certainly picked a passion project that most modern gamers might have had the opportunity to play. Stepping away from the tactical roots of the Delta Force franchise, Hawk Ops aims to modernize the shooter series with modern components while retaining some of the signature elements of the series.</p>
<p>For our 90-minute early look, we were invited to play two of Delta Force: Hawk Ops' multiplayer modes and get a brief peek at the Black Hawk Down campaign. It was a relatively low-key affair, with only a couple of Team Jade members accompanying me as the only media attending that particular appointment. There were only a handful of other media present across other appointments and NetEase billed this as a VIP opportunity before the game is properly unveiled at Summer Game Fest this weekend.</p>
<p>The Call of Duty Mobile influence is immediately present as players put together a loadout before getting boots on the ground. Players first pick an operator to field in battle, each with a variety of special weapons and abilities powered by cooldown timers that differentiate one another far more than just being a differently dressed target on the battlefield. The weapons themselves come with a variety of attachments that can be unlocked and slotted in that feels right at home from Call of Duty. Attachments seemed to have a currency cost associated with the basic currency that's awarded for simply playing Delta Force, and I couldn't get a glimpse into the cost per part nor if there was a per-account or per-weapon requirement before an attachment or weapon was unlocked.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Recon_3-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The primary multiplayer mode, Havoc Warfare, is their large-scale operations taking place across expansive maps with teams broken down into bite-sized squads. This particular map featured an attack-and-defend style layout. Attackers would need to push forward and overtake points, while defenders had to keep enemy forces at bay until either side's reinforcements were depleted. Players can spawn upon squadmates out of danger or back at select key points, a mechanic I've used in Battlefield and playing as a medic or assault class to resupply on the front lines. With Delta Force: Hawk Ops, I could see a glimpse of the various operator classes performing in similar ways, but I would like to take a much longer look at the multiplayer modes to see how progression and operator unlocks are handled at a much larger scale. Would the game reward for a particular playstyle beyond just gunning for the highest K:D ratio? Could playing the medic and dropping medpacks be a valid option for hitting the scoreboards? How do tanks and other vehicles handle in Havoc Warfare? These were all questions I was left pondering after completing my brief preview, and I aim to find the answers to them in the next closed beta or hands-on sessions.</p>
<p>Delta Force: Hawk Ops' second signature mode revealed so far and was playable in this month's hands-on event is Hazard Operations. This is Team Jade's take on the extraction shooter: squads of three Operators pick a spot to spawn into the map, scour the map for loot and high-value targets, complete mini-missions, and try to extract and bring what they've earned forward into another game. The one map showcased was fairly large to traverse without jumping into a vehicle, and I was able to make it through most of the math, stumbling into hidden loot caches and heavy artillery-wielding minibosses and beginning my path toward extraction before I ran across another player. Being that this was an offline session, those players I ran into were all bots, and about on par with the level of intelligence, one would expect from Call of Duty Mobile bot matches (which is to say not very reactive or dangerous if not caught unaware). Much of the loot was in the category of "useless and not worth the bag space" to pick up but once in a while, differently colored loot would be revealed that would be worth a significant chunk of currency if successfully extracted. The act of looting requires players to stop and inspect a cabinet or other container, wait for the inventory menu to pop up, and then wait for items to get scanned one by one. In its current form, the mechanic sounds good on paper to force players to make deliberate choices on when to stop and hunt for loot, but in execution, players just rifle through the inventory, waiting to see what color a souvenir might be all the while hoping that an enemy doesn't walk into the room out of the blue.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Combat_2-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>There are certainly some novel concepts to Hazard Operations that I do want to see fleshed out in greater detail. Players can bring forth different rarity tiers of ammunition with them into the operation and I would be curious to see what differentiates a green box of 7.62mm rounds versus a purple one. Similarly, there are many ways to equip an operator, from helmets and backpacks and armor satchels that provide different numerical benefits both in terms of defense and also gear slots. If these might provide other passive boons to a player, I did not yet have the opportunity to see them firsthand, but I would not be surprised, given how varied the loot has been thus far. Another area of opportunity is in the player count. During our interview, Leo Yao revealed that they're planning for less than half of the roster count that players might see in Call of Duty's DMZ mode (which is 22 squads of three players for a total of 66 in all). Whether the AI bots and missions will make that world feel more alive is yet to be seen, but for a game that wants to capture the high stakes of being an extraction shooter, there needs to be more danger around every corner. I must give Team Jade credit for having random escape points that might not always open up in every map rotation.</p>

<p>Lastly, Leo Yao showed off a brief campaign trailer for their Black Hawk Down story. Interestingly enough, this is the second time that Delta Force has crossed over with Black Hawk Down, but unlike the 2003 title, Delta Force: Hawk Ops draws from the film rather than the book of the same name. Leo Yao was proud to talk about securing the rights to the film (and the Delta Fore franchise as a whole) and use clips from the movie. More details on the campaign will follow, as Team Jade was heavily focused on the multiplayer component, and the campaign received its first trailer during Summer Game Fest. The PC Alpha test will take place in July, as you can read <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2507950/view/4173227802700072746?snr=1_5_9_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

Currently, super samples are locked to Helldivers 2 difficulties seven to nine (Suicide Mission, Impossible, and Helldive), making them out of reach to many. Super samples are used to unlock the final ship module in each section.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Helldivers 2 Viper Commandos Warbond Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>And here’s a really welcome change: visible supply lines and attack origins. Currently, planets viewable on the galaxy map have invisible lines between them that determine the path to liberation. To access a planet, Super Earth must have full control of a planet with a supply line connecting to it. But because Helldivers 2 does not surface this mechanic, the wider player base is most often oblivious to the focus of attention when new Major Orders come around. Hardcore Helldivers 2 players who enjoy playing the meta narrative that is the Galactic War believe this lack of information in the user interface has caused some Major Orders to fail.</p><p>The early patch news is going down well within the Helldivers community, which had called on Arrowhead to take more time with updates and Premium Warbonds after previous efforts fell flat. “It was frankly about time we offered you something,” Twinbeard said in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dagnf3/comment/l7kdkon/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on the Helldivers subreddit</a>. “We know you've been waiting a long time. Hopefully the patch and new warbond are two steps in the right direction.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Speaking of warbonds, Helldivers 2 gets <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-reveals-jungle-themed-premium-warbond-viper-commandos-heres-what-to-expect">the new jungle-themed Viper Commandos warbond</a> on June 13. In a recent post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/06/helldivers-ii-enlists-the-viper-commandos-warbond-on-june-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PlayStation Blog</u></a>, Katherine Baskin, social media and community manager at Arrowhead, said the studio had responded to feedback on Helldivers 2’s warbonds and had changed its approach as a result. For a start, Arrowhead has slowed down the pace at which it releases warbonds “to give us a little bit more time to polish these designs before they’re released.” Baskin continued: “We don’t want to rush anything out of the oven before it’s fully baked.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“We know you've been waiting a long time. Hopefully the patch and new warbond are two steps in the right direction.</p></div><p>So, next week is a big one for Helldivers 2, with the game-changing patch and warbond set to hit around the same time. It feels like the start of a new way of working for Arrowhead and cadence of updates for the game. Last month, Arrowhead revealed it was in the process of setting the studio up so it could “make more and better stuff” in the long-term. In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1d2pozq/hello_fellow_helldivers_greetings_from_the_newly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an introductory post on reddit</u></a>, new CEO Shams Jorjani, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-boss-of-helldivers-2-dev-arrowhead-is-now-its-chief-creative-officer-i-care-more-about-weapon-balance-than-qbrs"><u>who recently replaced previous Arrowhead CEO and now current Chief Creative Officer Johan Pilestedt</u></a>, said the studio has had to adjust to the enormous success Helldivers 2 has brought to the company.</p><p>PlayStation 5 and PC co-op shooter Helldivers 2 is the fastest-selling PlayStation game of all time, having shifted an incredible 12 million copies in just 12 weeks since going on sale earlier this year. Amid the huge revenue Helldivers 2 has generated, Arrowhead itself has suffered a number of crises, including launch server problems and, most recently, a battle with Sony itself over the console maker’s controversial attempt to force Steam players to account link to PlayStation Network.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Home to the peaceful Knacks, the world has been engulfed by the mysterious Miasma, plunging everything into darkness. As the chosen Lightbearer, you’re equipped with a lantern filled with radiant Ember. With its light you can cut through the thick shroud, allowing you to venture out across different biomes and save those that strayed from the path and became lost in the darkness.</p><p>In this cozy exploration game with a <a title="Genres > Roguelite [175 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelite">roguelite</a> twist, you have a clear mission: Rescue the Knacks that lost their way out in the wilds and lead them back to safety. Collect a wide assortment of resources to rebuild and expand the village, and transform it into a safe haven for the Knacks! But be aware: If your lantern’s light fades while you’re out in the wild, you will become a lost one yourself, and the next Lightbearer will need to step into your shoes…</p><p>Traverse various treacherous yet fascinating procedurally generated landscapes and biomes that make each new <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,540 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> different from the last. Every biome offers unique challenges and encounters, each needing you to adapt your playstyle if you want to succeed,</p><p>Speaking of encounters: The Emberlands is not just home to the Knacks, but to many other fantastical creatures! From lazy trolls and crazy scientists to… chickens?! They all offer their own quests and bargains to you. While some of them may be rather dubious, they all promise unique rewards, from resources and tools to upgrades to your equipment. Choose which offers you are willing to take—it’s all up to you!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>As you bring back precious resources and answer the calls of the Knacks, aiding them in rebuilding stores and homes, your village will expand and thrive, paving the way for future exploration. Each addition to your village brings you one step closer to unlocking the mysteries of the Miasma.</p><p><em>Into the Emberlands</em> invites players to venture out, explore the secrets that the vibrant Emberlands hold, and meet its many quirky inhabitants along the way.</p><p>Embrace the call of adventure, banish the Miasma and bring light back to the Emberlands!</p><p><em>Into the Emberlands</em> evolved from Tiny Roar’s former project <em><a title="Games > Wanderful" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/wanderful">Wanderful</a></em>. Thanks to Tiny Roar’s open and iterative development approach, the game advanced far from the initial concept. This led to the decision to give the project a new name that suits the game better.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Early Access Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Into the Emberlands - Early Access Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z8qG8GPB55o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
