            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/19/wreckfest-2-early-access-preview/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/wreckfest">Wreckfest</a> was a game that, for some reason, sailed past me like a detached tyre flying in slow motion in a spectacular crash in an action movie. I loved the idea, the crash-happy ethos behind it, but despite owning it on multiple platforms, I only ever dipped a toe in for one or two races. Thankfully time has given me another chance to experience this crash-happy racer with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/wreckfest-2">Wreckfest 2</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wreckfest 2 | Early Access Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z2PCl64qnng?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As it heads into Steam Early Access, Wreckfest 2 is a fairly limited package to start with. In a faint echo of the initial early access release of the first game, there’s four tracks – two race tracks, one oval and demolition derby arena, and a greybox test arena with big ramps and funky flippers – four cars, and support for both solo play and online multiplayer with up to 24 drivers. There’s no career, and just those core modes, but that’s more than enough to give a feel for what Wreckfest 2 offers…. which is more Wreckfest.</p>


<p>Dropping into a quick race is just plain old fun, once you get over that innate desire to actually win. With 24 cars crammed onto these circuits, bobbling and bouncing over bumps in the dirt tracks, the inherently loose suspension of the muscle cars imitations doing little to really help you in an off-road setting, contact is inevitable. Heck, it’s encouraged. Smash into the side, rear-end or T-bone another car and the game will pin a few points on your race suit as a reward.</p>


<p>You might think that’s a great way to get ahead – just use the other cars to help you brake! – but it’s a delicate balance. If another driver keeps their foot in as you nudge their rear corner, turning them off the racing line and forcing you to go with them. Not ideal. There’s plenty times in a race where a car will end up sideways, with an angry traffic jam of competitors all pushing them along, and the chaos is engineered with the way tracks loop back around and cross over themselves, with two-way traffic adding high speed peril. It’s easy to come off worse in contact, or just as disadvantages, that it makes it all the sweeter when you do manage to tap a rival just so and spin them out without losing momentum yourself.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you have the destruction derby mode, where the whole point is to crash into other cars, racking up points for high speed collisions and dealing damage to other cars with the aim of getting the final blow to empty their health bar. Every crash is a double-edged sword, though. Sure, you’ll dish out damage, but you’ll take it yourself, quickly wrecking your vehicle, slowing you down and making you vulnerable. Once you’re wiped out, you’ll spawn again with a fresh car and get to rampage some more until time runs out.</p>
<p>They’re the two bread and butter modes of Wreckfest, and they’re just as good here. Bugbear has built this within their new ROMU engine that enhances the demolition physics and dynamic simulation.</p>

<p>There’s a point of comparison from original to sequel with the inclusion of the Savolax Sandpit track. More than a decade on from its first creation, Bugbear has been able to increase the fidelity a bunch, reprofiling the trackside quarry cliffs, putting far more trees in the densely wooded sidings, giving it a much hazier tone on a cloudy day, and with much better looking dust that’s kicked up as you race. It’s a nice uplift alongside the new Scrapyard track, which raced through a dusty scrapyard that’s filled with heaps of cars.</p>
<p>And then there’s the destruction, which just ups the nuance of what’s wrought upon the cars in the game. There’s still a leaning toward deformation before parts come off, and car suspensions are necessarily incredibly tough, just so that the cars keep on working after one or two prangs, but it really doesn’t take too much before the engine has been compressed to just be an office fan, while doors and bonnets flap about in the wind.</p>
<p>At this point in time, fans of the original are probably best served by actually continuing to play the original, but if you know that Wreckfest 2 will be a part of your racing game future and want to get in at the earliest possible point to see it develop, then the Steam Early Access release might just be for you. It is distinctly limited right now, little more than a demo or technical test, but there’s plenty for fans to look forward to in the months ahead.</p>

While some reports have indicated that Prime Minister Ishiba hit out at Ubisoft’s Feudal Japan-set game and its maker Ubisoft over concerns about its depictions of shrines, the truth is less controversial.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN ran the question and answer via our colleagues at IGN Japan to get not only an accurate translation but some context that helps us understand what’s actually happening here. IGN has also asked Ubisoft for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For background, Ubisoft has apologized a number of times in the run up to Shadows’ much-delayed launch over aspects of the game and its marketing that upset some within Japan.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some expressed frustration with inaccuracies in the game's depiction of Feudal Japan, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-team-issues-apology-to-japanese-fans-for-marketing-that-has-caused-concern"><u>leading the development team to issue an apology</u></a> and say the game is not intended to be a factual representation of history but instead "a compelling, historical fiction."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft also emphasised its collaboration with external consultants and historians, but "despite these sustained efforts, we acknowledge that some elements in our promotional materials have caused concern within the Japanese community," Ubisoft said. "For this, we sincerely apologize."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Concern was also raised when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apologizes-to-japanese-historical-re-enactment-group-for-using-its-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-art-without-permission"><u>the developer used a flag from a Japanese historical re-enactment group</u></a> in artwork for Assassin's Creed Shadows without permission.

Torii gates are found close to religious shrines all over Japan to indicate a boundary separating the human world and the sacred. The one-legged Torii gate has significant meaning of its own, however, as one can famously be found at the Sannō Shrine in Nagasaki, located 900 metres from the hypocenter of the World War 2 atomic bomb which killed upwards of 60,000 people.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With all this in mind, Ubisoft is launching Assassin’s Creed Shadows with a degree of controversy not only in Japan, but with some western fans concerned about its depiction of the country.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.webtv.sangiin.go.jp/webtv/detail.php?sid=8374" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assassin’s Creed Shadows question was asked by Japanese politician and member of the House of Councillors of Japan, Hiroyuki Kada</a>. Kada, who will campaign for re-election this summer, said:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I fear that allowing players to attack and destroy real-world locations in the game without permission could encourage similar behavior in real life. Shrine officials and local residents are also worried about this. Of course, freedom of expression must be respected, but acts that demean local cultures should be avoided.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prime Minister Ishiba responded:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“How to address this legally is something we need to discuss with the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Defacing a shrine is out of the question - it is an insult to the nation itself. When the Self-Defense Forces were deployed to Samawah, Iraq, we ensured they studied Islamic customs beforehand. Respecting the culture and religion of a country is fundamental, and we must make it clear that we will not simply accept acts that disregard them.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/19/gettyimages-2203514070-1742400968639.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Shigeru Ishiba, the Prime Minister of Japan, responded to a question about Assassin’s Creed Shadows.

Our colleagues at IGN Japan helped us understand the situation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What needs to be understood here is that Japan has seen record numbers of overseas visitors in the wake of the country reopening its borders after the pandemic and the lure of the weak yen. In this government budget meeting the politician Hiroyuki Kada twinned his complaints against Shadows with the controversial subject of what he called “over tourism” and an attendant perceived rise in vandalism and graffiti in Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">His argument is that if players are able to deface a temple or harm individuals with a katana in the game, they may be inspired to do it in real life when they visit Japan, similar to the age-old argument that Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto inspire copycat violence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba responded that if such actions were taken in real life, he would oppose them, but the “if” is doing a lot of heavy lifting here. His comments were aimed at theoretical real-life copycat actions rather than at the game itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The shrine being defaced in Shadows gameplay videos online is Itatehyozu Shrine in Himeji, Hyogo Prefecture, which is within Kada’s constituency. He said that he has consulted with representatives of the shrine who say that Ubisoft did not seek their permission to show the shrine and use its name in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Masaki Ogushi (Vice Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry) responded that government agencies will work together to handle matters “if the shrine seeks consultation,”, that again is a big if, and anyway, in a work of artistic expression Ubisoft would probably be clear legally to use the shrine anyway under the Constitution of Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Responses from both ministers were vague at best and seem unlikely to result in any particular action, especially as Ubisoft appears to have addressed these concerns proactively with a day-one patch – showing they may be more sensitive to the feelings of Japanese citizens than Kada gave them credit for.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Complete Assassin's Creed Timeline</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">News of this day-one patch emerged in Japan this morning, but has yet to be confirmed by Ubisoft’s western operation. According to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/assassins-creed-shadows-day-one-patch-will-make-certain-shrine-objects-indestructible-and-eliminate-civilian-npc-bloodshed/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>, Ubisoft has revealed changes that will be implemented in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-global-release-times-confirmed">Assassin’s Creed: Shadows as soon as it releases on March 20</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to the site, the day-one patch will make tables and shelving located in in-game shrines indestructible and will reduce non-essential depictions of bloodshed taking place in shrines and temples. In addition, when attacking unarmed NPCs, there will no longer be depictions of blood. IGN has asked Ubisoft about this day-one patch, and whether it is specific to Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Irrespective of the game’s success or otherwise in Japan, there is enormous pressure on Assassin's Creed Shadows to do well for Ubisoft globally after a number of delays and the sales failure of last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-outlaws"><u>Star Wars Outlaws</u></a>.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> creative director Johan Pilestedt has slammed the current spate of video games industry layoffs as "unnecessarily brutal" and said that companies needed to learn lessons to avoid the same painful cycle of "death and rebirth" in future. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking today at GDC 2025, in a session attended by Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale, Pilestedt put the blame for layoffs on the decisions made by company bosses that they should chase industry trends such as yet more battle royales, just because a big few have become successful. 
</p>
<p>
Instead, Pilestedt continued, the video game industry needed to take more risks and simply make a wider variety of games to cater to the medium's ever-growing audience. That such widespread layoffs were happening despite more people playing games overall was "ridiculous", Pilestedt commented.
</p>
<p>
"The games industry is caught in a vicious circle of death and rebirth," he said. "Every so often we lay off thousands of people suddenly, and then nobody understands why, and I think it's just because we converge.
</p>
<p>
"We will always go through the cycles of death and rebirth, but now that cycle is unnecessarily brutal because we don't diversify enough. We need to make more types of games because people are playing more than ever and still we are unable to stay in business. It's ridiculous.
</p>
<blockquote>"People are playing more than ever and still we are unable to stay in business. It's ridiculous."</blockquote>
<p>
"If everybody stopped making battle royales and made [different] games we wouldn't be in this position."
</p>
<p>
While the majority of video game workers losing jobs were those on development teams, the people calling the shots on which projects were getting greenlit were the ones deciding to "play it safe" by following trends, Pilestedt continued.
</p>
<p>
"A lot of publishers - I'm sorry, my dear publisher friends - try to play it safe by taking safe bets," Pilestedt said. "But one thing that I can guarantee is that those safe bets are a death sentence for the studios that try to make it.
</p>
<p>
"We are in the business of taking risks, and if you don't take risks, we're never gonna be able to achieve success. Few people believed that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> would amount to anything,  and yet here we are."
</p>
<p>
Earlier in the same talk, Pilestedt shared his thoughts on game design, and said that "experiences need to be spiky" in order to stand out. 
</p>
<p>
"Game design is about experiences," Pilestedt noted. "If you balance out all the chaos, you make an uninteresting game. Balance is the polishing of an experience... but if you smoothen that out too much, it will just be bland."
</p>
<p>
Too many games were trying to please too many people, in other words, or make something too similar to something else that has come before. 
</p>
<p>
"You can't overtake if you stay in the same lane," Pilestedt continued, "making a game 10 percent better than something [that already exists].
</p>
<p>
"I love Escape From Tarkov, but if I were to make Escape from Tarkov that's a little bit [more] my preference, I would just be making Escape from Tarkov. And I would not be able to compete because people would rather play Escape from Tarkov than play <em>my</em> Escape from Tarkov.
</p>
<blockquote>"Unfortunately everybody was chasing after the battle royales."</blockquote>
<p>
"We have a convergence problem in the games industry. Minecraft is doing well. Battle royale is doing well. Live-service is the big next thing. All the developers move into the same position to compete for the same niche. 
</p>
<p>
"And what happens? Lots of unsatisfied players are saying, 'Well, what about my needs? I want to play some games and I have lots of money to spare.' Unfortunately everybody was chasing after the battle royales."
</p>
<p>
Concluding his session, Pilestedt challenged the games industry to "take more risks" in order to "avoid mass failures" from chasing trends.
</p>
<p>
"Make your games according to your studio's foundation and style," he said. "Don't copy others instead, think about what you wanna make and take a gamble on it."
</p>

			<p>Today, developer Crosswind Crew has announced an eponymous free-to-play pirate survival MMO game in development for PC. Just like you'd expect, Crosswind is set in the year '17XX', right in the middle of the Golden Age of Piracy. It is in this setting that players will take the role of a freelance captain who has just been betrayed and is stranded after a job gone wrong. The game starts as a relatively familiar tale of survival and revenge but eventually expands into a larger conflict with empires, pirate clans, and even mysterious dark forces. Driven by real-life characters and supernatural forces alike, the story unfolds in an epic battle against an unspoken ancient evil.</p>
<p>The game reportedly offers a comprehensive survival experience. Players will explore vibrant, diverse biomes to gather resources and then unleash creativity in building and crafting, turning their initial shelter into a fully functioning outpost. It's also possible to recruit and expand the crew to speed up harvesting and production. The combat features a vast arsenal of melee weapons and firearms, allowing players to&nbsp;parry and dodge enemy attacks and use a variety of strikes to succeed.</p>
<p>Of course, being a game about the Golden Age of Piracy, the adventures in Crosswind take place on land as well as on sea. From their ship, players may bombard coastal forts from afar, close in, and engage the defenders in hand-to-hand combat. There are various ships, such as nimble cutters, versatile frigates, huge galleons, and more. Singing sea shanties and boarding enemy ships are both available, too. The MMO features include playing with friends, engaging in faction rivalries as well as endgame PvE and PvP activities, including challenging boss fights. Players may trade, raid, and build their own pirate empire.</p>

<p>If you've been intrigued by the description and trailer, the developers are running a playtest right now, featuring the first story arc worth 30-40 hours of gameplay, three biomes, three new playable ships and one merchant ship, ground and naval combat, and an early prototype for the Tortuga social hub.

Remember how it felt in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> when you discovered a <a href="https://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Wooden+Shield">shield</a> and learned that it existed purely to shame and humiliate returning <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> players who are over-reliant on blocking? Do you remember reading those awful, judging, fourth-wall-besmirching words, “Shields are nice, but not if they engender passivity”? Well, The Knightling is the opposite of that feeling. It’s a bouncy, breezy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> platformer in which you are a novice chevalier equipped with a circular, gear-toothed shield he uses for absolutely everything. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
You can slide down hills on it! You can hurl it like Captain America! Like hurling his shield, I mean, not like hurling Captain America. You can use it as a parachute! You can even parry and block with it, though that feels like copping out. Not since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-brew-barons-is-a-sumptuous-ghibli-inspired-flight-sim-thats-also-a-brewing-sim-for-some-reason">The Brew Barons</a> have I witnessed such commitment to a bit. If you’re similarly enthused, you’ll be delighted to hear that developers Twirlbound and publisher Saber Interactive have just slapped a release date on the thing - 28th August. Here’s a trailer.

The story here is that you’re searching for your mentor, a famous knight called Sir Lionstone, who’s gone AWOL while a-questing in the realm of Clesseia. That’s his shield you’re doing doughnuts with. It’s made of Callyrium, which sounds like a Ratchet &amp; Clank version of Vibranium. Is the shield upgradeable in the manner of most video game weapons? I’m not sure, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1471650/The_Knightling/">the Steam page</a> does mention upgrades of some kind.
</p>
<p>
The trailer announcement accompanies an updated demo. It expands the previous demo’s Outskirt area to include ”the seldom-visited, secluded woods in the far corner of the realm known as the Cornered Bosk.” Somebody should get FromSoftware boss Hidetaka Miyazaki to play that demo and ask him if he still thinks shields “engender passivity”. Let’s see you surf through a meadow on an effing Moonlight Greatsword, Miyazaki. Let’s see you turn a Kirkhammer into a glider.

                <p>When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online/">The Elder Scrolls Online</a> first launched in 2014, one of its biggest selling points was Cyrodiil: the MMORPG's large scale, open-world PvP zone where hundreds of players across the game's three factions could lay siege to each other's territory. Cyrodiil was even a major positive note in GameSpot's original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-elder-scrolls-online-review/1900-6415741/">Elder Scrolls Online review</a>, with reviewer Kevin VanOrd calling developer ZeniMax Online's MMO "at its best when the PvP action heats up" and its massive battles "good fun."</p><p dir="ltr">Flash forward to shortly after ESO's post-launch honeymoon period, and the cracks in Cyrodiil quickly began to show. The huge number of players, and the complexity of the underlying game as a whole, led to major server performance problems that the mode still struggles with today despite numerous attempts by ZeniMax Online to fix the situation. Playing Cyrodiil in 2025 means contending with poor frame rates and extremely laggy battles, ultimately making the PvP sieges unplayable for many--a sad state of affairs for what was once a key back-of-the-box feature. But that may be about to change thanks to Cyrodiil Champions, a new experimental test mode.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4461898-esocyrodiilfactions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461898" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4461898-esocyrodiilfactions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461898"></a><figcaption>ESO's three-faction Cyrodiil PvP battles were a major selling point at launch in 2014.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4461898-esocyrodiilfactions.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Cyrodiil Champions is an ambitious open test on ESO's live PC servers running March 24-31 that ZeniMax Online is hoping will definitively identify the core problem behind the mode's frustrating performance. This test campaign will keep all the large-scale siege battles Cyrodiil is known for but massively simplify class abilities and disable nearly everything else (passive abilities, armor types, stats, and more) in order to (hopefully) prove a point--that it is the sheer complexity of each player's stats and abilities interacting with one another that is resulting in server-breaking performance issues, rather than poorly written code or bad server infrastructure.</p><p dir="ltr">"The number one goal for this test is to prove once and for all some of the performance debates we've been having internally," ESO game director Rich Lambert said in an interview with GameSpot. "We win either way, right? We win if it goes off and it does exactly what we want and players love it. We win if it fails, because then we can go back to the drawing board and say, 'Yep, it's not that. So what is the actual problem?'"</p><p dir="ltr">Lambert said the team is constantly getting feedback about Cyrodiil, and it is one of the biggest complaints ZeniMax Online hears about ESO. For eight years, ESO has been on a yearly chapter release cycle (ESO's version of expansions) that have added a large new zone alongside new story content and usually one larger feature, like NPC <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/massive-the-elder-scrolls-online-blackwood-update-adds-companions-new-chapter/1100-6492525/">companions</a> or ESO's card game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-online-legacy-of-the-bretons-is-a-return-to-the-franchises-storytelling-roots/1100-6499996/">Tales of Tribute</a>. In a blog from December 2024, studio director Matt Firor announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-online-is-ditching-chapters-in-favor-of-more-frequent-bite-sized-updates/1100-6528526/">ESO would not receive a new chapter in 2025</a>, with the team instead moving to a seasonal model consisting of smaller updates.</p><p dir="ltr">Firor said the team wanted to experiment more moving forward and outlined a number of ideas it has on how to improve ESO in the year ahead. He specifically called out the need to "seriously" address Cyrodiil performance and said the team had set an "ambitious" goal to see it return to the hundreds of concurrent players the mode supported shortly after launch in 2014.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4461899-esogoldroad.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461899" data-ratio="0.56239412761152" data-width="1771" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4461899-esogoldroad.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461899"></a><figcaption>ESO's latest Chapter, Gold Road, released in June 2024.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4461899-esogoldroad.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Cyrodiil Champions is the solution ZeniMax Online has come up with, despite it still being in its early stages and far from a fully fleshed out feature. Lambert said the team decided on this route back in October, with the goal of putting together a test version quickly to prove the concept.</p><p dir="ltr">For Lambert's part, he likens the ambition behind the Cyrodiil Champions test to that of the game's 2016 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-online-update-finally-lets-you-freel/1100-6444231/">One Tamriel update</a>, which dramatically transformed ESO by removing faction-restricted zones and made it so all of the game's quests and enemies would scale alongside players.</p><p dir="ltr">"We want to change," Lambert said. "We want to move forward. We want to spice things up. In my brain, Cyrodiil Champions is on the same level of crazy as One Tamriel was when we did that way back in the day, and that completely changed our game for the better. I think that's what Cyrodiil Champions could be, and we want to do more of that stuff going forward as well."</p><p dir="ltr">The test will dramatically alter class abilities while in Cyrodiil. Whereas many abilities can normally do damage and heal, or damage and crowd-control targets, or hit a large number of targets at once, that won't be the case in Cyrodiil Champions. An ability, like the Templar's Javelin, that usually does damage and knocks down opponents will instead just do the knockdown, or abilities that normally heal and deal damage will now do one or the other. Some abilities may deal damage to a reduced number of targets. It's all being done in the name of server performance, and pinpointing what, precisely, is causing Cyrodiil's performance woes.</p><p dir="ltr">Lead combat and PvP designer Brian Wheeler said doing a "hard separation" of PvE and PvP abilities is something the team has discussed for a long time, and that by removing extra layers from each ability, the team can finally hone in on Cyrodiil's performance issues. He said he knows it's a dramatic shift for the game.</p><p dir="ltr">"Engineering efforts have kind of gone as far as they can possibly go," Wheeler said. "At this point, it's on design. It's on us to look at abilities and go, 'Does this really need to do all the crap that it's doing?'"</p><p dir="ltr">Even if the test is a success on a technical level, Lambert said continuing to expand and build out Cyrodiil Champions isn't a sure bet. It all depends on how players respond as to what will come next.</p><p dir="ltr">"The internal playtests have been really, really positive," Lambert said. "Time-to-kill has gone up, so you're not getting two-or-three-shotted. There are builds, the really persnickety builds on live, the really tanky guys that you just can't do any damage to, a lot of that stuff is gone. It's just a really cool, welcoming, easy-to-pick-up game mode now. Which is really cool. Again, it's not a fully fleshed out feature, so there's going to be some warts and what not in there but we knew that going in. We chose to do that so we could get it out quick, and not spend two years and then find out, 'Oh, well that was actually not going to solve anything.' We are making a conscious effort on what we are focused on and why we are doing it, and hopefully players will like it as much as we have in our playtests."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4461900-eso10yearanniversary.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461900" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4461900-eso10yearanniversary.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461900"></a><figcaption>ESO celebrated its 10-year anniversary in 2024.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4461900-eso10yearanniversary.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Should the test not go as expected, Wheeler said it will still give the team further direction on how to solve the problem of Cyrodiil, something he said he's been "clamoring for" for a decade. And whatever comes next, whether it's additional Cyrodiil Champions tests that continue to bring the feature to full-realization or something else entirely, Wheeler said ZeniMax Online will always look to keep what fans love about Cyrodiil intact.</p><p dir="ltr">"We know that Cyrodiil is a unique experience that doesn't really exist in other MMOs," Wheeler said. "Regardless of where we go with Cyrodiil, that is something that is still going to be a core tenant. The keep battles, that fight, this feeling of grand scale, this feeling of war…The unique thing about Cyrodiil is the sandboxy warfare that it has, and whatever we do, we are going to do what we can to keep that intact and having that vibe."</p><p dir="ltr">Those who want to try out Cyrodiil Champions for themselves can play the experimental Cyrodiil campaign in ESO from March 24-31 and score in-game rewards via a new Golden Pursuits reward track. While the test is only on PC, console players will also be able to participate in certain activities to earn rewards for the duration of the test.</p>

But now, cryptic posts on social media hint that the publication may make a return.</p><p>On Bluesky, the <em>Game Informer</em> account, which had not posted since July of last year, returned to life with a short video featuring the publication’s farewell message. At the bottom of the screen, code appears with the words “Continue” as though it were an arcade game asking if you wanted to put in more quarters to keep playing. The screen then flashes to black with a date, March 25th, suggesting a launch or announcement next week.</p><p>At the same time, several former <em>Game Informer</em> staff, including director Brian Shea, shared the post, strengthening the idea the magazine is on its way back while also icing the fear that GameStop was somehow reviving the publication without the staff the company laid off in August. Additionally, former staff members posted videos of a “continue” screen with a copy of <em>Game Informer</em> in the background, with the animation moving the cursor onto “yes.” Taken together, the teasers suggest <em>Game Informer</em> is coming back with its former staff returning to lead the publication.</p><p><em>The Verge</em> has reached out to GameStop and former staff at <em>Game Informer</em> to confirm the news. In an email, Shea said that he can’t comment at this time but encouraged checking out the social media posts of his former colleagues. With the continued shrinking of digital media putting thousands of journalists out of work, especially in video games, it’s incredibly rare that something good happens. While we don’t quite know what form this announcement will take on March 25th, I think we can tentatively say, <em>Game Informer</em>’s getting the band back together.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
It's been a billion years since I played a proper new Front Mission game, and I'm depressed to learn that Square Enix cancelled one in 2022. Titled Front Mission 2089: Borderscape and developed by BlackJack Studio, it was <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2022/04/front-mission-2089-borderscape-announced-for-ios-android">announced</a> for release on iOS and Android but, who knows, might have clanked and rumbled onto PC, the place all good mobile games go when they die. Alas, Square Enix shut the project down a few months after reveal. Now, they're suing BlackJack for releasing a new game that allegedly makes use of leftover parts from the Front Mission contract.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/542570/square-enix-front-mission-mecharashi-lawsuit">Polygon</a>, BlackJack Studio released a game called Metal Storm, or Mecharashi, in October 2024. Square Enix claim that BlackJack (known in the lawsuit as HK Ten Tree) developed it "using materials created pursuant" to their old Front Mission licensing agreement for Borderscape. 
</p>
<p>
Mecharashi was only ever released in China and Japan, but does have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3446920/Mecharashi/">an English language Steam page</a>, which describes it as a "mecha-themed tactical turn-based game" that uses "a Front Mission-style combat system, where you can assemble mechas however you want, equip a wide selection of weapons, and choose your favorite pilots to engage in battle." The trailer certainly looks rather Front Missionary. Square Enix have sent a bunch of DMCA takedowns to get the game yanked from storefronts. It's back on Steam as of this writing thanks to a counter-claim.
</p>
<p>
Square Enix's lawsuit has been filed in both a US and a Japanese court, and includes side-by-side comparisons of Mecharashi and the unreleased Front Mission 2089: Borderscape - 11 pages of them. Find some examples below. 
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/1(8).png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Polygon / Square Enix</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
The Final Fantasy publishers argue that the game can't be released in its current state because it makes use of "game mechanics, visual designs, and other protected content" from the abandoned Front Mission collaboration. They want BlackJack to both remove said infringing material and cough up $150,000 per infringement. 
</p>
<p>
Being neither alleged infringer nor self-described infringed-upon, I will conclude only by saying that I think those mech designs are quite nice. Softer-looking and warmer of hue than I remember Front Mission being, though that's me harkening back to the PS1 era when the science of video game anti-aliasing was in its infancy. It reminds me of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/phantom-brigade">Phantom Brigade</a>. Ah, I hope we get another tactical mech game soon, once the lawyers have had their fun.

<p>After the skin briefly appeared during the Marvel Rivals early access tests, the beloved Spider-Man Spider-Punk suit is arriving to the store on March 20th. The skin has received a tune-up featuring some rocking new audio effects, meaning you’ll want headphones on to fully appreciate it.</p>



<h2 id="h-spider-punk-2099-arrives-in-marvel-rivals">Spider-Punk 2099 Arrives in Marvel Rivals</h2>



<p>Marvel Rivals confirmed today that Spider-Man’s Spider-Punk 2099 suit will make its official debut on March 20th at 2:00 UTC. The skin was one of a few that were playable during the early access tests for the game, such as the President Loki skin just recently officially released. The Spider-Punk character first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man comic series in 2015, and a version of them appeared in the Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse film.</p>



<p>The Spider-Punk 2099 suit will, naturally, be sold as a bundle that will include a suit-specific emote and MVP screen. The bundle will likely include a spray and a player card as well. It will hit the store at the same time as another skin that originally debuted during the closed tests: Iron Man’s Steam Power suit. According to Marvel Rivals insider Miller Ross, the bundle will <a href="https://x.com/mmmmmmmmiller/status/1902374511829512306" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost</a> 2,200 store units.</p>



<div><article><p><span>🤟 Unleash the Spider-Punk within you! 🎸

“The biggest leap we’ve made in decades? Putting synths back in punk music. And hey, punk was born from the raw strum of a guitar even the future can’t take that away. Wish Hobie could see this…”

Leap into the action as Spider-Man’s </span></p></article></div>



<p>Unlike the Spider-Punk 2099 suit that was playable during the closed test, the soon-to-be-released official version appears to include a handful of electric guitar licks and riffs accompanying Spider-Man’s attacks and abilities. Skins have been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-launching-perfect-couples-costumes-on-valentines-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a major focal point in Marvel Rivals’ ability to generate massive amounts of revenue</a>. However, some fans are already expressing irritation that some heroes are getting favorable treatment. Spider-Man is getting their second Legendary skin, but heroes like Squirrel Girl, Black Panther, Groot, and several others have yet to receive one.</p>



<p>Is Spider-Punk 2099 a must-buy for you when it arrives in Marvel Rivals? Let us know down below and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/apple-cider-vinegar-common-side-effects<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was at brunch with some friends a few weeks ago, one of whom is a massage therapist. We got onto the topic of–what else–politics, and my friend talked about how pervasively the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/02/everything-youve-been-told-is-a-lie-inside-the-wellness-to-facism-pipeline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alt-right</a> has seeped into her sphere, which once felt like a bastion of, if not leftist ideas, at least anti-conservative ones. As the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-robert-f-kennedy-make-america-healthy-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">US government </a>starts pushing fringe health theories into the mainstream,&nbsp; two recent TV shows–<em>Apple Cider Vinegar</em> and <em>Common Side Effects</em>–also explore this world and its dark side. Both shows make space to think about a world that can sometimes feel too big to wrap your head around, but they also raise the volume on dangerous wellness conspiracies.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81637595" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Apple Cider Vinegar</em></a> is a recent Netflix series that intersperses a fictionalized account of fraudulent wellness influencer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belle_Gibson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Belle Gibson</a> with two actually fictional characters: Milla Blake, a woman who believes she cures her cancer through juicing and coffee enemas (and who seems based on a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/mar/01/jessica-ainscough-australia-wellness-warrior-dies-cancer-aged-30" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">real-life influencer</a> who ultimately died of cancer), and a woman with breast cancer named Lucy who becomes a fan of Belle’s work.&nbsp;</p><p><em>(The following contains some general spoilers for the plot of </em>Apple Cider Vinegar<em>)</em></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Apple Cider Vinegar | Official Trailer | Netflix" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u2Yj_rmCzhE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Belle falsely claims to have been diagnosed with various cancers that she treats with a diet that ultimately becomes the worldwide phenomenon The Whole Pantry (while I didn’t recognize Belle’s name when I first started the show, I absolutely remembered the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Whole-Pantry/dp/0718180410/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.1D-WX9UTLx3UwZlVnLWuEg.BP49G0vtBHSVXaHONBIB5i7ZrbOactWCUwTBGq7BOBQ&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;qid=1742234285&amp;refinements=p_27%3ABelle+Gibson&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cookbook</a>.). Her fraud comes to light following reporting by Australian newspaper <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/national/revealed-the-age-stories-that-exposed-belle-gibson-s-lies-20250213-p5lbqj.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Age</a>, which first exposed that donations The Whole Pantry promised to various charities and individuals were never paid; the scrutiny ultimately forced Belle to admit that she had never had cancer.</p><p>The show jumps between multiple stories and timelines in a way that can be a bit confusing (the waters were further muddied for me given my feeling that the main actresses all look a bit alike) but which works to paint a complex picture of the world of wellness influencers. Milla, unlike Belle, earnestly believes that her non-medical cures saved her from having to have her arm amputated. When her cancer returns at the height of her fame, it doesn’t just threaten the media empire she’s built, but her entire sense of herself and her belief in the things she’s devoted her life to.&nbsp;</p><p>Lucy, meanwhile, is just a regular person. Her partner, who is one of the journalists investigating Belle, tries to stand by her through her treatment, but they grow estranged as Lucy’s fascination with Belle draws her deeper into alternative medicine. Unlike Belle and Milla, both of whom financially benefit from their experiences, we see the damage the wellness sphere does to Lucy financially, medically, and interpersonally.</p><p><em>Apple Cider Vinegar</em> also shows how its protagonists’ actions affect other people in their lives. When Milla first decides to pursue alternate medicine instead of having her arm amputated, we see her parents struggle between supporting her and wanting her to get the care the doctors recommend. Later in the series, her mother is diagnosed with cancer; Milla insists she eschew traditional medicine. Lucy’s partner is motivated to look into Belle as much by his profession as he is wanting to free Lucy from Belle’s grip. Belle’s partner Clive is in a unique position; he loves Belle and her son, and he also clearly loves the swanky lifestyle her fame affords him. But he struggles as Belle’s story starts to fall apart.&nbsp;</p><p>What I appreciated most about <em>Apple Cider Vinegar</em> is the way the multiple storylines complicate what might otherwise be another grifter tale in the vein of <a href="https://play.max.com/movie/1d7c48f8-8064-46d7-a3b8-bb7b91fc2056" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Inventor</em></a> or <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81008305" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Inventing Anna</em></a>. While plenty of wellness gurus are obviously frauds, there are surely more people who are drawn to that space because they honestly believe in what it has to offer, and who become more than just participants because they earnestly want to help people. Through the show’s stories, we see how people value more than just the juices and health outcomes; the wellness world provides a sense of purpose and a narrative for the world that helps people make sense of themselves and their circumstances.</p><p>In their book <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/derek-beres/conspirituality/9781541702981/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Conspirituality</em></a>, Derek Beres, Matthew Remski, and Julian Walker write that “People are drawn to both marginal spiritual communities and conspiracism because 1) they are attracted to the idea of knowing something necessary for survival, 2) that no one else knows, and 3) that they can share with other kindred spirits.” When Milla’s cancer returns, she meets a woman who offers her <a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/do-not-use-black-salve-dangerous-and-called-many-names" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">black salve</a> for her tumors; the woman tells her she can’t legally sell Milla the salve “because the government are scared of its potential to destroy the big cancer industry.” <em>Conspirituality</em> calls this an “an imagined fall from organic grace… as folk medicines were discredited by the captains of new pharmaceutical industries, and as spiritual rites were disenchanted by academics and bureaucrats.”</p><p>This strand in <em>Apple Cider Vinegar</em> would be right at home in another recent show, Adult Swim’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/common-side-effects-adult-swim-max-hbo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Common Side Effects</em></a>.That show follows Marshall, who has discovered a mushroom that cures all diseases, and his attempts to evade the government and pharmaceutical companies that want to get their hands on it. In one way, it flips <em>Apple Cider Vinegar</em>’s health frauds on their heads–there really <em>is</em> a miracle cure out there “they” want to keep you from, and we see it have real results throughout the show. But unlike <em>Apple Cider Vinegar</em>’s characters, Marshall seems to have no desire for riches and fame; he just wants to save humanity with his discovery, while powerful forces try to stop him. He is, in a sense, portrayed as the exact kind of hero so many wellness influencers seem to believe they are, or at least present themselves as.&nbsp;</p><p>Both shows deal with themes that are incredibly relevant today. It is indeed true that government and medical bureaucracy prevent people from getting the care they need and create dehumanizing systems. But the wellness world’s brand of conspiracy often fails to take the <a href="https://aftermath.site/united-healthcare-luigi-mangione" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">right aim</a>, inventing a shadow cabal that wants to push drugs and harm people instead of focusing on capitalism’s role in the health care industry. This thread feels especially notable now that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mzk2y41zvo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RFK Jr</a>. runs the Department of Health and Human Services. RFK’s “MAHA” (“Make America Healthy Again”) agenda whiffs of health conspiracies and wellness hacks that would be right at home in both shows’ worlds: vaccine skepticism, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/health/texas-measles-outbreak-kennedy.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">non-medical treatments</a> for diseases, and various stances and theories that <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/gay-frogs-and-atrazine-why-the-alt-right-likes-rfk-jr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeal to the alt-right</a>. Some of it might sound good on its face–a hypothetical priority on <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze391y17z7o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">healthy food</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-says-government-ignores-chronic-disease-misguided-rcna190042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chronic diseases</a> <em>would </em>be a good thing, if they weren’t pushed by a guy who <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-health-stances-vaccines-fluoride-raw-milk-rcna180244" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drinks raw milk</a>–but leaning into this as a country isn’t going to lead to some kind of wellness utopia; it’s just going to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/texas-measles-outbreak-grows-279-cases/story?id=119905598" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kill people</a> and spread more misinformation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>While <em>Apple Cider Vinegar</em> both humanizes and takes aim at this, <em>Common Side Effects</em> seems to revel in it, at least so far (the show’s season isn’t over yet). As games journalist <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/iantothemax.bsky.social/post/3ljbt6imz3s2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ian Walker</a> pointed out, “It's just a mysterious mushroom from the rain forest instead of a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-58170809" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">horse dewormer</a>.” What does it mean for both shows to explore themes that have long caused real harm, and are gearing up to cause more widespread harm now? Both shows make space to think about these issues apart from the horrors of the news; as fiction, they can look more deeply and explore more facets than a news story that has to prioritize accurate information above all else. But they also turn up the volume on a confusing world that’s already making a lot of noise in the public sphere, potentially giving it more validity in some people’s eyes. And while I don’t believe fiction is duty-bound to give moral instruction–neither show needs some kind of “remember: this is bad” placard–does <em>Common Side Effects</em>’ thriller conspiracy as humanized through its animation style and writing, or the ways in which <em>Apple Cider Vinegar</em> paints Belle as compelling, add fuel to the fire of these conspiracies?</p><p>I enjoy both shows a lot, including indulging in a certain brand of escapism they offer by letting me enter a version of our current world that doesn’t lead to babies getting measles. And <a href="https://aftermath.site/kennedy-center-nea-trans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">art</a> is, of course, one way we explore and make meaning out of our lives, and the accelerated rise of the wellness sphere is something that’s urgently present in the lives of Americans right now. Ultimately, maybe anything that takes wellness claims out of the mouths of the people who peddle them has value, especially these days. &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/uvw-cwa-video-game-union-microsoft-trump-musk"><h3>CWA And Video Game Workers Launch New Industry-Wide Union Anyone Can Join, Even If They’ve Been Laid Off</h3></a><p>With the Department of Labor and National Labor Relations Board under attack by Trump, CWA is trying something old and new</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/two-point-museum-review-impressions"><h3>Two Point Museum: It’s Great</h3></a><p>No tombs were raided in the making of this video game</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That message was notably not written by any of the staff members and was the only thing you could see on the website for the past seven months after GameStop wiped the publication’s online archive. But in the teaser, the screen glitches out, and the text “{CONSOLE.WRITELINE (CONTINUE?);” appears on the bottom right corner.

            <title><![CDATA[Is Inzoi Multiplayer? Is it Single-Player?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-inzoi-multiplayer-single-player/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-inzoi-multiplayer-is-it-single-player.1139211/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-inzoi-multiplayer-single-player/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Outside of official mods, it’s very rare to see a life-sim title enable multiplayer in any capacity. With Inzoi looking to take the genre by the scruff of the neck, we’re drawing our attention to Inzoi and whether it has multiplayer or focuses solely on single-player.</p>



<p>Even a cursory glance at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-inzoi-come-out-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi</a>‘s prerelease images and footage makes the soul feel warm. People playing together in a band or a couple enjoying the creation they conceived together. Everything we’ve seen looks friendly and instills a sense of togetherness. Your job in Inzoi is to micromanage the existence of Zois—plural being the key here. </p>



<p>Each city you build is crawling with characters, but can you bask in your vision with another person?</p>



<h2 id="h-will-inzoi-be-multiplayer">Will Inzoi be Multiplayer?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No buddying up yet. Credit to Inzoi Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Currently, Inzoi will not support any multiplayer features at launch.</strong></p>



<p>Like The Sims and other life simulators, there is no multiplayer in Inzoi. Outside of potential mods, this is a strictly single-player-only game. You only have to look at the official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Inzoi Steam page</a> to see the big “Single-Player” category assigned to it.</p>



<p>This is designed to be your world, your life, and it’s for your eyes only. However, I did say there is no multiplayer at launch. It doesn’t necessarily mean Inzoi won’t feature multiplayer content at any point in the future.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-multiplayer-be-added-to-inzoi">Will Multiplayer be Added to Inzoi?</h2>



<p><strong>Developer Inzoi Team is contemplating adding “various multiplayer features” to Inzoi.</strong></p>



<p>In the Inzoi <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1162040845181124618/1220564610151878696/1349181911481843722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord server’s FAQ</a>, a question asks: “Will the game be multiplayer?” Here’s what the official response says: “We are currently considering various multiplayer features, <strong>such as the ability to meet up with other online players or invite them over to your home.</strong> But specific details have not been decided.”</p>



<p>This feels more uplifting, wouldn’t you agree? There’s no timeframe mentioned as yet though as the team probably wants to ensure the Early Access launch goes smoothly first. We already know a ton of free DLC is coming courtesy of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-will-inzoi-cost-inzoi-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi’s cost</a>. We’ll keep you posted if the game does decide to integrate multiplayer into the main game.</p>



<hr>



<p>Does a lack of multiplayer put you off buying Inzoi? Or are you motivated to create virtual worlds with the foresight of potential forthcoming multiplayer content? Share your thoughts either here at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming</a> or on our lively <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forum</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Dungeons &amp; Dragons has spawned numerous fictional settings for players to explore, but one of the biggest and most detailed is Dragonlance. The high-fantasy world, known as Krynn, was crafted by authors Laura and Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis, but rather than just serving as a campaign setting for dungeon masters and players to explore, Weis and Tracy Hickman further developed the universe into a sprawling series of novels, expanding Dragonlance's popularity beyond just D&amp;D players, and cementing it as one of the more prolific fantasy settings ever conceived. If you've ever wanted to get into the series, <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fbooks%2Fworld-dragonlance-wizards-coast-books&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-26-dragonlance-novels-for-just-18-this-month%2F1100-6530195%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Humble's new The World Of Dragonlance Book Bundle</a></strong> includes up to 26 Dragonlance novels for $18.</p><p dir="ltr">Like all Humble Bundles, this is a pay-what-you-want deal where the more you pay, the more books you get. A portion of revenue is donated to charity--in this case, Room to Read, which helps children in low income communities learn reading, literacy, and life skills. You can also increase your pledge if you want to contribute more to charity, and the bundle's store page includes a slider so you can adjust the revenue split between Humble, Wizards of the Coast, and Room to Read.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the books you get, the base $1 tier includes three books: Dragons of a Fallen Sun, Dragons of Lost Star, and Dragons of a Vanished Moon. These novels were written by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, the co-authors of the original Dragonlance series, and comprise the War of Souls trilogy. Like other Dragonlance arcs, the War of Souls Trilogy can be read as a standalone series, making this $1 bundle a great introduction to the fantasy setting.</p><p dir="ltr">If you want to expand your collection further, the $10 seven total ebooks, including the War of Souls trilogy, plus The Soulforge, Brothers in Arms, Amber And Iron, and Amber And Blood. The best deal, however, is the $18 tier, which gets you a whopping 26 Dragonlance novels in ebook format, including the original Dragonlance Chronicles trilogy. That equates to a $207 value.

<p>The February 2025 releases of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is more than just one of the most successful launches of the year. The long awaited sequel produced more than five times the amount of launch month dollar sales than the original, even during a stacked release month.</p>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-outperformed-the-original-in-reviews-and-sales">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Has Outperformed The Original in Reviews and Sales</h2>



<p>According to the latest monthly United States video game sales data from Circana, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 was the second best selling premium game of February. Additionally, it’s also the second best selling premium game of 2025 so far, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-2025s-best-selling-game-in-the-united-states-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sitting below Monster Hunter Wilds on both charts</a>.</p>



<p>But Circana’s video game analyst Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lkqai5tjhs2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a> an additional piece of insight about the Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 launch. According to Piscatella, the “launch month dollar sales total Kingdom Come: Deliverance II reached in February 2025 was more than 5 times higher than that the original [game] achieved during its February 2018 debut.” Since both games were originally priced at $59.99 USD, this effectively means that the sequel sold five times more than the original did during its launch month. However, the sequel did have a slight advantage in that it released on February 4th, while the original released February 13th.</p>



<p>Even though it had a week more of sales to tout compared to the original, the critical reception to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 show how popular the sequel is. The first game garnered a 76 from critics according to MetaCritic and an 83% positive rating on Steam, which is by no means bad. The sequel though achieved a Metacritic rating of 88, and a 93% positive rating on Steam.</p>



<p>Will Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 finish 2025 as one of the top 10 best selling games? Let us know down below and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

Blizzard is instead progressing past vanilla WoW's normal endpoint and introducing new endgame content in the form of a new raid, as well as giving players the chance to wield one of WoW's most legendary weapons--the Ashbringer.</p><p dir="ltr">Phase 8 of WoW Classic Season of Discovery will begin on April 8, <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24188044" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Blizzard has announced</a>. That will be when players will be able to explore new quest content centered around the Scarlet Crusade stronghold of New Avalon. Then, on April 10, players can venture into the new Scarlet Enclave raid, where a splinter faction of the Scarlet Crusade is seeking help to overthrow an "insidious evil" that has taken control of the stronghold.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1168065435" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

this content!</p></div><p dir="ltr">The Scarlet Enclave is where Paladin, Warrior, and, yes, even Hunter players can embark on a new legendary questline to reforge one of WoW's most iconic weapons, the holy two-handed sword Ashbringer. It will be the first time WoW Classic players will be able to get their hands on a non-corrupted version of the weapon, despite players back in the vanilla WoW days tirelessly trying to discover a way to no avail. However, players of the modern "retail" version of WoW were able to use Ashbringer as part of the game's 2016 Legion expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">How, exactly, players will purify the Corrupted Ashbringer and restore it to its former glory is still under wraps, but the datamining sleuths at <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/how-this-legendary-weapon-may-be-coming-to-season-of-discovery-in-phase-8-375915" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a> have some theories. If you don't want spoilers, stop reading now! Based on datamines, in typical WoW Classic fashion, the quest to restore Ashbringer looks like it will be a globe-trotting affair. The quest may even take players to previously unseen areas in WoW Classic like Mount Hyjal and the Well of Eternity.</p><p dir="ltr">Wowhead has also <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/possible-bosses-coming-in-the-scarlet-enclave-raid-season-of-discovery-phase-8-375982" rel="nofollow ">datamined</a> possible bosses for the Scarlet Enclave raid, and one of them will be a very familiar face to longtime WoW players. Spoilers if you don't want the contents of the raid revealed, but it looks like players will face off against none other than Lillian Voss. In modern WoW, Voss is a prominent undead character who first appeared in the game's Cataclysm expansion, where she infiltrated the Scarlet Crusade in a quest of revenge against those who wronged her.</p><p dir="ltr">Before she was turned undead, she was a fanatical member of the Scarlet Crusade, but her exact backstory, or the manner of her death, has never been revealed. Just as was the case when players believed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-players-think-the-war-within-big-bad-is-secretly-in-season-of-discovery-too/1100-6520312/" data-ref-id="1100-6520312">Season of Discovery included appearances from WoW: The War Within's main villain Xal'atath</a>, it looks like Blizzard is once again tying together its two eras of WoW in an exciting way.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the raid's final boss, that also looks to be a familiar face--the dreadlord Balnazzar. Previously seen in the game's Stratholme dungeon posing as a member of the Scarlet Crusade, it looks like he has now attempted a full-blown coup, and it will be up to players to dethrone him once and for all.</p><p dir="ltr">What will be next for WoW Classic Season of Discovery is still unknown, but Blizzard has said the experimental seasonal servers will continue to exist in some form even after new content is no longer in development. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-within-next-major-update-is-going-full-goblin-mode/1100-6527723/" data-ref-id="1100-6527723">WoW: The War Within just received its goblin-themed Season 2 update</a>, as Blizzard continues to share more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-housing-will-allow-for-plenty-of-nitty-gritty-interior-decoration-options/1100-6530083/" data-ref-id="1100-6530083">details on the MMORPG's highly anticipated player housing system</a>.</p>
