            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-account-system-pirate-yakuza-skin<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has introduced a brand new unified account system that promises to give you access to rewards when playing either Sega or Atlus games, as well as "using their online services". The first of those bonuses is available to grab right now if you sign up.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://sega-account.com/auth/content/notice/01JJ1QNG67ZW54BR35EAZRAJ7Y" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">notice</a> on its website, Sega says that signing up for an account will give you "the latest news" about Sega and Atlus games and promotions, and that it'll also grant you access to "exclusive bonuses", as well as "the ability to link accounts" across platforms.</p>

<p>Signing up before March 7th will give you access to a special&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/like-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-announced" rel="nofollow">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a>&nbsp;</em>skin, which lets protagonist Goro Majima wear the iconic gray suit sported by longtime series main character Kazuma Kiryu (except in&nbsp;<em>Infinite Wealth</em>, of course).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-majima-sega-account.jpg?itok=txvBflv7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-majima-sega-account.jpg?itok=myRBjEN_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can get yourself a free&nbsp;<em>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii&nbsp;</em>skin if you sign up for a Sega account.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, you won't be able to use the skin until the game itself comes out, and signing up for an account doesn't get you a copy of&nbsp;<em>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>, unfortunately. Still, if you're planning to play it anyway, signing up can't hurt, right?</p>

<p>If you want your free skin, you'll simply need to create a Sega account <a href="https://cp.sega-account.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>, then link it to a corresponding platform in order to redeem the skin on that platform. Obviously, you won't be able to redeem it on Switch, since&nbsp;<em>Pirate Yakuza&nbsp;</em>isn't coming out for that console.</p>

<p>Could the fact that Kiryu's iconic suit is appearing as a skin in the game perhaps portend further development of his story in&nbsp;<em>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>'s plot? I sure hope so, because&nbsp;<em>Infinite Wealth</em>'s ending left me desperate to know what happens to him next.</p>




<p>At the moment, there's no suggestion that the Sega account will become mandatory for playing Sega or Atlus' games, although I'm sure if that does happen, Sega and Atlus will know how their fans feel about it pretty quickly.</p>

<p>Sega has also <a href="https://sega-account.com/auth/content/notice/01JJ71YSH5ZR99A3GSYS1CMTTX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">acknowledged</a> that some users are having trouble authenticating their accounts, promising to resolve the issue soon. Hang on in there if that's you.</p>

<p>Xbox is increasing the size of external storage the Xbox Series consoles will support. In a new update coming to the consoles—Xbox Insiders will get first access to the feature—external hard drives larger than 16TB will now be compatible with the systems.</p>



<p>“We are enabling support for external USB drives larger than 16TB, so you can be sure your favorite games are always ready to play,”  the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/help/hardware-network/xbox-insider-release-notes/console/alpha-skip-ahead/2025/01/alpha-skip-ahead-2502-250120-2200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company said</a>. “Newly formatted drives that are larger than 16TB will be formatted with multiple partitions to utilize all available space for games and apps. These will appear as multiple devices in the storage devices list.”</p>



<p>While the company says that the update adds support for “drives larger than 16TB”, it doesn’t set a new limit. Based on that, it could be inferred that the partition method allows as large of a external drive as you can afford. If you already have a larger drive, Microsoft says they may need to be reformatted.</p>







<p>“Drives greater than 16TB that have already been formatted will be unaffected by this change and would need to be reformatted to take advantage of the updated support for larger drives,” they said. </p>



<p>This isn’t going to be the only news from Xbox this week as the company airs their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-january-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">annual Developer Direct</a> on January 23. Insider Gaming will have full coverage of all the news that comes from the showcase.</p>

Activision has revealed the season's new gameplay trailer, which features new multiplayer maps, more DLC weapons, and operator skins. The trailer also gives a first look at gameplay and Wonder Weapons for the upcoming Zombies map.</p><p dir="ltr">While most of the post-launch content for Black Ops 6 has forgotten about the game's '90s setting, the Season 2 trailer includes a remixed version of Bush's 1996 hit "Machinehead." Season 2 is themed around ninja-esque operators who are dual-wielding katanas, as seen in the trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXpnKJBhL48" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SXpnKJBhL48" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">One of the multiplayer maps shows gameplay inside a car dealership, which is simply called Dealership. Another multiplayer map features a super-yacht that looks similar to the Hijacked map from Black Ops 2, but this is apparently a new yacht map called Lifeline. A third map is called Bounty, but we don't get to see much of the setting. These three maps will arrive at launch, while two additional maps will drop during the midseason.</p><p dir="ltr">Zombies footage is also featured near the end of the trailer, giving the first look at gameplay on The Tomb map. It also reveals the map's unique Wonder Weapons, which are four staffs similar to the ones used on the fan-favorite Origins map from Black Ops 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Activision shared the new <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1881754960213512314" rel="nofollow ">promotional art for Season 2</a>, which reveals the katanas, PPSh-41 submachine gun, and FAL rifle as the new weapons in the game.</p><p>Season 2 will bring several game improvements, including the ability to turn off cross-play in Ranked Play modes.

One of these features is the bigger Joy-Con controllers which now connect to the screen via magnetic attachments. A brief clip on the company’s website gives us a better look at how it works, but it’s an innovation that Nintendo  first teased over eight years ago. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,193658,194644" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The current Switch has its Joy-Con controllers attach by sliding through a railing on the side until a locking mechanism clicks them into place. Owners then press a very (very) small black button on the back to release the mechanism to slide them back out again. With the Switch 2 there’s no sliding and seemingly a whole lot less friction overall, as the Joy-Con merely click into place and hold on through the force of magnets alone.</p><p>A short snippet recently published on Nintendo’s website shows this all happening in slow motion, including how the (much) bigger triggers on the back of the Joy-Con are held to release the magnets and pull the controllers back away from the screen. It’s a much more elegant solution and, if combined with other Joy-Con features like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1i31e7k/comment/m7p9qfn/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1i31e7k/comment/m7p9qfn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported anti-drift Hall Effect joysticks</a></span>, mouse-like optical sensors, and a mysterious new C button, could make the Switch 2 feel like a bigger upgrade than it initially appears. </p><p>But it turns out that magnetic Joy-Con, one of the primary points of speculation <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-trailer-date-nintendo-mario-kart-9-1851739487&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-trailer-date-nintendo-mario-kart-9-1851739487">throughout months of Switch 2 leaks</a></span>, weren’t actually a secret at all. Nintendo revealed it was exploring the feature as early as its pre-release breakdown of the original Switch back in 2017. Here is Nintendo executive and <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> producer Yoshiaki Koizumi teasing the design possibility to Nintendo of America’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl0XiEgng4LZFpYVDd8oR8A&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl0XiEgng4LZFpYVDd8oR8A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang</a></span>, all the way back then:</p><p>“We tried a lot of different things in terms of connecting the Joy-Con to the console and one that I was particularly excited about at the time was using magnets where you would just snap it right to the console, but as you would play sometimes it would just fall into your lap,” he said at the time. “But because we still wanted to have something that was sturdy enough for you to hold onto the console but also gave you that sort of satisfying snap that the magnets did that’s how we came up with the mechanical rails that give you a click.”</p><p>Nintendo has a way of making its inventions, whether in hardware or the games themselves, feel like they magically appeared out of nowhere, but often it turns out  that they were leftover ideas from long and arduous trial and error processes, later repurposed when the moment is right or newer tech makes them more feasible. So it seems to be with the Switch 2's magnets. I’m super-eager to try them myself and see how they hold up. Hopefully, Nintendo worked out all the kinks this time around. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mortal-kombat-1-sales-have-passed-5m.1088688/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-sales<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>co-creator Ed Boon has revealed the latest sales figures for&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>, the most recent entry in the long-running fighting game franchise, and it turns out the game is doing about as well as a recent indie smash hit.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1881825218538467395" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform X, Boon reveals that&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>is currently sitting at five million sales, as well as the fact that it's still ranking in the top 15 most-played games on PlayStation 5 (according to data that looks suspiciously similar to Circana's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-sales-data-july-circana" rel="nofollow">usual roundup</a>).</p>

<p>That figure puts&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>'s sales roughly on par with those of indie smash hit poker roguelike&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-5m" rel="nofollow">revealed to have hit the same milestone yesterday</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mortal-kombat-1-sales-fight.jpg?itok=IBARtKWX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mortal-kombat-1-sales-fight.jpg?itok=YG0Rx-Ir 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>has apparently reached five million sales.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course,&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>belongs to one of the longest-running fighting game franchises in the world, and it was also released several months before&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, so its achievement is perhaps a little more humble in that light.</p>

<p>Back in November 2023, around two months after&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>'s initial release, Warner Bros <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-eyes-more-live-services-as-mortal-kombat-1-sells-nearly-3-million-copies" rel="nofollow">revealed that the game had sold three million copies</a>. That means it's picked up another two million in just over a year.</p>

<p>Since launch,&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>has enjoyed a slew of crossovers that have no doubt boosted its profile. These have included DLC fighters like <i>Invincible</i>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-omni-man-gets-gameplay-reveal-november-release-window" rel="nofollow">Omni-Man</a>,&nbsp;<em>The Boys</em>' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-homelander-first-look" rel="nofollow">Homelander</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Peacemaker</em>'s...uh...<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-peacemaker-gameplay" rel="nofollow">Peacemaker</a>.</p>

<p>The game's latest crossover DLC fighter is Conan the Barbarian, and believe it or not, he's never appeared in a&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>game before, although another iconic Arnie character, the T-800 Terminator, was added to&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 11&nbsp;</em>as post-launch DLC.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>, it is, despite its name, the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>Released in September 2023, the game's story serves as another reboot, realigning some characters and reimagining others to create a new narrative continuity. It's still got plenty of the same blood-spattered fighting gameplay you know and love, though.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-does-1-ante-1-hand-each-round-mean-in-balatro-hieroglyph-voucher-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you’ve come across the Hieroglyph Voucher in Balatro and are unsure what it does, you’re in the right place. It stumped me, and my heart sank when I realized the full extent of what it did. Let’s avoid the same mistake happening to you.</p>



<p>Early games of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-has-announced-its-sold-5-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Balatro</a> are understandably a lot to take in. Jokers, Card Enhancements, Planets, Spectral modifiers, etc. But Balatro’s Hieroglyph Shop Voucher is a perfect example of how a simple misunderstanding can bring a run crumbling down. I took this the first time it appeared, having a vague idea of what it would do, and it didn’t help.</p>



<p>With greater understanding, I now know Hieroglyph’s full value and worth. Let me pass this knowledge on.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-hieroglyph-voucher-do-in-balatro">What Does Hieroglyph Voucher Do In Balatro?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>For those daring enough. Credit to LocalThunk</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Buying the Hieroglyph Voucher reduces your Ante by one, but you have one fewer Hand for every subsequent Blind you come up against from this point on.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-1-ante-explained">-1 Ante Explained</h3>



<p>When you start a game of <a href="https://www.playbalatro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Balatro</a>, you are immediately on <strong>Ante One of eight</strong>. If you beat the Boss Blind—after the Small and Big Blind—you progress to <strong>Ante Two</strong>, and so on.</p>



<p>Let’s say you’ve beaten the Small Blind on <strong>Ante Four</strong>. You go to the Shop and purchase Hieroglyph, and your Ante counter now changes to <strong>Ante Three.</strong> You have gone back a whole Ante!</p>



<h3 id="h-1-hand-explained">-1 Hand Explained</h3>



<p><strong>The default Hands you start with is usually four</strong>. Different Decks can change this, but by and large, you’re going to start with four. A Hand is the <strong>amount of times you’re allowed to submit cards in exchange for a score</strong>.</p>



<p>So, if you buy Hieroglyph and have four Hands available, <strong>this tally goes down to three</strong>. You now only have three chances to score points for any Blind you come up against.</p>



<h2 id="h-should-you-use-1-ante-1-hand-hieroglyph-voucher-in-balatro">Should You Use -1 Ante -1 Hand Hieroglyph Voucher in Balatro?</h2>



<p><strong>Hieroglyph should only be procured if you have an extremely effective strategy and you’re obliterating every Blind with a single hand.</strong></p>



<p>The Voucher is designed so that if your setup is OP, <strong>you get another Ante to make it even stronger</strong>. If you’re already destroying Blinds in one or two goes, losing a Hand won’t affect you. </p>



<p>You can also try Hieroglpyh if you’re<strong> struggling and desperately need something to turn your run around</strong>. This is very risky, and losing a Hand could sign your death sentence. The <strong>Paint Brush</strong> (+1&nbsp;Hand Size) and <strong>Palette </strong>(+1&nbsp;Hand Size again) Shop Vouchers are incredible additions to your arsenal if you can get them.</p>



<p>They negate the consequence of losing a Hand and can give you a clean reset. I pick and choose my Hieroglyph usage—mainly for those OP runs—but it’s a great tool to be more powerful and <strong>take your run into Endless Mode</strong>.</p>



<hr>

Additionally, your Sega Account grants you access to exclusive bonuses and the ability to link accounts on various gaming platforms."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The first of these benefits is the Kazuma Kiryu Special Outfit in Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, which lets protagonist Goro Majima dress up as his friend, rival, and longtime Yakuza series lead. This is the same outfit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-players-can-dress-up-majima-as-kiryu-if-they-sign-up-for-email-notifications">Sega is giving away for signing up to email notifications</a>, but it's unclear if that has now changed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those with a Sega Account between January 22 and March 7 will receive the outfit, distributed via a code between February 17 and March 7. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-release-date-brought-forward-a-week-to-avoid-monster-hunter-wilds-clash">Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii itself arrives on February 21</a>, brought forward from its original February 28 date to avoid a clash with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-hands-on-preview-exactly-what-i-hoped-for">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega didn't announce what future benefits fans could expect, but it will presumably include its other flagship franchises such as Sonic the Hedgehog and Persona. It could also tie into a Game Pass style subscription service Sega is currently considering.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As reported by the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgnj7e8028o" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC</a>, the company is currently "evaluating some opportunities" in the subscription service space and, just like PlayStation launched its Game Pass rival on the back of its established PlayStation Plus service, Sega could be setting the foundations for a similar move in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are also speculating a connection with the impending Sega "Super Game," expected to release by the end of March 2026. While practically nothing is known about this project, Sega described it as a "large scale global title" that many fans are expecting to be an accumulation of various games akin to what Call of Duty has done with its titles or what Ubisoft is working on with Assassin's Creed Infinity: essentially a hub for myriad other games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

NetherRealm development chief Ed Boon had teased fans over the years by referencing a pink ninja called Floyd, and, back in 2023, <a href="https://x.com/thethiny/status/1706734341982687374" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Mortal Kombat dataminer TheThiny</u></a> unearthed text in the Mortal Kombat 1 files that referenced a character of the same name. Only now though, years later, is Floyd actually in Mortal Kombat 1, although the specifics are hazy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Spoilers for Mortal Kombat 1’s secret Floyd fight follow:</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/thethiny/status/1881959728756191322" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TheThiny has revealed the secret Floyd fight</a>, which is preceded by a cool cutscene in which ninjas of various colors appear in beams of light before settling on our pink friend. You then get the unique “YOU FOUND FLOYD” text flash on-screen. The idea, it appears, is that Floyd is all Mortal Kombat’s ninjas in one, a bit like Chameleon from Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/22/screenshot-2025-01-22-120049-1737547291558.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Floyd is now in Mortal Kombat 1.

It’s unclear at the moment. TheThiny said the fight was discovered after a player completed “a bunch of Floyd challenges then he appears. This video was taken in the Towers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How many challenges must be completed? We’re not sure, but it’s a lot. Could it be that each challenge completion increases the chance Floyd will turn up? We’re not sure, but maybe?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players are still working out Floyd’s moveset, which appears to combine attacks and abilities from various characters on the roster. Floyd isn’t officially playable, but that hasn’t stopped dataminers from getting hands-on with the character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s super cool is that beating Floyd in this secret fight unlocks a brand new stage, the beautiful Field, which players have already noticed is from the Mortal Kombat 1 announcement trailer.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">New Stage:<br>Field<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MK1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MK1</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MortalKombat1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MortalKombat1</a> <a href="https://t.co/ygkarWNRhU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ygkarWNRhU</a></p>— thethiny 🐰🍉 (@thethiny) <a href="https://twitter.com/thethiny/status/1881782846047899712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 21, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">So, Floyd is in Mortal Kombat 1, which means Ed Boon has finally made good on his desire to add the character.

		<p>It seems the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> release date has leaked, the game set to launch on 15th May 2025 for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC, and naturally day one on applicable tiers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p>The leak has seemingly come from an article that was briefly posted online by Gamekult, spotted via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/doom-the-dark-ages-releasing-on-may-15-2025.1088169/">Resetera</a>, who may have been briefed ahead of time on the content of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/09/xbox-developer_direct-stream-will-feature-doom-the-dark-ages-more-on-23rd-january/">Xbox Developer_Direct stream that will take place tomorrow</a>, Thursday 23rd January.</p>


<p>Doom: The Dark Ages is a prequel to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/05/16/doom-review/">Doom 2016 reboot</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/17/doom-eternal-review/">Doom Eternal</a>, nipping back in time to the last time that the Doom Slayer was out and about for some demon bashing. You’ll go thoroughly medieval on those demons, which will include a mix of very familiar foes from the series as well as some all-new enemies.</p>
<p>The stream will feature the developers themselves to introduce their games and talk about them ahead of expected launches in 2025, and alongside Doom: The Dark Ages, it will be visiting Compulsion Games to talk about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a>, to Sandfall Interactive to look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/28/clair-obscur-expedition-33-preview-a-poignant-and-painterly-rpg/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, and one final surprise studio and game reveal – there’s been lots of rumours for an Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake…</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-apparently-leaks-ahead-of-developer-direct.1088655/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/doom-dark-ages-release-date-apparently-leaks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>release date may already have leaked ahead of the game's showing during tomorrow's Xbox Developer Direct presentation.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-announced" rel="nofollow">announced a Developer Direct</a> for January 23rd (that's tomorrow), during which the studio will be showing off&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>,&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, and&nbsp;<em>South of Midnight</em>, as well as an as-yet unrevealed fourth game.</p>

<p>Getting a release date for one or all of those games would make sense during said presentation, but it looks like a French publication may accidentally have already leaked the release date for&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, if a ResetEra user's sighting of an RSS feed listing is to be believed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-apparently-leaked-armor.jpg?itok=lkDB-wik 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-apparently-leaked-armor.jpg?itok=ikweDE3y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>' release date may already have been leaked.</figcaption></figure><p>ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/doom-the-dark-ages-releasing-on-may-15-2025.1088169/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Alexzan</a> says they were browsing their RSS feeds (essentially feeds that display website updates and information) on RSS app Feedly when they noticed an entry from French publication <a href="https://www.gamekult.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gamekult</a>.</p>

<p>The listing is, of course, in French. It reads as follows: "<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> décimera les légions infernales le 15 mai 2025".</p>

<p>You can probably work out roughly what that means on your own, but just in case, Alexzan helpfully provides a translation: "<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>will decimate the infernal legions on May 15th, 2025".</p>

<p>The article to which the listing should point is, of course, not currently available on Gamekult's website, but it would seem the publication has accidentally revealed a May 15th release date for the upcoming game. If it's legit, it was almost certainly published too early in error.</p>




<p>We'll almost certainly find out exactly when&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>is due to launch when the Developer Direct airs tomorrow. It's due to start at 1pm Eastern (which is 10am Pacific and about 6pm GMT).</p>

<p>When it does launch,&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>will arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3017860/DOOM_The_Dark_Ages/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/doom-the-dark-ages/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/doom-the-dark-ages" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. As a first-party Xbox game, it'll also be available on Game Pass on day one, but only for certain tiers.</p>

The feedback showed that gaming has been rocked by layoffs over the last 12 months, but also pointed to some silver linings for its growth and future heading into 2025. </p><p>This year is expected to be a massive one for gaming between the launch of Nintendo’s highly-anticipated new Switch 2 console and the long-awaited arrival of <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>, the sequel to the second-best-selling game ever made. But 2025 is also expected to be another year full of potential upheaval as the video game industry tries to figure its shit out amid both audience stagnation and record competition between the hundreds of high-quality new games released every month. </p><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://reg.gdconf.com/state-of-game-industry-2025?_mc=edit_gdcsf_gdcsf_le_x_10_x_2025&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://reg.gdconf.com/state-of-game-industry-2025?_mc=edit_gdcsf_gdcsf_le_x_10_x_2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2025 GDC State of the Game Industry report</a></span>, whose data was compiled from the responses of over 3,000 developers, showed game makers are still reeling from cuts across publishers and studios both big and small (NYU associate professor Laine Nooney discussed some of the limits of the data <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/lainenooney.bsky.social/post/3lgbfp7nmdk2o&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/lainenooney.bsky.social/post/3lgbfp7nmdk2o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></span>). Eleven percent of respondents said they were laid off in 2025, with over 40 percent of developers feeling the immediate impact of those departures. They’re also feeling the effects of generative AI, with over 50 percent of respondents saying their companies use the tools and roughly one third saying they have personally used them to make games. </p><p>Live-service games are another area in which developers are increasingly skeptical. Amid major flops like <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League </em>and <em>Concord</em>, roughly one-third of developers at big-budget studios said they’re currently working on an online multiplayer game, but 41 percent of all developers said they’d rather be working on anything but a live-service project. That sentiment comes alongside conflicting signals from players, with Sony cutting even more live-service projects even as hero shooter <em>Marvel Rivals</em> explodes as one of the most successful new online games in years (for the time being, anyway).</p><p>One area for optimism? PC gaming. The 2025 GDC State of the Game Industry survey found that more developers than ever are planning their games for the open platform. The number of developers who said they’re working on a PC game grew from 66 percent in 2024 to 80 percent this year. The report speculates that this could be due in part to the popularity of Valve’s Steam Deck, which combines the convenience of a Nintendo Switch with the vast library of Steam games. (PC gaming has also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/new-report-says-pc-games-are-outselling-console-games-calling-pc-gaming-a-bright-spot-in-a-troubled-industry/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/new-report-says-pc-games-are-outselling-console-games-calling-pc-gaming-a-bright-spot-in-a-troubled-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grown by 20 percent since 2021 according to some estimates</a></span>, even as console gaming has stalled.)</p><p>GDC, which runs March 17-21 this year, includes curated video game history installations, award shows, and talks in which developers share stories and insights from their experiences making hugely successful and/or historically significant games  (GDC 2025 includes presentations on <em>Astro Bot</em>, <em>Helldivers 2</em>, and more). But it’s also a place where funding deals for new releases, from small indie games to bigger projects, get hatched. How to secure development funding while the industry is in flux is one of the big topics the conference plans to focus on this year.</p><p>  “The lack of opportunities in the game industry spills into funding opportunities,” one anonymous developer said in the survey. “Unless you have something that will be live-service or the potential to be super viral, it’s not easy to find a publisher.”</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d069670ac0f04af574f0c285b9554d42" data-recommend-id="image://d069670ac0f04af574f0c285b9554d42" data-format="png" data-width="1304" data-height="734" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the breakdown of what platforms developers are creating games for.

That’s followed next by PS5 at a rate of 38 percent and Xbox Series X/S at 34 percent. (Games can come to multiple platforms, of course, hence the total here far exceeding 100 percent.) Developers were also surveyed about their upcoming projects, and that data shows the console numbers going just slightly down, with 37 percent of these upcoming projects targeting PS5 and 33 percent coming to Xbox Series X/S. Switch 2, meanwhile, is trending the other way, leaping from an 8-percent target rate for developers’ current projects to 20 percent for their next ones. Meanwhile, despite PlayStation edging out Xbox as a development target, when it comes to subscription services,  Game Pass is still more popular to develop for than PS Plus. Thirteen percent of developers are working on games for Microsoft’s service while only nine percent are targeting Sony’s rival one. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="52e5853c94eae704ce19fdd70bab900e" data-recommend-id="image://52e5853c94eae704ce19fdd70bab900e" data-format="png" data-width="1295" data-height="727" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A chart shows developer interest in various VR/AR platforms.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-spring-festival-rocket-league-mode<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase Games has revealed a brand new event for hero shooter&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>. The Spring Festival event arrives tomorrow, bringing with it a whole new game mode and some shiny new skins.</p>

<p>Kicking off on January 23rd at 9am UTC (that's 4am Eastern and 1am Pacific), the Spring Festival event's main draw is its Clash of Dancing Lions limited-time mode, which will look familiar to you if you've ever played&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/rocket-league" rel="nofollow"><em>Rocket League</em></a>.</p>

<p>Teams of three compete against one another on a dedicated map, with each team aiming to gain possession of a ball and make sure it enters the opposing team's scoring zone. Whoever reaches "a predetermined score" first will be declared the winner.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-spring-festival-new-mode-gameplay.jpg?itok=agXvRQcg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-spring-festival-new-mode-gameplay.jpg?itok=TRUuuJux 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel Rivals</em>' new mode will be familiar to you if you've played&nbsp;<em>Rocket League</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The trailer for the event shows Star-Lord, Iron Fist, and Black Widow competing in the event, but it'll likely be open to all heroes; those are just the characters getting new skins as part of the Spring Festival.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, three Clashing Lions-themed skins have been introduced for those heroes. Star-Lord gets a fetching Lion's Mane costume, Black Widow gets a Lion's Heartbeat outfit, and Iron Fist gets a Lion's Gaze look.</p>

<p>They're all essentially themed around the same traditional Chinese lion dance motif, and they all look pretty excellent. At the very least, you'll be able to earn Star-Lord's outfit through "completing tasks", although it isn't clear whether you can earn the other two that way as well.</p>

<p>Additionally, since&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/marvels-spider-man-2" rel="nofollow">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>&nbsp;</em>is landing on PC soon, NetEase says a new&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man 2</em>-themed bundle will be available in&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' store, complete with a new outfit for Spidey, as well as a new nameplate and spray. Those are launching on January 30th.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, it's a free-to-play hero shooter developed and published by Chinese studio NetEase. Similar in many ways to&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>, the game pits Marvel heroes like Black Widow, Captain America, and Venom against one another in objective-based gameplay modes.</p>

<p>The game has proven popular among players, reaching a player count of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-10m" rel="nofollow">10 million within a 72-hour period</a>. It's also attracted the attention of modders, who have already <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-modding-workaround" rel="nofollow">found a way around</a> an apparent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-modding-clampdown" rel="nofollow">clampdown on skin modding</a> introduced alongside&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' first season.</p>

<p>You can play&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvel-rivals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marvel-rivals/9n8pmw7qmd3d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

Plus, 15 minutes of new gameplay was showcased during the Taipei Game Show 2025 Special Program for the game. <span id="more-939549"></span></p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p>In the latest entry of the <em>Atelier</em> franchise, players can freely explore the Aladiss continent by discovering ruins, uncovering hidden treasures, and encountering brand-new characters. A newly unveiled overview trailer gives fans a deeper look at the game system, while a brand-new key visual by Benitama has also been released to the public to help celebrate the upcoming game.</p><p><em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</em> follows the adventures of Yumia Liessfeldt and her companions as they set off on a journey to unravel the mysteries behind the cataclysm that destroyed the once great continent of Aladiss, resulting in alchemy becoming taboo. In her quest, Yumia will be assisted by Flammi, a flying, self-confident traveling companion who once belonged to her mother. Yumia will also encounter many different characters throughout her travels including Licht, a highly skilled informant; Wilma, an anthropologist with a passion for the culture of Aladiss; Erhard, the leader of the Research Team; and the Alber, a small and friendly tribe who live in various parts of the world.</p><p>Throughout Yumia’s adventures, players will explore dungeons and ruins in search of hidden treasures including “memory vials” – remnants of the past that will allow them to consult certain information on the field such as the location of relic treasure around them. “Memory vials” can also be dismantled to obtain rare materials which are useful for synthesis.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_939581"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>By using the treasure trove keys found during their journey, players will be able to access precious treasures. They can find “trait crystals,” which can be used on items or equipment to improve performance from treasure chests. As they venture into Aladiss, fans will also find “mana geysers” which will release “particles” needed to unlock new synthesis recipes.</p><p>In <em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</em>, exploration will not be without its dangers, however, as players will sometimes have to venture into “manabound areas” where highly dense mana lies stagnant. Entering these areas will gradually deplete players’ energy, making it impossible to run while also reducing abilities in battle. Players will be able to restore their health by finding Alstahlia Flowers, while discovering and restoring landmarks will clear the area and improve ease of exploration.</p><p>While progressing through the story, players will receive exclusive quests from their travelling companions, but will also be able to gain rewards by completing normal quests. Discovering and unlocking landmarks and Shrines of Prayers during exploration will grant them with location quests.</p></blockquote><p><em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,685 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,590 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,608 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,713 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,539 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,170 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3123410/Atelier_Yumia_The_Alchemist_of_Memories__the_Envisioned_Land/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> on March 21 worldwide.</p><p>Watch the footage below.

<p>After <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/the-thing-after-the-switch-how-overheard-chatter-led-to-a-nintendo-goose-chase/">literal years</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/07/report-nintendos-next-console-ships-late-2024-still-supports-cartridges/">speculation and leaks</a>, it was nice to get <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/its-official-take-a-first-look-at-the-switch-2/">an actual glimpse of the Switch 2 hardware</a> (and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/how-big-is-the-switch-2-trailer-suggests-7-9-screen-10-5-width-w-joy-cons/">its increased size</a>) last week. But even with the console officially "revealed," there's still a wide range of important unknown Switch 2 details that Nintendo has yet to address.</p>
<p>As we wait for the company to dribble out additional information in the coming weeks and months, we thought we'd take a quick look at the biggest outstanding questions and concerns we still have about Nintendo's next gaming platform, along with some analysis of what we know, what we can guess, and what we expect on each score.</p>
<h2>Launch date?</h2>
<p>The teaser trailer's promise of a "2025" Switch 2 release technically covers any launch date between "tomorrow" and December 31. But we can probably narrow that window down a bit.</p>
<p>For one, Nintendo promised "a closer look at Switch 2" in <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/successor/en-us/nintendo-direct/index.html">a Direct video presentation scheduled for April 2</a>. It would be a little weird for that "closer look" to come after the console itself was launched, so a launch before April seems out of the question.</p>

<p>Nintendo is also planning <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-switch-2-experience/">a series of worldwide "Nintendo Switch 2" hands-on experiences</a> through which consumers will be able to try the console for themselves. Again, it would be odd to run an exclusive, ticket-limited hands-on experience if the console was already available in stores. The latest Switch Experience event is currently scheduled for May 31 through June 1 in Seoul, South Korea, making a Switch 2 release before June seem unlikely (though a staggered regional rollout could change this calculus).</p>
<p>Before the Switch launched in March of 2017, Nintendo's previous three home consoles all launched in November, dating back to <a href="https://archive.arstechnica.com/archive/2001/0901-1.html">the GameCube in 2001</a>. Don't be shocked if Nintendo reverts to form and waits until the high-impact holiday sales windows near the end of the 2025 for the Switch 2's release.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<h2>Price?</h2>
<p>When the Switch launched in 2017, its $300 price point was actually a little higher than the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2017/02/09/sony-just-gave-ps4-a-price-cut/">contemporary prices for the aging PS4</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/10/15776370/microsoft-xbox-one-s-price-drop-e3-2017">Xbox One</a>. And Nintendo has steadfastly managed to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/08/will-the-nintendo-switch-ever-see-a-price-drop/">avoid offering a single price drop</a> on the best-selling console since then (though inflation has lowered the value of that pricing a bit, and the Switch OLED <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/switch-oled-review-nintendos-nicest-most-nonessential-upgrade-yet/">came in at $350 in 2021</a>).</p>

              While the nominal price of the original Switch hasn't changed, inflation has eaten into its "real" price a bit.

<p>In the meantime, Sony has actually raised the PS5's (already significant) launch price <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/08/sony-raises-playstation-5-console-prices-in-many-regions-effective-immediately/">in many regions</a>&nbsp;and has seen <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-700-price-tag-isnt-hurting-ps5-pros-early-sales/">strong initial sales for the $700 PS5 Pro</a>. On the other side, Microsoft's $300 Xbox Series S <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/leaked-microsoft-documents-show-the-xbox-series-s-might-be-more-popular-than-you-think">seems to be vastly outselling</a> the $500 Series X, showing there is still quite a bit of sensitivity to console pricing in the market.</p>
<p>Taking all that into account, a $350 to $400 asking price for the Switch 2 doesn't seem out of the question. But Nintendo has surprised us with both <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2006/09/7743/">lower than expected</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/03/a-beautiful-screen-a-weak-battery-a-door-to-the-future-ars-reviews-the-nintendo-3ds/">higher than expected</a> hardware launch pricing in the past, so we wouldn't bet the farm on where this one ends up.</p>

<h2>Games?</h2>
<p>While it was neat to see a few brief seconds of what we assume is <em>Mario Kart 9</em> in the Switch 2 teaser trailer, it would be nice to hear more about what first-party games Nintendo has planned for that all-important launch window.</p>

<p>Nintendo could follow the example of the original Switch and launch with a new <em>Zelda</em> title again, but this seems a bit unlikely since we're still <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/hands-on-with-tears-of-the-kingdoms-zelda-meets-minecraft-construction-set/">less than two years out from <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>. A new full-fledged 3D Mario adventure—perhaps expanding on some of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury-review-everything-old-is-new-again/">the open-world ideas from <em>Bowser's Fury</em></a>—seems like a better bet this time around, given how long it has been since 2017's best-selling <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> (which continued Nintendo's long tradition of launching a Mario game in a new console's first year).</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>And let's not forget about <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, which Nintendo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/seven-years-later-nintendo-proves-metroid-prime-4-still-exists/">officially teased last summer</a>, long after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/06/core-pokemon-rpg-metroid-prime-4-coming-to-nintendo-switch/">its original 2017 announcement</a>. The planned 2025 release seems perfectly aligned to be a big launch title for Nintendo's new system.</p>
<h2>Battery life?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/how-big-is-the-switch-2-trailer-suggests-7-9-screen-10-5-width-w-joy-cons/">additional size</a> of the Switch 2 tablet could offer a bit more space to squeeze in some bulky rechargeable batteries. But those batteries will be powering a much larger display this time around, as well as some more powerful internal hardware.</p>
<p>We'd expect this trade to roughly come out as a wash and for the Switch 2 to match the 4.5 to 9 hours of battery life that Nintendo quotes for modern Switch consoles, depending on the game being played.</p>
<h2>Weight?</h2>
<p>At less than a pound, the Switch has always been less heavy to hold for extended periods than modern portable gaming PCs like the Steam Deck (1.4 lbs) or the Lenovo Legion Go (1.88 lbs). The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/how-big-is-the-switch-2-trailer-suggests-7-9-screen-10-5-width-w-joy-cons/">upsized</a> Switch 2 will likely add a little bit of weight over its predecessor, but we'd be surprised if it ends up significantly heavier on a relative basis.</p>

<p>Nintendo's long history of handheld consoles has always prioritized designs that are comfortable for the smaller hands and arms of younger players. We don't expect that to change significantly for the Switch 2.</p>
<h2>Hardware power?</h2>
<p>Back in 2023, leaks suggested that the Switch 2 would be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/what-do-we-know-about-the-switch-2s-hardware-power/">powered by an Nvidia T239-based chip</a>. That mobile-focused chip would be a significant step up from the Tegra X1 in the original Switch—which was considered slightly underpowered <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/12/nintendo-switch-nvidia-tegra-x1-specs-speed/">even when it launched in 2017</a>—but still only roughly equivalent to <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-rtx-2050-mobile.c3859">a 2021-era RTX 2050 Mobile chipset</a>&nbsp;as far as graphical performance is concerned. Still, that would be enough for some fancy graphical features like hardware-accelerated ray-tracing and DLSS upscaling on at least some games.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>In <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/what-do-we-know-about-the-switch-2s-hardware-power/">a speculative piece</a> based on those leaks, Digital Foundry said this kind of chipset could likely manage a "far from pristine" but "decent [upscaled] image on a 4K living room TV." That seems like a reasonable guess, and it could be a good excuse for publishers to re-release new versions of some late PS4/early PS5-era hits for Nintendo's next portable.</p>
<h2>Screen resolution/quality?</h2>
<p>The 720p screen on the original Switch was a revelation after decades of Nintendo handhelds with notably low-resolution screens. Since the launch of the 800p Steam Deck in 2022, though, most portable PC makers have opted for a full 1080p display or higher for their handheld offerings.</p>
<p>Increased resolution could be even more important on the Switch 2 if Nintendo wants to maintain a decent pixels-per-inch ratio on the new console's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/how-big-is-the-switch-2-trailer-suggests-7-9-screen-10-5-width-w-joy-cons/">expanded screen size</a>. Previous Nintendo consoles like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/switch-oled-review-nintendos-nicest-most-nonessential-upgrade-yet/">Switch OLED</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/02/new-nintendo-3ds-xl-review-return-to-the-third-dimension/">3DS XL</a> show what happens when you expand the screen real estate but not the pixel resolution of an existing platform.</p>

<p>While a full 1080p screen would likely increase the Switch 2's materials cost a bit, it's a price Nintendo is likely ready to pay to show off the power of the Switch 2 in portable mode. Don't expect a pricey OLED screen at launch, though—if the Switch is any indication, Nintendo will save that for a mid-generation upgrade in a few years.</p>

<h2>Compatibility with old hardware?</h2>
<p>While Nintendo has stressed that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-will-play-original-switch-games/">your old Switch software will still work on the Switch 2</a>, it has so far been less clear on whether all your old Switch controllers and accessories will be compatible with the new console.</p>
<p>First- and third-party Switch controllers simply use the Bluetooth standard, which Nintendo seems overwhelmingly likely to keep using for the Switch 2. Given that, there's little reason that wireless Switch controllers shouldn't continue to work on the Switch 2. The same goes for wired USB controllers and wired accessories like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/10/your-old-gamecube-controllers-now-work-with-the-nintendo-switch/">the GameCube controller adapter</a>.</p>

<p>Using your old Switch Joy-Cons in portable mode is a different matter, as the Switch 2 seems to lack the physical plastic "rail" needed to slide those controllers into place. But since the Switch 2 comes packaged with new, larger Joy-Cons, there aren't many situations where you would need to physically connect your old controllers anyway.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 teaser trailer briefly showed a more rounded Switch 2 dock, suggesting that the new console might not be able to connect via docks designed for the original console. What's currently unclear is whether that dock upgrade is primarily cosmetic or houses some new internal circuitry necessary for upscaling Switch 2 games on the big screen.</p>
<h2>Improved performance for old games?</h2>
<p>If you own a Switch, you're probably used to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/11/dooms-switch-port-playable-but-a-distinct-visual-downgrade/">stuttering frame rates</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/the-switcher-is-real-witcher-3-on-switch-is-a-blurry-tolerable-compromise/">other performance issues</a> on the system's more taxing 3D titles. The additional hardware power of the Switch 2 could theoretically help these legacy games run more smoothly, much as it does for backward-compatible software on recent Sony and Microsoft systems.</p>
<p>Nintendo will likely follow its competitors' lead in this regard to some extent. The biggest question is how much work developers will need to put in to unlock the best performance for original Switch games on the Switch 2.</p>

<p>On the PlayStation 5 Pro, for instance, developers have <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/04/ps5-pro-50-enhanced-games-available-at-launch-november-7/">needed to patch in "Enhanced" versions</a> to take full advantage of the console's power. Titles without those specially designed patches simply get a less optimized "PS5 Pro Game Boost," which <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-game-boost-significant-improvements-final-fantasy-xvi-xiv/">can still offer some significant improvements</a>.</p>
<h2>Switch Online?</h2>
<p>Nintendo has confirmed your current Switch Online account will still work with the Switch 2. But the company hasn't confirmed which perks from that subscription will carry over to the new system.</p>

<p>The expansive <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/09/welcome-to-nes-flix-testing-nintendo-onlines-new-8-bit-library-on-switch/">Switch Online classic game library</a> is the biggest perk in question here. Since the Switch 2 is backward-compatible with old Switch software, it would be a bit odd to suddenly cut off the emulated game library that is a core of the Switch Online experience. But Nintendo has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/05/sorry-the-switch-isnt-getting-wii-style-virtual-console-downloads/">shut down access</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/rip-virtual-console-nintendo-will-shut-off-wii-u-3ds-game-downloads/">officially emulated games in the past</a>, so it's not out of the question.</p>
<p>It's also worth remembering that Switch Online subscriptions haven't increased in price <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/09/nintendos-first-ever-paid-online-service-launches-on-switch-sept-18/">since they started in late 2018</a>, despite years of higher-than-normal inflation. The launch of a new console could serve as a good excuse for Nintendo to foist a price increase onto consumers.</p>

                <p>Ask any collector of Game Boy Advances games what their holy grail is, and chances are high that Ninja Five-O is on that list. A cult-classic action game released by Konami way back in 2003, physical GBA copies are typically listed for a very high price on the reseller market, but fortunately, you can save quite a bit on its upcoming digital release for PC, PS5, PS4, and Switch on February 25.

Just like in the original GBA game, you'll take on the evil Mad Mask gang using your ninjutsu, and for anyone looking for a real challenge, you can put your ninja arts to the test with a Time Trial mode. Quality-of-life updates include quick-saves and the option to rewind the game at any time to help you get through some of the tougher stages.</p><p>Anyone looking to score a physical edition of Ninja Five-O can also check out Limited Run Games for a hard copy.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-movie-set-for-march-2027-release.1088598/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-hedgehog-4-movie-march-2027<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paramount has already announced a release date for the fourth&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>movie, despite the fact that the third movie was only made available to stream yesterday (and that it's still available to watch in some theaters).</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/sonic-4-release-date-march-2027-1236280697/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Variety</a>,&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4&nbsp;</em>will be launching on March 19th, 2027. Obviously, that date is more than two years away, but hey, I suppose&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>movie fans need something to look forward to.</p>

<p><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4&nbsp;</em>won't necessarily be the movie's final title, but if it follows the naming conventions of its two predecessors, then it probably won't bear any kind of secondary name. Don't expect&nbsp;<em>Sonic 4: The Rise of Robotnik&nbsp;</em>or anything anytime soon.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-movie-release-date-sonic-3-shot.jpg?itok=XODQS-Vq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-movie-release-date-sonic-3-shot.jpg?itok=NIohTK_b 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The fourth&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>movie will be hitting theaters in March 2027.</figcaption></figure><p>A <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fourth-sonic-hedgehog-movie-2027-report" rel="nofollow">report back in December</a> (also courtesy of Variety) already revealed that a fourth&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>movie was confirmed before the proverbial ink on the third one was dry, but now we know exactly when we can expect it.</p>

<p>Of course, we still don't know what kind of story details we can expect from the movie, although the post-credits scenes included in the third installment are probably strong clues as to where it's headed.</p>

<p>The third movie's post-credits scenes (look away now if you don't want spoilers!) confirm that Shadow survived the events of the film, and they also tease the appearance of both Metal Sonic and Amy Rose in the next movie.</p>

<p>As such, we can probably expect&nbsp;<em>Sonic 4&nbsp;</em>to focus on both characters, and Keanu Reeves' Shadow the Hedgehog will probably be returning as well. Naturally, all of this is speculation until the movie is officially revealed.</p>




<p>The existence of a fourth&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>movie makes a lot of sense given how well the previous three have done in financial terms.</p>

<p>According to Paramount, between them, the three&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>films have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-1b-box-office" rel="nofollow">crossed $1 billion at the box office</a>, and since that report was released earlier this month, that number's likely to be higher by now as well.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4&nbsp;</em>releases on March 19th, 2027. Don't expect to hear anything more about the movie for a while given how far off that date is.</p>
