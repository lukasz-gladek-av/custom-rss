                <p>Amazon has revealed<i> </i><em>five </em>new Kindles, including its first full-color e-ink tablet. The <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN3XR57P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Colorsoft</a></strong> is a brand-new addition to the lineup, and it's a potential game changer for fans of comic books and graphic novels. You can already read digital comics on any Kindle reader, but unless it has black-and-white illustrations, you lose a key component of the story. If the Kindle Colorsoft works well, you will be able to read all of your favorite full-color comics, graphic novels, and manga as intended, with the inherit benefits of an e-ink display. It releases October 30 and is available to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN3XR57P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorder now for $280</a>.</p><p>The Kindle Colorsoft sounds even more appealing when you consider Amazon's <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/cu/signup?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Comixology Unlimited subscription service</a></strong>. Comixology Unlimited offers over 45,000 comics, graphic novels, and manga for $10 per month (after a free 30-day trial). The catalog includes comics and graphic novels published by Marvel, DC, Dark Horse, Image, and other leaders in the visual storytelling medium. <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Unlimited</a></strong> also has graphic novels and manga, but Amazon's $12/month flagship reading subscription service has a much larger focus on novels.</p><p>The Kindle Colorsoft releases <strong>October 30</strong> and is available to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN3XR57P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorder now for $280</a>. We've rounded up all five of the new Kindles below, including the updated <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZ9VFQ2P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Scribe</a></strong> with improved note-taking features, a faster version of the ever-popular <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFPJYX7P?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Paperwhite</a></strong> in models geared for adults and kids, and an <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CNV9F72P?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">upgraded entry-level Kindle</a></strong>.</p><p><strong>Quick look: Amazon's All-New Kindles</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Preorder Now</strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN3XR57P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Colorsoft</a> -- $280 | Releases October 30</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZ9VFQ2P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Scribe</a> -- Starting at $400 | Releases December 4</li></ul></li><li><strong>Available Now</strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFPJYX7P?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Paperwhite</a> -- Starting at $160 | Available Now</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFPS7ZY9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Paperwhite Kids</a> -- Starting at $180</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFPS7ZY9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle</a> -- $110</li></ul></li></ul><div title="[Various] Kindle Colorsoft" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2751" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] Kindle Colorsoft" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN3XR57P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CN3XR57P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN3XR57P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Kindle Colorsoft</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN3XR57P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CN3XR57P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN3XR57P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$280 | Save 20% with Eligible Trade-In | Releases October 30</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Kindle Colorsoft has a 7-inch full-color display that lasts up to eight weeks on a full charge, which is pretty remarkable for a color e-ink tablet. Designed to be used anywhere, the Colorsoft's front light will automatically adjust to your surroundings. The high-contrast screen has built-in anti-glare technology to help create the Kindle's signature paper-like reading experience, just with a full color palette this time around. While reading, you can highlight passages in color, which sounds like a nice little benefit for those who regularly like to revisit to share their favorite sentences.</p><p>Amazon has labeled the launch-model Colorsoft a "Signature Edition." This may sound a bit confusing since it's the only model available at launch, but Kindle Signature Editions offer a handful of upgrades versus lower-priced models: support for wireless charging, auto-adjusting front light, no ads, and 32GB of storage. Signature Editions also have metallic chassises. The Metallic Black Colorsoft checks all of the Signature Edition boxes.</p><p>Amazon says it's totally safe to read in the bathtub or the pool, as the Colorsoft has an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=18116670011&amp;ref=ods_me_waterproof&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IPX8 water resistance rating</a>. In lab tests, the Colorsoft still functioned after being immersed in 6.5 feet (2 meters) of fresh water for up to 60 minutes. You probably won't want to bring the Kindle with you in ocean, though, as it's only graded for three minutes of immersion at less than 0.8 feet (0.25 meters) of depth.</p><p>As mentioned, the Colorsoft is especially exciting for fans of comic books, graphic novels, and manga. Being able to read your favorite graphic novels in color on a paper-like display could bring those who have wanted to switch to digital but weren't keen on the idea of looking at black-and-white illustrations into the ereader community.</p><p>At $280, the Colorsoft is cheaper than the Scribe but a good bit pricier than the Paperwhite. Amazon is running one of its generous trade-in promotions for existing Amazon device owners that can save you some serious cash. Trade-in values for your old devices vary, but what doesn't change is the 20% discount on the Colorsoft. You'll automatically save $56 plus however much you get for your old device. Click the "Save 20% with Trade-in" banner below the price to instantly see trade-in values for eligible devices. It doesn't even need to be a Kindle. Other devices, including cheap Fire TV Sticks, can get you the 20%-off deal.</p><p>Amazon is also offering a deal on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Amazon-Essentials-Plant-Based-Cover-Black/dp/B0DJ3RRNQX?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Colorsoft Essentials Bundle</a>, which comes with a plant-based leather cover and a wireless charging dock/stand for $328. You're saving $35 by purchasing the bundle compared to buying the Colorsoft and both accessories separately. Cases are available to purchase separately, too. Amazon has <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Paperwhite-Lightweight-Water-Safe-Protective/dp/B0DGNVSYR5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fabric protective covers</a> in three color options for $37, while the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Amazon-Plant-Based-Lightweight-Sustainability/dp/B0DGNSVTFK?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">leatherette covers</a> are $43. That means you'd spend $317 or $323 for the Colorsoft and one of the cases. The Kindle Colorsoft Essentials Bundle is probably the way to go here, as you'll only spend $5-$11 more to get the charging stand thrown in, too.</p></div>                      </div><p>Color e-ink has become a trend over the past year. Kobo, Amazon's biggest competitor, released its own full-color e-ink reader in April. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kobo-Glare-Free-KaleidoTM-Audiobooks-Waterproof/dp/B0CZXX465Z?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kobo Libra Colour</a> has a 7-inch full-color display and 32GB of storage for $220. But switching between brands after years of use is tough, as Amazon and Kobo have unique digital storefronts and file formats. You can't read Kindle ebooks on Kobo devices and vice-versa.</p><p>Most of the color e-ink tablets available now are more comparable to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZ9VFQ2P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Scribe</a> as hybrid readers, note-taking, and productivity devices. For instance, Android e-ink tablet manufacturer Boox has released a few different full-color options, including the 7.8-inch <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Tablet-Tab-Mini-ePaper/dp/B0CCJCXN25?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Boox Tab Mini C</a> for $400, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Tablet-Note-Air-ePaper/dp/B0CHF423CP?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">10.3-inch Note Air 3 C</a>, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Tab-Ultra-Pro-Digital/dp/B0CHM54YZK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">10.3-inch Tab Ultra C Pro</a> for productivity for $650.</p><p>And then there's reMarkable, the manufacturer behind the most popular note-taking e-ink tablet not made by Amazon, released its own full-color tablet in September. The $629 <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1856639036910958843%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Famazon-kindle-colorsoft-e-ink-color-ereader-comic-books-new-kindle-models-2024%2F1100-6527202%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reMarkable Paper Pro</a> has an 11.8-inch display and is designed to replicate the experience of writing in a notebook.</p><p>Perhaps the next iteration of the Kindle Scribe will join the color e-ink party, too. For now, here's what's new with the Kindle Scribe and Amazon's other black-and-white ereaders.</p><p>All of the new Kindles are eligible for Amazon's 20%-off trade-in promotion.</p><div title="6527202 - Kindle Preorders" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2750" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6527202 - Kindle Preorders" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZ9VFQ2P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CZ9VFQ2P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZ9VFQ2P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Kindle Scribe (2024)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZ9VFQ2P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CZ9VFQ2P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZ9VFQ2P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Starting at $400 | Releases December 4</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The updated Kindle Scribe now features new white borders, an updated screen with a paper-like texture for an improved writing experience, and a new Active Canvas feature that lets you write notes directly in your books. It comes bundled with the Premium Pen so you can draw, doodle, or jot down reminders during a meeting. It’s large 10.2-inch display is a good size for both reading or writing, and you can even share your files via email if you want to access them off your tablet.</p><p>The Kindle Scribe starts at $400 and is available in three different storage configurations: 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB. All three capacities can be purchased with a Tungsten chassis, and the 64GB is also available in Metallic Jade.</p><p>Multiple <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle-Scribe-Essentials-including/dp/B0DB2SP9VV?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Scribe Essential Bundles</a> are eligible for preorder discounts. For the 16GB model, the Essentials Bundle with a plant-based leather folio and AC adapter costs $435. Official Kindle Scribe cases cost more than $35, so if you preorder this one, it'd be a good idea to opt for one of the bundles.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-fortnite-ranks-in-order/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Venturing down the road of competitive Fortnite, but not sure exactly how many ranks there are in competitive? The popular game mode is full of some of the best sweats in the game, making it a hefty challenge to move up. Here is a list of all the Fortnite ranks in order from worst to best.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-ranks">Fortnite Ranks</h2>



<p>The ranking system in Fortnite is similar to many other games as it starts with Bronze and then moves up. However, higher up in the ranking system is where the game differs from others.</p>



<p><strong>Here are all the Fortnite ranks in order:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze (I, II, III)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver (I, II, III)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold (I, II, III)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Platinum (I, II, III)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Diamond (I, II, III)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Elite</strong></li>



<li><strong>Champion</strong></li>



<li><strong>Unreal</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>After Diamond, each ranking is no longer split up into threes. Elite, Champion and Unreal are all their own ranking.</p>



<h6 id="h-ranked-esports-events-calendar-2024-every-tournament-you-need-to-see">Ranked:<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/esports-events-calendar-2024/"> Esports Events Calendar 2024 | Every Tournament You Need to See</a></h6>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-s-old-system">Fortnite’s Old System</h2>



<p>Did you know that Fortnite used to have a completely different system for Ranked? In fact, it was not even called Ranked, instead, it was titled “Arena.”</p>



<p>Arena first left the game back in 2023, when Ranked officially replaced it. So, what was Arena? Well, the game mode went off of points and not rankings. </p>



<p>There were three different divisions, Open, Contender and Champion. Players who wanted to compete in FNCS had to be in Champion League. Fortnite often played around with how many points players needed to reach Champion League, but it was usually around 6,500. </p>



<p>In some seasons, once you reached a specific division, you would not fall back below that division even if your points dropped below. This ended up changing later on until Fortnite officially released Ranked.</p>



<p>Would you like to see Arena return?</p>

It will launch in 2025 with English, Japanese, and Simplified Chinese language support. <span id="more-921811"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3193560/_/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>A Werewolf game-style social deduction adventure where you play as the landlord of an apartment and try to uncover the Yokai hiding among your residents. Not just a mystery adventure, this is a heart-warming tale of character growth.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>You are left all alone in the world after losing your last remaining relative, with only the apartment inherited from your late father.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Suddenly, a man appears and gives you—the new landlord—a warning.</p><p>“There are Yokai living among the residents in your apartment building.”</p><p>Your time spent sleuthing out the cleverly disguised Yokai began from that moment.</p><p><strong>Overview</strong></p><p>In this social deduction adventure game, the player uses the information they gather to find the Yokai who have attempted to blend in with the residents of the apartment building they manage.</p><p>But Yokai aren’t so easy to find. You will need to talk with residents, check the security cameras, and use the detailed information in the residents’ directory to gradually uncover the truth.</p><p>However, the Yokai may set traps in order to conceal their existence, causing the residents to become suspicious of one another. Just like in a Werewolf game, every word and action can sow the seeds of doubt.</p><p>As the landlord, it’s your duty to keep your residents safe, calmly gather information, and root out the true Yokai amongst the chaos.</p><p>And while you do, you’ll also unravel the true intentions behind the mysterious man who warned you about the Yokai…</p><p>Not just a mystery adventure! A heart-warming tale of character growth awaits you.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_921816"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p>Gather information from the residents to uncover the Yokai who are hiding among your apartment’s residents.</p><p>The residents will come to the player, as the new landlord, with complaints and requests, or just to have a chat.</p><p>This will give you the information you need to root out all of the Yokai.</p><p>If you notice anything in their conversations that feels out of place, that may be a clue to the Yokai’s identity. Note down anything important that you hear.</p><p><strong>Check the Apartment’s Security Cameras</strong></p><p>Yokai are cunning. Even with security cameras installed, that doesn’t mean they will reveal themselves so easily.</p><p>But you might be able to catch them dong something that’s not quite human-like when they think no one’s looking, or something they normally wouldn’t do when in their human forms.</p><p>Behavior that appears ordinary at first glance could be a hint. Keep no stone unturned, and root out the Yokai.</p><p><strong>Evict the Yokai Upon Discovery</strong></p><p>Evict the resident after you have gathered enough evidence and identified them as a Yokai.</p><p>But be careful, if you mistake a real human for a Yokai and evict them, the remaining residents will become even more suspicious of each other, which is exactly what the Yokai want.</p><p>Stay calm during your investigations and keep the residents safe until the day of the new <a title="Games > moon [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/moon">moon</a>, when the Yokai will reveal their true forms.</p><p><strong>If You Don’t Evict Them in Time…</strong></p><p>On the night of the new moon, the Yokai will display their true power.</p><p>When that happens, there will be nothing that we powerless humans can do.</p><p><strong>Future Plans</strong></p><p>We will also continue to make the interface compatible with translations.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement teaser trailer below.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/itch-indie-games-chagos-islands-rule-britannia<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://itch.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Itch.io</a>, if you don't already know it, is a wonderland of game ideas, rough sketches, works in progress and little indie surprises. You can't exist in game development, or love indie games, without having come into contact with it at <em>some</em> point.</p><p>The weird thing about Itch, though, is that the site isn't just known as Itch. You'll usually see it written about in full, domain extension and all, as Itch.io, in ways people would never do for, say, github.com. Even weirder is that,<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/could-a-surprise-uk-territory-handover-spell-the-end-for-itch-io-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> as Game Developer report</a>, the .io part of that name is now under threat for the most unlikely of reasons.</p><p>I'll be honest and say that, until this week, I had no idea what the .io even meant. Aftermath.site, that makes sense, we're a site! Ebay.com.au also makes sense, we all know .com is a business, and .au is Australia. But .io? I've just taken it for granted all these years, figuring it was some tech thing or coder thing or something I just didn't understand and had never bothered to learn.But no! Turns out .io is a <em>place</em>! And that place is the Chagos Islands, a tiny series of atolls in the Indian Ocean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagos_Archipelago" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whose history is, well...</a></p><blockquote><p>The Chagos Islands had been home to the Chagossians from the 1700s brought as slaves by the French from Africa and India, a Bourbonnais Creole-speaking people, until the United Kingdom expelled them from the archipelago at the request of the United States between 1967 and 1973 to allow the United States to build Naval Support Facility Diego Garcia, a military base on Diego Garcia, on land leased from the UK military in the British Indian Ocean Territories. Since 1971, only the atoll of Diego Garcia has been inhabited, and only by employees of the US military, including American civilian contracted personnel. Since being expelled, Chagossians, like all others not permitted by the UK or US governments, have been prevented from entering the islands.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>It's essentially some rocks, with very nice beaches, that are outposts for the US military, built on land leased from the United Kingdom, which acquired the islands in 1814 as part of the treaty governing Napoleon's original surrender. Not the kind of scenario you associate with experimental indie game development, but it is what it is. It's .io specifically because, at the time of the creation of international domain extensions, the islands were listed as the British <strong>I</strong>ndian <strong>O</strong>cean Territory.</p><p>Those islands, despite being presently leased to the US, are actually one of the few remaining overseas possessions of the United Kingdom, and that's about to change because they're about to be handed over to Mauritius as part of an overdrawn (and overdue) exchange. And with that handover comes the risk of the .io domain extension no longer existing, since the Chagos will be folded into Mauritius (whose own extension is .mu, if you were wondering).</p><p>Itch's Leaf Corcoran<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/could-a-surprise-uk-territory-handover-spell-the-end-for-itch-io-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> tells Game Developer</a> that the site itself is obviously not going anywhere, but that they might in a worst-case scenario have to change domain extension, which sounds like an enormous pain both in terms of branding but also in policing external links and backlinks. Hopefully the internet's authorities can just leave .io up. If not, Ireland's domain extension (.ie) is probably the closest replacement, and would also be much funnier to read out loud.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Five months after bursting into PC early access, Hades 2 - the sequel to Supergiant Games' much-loved 2020 roguelike action-adventure - has just received its first major content update, adding a new region, weapon, and so much else its patch notes weigh in at over 3,500 words.
</p>
<p>
Hades 2's Olympic Update ("practically mountain-sized!", exclaims Supergiant) starts with the addition of a brand-new region - one you'll probably already have guess based on the name of today's release. If it's concrete information you want, though, we'll need to delve into spoiler territory - so <strong>turn back right now</strong> if you're sensitive to that kind of thing, otherwise I'll just get on and confirm Hades 2 players can now explore Olympus, the mountain of the gods.
</p>
<p>
Olympus consists of multiple new locations, and Supergiant notes today's update also adds new locations to several other existing regions. That's alongside an "otherworldly" new weapon - Xinth's Black Coat, to be more specific - plus two new allies with unique Keepsakes, and two new Animal Familiars (Raki the Raven and Hecuba the Hound) to find.

<p>
Elsewhere in Hades 2's Olympic Update, those looking to spruce up the Crossroads a little now have access to "dozens" of new cosmetic items, while Supergiant also promises "hours" of new dialogue (spanning 2,500 new voice lines) as the game's plot picks up the pace thanks to the arrival of Olympus and its denizens. Other key additions include a new world map that appears as protagonist Melinoë moves between regions, plus native support for Apple's M1 Macs.
</p><p>
Supergiant's full patch notes are appropriately supergiant in nature, so I won't be appending the whole thing to the bottom of this page. Instead, you'll find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/7057794870234137716?l=english">all 3,500+ words covering Hades 2's latest additions</a> over on Steam; alternatively, Supermassive has brilliantly released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQtih_yy6IA">nearly 27-minute long dramatic reading</a> of the whole thing.
</p>
<p>
Hades 2 is currently expected to leave early access next year, and a release for unspecified consoles is also on the cards. Already, though, it's a bit of a treat, with Eurogamer contributor Christian Donlan <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">calling it</a> "comfortable and familiar" and armed with the "power of surprise".

And sure, you can argue that people don’t <em>need</em> to buy these passes, that they can just wait in line, but ride queues can get quite long and waiting sucks. Besides, the big appeal of Disney World and Disneyland is the rides! And making it more expensive to actually enjoy them seems like the opposite of making your parks more accessible to more people.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The aptly named Pixel Perfect Secret Lair contains card artwork inspired by 16-bit pixel art games. Furthermore, proceeds from the drop will go to Extra Life.</p>

<p>The Pixel Perfect Secret Lair was announced <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/us/extralife2024#filter-product-1018598|sort-availability_wotc,featured">via blog post</a> on the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> website. It is a limited time drop available in both foil (MSRP $49.99) and non-foil (MSRP $39.99). According to the drop's description, 50% of the drop's sales will go to the fundraising program Extra Life.</p>

The cards in the drop are <em>Mana Geyser</em>, <em>Lightning Bolt</em>, <em>Fierce Guardianship</em>, and <em>Delayed Blast Fireball. </em>Each of these four cards contains pixel art by Mike Burns. That artwork depicts the Fbithp braving a lava-filled dungeon to do battle with the powerful dragon planeswalker Nico Bolas.</p>
<p>The pixel art is packed with small but important details. Background details like Nico Bolas' symbol. Fbithp having a heart gauge in the upper left corner. Nico Bolas having a large boss health bar. The card descriptions depicted as textboxes by planeswalker Ajani. It all comes together to sell the retro sidescroller aesthetic.</p>
<p>Extra Life was founded in 2008 as a fundraising program of Children's Miracle Network hospitals led by the gaming community. Since its inception, the program has raised $120 million for critical pediatric needs at local hospitals across the United States and Canada.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wizards of the Coast has helped donate money to their cause in the past through similar <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-partners-with-extra-life-2022" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Secret Lair</a> events. Specifically, their proceeds go to support the Seattle Children's Autism Center.</p>
<p>The Pixel Perfect Secret Lair is available for pre-order right now. The Secret Lair will be available until November 18, 2024.</p>

Maybe it’s all leading up to another big trailer at the next Game Awards this December. In the meantime we have 90 seconds of McConaughey reprising his energy from <em>True Detective</em> season 1 to describe the game’s main villains, The Mara Yama.</p><p>“Do you know what fear is?” the <em>Interstellar</em> astronaut asks. “The Mara Yama do. They thrive on it. These monstrous celestials haunt the darkest corners of the cluster hunting for isolated targets, and, unfortunately for their victims, the Mara Yama are interested in stealing more than just cargo. They want minds. Memories. Emotions. The more twisted and tortured, the better.”</p><p> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8x73UW8Hjk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8x73UW8Hjk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smell the psychosphere much</a></span>?</p><p>  <em>Exodus</em>, which is promising to let players engage with the consequences of their actions between the past and future through a unique time dilation mechanic, might end up being the next <em>Mass Effect</em> or <em>Destiny</em>. Or it could be another interesting but flawed AAA experiment from a new studio still finding its footing amid a grim video game industry landscape. Either way, I’m willing to bet that it never feels as full of violent, weird, and imaginative possibility as it does in this trailer. </p><p>Real games, the ones that survive a brutal series of trade-offs, compromises, and unexpected pitfalls to come out the other end a finished product on a store shelf or download queue, are almost never as good <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-god-of-war-weve-already-been-playing-in-our-heads-1824356326&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-god-of-war-weve-already-been-playing-in-our-heads-1824356326">as the versions of them we dream up</a></span> while we’re waiting for them to arrive. I don’t expect it to be any different with <em>Exodus</em>, which is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, but still doesn’t have any kind of release window. At least we’ll always have this incredible teaser. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Don't Nod - the studio behind the likes of Jusant, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> 1 &amp; 2, and the upcoming Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage - has announced 69 jobs are at risk as it initiates a "reorganisation project to ensure the company's long-term future" amid "deteriorating" financial results.
</p>
<p>
Signs the studio was facing difficulties <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-nod-bets-on-lost-records-bloom-rage-as-multiple-projects-fail-to-meet-expectations">emerged earlier this year</a> when it announced it would be partially writing down €24m following the underperformance of Jusant and Banishers: Ghost of New Eden. It also confirmed it would be cancelling the development of one unannounced project, codenamed P10, while two additional Paris-developed projects (codenamed P12 and P13) had been temporarily put on hold in order to "prioritise resources and maximise the chances of success for the most promising titles at present." Despite all this, it remained upbeat regarding the prospects of Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, and noted it had two additional in-house projects in the works, both scheduled to release by the end of 2027. 
</p>
<p>
But in its newly released <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases?ID=ACTUS-0-88278">2024 half-year results update</a>, Don't Nod has acknowledged "strongly negative results despite [these] performance-enhancing measures", and has announced a "reorganisation project to safeguard its competitiveness in an increasingly demanding and competitive ecosystem" that may affect up to 69 jobs. "An initial exchange took place today with the employee representative bodies," it noted, "and an information-consultation process with these same bodies will subsequently be initiated regarding this project."

<p>
In a statement accompany today's news, Don't Nod CEO Oskar Guilbert wrote, "Our half-year results for 2024 reflect the economic underperformance of our latest release, despite solid ratings on Metacritic, as well as the accounting impact of the decisions we had to take. The initial performance support measures announced last spring no longer seem sufficient to maintain the company's competitiveness. As a result, today we presented a reorganisation project to the employee representative bodies, which could set Don't Nod on a new development trajectory. I am fully conscious of the impact this project may have on all our employees. Securing our company's resources and restoring its ability to perform more in an increasingly competitive and selective industry is extremely necessary."
</p><p>
In addition to its in-house projects, Don't Nod is providing support for two external publishing projects due for release in 2025, but Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage will be the company's next major own release when it launches for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S next year - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-creators-lost-records-launches-in-two-parts">first part arriving on 18th February</a> and its concluding half releasing a month later on 18th March.

GSC did spend a lot of time boosting performance and optimizing the game, which the studio claims helped the PC version become more “performant.”</p><h2 id="h195743"><a id=""></a>The Xbox Series S might be causing problems for devs</h2><p>In the past, we’ve heard <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/developer-claims-many-studios-are-asking-xbox-to-drop-mandatory-series-s-compatibility/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/developer-claims-many-studios-are-asking-xbox-to-drop-mandatory-series-s-compatibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vague complaints</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yKJsDoysEM&amp;t=4257s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yKJsDoysEM&amp;t=4257s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from developers</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamerant.com/rocksteady-fleur-marty-comments-xbox-series-s-holding-back-generation/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamerant.com/rocksteady-fleur-marty-comments-xbox-series-s-holding-back-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that the Xbox Series S is holding back some ports</a></span>.

However, in many cases, we have managed to hit 60 FPS, but it’s not as consistent as the Series X. But we’re looking to get a performance mode for Xbox Series S, to get it to 60 FPS. We think it’s possible,” explained GSC. <br></p><p>Performance modes aren’t as common on Xbox Series S, due to its lower specs, so if GSC can actually pull it off I’ll be curious to see what was cut or downgraded to make <em>Stalker 2</em> run at 60FPS on the weaker Xbox. We don’t have to wait long, as <em>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl </em>is set to finally arrive on Xbox and PC on November 20.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Like many other games, Psyonix's Rocket League is getting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-2024-halloween-game-events/2900-5807/" data-ref-id="2900-5807">Halloween update</a>, and this one will also include a range of Spider-Man content focused on the franchise's heroes and villains.</p><p>The Haunted Hallows event begins this Friday, October 18, and runs through November 4. As part of the event, players can complete challenges to unlock rewards like toppers and decals inspired by Spider-Man villains like Venom, Mysterio, and Green Goblin.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=025TMNQHWV0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/025TMNQHWV0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Spider-Man superfans might be interested in buying the Spider-Man Mega Bundle (about $25 USD), which comes with everything, including a Venom-themed goal explosion, decals for Spider-Gwen and Spider-Punk, a Web-head boost and trail, Spider-Man and Symbiote wheels, and a Spidey sense topper, among other things. Check out everything available in the bundle below. Players don't have to buy the mega bundle, though, as individual items and bundles are available as well for separate purchase.</p><p>In addition to the Spider-Man content, Rocket League is adding two limited-time modes for Halloween, including Spooky Cube and Haunted Heatseeker. Spooky Cube is normal Rocket League except the spherical soccer ball is replaced with a cubical jack-o'-lantern. In Haunted Heatseeker, the field is invaded by ghosts who try to steal the ball and score--but there is a catch. If your opponent blocks a ghost's shots, the ball will ricochet back toward your own goal.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385913-screenshot2024-10-16at3.51.53pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4385913" data-ratio="0.56035889070147" data-width="1226" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385913-screenshot2024-10-16at3.51.53pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4385913"></a><figcaption>Spider-Man comes to Rocket League</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385913-screenshot2024-10-16at3.51.53pm.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385914-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.34pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385915-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.41pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385916-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.47pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385917-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.52pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4385914,1300-4385915,1300-4385916,1300-4385917" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4385914-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.34pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4385915-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.41pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4385916-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.47pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4385917-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.52pm.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385914-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.34pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385915-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.41pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385916-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.47pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385917-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.52pm.png"></figure><p>For lots more on Haunted Hallows, be sure to <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/en/news/its-a-spider-man-spooktacular-in-rocket-leagues-haunted-hallows" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">read the full blog post on the Rocket League website.</a>⁠</p><h3>⁠⁠⁠Spider-Man Mega Bundle (3000 Credits, or about $25 USD)</h3><ul><li>We Are Venom Goal Explosion <i>(2000 Credits individually)</i></li><li>Spider-Man Octane Decal Bundle <i>(900 Credits individually)</i><ul><li>Classic Spider-Man Octane Decal</li><li>Spider-Gwen Octane Decal</li><li>Spider-Punk Octane Decal</li><li>Scarlet Spider Octane Decal</li></ul></li><li>Web-Head Boost + Trail Bundle <i>(600 Credits individually)</i><ul><li>Web-Head Boost</li><li>Web-Head Trail</li></ul></li><li>Symbiote Fennec Bundle <i>(500 Credits individually)</i><ul><li>Spider-Man Symbiote Suit Fennec Decal</li><li>Scream Fennec Decal</li></ul></li><li>Spider-Man Wheels Bundle <i>(500 Credits individually)</i><ul><li>Spider-Man Wheels</li><li>Spider-Man Symbiote Wheels</li></ul></li><li>Spidey Sense Topper</li><li>Spider-Man’s Bag Topper</li></ul>

Sombra will now gain Stealth for five seconds after activating Translocator, though hacking enemies or taking damage will no longer end Stealth but instead will temporarily reveal her. Blizzard has also added back her Opportunist passive, allowing her to see critically injured enemies through walls and deal more damage to hacked targets.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Overwatch 2 - Season 13: Spellbinder Event Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24148443/director-s-take-tricks-tweaks-and-treats-for-season-13/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> going over the update, game director Aaron Keller said the changes were in order to make it so Sombra can't take any position she wants in Stealth while giving her a new gameplay loop that "increases her lethality."</p><p dir="ltr">Several Tank heroes have received changes as well in Season 13, namely Ramattra, Reinhardt, and Mauga. Ramattra's Pummel ability no longer pierces shields, though it will deal 2.5x more damage to them to compensate, with the patch notes stating that the ability being able to damage through shields was a "source of frustration for players trying to protect themselves or their allies."</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of shields, the health of Reinhardt's Barrier Field has been reduced by 100, which Keller said should lead to players having to make a choice between blocking attacks with their barrier or taking the hits themselves. Mauga, on the other hand, received a nice buff, with his ignite damage from his incendiary chaingun now dealing damage over four seconds instead of three. That should give him more power against "smaller, harder to hit targets," Blizzard said.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-season-12-introduces-juno-lets-players-become-egyptian-gods/1100-6525795/" data-ref-id="1100-6525795">Juno, the game's newest Support hero</a>, received a nerf to her healing both in terms of the amount healed and the falloff range of her Mediblaster. The change will require players to make better use of her mobility abilities in order to maintain proper positioning, Blizzard said. Other heroes got small updates as well, ranging from increased cooldown for Brigitte's Repair Pack to a slight health buff for Hanzo.</p><p dir="ltr">Other changes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/overwatch-2-season-13-battle-pass-all-skins-emotes-and-rewards/2900-5867/" data-ref-id="2900-5867">Overwatch 2 Season 13</a> include a number of adjustments to various maps. Four maps--Circuit Royal, Havana, Dorado, and Numbani--have seen various tweaks, ranging from added cover and adjusted sightlines to new pathways and changes to spawn locations. A full before-and-after breakdown can be viewed in the official patch notes.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to all the various map and hero changes, Clash, the newest Overwatch 2 game mode added during Season 12, received adjustments. Blizzard said it's looking to "reduce the number of one-sided stomps" in the mode, and as a result tweaked capture times as well as made it easier for Attackers to secure at least one segment of the final objective point.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-new-halloween-game-mode-mutates-heroes-for-brutal-pvp-action/1100-6527094/" data-ref-id="1100-6527094">Overwatch 2 Season 13 introduced a new PvP Halloween game mode</a> alongside bringing back previous PvE event modes like Junkenstein's Revenge and Wrath of the Bride, and will soon offer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-getting-another-anime-crossover-this-time-with-my-hero-academia/1100-6526743/" data-ref-id="1100-6526743">My Hero Academia-themed skins</a>.

The Interactive Scoreboard is intended to make reporting faster and easier, but also to improve your social experience through whatever channels you prefer to communicate in or avoid entirely. The following features are now accessible via Interactive Scoreboard:</p><ul><li>Adjusting Mic Volume of other players</li><li>Adjusting your Mic Volume</li><li>Reporting other players</li><li>Joining/Leaving Team Voice Chat</li><li>Joining/Leaving Group Voice Chat</li><li>Muting Team Text Chat</li><li>Muting Match Text Chat</li><li>Muting Text Chat of other players</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Matchmaking Updates</p><ul><li>Tuning changes to reduce queue times for Wide matches in Competitive Play.</li><li>Loss Streak avoidance tuned down to prevent cases where it could increase worst case scenario queue times.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: We're not seeing any measurable impact from this tech in preventing loss streaks and we're concerned it might be making queue times longer. So we're scaling it back for now.</p><ul><li>Role Delta tuning tightened, to try to match Ranks on the roles on each team more closely.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: We believe that match quality improves significantly when you are matched closely with one of the members on the opposing team in the same role. We believe we can tighten this preference without significantly impacting queue times.</p><ul><li>Role Delta has been updated to prioritize the Tank Role above other roles.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: We've been thinking about how to improve the Tank experience from every angle, to give them more even matchups and reduce 1-sided matches for the whole team further.</p><ul><li>At higher Ranks the effects of MMR Decay, Winning Trend, Losing Trend, and Calibration have been reduced.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: At our highest ranks these modifiers could sometimes allow very high skill players playing on new accounts to get lucky and surpass their peak ranks considerably, without actually earning their new rank like other players that have played more on their accounts.</p><ul><li>At higher Ranks the matchmaker now takes into account the benefits of grouping when constructing matches.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: At the highest ranks, groups have had noteworthy advantages against teams composed of all solo players for some time now. Our aim with this addition isn't to remove the advantage of grouping at higher ranks entirely, but we'd like the advantage of grouping at higher ranks to be less extreme.</p><p dir="ltr">Public Custom Games</p><ul><li>Hosting Public Custom Games now requires Endorsement Level 3.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: A reminder that we've been actioning accounts that post disruptive content in the Game Browser and we're serious about removing problematic players that don't follow our Code of Conduct. Whenever an account is actioned for a social penalty, they're reduced to Endorsement Level 0, so the combination of social actions and this feature will allow for one chance to change their behavior before they're permanently banned. Anyone that is below Endorsement Level 3 can still host games with the "Friends" or "Invite Only" settings, but they will not have access to the "Everyone" setting.</p><p dir="ltr">Streamer Protect</p><ul><li>Access to the "Hide My Name" function of Streamer Protect now requires completing the "Unrelenting Hero" Lifetime Challenge.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: We've been listening to community feedback that newer accounts should be required to earn access to the feature, but it's important that this feature can't be abused by various types of disruptive players that tend to play on very new accounts. As a reminder, the "Hide My Name" feature does not prevent disruptive players from being punished when they're reported since we know their actual battle tag behind the scenes.</p><p dir="ltr">Challenge Updates</p><ul><li>Select challenges are now visible in the Main Menu.</li><li>Challenge Rewards can now be inspected in detail in the Challenges Menu.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: Challenges are now in the main menu to highlight their rewards, primarily for new Event Challenges.</p><p dir="ltr">SHOP UPDATES</p><ul><li>Mythic Skin Aspects Add-on Cosmetic is now added to the Mythic Shop.</li><li>Overwatch League Store tab was removed and replaced by a separate button in the bottom of the main Shop tab.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">COMPETITIVE UPDATES</p><p>The requirements to appear on the Top 500 Leaderboard have changed:</p><ul><li>Win requirement per season reduced from 50 to 25.</li><li>The Seasoned Competitor challenge (750 lifetime wins in Competitive Play) is now required to be completed to be eligible for any Top 500 Leaderboard starting in Season 12.</li></ul><h4>Hero Updates</h4><p dir="ltr">General</p><ul><li>Swapping your hero hides your selection on the enemy scoreboard for 15 seconds.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: This change adds a more friction to counterswapping, especially in the extreme case where two players on opposite teams are both sitting in spawn with the scoreboard open and rapidly switch their heroes in response to each other’s choices.</p><h4>Tank</h4><h5>Mauga</h5><p>Developer Comment: Increasing the duration of Mauga's burn effect will help better reward going for the smaller, harder to hit targets.</p><p dir="ltr">Incendiary Chaingun</p><ul><li>Ignite damage over time duration increased from 3 to 4 seconds.</li></ul><h5>Ramattra</h5><p>Developer Comments: Ramattra's Pummel projectiles passing through barriers was a source of frustration for players trying to protect themselves or their allies. With these changes enabling Ramattra to deal critical damage to barriers, he will still be a valuable hero choice against barrier mechanics, but won't immediately apply damage to players on the other side.</p><p>Pummel</p><p dir="ltr">Pummel</p><ul><li>No longer pierces barriers.</li><li>Now deals 2.5x more damage to barriers.</li></ul><h5>Reinhardt</h5><p>Developer Comments: This is just some fine tuning for the barrier health and regeneration rate as it had become slightly too tough to break through.</p><p dir="ltr">Barrier Field</p><ul><li>Barrier Field health reduced from 1600 to 1500.</li></ul><h4>Damage</h4><h5>Hanzo</h5><p>Developer Comments: We are reverting Hanzo back to his previous health now that it's possible to take out an opposing Hanzo with a well-aimed headshot thanks to the weapon damage changes.</p><ul><li>Base health increased from 225 to 250.</li></ul><h5>Sojourn</h5><p>Developer Comments: These Railgun changes swap out the 25 minimum energy it decays to for a longer time before it begins to degenerate which alleviates some of the pressure to quickly use the secondary fire. Disruptor shot is getting a damage increase to helps its effectiveness as an area denial tool, andlong with additional utility through generating a small amount of Railgun energy to make it more broadly useful.</p><p dir="ltr">Railgun</p><ul><li>Energy no longer stops degenerating at 25 energy.</li><li>Time before energy degeneration begins increased from 7 to 12 seconds.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Disruptor Shot</p><ul><li>Damage per second increased from 60 to 80</li><li>Now generates 25% of damage done to enemy players as Railgun energy.</li></ul><h5>Sombra</h5><p>Developer Comments: This is a significant change to Sombra's playstyle in the hopes of making her more interactive for the opposing team and shifting some of her power from the utility of Stealth and Hack into increased lethality.</p><p>Stealth having a limited duration less than the Translocator cooldown is intended to create brief windows of vulnerability. It still enables Sombra to cross through dangerous areas unseen, but to really hang around in the enemy backline will require moving from cover-to-cover similar to other flanking heroes. No longer having the stealth movement speed removed upon taking damage also enhances its usefulness as an escape tool.</p><p dir="ltr">Hack</p><ul><li>No longer ends Stealth but does reveal Sombra.</li><li>Hacked ability lockout effect duration reduced from 1.5 to 1.0 seconds (EMP duration unchanged).</li><li>BOB hacked stun duration reduced from 10 to 3 seconds.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Translocator</p><ul><li>Cooldown increased from 5 to 7 seconds.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">EMP</p><ul><li>Ultimate cost increased 12%.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Stealth</p><ul><li>No longer passive and now activates by using Translocator.</li><li>Now has a 5 second duration.</li><li>Added stealth timer around the reticle and removed ability icon.</li><li>Taking damage now reveals Sombra for 1 second instead of ending stealth.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Opportunist</p><ul><li>The Opportunist passive has been added back in.</li><li>Increases Sombra's weapon damage versus hacked targets by 20%.</li><li>See critically injured enemies through walls.</li></ul><h4>Support</h4><h5>Baptiste</h5><p>Developer Comment: This change is aimed at reducing the fatigue resulting from controlling the recoil over longer periods of play more than trying to add power to Baptiste's primary fire.</p><p dir="ltr">Biotic Launcher</p><ul><li>Primary fire recoil reduced by 30%.</li></ul><h5>Brigitte</h5><p>Developer Comment: Brigitte's healing output over the course of a match is quite high, so this is just a slight adjustment to help bring that in line.</p><p dir="ltr">Repair Pack</p><ul><li>Cooldown increased from 5 to 5.5 seconds.</li></ul><h5>Juno</h5><p>Developer Comments: Juno's healing output is too high for how much mobility she possesses so we're shortening her falloff range to increase the importance of positioning well with her mobility abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">Mediblaster</p><ul><li>Falloff range reduced from 30-50 meters to 20-35 meters.</li><li>Healing per projectile reduced from 6.5 to 6.</li></ul><h4>Map Updates</h4><p dir="ltr">CLASH</p><ul><li>Capture time on the final objective points A and E now increases for Attackers as segments get secured consecutively from 1x /1x / 1x to 0.7x /1.1x /1.4x, to make the first segment easier to capture for attackers but consecutive ones harder.</li><li>Defenders now respawn instantly as the first segment and second segment get secured instead of when the previous objective points B or D get captured.</li><li>Unlock time for final objective points A and E has been increased from 25 seconds to 27.5 seconds.</li><li>Decay rate on final objective points A and E have been doubled for attackers to not lose their progress as quickly when stepping off the point.</li><li>Capture time for defenders on objective points B and D has been increased by 10% to give attackers more opportunities to attack the point.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: We want to reduce the number of one-sided stomps occurring in the Clash game mode. We also want to address the difficulty of securing at least one segment on the final objective points as attackers. So, we tweaked the capture time for the defending team to make the fight for objective points B and D a bit more favorable for attackers.</p><h4>Circuit Royal</h4><p>1st Point</p><ul><li>New exit options from attackers initial spawn to reduce spawn camping.</li><li>Initial high ground right flank brought in and access adjusted to reduce spawn camping.</li><li>Cover options added.</li><li>New far side flank option to contest defenders on the high ground by the bridge.</li></ul><p>2nd Point</p><ul><li>Improved spawn protections for attackers leaving the second spawn area to reduce spawn camping.</li><li>Additional cover added while pushing high ground for attackers.</li><li>New flank added for attackers to take rear high ground by the chicane.</li><li>Hill lowered slightly and road angled forward to make approach for attackers slightly more comfortable.</li></ul><p>3rd Point</p><ul><li>Improved options for attackers leaving the third spawn area to combat spawn camping.</li><li>Flank route to high ground pool area widened and additional cover added to increase play options in this space.</li><li>Sightlines improved for attackers to poke at entrenched defender positions in the final area.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Before and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and After</p><h4>Dorado</h4><p>1st Point</p><ul><li>Starting high ground cover and access has been adjusted to reduce spawn camping.</li><li>Flank routes have been streamlined for attackers.</li><li>Various geometry adjustments to provide more favorable gameplay opportunities for attackers in the market area.</li></ul><p>2nd Point</p><ul><li>Staircase added for easier attacker access to the high ground.</li><li>Added access to the courthouse for attackers.</li></ul><p>3rd Point</p><ul><li>Cover added after the chokepoint on the main path.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Before and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and After</p><h4>Havana</h4><p>1st Point</p><ul><li>Reduced sightlines into the attackers' spawn.</li><li>Added new options for attackers to exit their spawn.</li><li>Reduced oppressive high ground vantage points for defenders.</li></ul><p>2nd Point</p><ul><li>Widened doorways and certain routes for cleaner navigation and flow.</li><li>Closed small holes through certain assets to block sightlines and projectiles.</li></ul><p>3rd Point</p><ul><li>Redesigned attackers' spawn interior and added additional routes for a safer attacker exit.</li><li>Sightlines from the fort wall to spawn and main route have been reduced.</li><li>Pathing into the fort has been consolidated on one side for cleaner flow and to give both teams more options while in combat around the final chokepoint.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Before and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and After</p><h4>Numbani</h4><p>1st Point</p><ul><li>Attackers' initial spawn room has been pushed a lot closer to first point to reduce runback times.</li><li>Lowered some high ground around first point.</li><li>Easier access to flank routes around first point.</li><li>Combined the paths in the building behind the payload on first point - one room that connects everything.</li></ul><p>2nd Point</p><ul><li>Forward defender spawn points have been added to reduce runback times for defenders.</li><li>A staircase has been added near attackers forward spawn for easier access to high ground.</li><li>Added a connecting path past and above the choke into third point.</li></ul><p>3nd Point</p><ul><li>Relocated a pesky sign.</li><li>Removed a tree.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Before and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and After</p><h4>Bug Fixes</h4><p dir="ltr">General</p><ul><li>Fixed a bug that caused some players to be unable to purchase golden weapons.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the Voice Chat Devices setting was unable to be changed.</li><li>Fived a bug that caused Adrenaline Junkie achievement to sometimes not grant.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Heroes</p><p>Baptiste</p><ul><li>Fixed a bug with Baptiste's Zombie Walk Emote.</li></ul><p>Sigma</p><ul><li>Fixed a bug where Sigma would not gain Overhealth for Juno's Mediblaster.</li></ul><p>Reaper</p><ul><li>In a previous update, fixed a bug that caused exit sound enemy reaper's shadow step to not play.</li></ul>

The turn-based adventure continues to look stunning though, and it just announced an all-star voice cast to boot that includes Andy Serkis.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196646" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="137" data-playlist="196646,196215,196055" data-current="196646"><div><p>Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22202.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is a dark fantasy RPG inspired by the French Belle Époque (think French Impressionism and the Lumière brothers) about a group of explorers trying to take on a god called the Paintress who’s terrorizing the countryside with arbitrary mass killings. The turn-based combat mixes in real-time elements, while the gorgeous menus and evocative UI look like a cross between <em>Persona</em> and <em>Dishonored</em>. If the actual game can live up to its early trailers, we could have something really special on our hands. </p><p>And despite coming from a brand-new studio, the just-revealed cast for the game is full of top-notch talent. In addition to Serkis, best known as Gollum in Peter Jackson’s<em> Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy and as <em>Andor</em>’s Kino Loy in the single best episode of <em>Star Wars</em> TV ever produced, <em>Expedition 33</em> also features the voice talents of <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>’s Clive Rosfield (Ben Starr) and<em> Baldur’s Gate III</em>’s Shadowheart (Jennifer English). Here’s the full cast list so far:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Andy Serkis </strong>(<em>13 Going on 30</em>) as a man trying to save his family named Renoir</li><li><strong>Charlie Cox</strong> (<em>Daredevil</em>) as the lead engineer Gustave</li><li><strong>Ben Starr</strong> (<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>) as the dangerous stranger  Verso</li><li><strong>Jennifer English </strong>(<em>Baldur’s Gate III</em>) as the shy loner  Maelle</li><li><strong>Kirsty Rider</strong> (<em>Sandman</em>) as chief researcher Lune</li><li><strong>Shala Nyx </strong>(<em>The Old Guard</em>) as the cheerful warrior Sciel</li></ul></blockquote><p>The newest trailer features the talents of both Starr, who helped carry <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>’s uneven story <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xvi-ffxvi-clive-thirsty-fan-fiction-ps5-1850588637&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xvi-ffxvi-clive-thirsty-fan-fiction-ps5-1850588637">to hell and back on his shoulders</a></span>, and Serkis, who we still love <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/09/andy-serkis-ai-characters-project-gollum-lord-of-the-rings-1236096832/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/09/andy-serkis-ai-characters-project-gollum-lord-of-the-rings-1236096832/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">despite his saying some dumb stuff about AI</a></span>. The gameplay footage also gives a wider look at <em>Expedition 33</em>'s unique world and massive monsters. A giant clockwork golem fight demonstrates the game’s timing-based combat mechanics, and a grappling hook-like power shows off one of the game’s many traversal abilities. </p><p>Devora Wilde (<em>Space Marine 2</em>), Tracy Wiles (<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>), Rich Keeble, and Maxence Cazorla are in the game as well. “The actors were phenomenal to work with (and just all-around great people),” wrote <em>Clair Obscur </em>lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/16/introducing-the-cast-of-clair-obscur-expedition-33/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/16/introducing-the-cast-of-clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the PlayStation Blog</a></span>. “We had a lot of fun during the recording sessions. The cast beautifully conveyed the complexity of the characters, who have each been shaped by the harshness of their world. Every character has been affected by deep and constant loss and has dealt with this in their own way.”</p><p>  <em>Expedition 33</em> doesn’t have a set release date yet, but it’s supposed to come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC early in 2025. So far the Unreal Engine 5 game looks like it’s shaping up nicely. I wouldn’t be surprised if it still gets one or two minor delays, but I’m looking forward to it whenever it finally arrives. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Per the company, the decline is the result of Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden and Jusant not performing as well as expected.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/02/17/banishersthumb-1708181723447.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden didn't perform as well as expected, Don't Nod says.</figcaption></figure></output><p>"Our half-year results for 2024 reflect the economic underperformance of our latest release, despite solid ratings on Metacritic, as well as the accounting impact of the decisions we had to take," said CEO Oskar Guilbert in a statement. "The initial performance support measures announced last spring no longer seem sufficient to maintain the company's competitiveness. As a result, today we presented a reorganization project to the employee representative bodies, which could set Don't Nod on a new development trajectory. I am fully conscious of the impact this project may have on all our employees. Securing our company's resources and restoring its ability to perform more in an increasingly competitive and selective industry is extremely necessary."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Our half-year results for 2024 reflect the economic underperformance of our latest release, despite solid ratings on Metacritic</p></div><p>The company has already taken some restructuring measures to reduce costs, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/life-is-strange-creator-dont-nod-has-rough-start-to-the-year-presses-pause-on-two-projects">including "pressing pause" on two unannounced projects</a>. However, this seems to not be enough, as Don't Nod is also expecting to lay off a number of individuals in the coming months. The exact number is still in flux, as Don't Nod management must negotiate with employee union representatives and may implement other measures such as a voluntary redundancy plan. Notably, earlier this year, the representative French union Le Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo (STJV) <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/02/dont-nod-ascension-or-free-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accused the company</a> of mismanagement, claiming employees were facing burnout due to the ongoing reorganization and that communication, understaffing, and shifting deadlines were endangering the workforce.</p><p><strong>Update 2:22pm PT: </strong>STJV has issued a statement condeming the layoffs, saying the company broke the law by not providing any information to employees beforehand about today's meeting agenda where the layoffs were announced. The union also accused the company of ignoring workers asking for clearer communication about the state of the company, saying that "alarm bells have been ringing for months."</p><p>"The Don’t Nod union section, as well the whole of the STJV, cannot tolerate the company rejecting the responsibilities of its own failures on its workers," <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/10/at-dont-nod-the-only-plans-for-the-future-are-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the statement reads</a>. "We warned them long ago, but they ignored us and accused us of being too agressive to speak with. With this layoffs plan, they are creating an atmosphere of extreme violece. We are calling on all workers at Don’t Nod to mobilise to save their jobs and working conditions."</p><p><strong>Original story continues:</strong></p><p>According to a <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">games industry layoff tracker</a>, over 13,000 game developers have been laid off just this year (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riot-lays-off-more-league-of-legends-developers-while-promising-to-increase-team-size">including 32 just yesterday at Riot Games</a>). Over 10,000 developers were laid off in 2023 and over 8,000 in 2022.

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/new-world/" data-ref-id="5000-489582">New World: Aeternum</a>, Amazon Games' MMO, is set during the Age of Exploration, on an island where no one can die--but immortality isn't always a gift. For some, living forever leads to madness, while others lose their souls. Some corpses are long since hollowed out but live on, unable to find peace.</p><p dir="ltr">That idea gets pretty dark pretty fast, but in the episode of animated anthology series Secret Level that's based on New World, the focus is on a slightly different take on the material.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLihxsmI_OU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gLihxsmI_OU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"[New World: Aeternum is] not quite as light as [the episode] presents it," said New World: Aeternum narrative director Rob Chestney, during a question-and-answer session with press following a recent screening of Secret Level's first episode. "We talk about it as grimdark. We talk about it as supernatural, rather than fantasy."</p><p dir="ltr">The video game conceit of players dying is baked into the fiction of New World: Aeternum, giving an in-universe reason for players to die and resurrect frequently. In the game's fiction, Chestney said, that often gets treated seriously. The Secret Level episode, however, puts a darkly humorous spin on all that death and how it alters consequences for characters, resulting in a short that's a comedy, rather than a dark fantasy. It's a take on New World: Aeternum that utilizes the same ideas but to a very different effect than the game itself.</p><p dir="ltr">The New World episode might be a good example of creator Blur Studios' process in making Secret Level, which has episodes based on 15 different games from 11 different developers. The episode focuses on a key element of the game it's based on, teasing out something that can resonate with viewers regardless of their familiarity with that world. But it also means shrinking down an entire game world that might take players tens of hours to experience, like New World, into something with a few characters and a few minutes of story.</p><p dir="ltr">"Especially with this episode, but any game that is that vast and there's so much to draw from, especially with the sort of an unindoctrinated audience, you want to distill it down to something personal that people can connect to," Secret Level executive producer Dave Wilson said. "So, with everything that was available to us, that's why it got distilled down to a handful of characters that you could, in 10 minutes, you can actually feel something for. One of the mantras that we've attached to all this sort of storytelling is, people remember what they felt, not what they saw."</p><p dir="ltr">The process for creating Secret Level episodes sounded pretty intense, though. To get that distillation of a particular idea or aspect of a game in the first place, Blur Studios, the animation studio behind the series, spent time with developers to immerse themselves in the games.</p><p dir="ltr">As Secret Level creator and executive producer Tim Miller explained, Blur developed massive documents, or "decks," about each one.</p><p dir="ltr">"We do a really deep dive with the lore, with the game developers, we build a huge f**king deck. These decks are massive, you know? Like 70 pages of, like, dos and don'ts about the game, here's what's interesting," Miller said. "And of course, we ask the developers, what's interesting about the lore and the characters? What do you feel is territory worth exploring? And sometimes the answer is, let's just make something cool. Sometimes it is, predictably, 'Well, we have a game coming out that focuses on this,' and that's also cool."</p><p dir="ltr">Blur took all the material about the games they created and passed them onto writers, Miller said, who then pitched story ideas--like the one about the funnier side of living forever.</p><p dir="ltr">"Because there's so many [writers], and because they come from such varied backgrounds and it's such a wide variety of POVs, we get a really wide variety of stories, much better than Dave and I sitting in a room, you know, whatever two white guys would come up with," he continued. "It's a much more interesting and broad spectrum of stories. I love that aspect. And we get a lot of unexpected things we would not have come up with."</p><p dir="ltr">New World: Aeternum hit PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S this week, and is also available on PC, so while it'll be a bit until viewers can see Secret Level's take on Aeternum--the series releases in December--the grimdark fantasy MMO is available for players right now.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-says-james-bond-game-will-hopefully-be-the-start-of-a-trilogy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> - the team behind the rather brilliant (in my humble opinion) Hitman games - hopes its upcoming James Bond origin story will be the start of a trilogy.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-007-io-interactive-young-bond-for-gamers-trilogy">IGN</a>, IO boss Hakan Abrak said the team feels like it's had "20 plus years of training for the agent fantasy", thanks to Hitman. Indeed, Agent 47 is very Bond-like with his seemingly endless talents and ability to handle any weapon under the sun.</p>
<p>"But obviously James Bond is a different IP. It's a huge IP. It's not our IP. It's actually the first IP that is not our original IP from the ground up," Abrak told the publication, adding one of the most exciting parts of the upcoming release is that it will be an original story for the British spy.</p>

<p>"So it's not a gamification of a movie," Abrak continued. "It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future. And equally important and exciting, it's a new Bond. It's a Bond we built from the ground up for gamers. It's extremely exciting with all the tradition and all the history there is... to work on this together with the family [and create] a Bond that the gamers can call their own and grow with."</p><p>"It's been, what, almost 15 years since the last game. So it's been a long time," Abrak added. "It definitely is something that is not overexposed in gaming. We actually see that as a strength... There's a lot of people out there who think about GoldenEye as the classic... I don't want to speak too big about it, but I just hope we'll do a thing that will define James Bond in gaming for years to come. And that is not only one game, but that we create a universe for gamers to own for many years to come that we can grow with that next to the Bond on the movies."</p>
<p>As for when we'll all get to see the fruits of the studio's labours, that's still a mystery for now. "I don't have an update today, but believe me, it's itching here as well to be talking about it soon," Abrak admitted. "So we are following our plans. The production's going amazingly well and we will soon be talking more about it. I know it was a little teaser, not a lot of information, but there's a lot of cool stuff coming up."</p>

<p>IO first announced its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-io-reveals-fresh-project">James Bond game back in 2021</a>. Very little has been shared on it since, although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-studio-io-opens-up-a-little-about-its-james-bond-007-game">our Bertie managed to tease a few extra 00-details out of the team last year</a>.</p>
<p>But while we may have to wait a little longer to hear anything more concrete on IO's James Bond, the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-studio-to-publish-former-rockstar-and-gta-producers-mysterious-blockbuster-mindseye">has also announced it's taking on publishing duties for MindsEye</a>, the big-budget action adventure in the works from former Rockstar exec Leslie Benzies.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In light of this, the union, STJV, has denounced company leadership and called for workers to mobilize and defend their jobs.</p><p>Don’t Nod has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/life-is-strange-creator-dont-nod-has-rough-start-to-the-year-presses-pause-on-two-projects" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously said</a> that its latest releases, <em>Jusant </em>and <em>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</em>, fell short of “commercial expectations,” leading it to “temporarily” pause two other in-development projects. Despite a focus on the upcoming and thus far well-received <em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>, Don’t Nod <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases?ID=ACTUS-0-88278" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now says</a> that “amid deteriorating results” it has been “compelled to consider a reorganization project to safeguard its competitiveness in an increasingly demanding and competitive ecosystem.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>STJV, which earlier this year <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/02/dont-nod-ascension-or-free-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a post criticizing Don’t Nod</a> for a burnout-inducing work environment in which "each project erratically follows another," has <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/2024/10/a-dont-nod-le-seul-plan-pour-lavenir-est-le-plan-de-licenciement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deemed</a> the layoff plan “the climax of a series of catastrophic decisions,&nbsp;denounced for a long time&nbsp;by workers' representatives.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Management is hiding being 'the state of the economy' and 'a very competitive market' as excuses for its failures, without ever questioning its inconsistent decisions, which have been harmful to the studio and its workers,” wrote Don’t Nod’s STJV union section in a post published today.</p><p>Workers, they say, must fight back. Specifically, they cite mass mobilization at Ubisoft, which <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-strike-france-pay-yves-guillemot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has included strikes</a> – something STJV also helped organize.&nbsp;</p><p>"The Don't Nod union section, as well as the whole of the STJV, cannot tolerate the company rejecting the responsibilities of its own failures on its workers. We warned them long ago, but they ignored us and accused us of being too aggressive to speak with,” the Don’t Nod STJV union section wrote. “Faced with executives who have decided to mock their workers, a social movement like the one currently happening at Ubisoft is necessary. It is up to us to establish the necessary balance of power to save our jobs. We will not pay for our bosses' mistakes."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
A former member of renowned Texas-based support studio Certain Affinity has confirmed frequent reports the team was working on a battle royale mode for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a>, calling the cancelled project a potential "game changer".
</p>
<p>
Certain Affinity has worked on multiple major franchises since its founding in 2006, supporting development on the likes of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo">Halo</a> series, Call of Duty, and Doom 2016. One of its most intriguing projects, however, was the frequently rumoured and oft alluded to - but never officially confirmed - Halo-themed battle royale mode.
</p>
<p>
Whispers of the project began circulating in early 2022, when Certain Affinity <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-battle-royale-rumours-swirl-as-certain-affinity-confirms-it-has-joined-project">announced</a> it was "deepening" its relationship with Halo series stewards <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/343-industries">343 Industries</a> and working to 'evolve' Halo Infinite in "new and exciting ways" - later <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/studio-rumoured-to-be-making-halo-infinite-battle-royale-offers-fresh-tease">confirming</a> over 100 employees had been developing the mysterious "something" since at least 2020. But despite the massive amount of time and resources invested in the endeavour, reports surfaced this January that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-battle-royale-reportedly-cancelled-after-years-of-work">Microsoft was pulling the plug</a> - news that was followed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-call-of-duty-support-studio-certain-affinity-confirms-its-laying-off-25-employees">25 layoffs at Certain Affinity</a> two months later.

<p>
But while Certain Affinity and Microsoft have never publicly confirmed the succession of reports from reliable sources claiming the canned project was a battle royale mode for Halo Infinite, former Certain Affinity design director Mike Clopper - who recently joined Call of Duty studio Raven Software as a design director - has now done just that.
</p><p>
"I led a large team of designers working on a cancelled Battle Royale mode for Halo," Clopper wrote in an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-clopper-9300811/">update to his LinkedIn profile</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dev-claims-cancelled-halo-infinite-battle-royale-could-have-been-game-changing/">VGC</a>), adding, "I believe this product could have been a game changer for the franchise. We loved playing it and working on it, was a fantastic experience in spite of its cancelation."
</p>
<p>
Since the project's cancellation at Certain Affinity, Microsoft has announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-is-introducing-a-third-person-mode-for-the-very-first-time">third-person mode for Halo Infinite</a> - which is due to arrive next month - and has also shared its future plans for the Halo series. 343 Industries, now rebranded Halo Studios, is currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-developer-343-industries-rebrands-confirms-multiple-new-games">working on multiple new Halo games</a> - and the studio recently released some experimental footage showing how the series might look once it transitions to Unreal Engine 5. Digital Foundry, if you're curious, shared its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-halo-is-moving-to-unreal-engine-5-and-the-first-footage-looks-impressive">first impressions</a> of that "impressive" footage last week.

As files and information gradually surface, most of what we’ve seen so far has been early assets and concept art for old games over the franchise’s many years. But there have been a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1845560379428024713&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1845560379428024713" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">few details about upcoming games</a></span> being rounded up by every <em>Pokémon </em>leak and fan account, including next year’s <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> and beyond.

Specifically, the fact that the game will include Mega Evolutions for Zygarde and Zeraora. The former isn’t surprising, as Zygarde will likely play an important role in <em>Legends: Z-A </em>story, which takes place in the Kalos region from which the legendary Pokémon is based. Zeraora is more surprising, however, because it has no connection to the region, as it was introduced in Generation VII.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0b55d2bba7e922064c9631bd20406316" data-recommend-id="image://0b55d2bba7e922064c9631bd20406316" data-format="jpg" data-width="1241" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ash and Pikachu hug." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ash and Pikachu hug." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0b55d2bba7e922064c9631bd20406316" data-recommend-id="image://0b55d2bba7e922064c9631bd20406316" data-format="jpg" data-width="1241" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ash and Pikachu hug." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We do know a little bit more about the next generation of <em>Pokémon </em>games thanks to the leaks, though they haven’t been officially announced as of this writing. While <em>Legends: Z-A </em>will be out for the original Switch next year, the upcoming Generation X games are apparently being made for the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-specs-leaks-nintendo-screen-release-date-price-1851651185&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-specs-leaks-nintendo-screen-release-date-price-1851651185">Switch successor</a></span> with an original Switch version also being considered. These Generation X games will apparently take place in an archipelago of several islands. Fans are speculating it may be modeled after Greece as <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>’s Paldea region is based on the Iberian Peninsula. The pair of games are internally called <em>Pokémon K </em>and <em>N </em>in Japanese.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b8df2db231c9005d840c31ebb379ad90" data-recommend-id="image://b8df2db231c9005d840c31ebb379ad90" data-format="jpg" data-width="1462" data-height="822" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Several Pokemon try to stop Pikachu from dunking into a goal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Several Pokemon try to stop Pikachu from dunking into a goal." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b8df2db231c9005d840c31ebb379ad90" data-recommend-id="image://b8df2db231c9005d840c31ebb379ad90" data-format="jpg" data-width="1462" data-height="822" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Several Pokemon try to stop Pikachu from dunking into a goal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Also revealed in the leak is a game codenamed <em>Pokémon Synapse</em>, which is a multiplayer title (not an MMO, according to Centro Leaks) being developed by Game Freak in collaboration with <em>Pokémon Brilliant Diamond</em> and <em>Shining Pearl </em>studio ILCA. The game has been compared to Nintendo’s turf war shooter <em>Splatoon</em>.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="46eda18a285d3f0d3d568f5a0e1e0419" data-recommend-id="image://46eda18a285d3f0d3d568f5a0e1e0419" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Liko and Sprigatito cuddle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Liko and Sprigatito cuddle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="46eda18a285d3f0d3d568f5a0e1e0419" data-recommend-id="image://46eda18a285d3f0d3d568f5a0e1e0419" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Liko and Sprigatito cuddle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While Game Freak doesn’t make the <em>Pokémon </em>anime itself, it plays a crucial role in its creation, so there is some information about anime projects in the leaks, as well (though the status of these are more nebulous than the games). This includes details about the 24th animated movie codenamed “Project Bauer,” presumably a reference to television series <em>24</em>’s protagonist Jack Bauer. The project has apparently been in development hell since 2021, but was pitched as a reboot for the movie universe and would feature a different protagonist from original hero Ash Ketchum or current leads <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-horizons-anime-netflix-liko-roy-captain-pikachu-1851326504&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-horizons-anime-netflix-liko-roy-captain-pikachu-1851326504">Liko and Roy</a></span>. The movie would take place entirely in the original Kanto region and only feature Pokémon that debuted in the first games, with Mew the main mythical character.<br></p><p>Also in the works is an animated series internally called “Project Reload,” which will consist of a dozen 21-minute episodes. It has been in development since 2022 at Studio Colorido, who previously worked on the <em>Pokémon: Twilight Wings</em> limited-run series.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="51572d425c53bd7d245dfd073a152ff9" data-recommend-id="image://51572d425c53bd7d245dfd073a152ff9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1500" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Pikachu and Tim look at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pikachu and Tim look at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="51572d425c53bd7d245dfd073a152ff9" data-recommend-id="image://51572d425c53bd7d245dfd073a152ff9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1500" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Pikachu and Tim look at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Two live-action projects are also mentioned in the leaks, including the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/report-netflix-is-making-a-live-action-pokemon-series-1847363481&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/report-netflix-is-making-a-live-action-pokemon-series-1847363481">previously reported Netflix series</a></span>. The only details are that the first season will be eight episodes long and that up to five seasons are currently being considered, but nothing’s been greenlit at this moment.<br></p><p>The most important project, however, is a sequel to the 2019 live-action <em>Detective Pikachu </em>film starring Ryan Reynolds. The film entered development in 2021 and was titled <em>The Great Detective Pikachu</em>. <em>Kong: Skull Island </em>director Jordan Vogt-Roberts signed on to direct the sequel, but the status of the film is currently unknown.</p><hr><p>Not every leak has been about a new project, with a lot of the data featuring old assets from previous games dating back decades.
