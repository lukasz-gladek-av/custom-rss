<p>Acer recently showcased its newest gaming laptop concept during IFA Berlin 2024, one of the world’s largest tech conventions, and this baby had some impressive features. Two of the most notable takeaways from this laptop concept were the fact that it had a built-in controller and detachable speakers.</p>



<h2 id="h-gaming-laptop-concept-by-acer-has-built-in-controller">Gaming Laptop Concept By Acer Has Built-In Controller</h2>



<p>The built-in controller was easily the biggest takeaway from the showcase. While many gamers stand by the fact that keyboard and mouse is the best way to play, there are still quite a few people who prefer a controller. In fact, some keyboard and mouse players prefer to take a break from their desks and just sit back and utilize a controller.</p>



<p>Gaming with a controller also appeals to more casual gamers, which could be a big selling point for this laptop.</p>



<p>The way the computer is designed, the mouse pad is actually detachable with two joysticks and buttons on the side. This means you can use the controller as just a mouse or you can use it as a gaming controller. Either option is pretty cool.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The computer even allows for dual controllers, as the company showcased the feature by having two people play Street Fighter 6 against each other on the system.</p>



<p>Although, the device does have a smaller battery and cooling system to give it more room for the controller. This has led to many questioning whether or not the computer will be able to handle high-end gaming.</p>



<h2 id="h-acer-laptop-showcases-detachable-speakers">Acer Laptop Showcases Detachable Speakers</h2>



<p>Another fancy little feature showcased at the event was the Acer laptop’s detachable speakers. Want your speakers facing a different way? Maybe you would like to have them facing directly at you instead of upwards? Well, this newest feature allows gamers to customize their gaming space with the new detachable speakers.</p>



<p>So, will Acer implement all of these ideas? As of now, this is just a concept, meaning Acer could completely scrap it. </p>

                <p dir="ltr">If you've ever read a book and thought, "This would be a lot cooler if the main characters knew their stats and could see their health points," then you might want to check out the new print edition of the Dungeon Crawler Carl series, which is getting <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dungeon-Crawler-Carl-Matt-Dinniman/dp/059382024X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hardcover editions for the first time</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Written by Matt Dinniman, the popular book series belongs to a subgenre of fiction called "LitRPGs" that integrates video game tropes like stats, health bars, and inventory screens directly into the story. Rather than being a choose-your-own-adventure story or a tabletop RPG, LitRPG books are prose novels where the characters interact with the world in a game-like way--often because they are transported into an alternate video game reality or because outside forces morph the real world into a game-like setting. In Dungeon Crawler Carl, aliens have turned Earth into a 10-floor mega-dungeon, and each book in the series represents a different level of the dungeon with its own environmental identity, characters Carl meets, and objectives he completes in hopes of saving humanity.</p><p dir="ltr">If that sounds like a series you'd like to read, you're in luck--the first six Dungeon Crawler Carl books are getting print editions for the first time. The franchise began as an audiobook and ebook series, but now you can grab a h<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dungeon-Crawler-Carl-Matt-Dinniman/dp/059382024X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ardcover copy of the first book at Amazon</a> for just $20 (was $30).

            <p>
Among the many questions observers had following this week's shock shutdown of PlayStation 5v5 shooter Concord (albeit not necessarily at the top of their list) was if the now-defunct live-service title would still make an appearance in Amazon's upcoming animated video game anthology series Secret Level - and the answer, according to a new report at least, is yes.
</p>
<p>
Secret Level, if you haven't been following along, is a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reportedly-working-on-animated-anthology-tv-series-featuring-spelunky-and-other-video-game-worlds">15-episode series from the creators of Love, Death &amp; Robots</a> that'll feature original stories set in the world of games. More specifically, it'll include episodes centred on Armored Core, Crossfire, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Exodus, Honor of Kings, Mega Man, New World: Aeternum, PAC-MAN, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/spelunky">Spelunky</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/unreal-tournament">Unreal Tournament</a>, Warhammer 40,000, and a number of PlayStation Studios games.
</p>
<p>
More pertinently, though, it was also due to include an episode based on Concord - a decision made well before the game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">pulled from sale just two weeks after launch</a> amid less-than-stellar player numbers. And while developer Firewalk Studios has suggested Concord may one day return, many wondered if its Secret Level episode would get the chop given it was essentially envisaged as an advert for a game that, currently at least, effectively no longer exists.

<p>
While Amazon is yet to officially comment on the matter, IGN - citing a "source close to production" - has now reported Concord will <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-will-remain-in-prime-videos-secret-level-despite-games-sudden-cancellation-source">remain a part of Secret Level despite its recent closure</a>. That's perhaps not entirely surprising given the significant investment Amazon has likely made in the episode, but it'll certainly hit differently knowing what we now know.
</p>
<p>
Secret Level is currently due to make its Prime Video debut on 10th December this year, if you want to pour one out for Concord as its episode airs.

<p>Fortnite Globals happens this weekend with the best Fortnite players in the world heading to Texas to compete against one another. Every year during this season, many esports organizations quickly pick up some of the top players and XSET is no exception. The popular esports team recently announced their newest signing, Veno.</p>



<h2 id="h-veno-signs-to-xset-going-into-fortnite-globals">Veno Signs To XSET Going Into Fortnite Globals</h2>



<p>The Fortnite Global Championship is an annual event, where teams who qualified during the year’s various FNCS tournaments come together and compete against each other for a massive $3 million prize pool.</p>



<p>Many of the biggest names in Fortnite qualify for this event, with quite a few of them represented by large organizations. XSET, who has some massive Fortnite names on their roster, recently acquired Veno.</p>



<p>Veno has already gone down in history as one of the best Fortnite players of all time, with more than one FNCS first-place title and a second-place title from the FNCS Invitational back in 2022.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Veno acquired quite a bit of fame back in 2022 after he and the European player, Queasy, dominated in various FNCS Majors and the FNCS Invitational. The player really took the spotlight, though, after he and Queasy attempted to land second place while they were holding first during the last game of the 2022 Invitational.</p>



<p>Since then, Veno has qualified and placed in many different large Fortnite tournaments, making him one of the most decorative players in the scene.</p>







<h2 id="h-additional-players-in-xset">Additional Players In XSET</h2>



<p>XSET also has a few other Fortnite players on its roster, as the team has been preparing throughout 2024, getting as many big names as they can. </p>



<p><strong>Every Fortnite player on XSET:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Clix</li>



<li>Muz</li>



<li>Trashy</li>



<li>Ritual</li>



<li>Edgey</li>



<li>Cold</li>



<li>Veno</li>
</ul>



<p>Veno and Muz are the only non-North American players on XSET, at the moment.</p>

Its inclusion was thrown into doubt by PlayStation's decision to take Concord offline, seemingly spelling the end of the troubled live service game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Prime Video has yet to publicly announce whether or not it will remain in Tim Miller's anthology series, but IGN understands that the episode featuring Concord is indeed still slated to air this season.</p><p>In addition to Concord, Secret Level will include stories featuring God of War, Mega Man, Unreal Tournament, and other properties from throughout video game history. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-looks-like-keanu-reeves-is-in-amazons-armored-core-animation">Keanu Reeves is among the actors said to be starring in the series</a>.</p><p>Secret Level garnered attention at gamescom not just because of its large numer of familiar franchises, but because of Miller's involvement in popular anthologies such as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/love-death-and-robots-vol-3-review">Love, Death and Robots</a>.

In fact, it’s a testament to its FPS chops that even while it has a virtually nonexistent story and a serious need for a signature game mode, I still found myself losing dozens of hours to its PvP charms."</p><p>Concord is scheduled to go offline on September 6.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/nba-2k25-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nba-2k25-review-in-progress.973626/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nba-2k25-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Over the past few years, developer Visual Concepts’ focus on updating online features and adding more microtransactions has left the meat of its annualized basketball series a forgettable merry-go-round of rehashed ideas and uninspired modes. But after spending about a dozen hours with NBA 2K25 so far, it already feels like a grizzled league veteran instead, and the definition of a perennial starter—there are still gaps in its game, but solid fundamentals and a willingness to adapt help make it a reliable part of any rotation. Or, in this case, right now it seems like a novel and innovative entry that can win new fans and bring back oldheads alike.</p><p>Make no mistake, you still can’t teach a long-running basketball sim new tricks. But that doesn’t mean you can’t polish it until it becomes as smooth as Steph Curry’s buttery jumper. This is where the return of ProPLAY technology shines. Although it was initially brought on board as part of 2K24, this year’s iteration is much better. It produces more lifelike player animations and motions, so Paul George’s fluid jump shot and Jayson Tatum’s upper body heave look like the actual thing.</p><p>Visual Concepts' introduction of Go-To Moves further emphasizes NBA 2K25’s focus on realistic player movement. With it, you can recreate your favorite player’s iconic signature move, whether it’s Nikola Jokic’s one-legged sidestep jumper or Donovan Mitchell’s bump-and-stepback shot. I especially enjoy using (and abusing) these go-to moves whenever my play gets broken up or the clock is running down. After all, most of them, like KD’s crossover hesi pull-up, guarantee space creation and an open shot each time.</p><p>My only issue with it is the lack of variety. Yes, spamming the same, near-unstoppable go-to shot is nice, but I wish each superstar had more than one signature skill they could turn to. I was especially disappointed to see that go-to post moves were non-existent; a one-dribble pull-up fadeaway should not replace Joel Embiid’s real-life arsenal of dream shakes and shimmy fakes.</p><h2>Rhythm and Blues</h2><p>Another interesting new addition is Rhythm Shooting—a completely different and more complex way of scoring middies and threes. But I’ll be honest: as someone who’s tapped-and-released square all these years, I initially found it pointless. It just didn’t feel like there was an incentive to learn its trickier down-up Pro Stick motion. But after repeatedly trying both it and the classic shooting method with different jump shot animations, I started preferring Rhythm Shooting more—not only because it’s more forgiving toward imperfect releases, but also because you can seamlessly transition into dribble moves after faking a shot.</p><p>Of course, with revamped animations comes a new shot meter, which I was admittedly frustrated by the first time I played a full match with it. Can you blame me for getting angry after bricking three open shots in a row? Clearly, it was the shot meter’s fault and definitely not a skill issue. But even though I was dangerously close to hurling both hurtful insults and a controller at my TV, cooler heads prevailed, and I eventually learned about the new Shot Timing Profiles feature.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>NBA 2K25: Top 10 Players at Launch</h3></div></output><p>By default, NBA 2K25’s Shot Timing Profile is set to Difficulty-Based, meaning your current difficulty heavily influences your jump shot timings. So, if you’re playing on All-Pro, like me, your release needs to be near-perfect for your shots to go in. Or, if you’re on Hall of Fame for some reason, you might as well not even try. Thankfully, this isn’t your only choice, and there are four other profiles you can try out: Real Player %, Low Risk-Reward, Normal Risk-Reward, and High Risk-Reward.</p><p>After switching to Normal Risk-Reward, the setting “most similar” to the previous 2K timing, getting used to the new shot meter was much easier because an imperfect release had less impact on a shot (and thus, my TV was saved).  But Shot Timing Profiles can only do so much to mask that this year’s arrow shot meter, along with the ring and dial alternatives, are still difficult to time, and I wish there was an option that would let me use last year’s easier-to-master classic bar design instead.</p><p>After experimenting in the new tutorial hub, Learn2K, I was eager to see what the rest of NBA 2K25 had to offer. So, I went into MyNBA Eras to check out the new Steph Era, which, confusingly enough, begins in 2016, two years after the Warriors’ first championship and the true beginning of Curry's reign of terror. Or, should I say, three-rror? Get it? Although the Steph Era makes the 2010s uncomfortably congested (the LeBron Era takes place in the first half of the decade), it’s an addition that I can fully get behind, commemorating Steph and co’s near-unstoppable dynasty the way it deserves to be.</p><h2>RPGeez, Really?</h2><p>Since this was the only new feature in Eras, I immediately turned my attention to the return of MyGM, which, to my surprise, has <em>almost</em> turned into an RPG. I emphasize the word almost because its RPG elements feel patchy and incomplete. Upon selecting a pre-made character, you’re given a choice between six different backstories, which grant different attributes and perks depending on your preference. I enjoy that this allowed me to imagine a unique rags-to-riches tale for my up-and-coming general manager (for the record, I chose Ex-Scout because I wanted an Erik Spoelstra-like story), but the problems with this new RPG direction began once I finished creating my character and got thrust into bizarre conversations with some of my team’s staff members.</p><p>Every line of dialogue with these NPCs feels unnatural and forced, thrown together just to serve as a way of handing out in-season tasks. In my first conversation with the team governor, he immediately asked me to trade away our oldest (and best) player <em>because of a dream he had</em>. Frustrated, I almost handed in my resignation letter then and there. But Mama didn’t raise no quitter. So, after finishing my strange water cooler chat with the governor, I went on my way, exploring the rest of the new MyGM building.</p><p>Unfortunately, like the previous conversation’s idle and unrealistic tone, the MyGM building appears equally empty, barely filled with expensive equipment you can’t touch, as if it were a barebones museum. Instead of mirroring a bustling business hub for a multi-million dollar NBA team, the weirdly designed, single-floor space feels more like an expensive penthouse apartment you share with four strangers.</p><p>In it, NPC interactions are confusingly kept to a minimum; you can only speak with your team’s governor, scout, head coach, or best player if they have an exclamation point above their head. Otherwise, they’ll give you the cold shoulder. Outside of these rare conversations, the rest of your managerial responsibilities are conducted in the Nav menu, turning the MyGM building and the people within into even more of an afterthought.</p><h2>Don’t Call It a Comeback</h2><p>With the new features in MyNBA Eras being slightly underwhelming, I was preparing myself for disappointment before diving into the refreshed MyCareer mode. Oh, how wrong I was. As soon as I started it up for the first time, I was immediately placed into every hooper’s childhood fantasy: it’s overtime in game seven of the NBA Finals, my team’s in the lead, and (after choosing my preferred position, team, and appearance) I got to play out the rest of the match for a chance at history.</p><p>Although only a short snippet of my player’s potential storyline to kick things off, this immediate thrust into a high-stakes scenario is the sudden revitalizing jolt MyCareer needed following last year’s disappointment. That said, after finishing the match (spoiler alert: we won), I've admittedly spent most of my time in the mode so far trying out different Pro-Tuned Builds and NBA Template Builds because I couldn’t decide on one. That’s been fun in its own right, but I still have to dive back in and make that intro a reality before my final review.</p><p>So, having only spent a few days with NBA 2K25 as of yet, I still have a lot more to play before reaching a verdict. I’ve only had a limited amount of time to check out its shiny new online features, for example, but  I'm at least cautiously optimistic about what I’ve seen overall after enduring 2K24’s glaring shortcomings and its disastrous lack of a single-player storyline. Here’s hoping my optimism isn’t smothered by an inevitable wave of microtransaction ads in MyTeam. Either way, I’ll be back with a score next week.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It wasn’t long ago that the city-building genre was more relaxed—a tame experience overall that felt like it was meant to ease new players into the strategy genre as a whole. But then titles such as Banished launched and took the genre by storm, creating a subgenre that melded survival with city-building for a more hardcore experience. Then, along came Frostpunk. It ramped up the core mechanics of the survival city-building genre tenfold. Now, we’re about to dive into Frostpunk 2 this year. Here’s everything we know about Frostpunk 2!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-frostpunk-2">What is Frostpunk 2?</h2>



<p>Frostpunk 2 is a survival city-building strategy game set 30 years after the first title, in which an apocalyptic winter takes hold of the planet and won’t release its grip. As humanity struggles to survive in settlements across the world, utilizing coal and oil to power heating mechanisms and generators, the world worsens, and people become desperate. </p>



<p>As in the first game, Frostpunk 2 will heavily focus on morals. Will you provide equality for your citizens? Will you force children to work instead of investing time in classrooms? Do your citizens deserve full rations after a hard day at work? You must decide how best to guide your civilization through the end times, even if that means upsetting a few groups along the way.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-frostpunk-2-release-date">Do We Know the Frostpunk 2 Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via 11 bit studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Following a few delays during development, 11 bit studios finally unveiled the official release date of Frostpunk 2 as <strong>September 20</strong>. At the time of this writing, we’re just a few weeks away from the game’s launch.</p>



<p>If you’re a fan of the previous title, this new iteration promises completely overhauled gameplay. It continues the story of the world’s end as we know it during a winter apocalypse!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-are-the-frostpunk-2-system-requirements">What Are the Frostpunk 2 System Requirements</h2>



<p>While certainly not the most demanding genre in gaming, strategy does have its exceptions. Frostpunk 2 is a genuinely gorgeous, albeit bleak, game that pushes the genre’s envelope. But based on its system requirements, you should have no trouble running the game on current hardware norms.</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor: </strong>AMD Ryzen 5 / Intel Core i5 2.5 GHz</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: AMD RX 550 4 GB / Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti 4 GB / Intel ARC A310 4 GB</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 8 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 30 GB (SSD Required)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-system-requirements">Recommended System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor: </strong>AMD Ryzen 7 / Intel Core i7 2.8 Ghz</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: AMD RX 5700 8 GB / Nvidia 2060 Super RTX 8 GB / Intel ARC A770 8 GB</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 30 GB (SSD Required)</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-what-platforms-is-frostpunk-2-releasing-on">What Platforms is Frostpunk 2 Releasing On?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via 11 bit studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s uncommon for a strategy game to launch simultaneously on PC and consoles, but Frostpunk 2 aims to reach as broad an audience as possible in September. Here’s what platforms you can play Frostpunk 2 on at launch:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>PC</strong></li>



<li><strong>PlayStation </strong>5</li>



<li><strong>Xbox Series X|S</strong></li>
</ul>

It’s a message that ends teasing that fans should “be on the lookout for more announcements in the near future,” but the biggest reveal starts at the top of the page. </p><p>If you take a close look between the PlayStation logo and the 30 in the image below, you’ll see what many fans have picked up on: a foreign PS5 design that features three stripes on its side.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/05/screenshot-2024-09-05-150456-1725567211175.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Sony seemingly teases the design of the PS5 Pro in this PlayStation 30th Anniversary image.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Sony has released a number of PS5 plates since the console was first released in 2020. Although players have been able to pick up <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-ps5-console-covers-announced">various cover colors</a> and, more recently, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-internet-weighs-in-on-the-ps5-redesign-and-plenty-think-it-looks-no-different-than-before"><u>single-striped PS5 Slim</u></a>, a PS5 with three breaks in its plates has never been officially revealed. Considering the likely tease accompanies the announcement that Sony’s 30th anniversary plans are on the horizon, we may not have to wait that much longer to see what could be an official announcement for what many are already calling the PS5 Pro.</p><p>Although Sony hasn’t gone as far as to reveal or name its long-awaited PS5 upgrade, fans have anticipated an announcement for months. Now nearly four years removed from the launch of the fifth PlayStation console, it’s high time for a mid-gen refresh that gives gamers more tools to play their favorite titles. There’s also the fact that, last week, reliable <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-nom-le-design-de-la-nouvelle-console-de-playstation-avec-plein-dautres-details-inedits-59094" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>leaker billbil-kun shared</u></a> what they said was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-leak-reveals-alleged-name-and-design-of-the-console"><u>the design of the PS5 Pro</u></a>, publishing a picture that looks remarkably similar to what we’re seeing today. The time is right and the rumors are swirling more than ever, but until Sony confirms the news itself, it’s best to keep expectations for the PS5 Pro low for now.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Another look at the PS5 Pro design <a href="https://t.co/WLI6Vy9hLH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/WLI6Vy9hLH</a></p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1831776473839247819?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 5, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, Sony is said to be aiming to release a new console sometime during this year’s holiday season, with an official announcement possibly happening ahead of Tokyo Game Show.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguards-devs-reveal-new-info-about-each-of-the-companions-and-solas-and-varric-too.973590/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguards-devs-reveal-new-info-about-each-of-the-companions-and-solas-and-varric-too<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Friendships, romantic relationships, and everything in between have always been an integral part of not just the Dragon Age series, but of BioWare in general. From Mass Effect’s Garrus Vakarian to Dragon Age’s Varric Tethras, the characters – and how they get along with the player – are inseparable from titles from the studio.</p><p>But, perhaps more than any other BioWare game, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is leaning in <em>heavily </em>on this idea, as it’s already easy to see from the marketing material. For one, the name changed from Dragon Age: Dreadwolf back in June, with BioWare general manager Gary McKay <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay"><u>telling us at the time</u></a> that it was out of a desire to shift the focus to a “really deep and compelling group of companions.” That would be followed by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/first-dragon-age-the-veilguard-trailer-revealed-alongside-familiar-faces-xbox-showcase-2024"><u>a first official trailer at Summer Game Fest</u></a> that put the focus squarely on seven new companions that will be tagging along with the player character, Rook, in The Veilguard.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>With all that in mind, it’s little surprise to hear game director Corinne Busche talk about how these companions aren’t <em>just</em> central to the story of The Veilguard, but the gameplay and combat as well.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"You're going to develop trust, understanding. That doesn't mean you're always going to agree.”</p></div><p>“Building a relationship with companions has always been a staple of Dragon Age, but this time around, that relationship translates into how well you work together as a team,” Busche tells IGN. “It is how you're actually going to level up your companions, by getting to know them better. That's how you're going to unlock skill points. So when you look at all of the various abilities the companions have, there's inherent combos and synergies and roles that they'll have on the battlefield.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard - Preview Gallery</h3></div></output><p>She uses the example of Neve, the mysterious detective mage who has a wildly useful special ability to slow time in combat. “But if I really get the opportunity to know her,” Busche explains, “whether it's platonic or romantic, I'm going to help be able to shape her skills and augment those abilities that work really well with my own personal build, so our sense of teamwork really deepens.”</p><p>During our time with the game, IGN got to see some of this in action; unsurprisingly, Dragon Age: The Veilguard has an approval/disapproval system, with pop-up text on the side of the screen indicating whether or not a companion liked what Rook just did or said. But something new in this Dragon Age: even just completing a quest with a companion in your party increases your “bond” with them, whether they agree with how you handled things or not. Your relationship, Busche says, isn’t necessarily about “how much they like you, but how well you get to know them.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Dragon Age (@dragonage) <a href="https://twitter.com/dragonage/status/1828492421639860624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 27, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>“This is about a found family,” Busche tells us. “That is, they have the same goals, different complications in their life, but they're all giving everything they have to defend Thedas. You're going to get to know them really well. You're going to develop trust, understanding. That doesn't mean you're always going to agree.”</p><p>But, we’ll have plenty more to say about the game systems and combat later. With Busche, we had the opportunity to really dive into the seven companions at the center of The Veilguard and what they’re all about. Here’s what she had to say about each one:</p><h3><strong>Davrin</strong></h3><p><strong>Faction</strong>: Grey Warden</p><p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Ike Amadi</p><p><strong>Previous Dragon Age appearances</strong>: None</p><p><strong>Busche: “</strong>When we were thinking about Davrin, how we were going to develop him as a character, we had to think about, 'How is he going to show up on the battlefield?' And it was unique because he has this, I guess you could say, companion of his own, the griffon Assan. That makes him, as a companion, very unique, because Assan shows up on the battlefield. So we had to think about how that integrates into his abilities, where Davrin as a Grey Warden is capable on his own, but also, when does he call upon Assan and what does that look like? What happens if you're indoors?... And indeed, when you're doing some of Davrin's content, just seeing Assan gliding through the environments, you really get a sense that they care and they're protective about each other. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"I absolutely love when you're journeying with Davrin, not only his aesthetic, how he carries himself as a Warden, but how he interacts with his fellow Wardens."</p></div><p>“…When we think about Davrin and his being the representative of the Grey Wardens within the team of The Veilguard, it was an opportunity for us to really go back to some of those roots that we know our fans, our players, deeply care about. Dragon Age: Origins, of course, was so Grey Warden-forward. We want to evoke those memories, those connections that our players have. And I absolutely love when you're journeying with Davrin, not only his aesthetic, how he carries himself as a Warden, but how he interacts with his fellow Wardens. The little wrinkle of, 'Hey, there actually are some griffons remaining in Thedas,' how he learns as a Warden to train and interact with these griffons that, to our knowledge, haven't existed for quite some time, it's a learning experience on a lost art of the Grey Wardens that is really unique to Davrin's character.”</p><h3><strong>Harding</strong></h3><p><strong>Faction: </strong>None (scout)</p><p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Ali Hillis</p><p><strong>Previous Dragon Age appearances</strong>: Dragon Age: Inquisition, The Missing (comic book)</p><p><strong>Busche: “</strong>To talk about Harding as a companion, I guess I'd have to go back to Inquisition. Of course, Harding showed up. She was your scout on the field. There was a light romance with her, and I think one of the things that the team didn't quite expect is how much Harding would catch on in Inquisition. Players fell in love with her, and we heard them. They wanted a deeper romance, they wanted more engagement with Harding. So for the team, I felt like it was kind of a no-brainer for us to bring back Harding, and we also wanted to reestablish that connection to the Inquisition in the world of Thedas, which occurred 10 years ago, the events of Inquisition.</p><p>“Harding serves as our proxy back to those events, and you get to learn about what's happened with the Inquisition since, so she presents some really lovely opportunities for us. I will say, personality-wise and her role on the battlefield, she is among my favorites. When you see her leap into the air, unleashing these devastating attacks with her bow and arrow, I just can't get enough of her.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3><strong>Taash</strong></h3><p><strong>Faction</strong>: Lords of Fortune</p><p><strong>Voiced by: </strong>Jin Maley</p><p><strong>Previous Dragon Age appearances</strong>: None</p><p><strong>Busche</strong>: “Taash, in the creation of their arc, is one of our more complex characters. It's a journey along their arc that is about introspection. 'Where do I belong in the world? What are my boundaries? What do I fight for? How do I become at peace with who I am?' So I love the juxtaposition, actually, between Taash's personal journey and this imposing literal dragon slayer, that sort of hard exterior and really gentle interior. It makes Taash a really special companion for me.”</p><p>(When asked which companion had the steamiest romance): “I'll just speak for me personally, but at the culmination of the romance arcs, I'd have to say Taash. When I got to that scene and saw the finished version of that cinematic, I was hollering. <em>Hollering</em>.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3><strong>Emmrich</strong></h3><p><strong>Faction: </strong>Mourn Watch</p><p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Nick Boraine</p><p><strong>Previous Dragon Age appearances</strong>: The Flame Eternal (<a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-inquisition/news/the-eternal-flame" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>short story</u></a>)</p><p><strong>Busche: “</strong>The thing about Emmrich that is going to surprise our fans the most is his relationship with necromancy. I really love that we kind of turned the idea of a necromancer on its head here, where you think of them as these conjurers of evil, the certain malice when you hear the term 'necromancer,' but it couldn't be farther from the truth for Emmrich. There is a reverence about the dead. He has a unique relationship with death. You get to explore how he ended up in the Mourn Watch. Death has shaped this character in all aspects of his life, and we frequently refer to him as our gentleman necromancer. I think his proper, kind nature stems from that respect that he's learned about this cycle of life and death throughout his life. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Death has shaped this character in all aspects of his life, and we frequently refer to him as our gentleman necromancer."</p></div><p>“Manfred is like a son to Emmrich. He very much has an affinity for this wisp, this life force that he's given a second chance through this skeletal body, and in many ways, it's the story of a parent raising a child. Emmrich, he needs to teach Manfred and help him along to develop as a character of their own, things like learning new skills, how to assist The Veilguard. Some of our most charming moments are in dealing with Manfred, and I must say I absolutely love the interactions. They just have me rolling whenever Manfred steals the show.</p><p>“…In my last playthrough, I romanced Emmrich. What I also loved is as I'm synergizing with him as we're doing combos, just having him refer to me as ‘my dear’ on the battlefield. ‘Well done, my dear!’ It just fills me with joy every time.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3><strong>Lucanis</strong></h3><p><strong>Faction</strong>: Antivan Crows</p><p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Zach Mendez</p><p><strong>Previous Dragon Age appearances</strong>: Tevinter Nights (short story anthology)</p><p><strong>Busche</strong>: “The character that went through the most changes [throughout development] without a doubt was Lucanis. Lucanis is very complex. He's an assassin. He is very skilled in the art of death. The Antivan Crows, they pursue these contracts with a certain level of dispassion, but also, Lucanis is a romantic, and he's dealing with some internal struggles. He's been through a lot of trauma. He's relearning how to trust. And all of those elements come together with a richness, but it creates a lot of complexity in how we tell that story. So I'd say Lucanis is the first one that comes to my mind in terms of the thought that's gone into it, where we've had to make adjustments to really cover all facets of his character.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3><strong>Neve</strong></h3><p><strong>Faction: </strong>Shadow Dragons</p><p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Jessica Clark</p><p><strong>Previous Dragon Age appearances</strong>: Trevinter Nights, The Missing</p><p><strong>Busche: “</strong>Neve is our confident noir detective. I love to bring her onto the battlefield because she's just so incredibly capable. She's our ice mage, so really big on controlling the battlefield, and that's actually a good metaphor to her arc. She wants to fight for change. She wants to fight for a better Minrathous, and she's going to use all the tools at her disposal to try and reshape Minrathous into a better place for all. She's very much a Shadow Dragon. This is among the mantra of the Shadow Dragons. They operate from the shadows, fighting for a better Minrathous. So as this accomplished ice mage, she's fierce. She's not going to shy away from any challenge, whether it's taking down darkspawn or dealing with the Magisterium in Minrathous.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard Screenshots</h3></div></output><h3><strong>Bellara</strong></h3><p><strong>Faction</strong>: Veil Jumpers</p><p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Jee Young Han</p><p><strong>Previous Dragon Age appearances</strong>: None</p><p><strong>Busche</strong>: “Oh, my dear, sweet Bellara. I relate to Bellara a lot. She is joyous. She's been through a lot, but she remains curious, optimistic. She's kind of a geek. She really likes her fiction. She fangirls over Neve a little bit. She's just so relatable, and I think that's what our players will find and fall in love with when they get to meet Bellara, is just how much you'll recognize some of those patterns and sensibilities that she holds, but don't let it fool you. She is also a Veil Jumper. She's very comfortable in elven ruins. I frequently bring her with me in my party. I like to play rogue. I like to play the Veil Jumper, or the Veil Ranger. Bellara's a fantastic companion to set up that spec with electric vulnerabilities, so I love her both on and off the battlefield.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/05/ign-first-varric-and-solas-illo-copy-1725563602830.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>Bonus round</strong>: Solas</h3><p><strong>Voiced by: </strong>Gareth David-Lloyd</p><p><strong>Previous Dragon Age appearances</strong>: Dragon Age: Inquisition, The Masked Empire (novel), Tevinter Nights, Dark Fortress (comic series)</p><p>Okay okay, so Solas isn’t technically one of your core companions who will travel with you, but given his place in the Dragon Age story, we <em>still</em> had to ask about his relationship with Rook. Here’s what Busche had to say:</p><p><strong>Busche</strong>: “Rook's relationship with Solas is a complicated one. Everyone has seen, at this point, the gameplay reveal and the opening moments of the game, so you'll know things got shaken up pretty radically for Solas already. He's trapped. He's basically communicating with you as an advisor, and I absolutely love that idea of, ‘He's your lifeline right now, but can you trust him?’ And those touch points with him, ‘Do I take his advice or not? Can he be trusted? Is he going to betray me?’ All the while giving you this information that you absolutely need in order to be successful.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"[Solas is] basically communicating with you as an advisor, and I absolutely love that idea of, ‘He's your lifeline right now, but can you trust him?’ "</p></div><p>“It creates an interesting stage for us, where, I think our fans will agree, Solas is very complicated. He firmly believes he's doing the right thing, and some of our fans will agree that he's trying to do the right thing. Others will not, and this creates a stage for you, the player, where you get to lean into those tendencies of your own as you're taking advice from Solas throughout parts of the game. I think those really interesting debates about, ‘Was he ever redeemable? Can he be trusted? Was he wrong all along?’ You're really going to be able to dive in deep on that.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3><strong>Bonus round #2</strong>: Varric</h3><p><strong>Previous Dragon Age Appearances: </strong>Dragon Age II, Dragon Age: Inquisition, Knight Errant (comic book), Tevinter Knights, The Missing</p><p>Varric, while a part of Dragon Age: The Veilguard and a series mainstay, isn’t part of your core companions either. <em>But</em>, as fans can see in the trailers, he’s still very much in The Veilguard, so we asked Dragon Age creative director John Epler about how he’s changed since we last saw him in Inquisition:</p><p><strong>Epler</strong>: “Since the events of Dragon Age: Inquisition, he has spent the time, just briefly, obviously, [serving as] Viscount of Kirkwall. I mean, anybody who knows much about Varric knows how well a job where he sits around and tells people what to do is going to sit with him. He has been participating in the hunt for Solas. And I think for Varric in particular, that's a very difficult thing for him to do because Solas is his friend. Solas is somebody that he grew close to over the events of Inquisition. They adventure together, they work together.</p><p>“And now knowing who Solas really is, that eats at Varric. Because Varric always sees, Varric believes he can always make somebody do the right thing. Varric believes he is the most convincing, charismatic, because he cares about people. And he has this belief that as long as I get a chance to talk to Solas, I'm going to be able to turn him. But as he's seeing what Solas' ritual is doing to the world around him, as he experienced in the comics, Dragon Age: The Missing, that eats at him a little bit. That's challenging his world view of him as always being the best judge of people, being able to see that somebody is able to be redeemed. And he's starting to question a little bit, ‘am I right or am I being a fool by believing in Solas?’ ”</p><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard releases on PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S on October 31, 2024.</em></p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

            <p>
A recently leaked image purportedly showing Sony's heavily discussed but still officially under-wraps PlayStation 5 Pro appears to have received corroboration from an unexpected source. A near-identical design has now been spotted in the background of Sony's newly unveiled official PlayStation 30th anniversary artwork.
</p>
<p>
Last week, prolific leaker bilbil-kun <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-pro-design-reportedly-leaks">shared details of Sony's still unannounced PS5 Pro</a>, alongside an illustration of its outer shell. While it mostly retained the PS5's familiar open-shirt design, it included one notable change: in place of the single diagonal stripe found on the body of the PlayStation Slim, the leaked PS5 Pro design featured three diagonal ridged lines.
</p>
<p>
Keep that in mind as we now hurtle forward in time to the present, and Sony's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstations-30th-anniversary-celebrations-include-digital-soundtracks-and-a-board-game">recently announced PlayStation 30th anniversary celebrations</a>. Alongside details of its birthday activities - which are set to include the release of several digital soundtracks as well as a new range of toys - Sony shared new anniversary artwork featuring a grey cross, triangle, circle, and square made up of various PlayStation consoles and peripherals.
</p>

<p>
And there, right between the PlayStation logo and a big old number three, sits something that doesn't resemble a currently released PlayStation device, but which looks awfully familiar all the same: a large rectangular machine with three distinct diagonal ridges running along its side. So yes, this may well be our first official confirmation, albeit indirectly, of PS5 Pro's existence.
</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/PS5-Pro-enhance.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<p>
And if last week's design is accurate, it seems reasonable to assume other details shared by bilbil-kun (that PS5 Pro will be a digital-only model possibly with support for the PS5 disc drive add-on) are too. It was also claimed Sony would formally announce the console this month, so with official artwork seemingly now out in the wild, we could be on the cusp of a full reveal.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer and Digital Foundry have been tracking the PS5 Pro's path to release since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-df-weekly-are-the-latest-switch-2-and-ps5-pro-leaks-actually-plausible">leaks first emerged last summer</a>. Since then, PS5 Pro <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-pro-leaked-specs-appear-online">technical specs</a> have appeared online, which Eurogamer understands to be accurate, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-pro-leaked-specs-appear-online">Digital Foundry analysis</a> dubbed the PS5 Pro "the most powerful console yet". April brought word Sony has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/which-games-will-get-sonys-ps5-pro-enhanced-label">prepping a "PS5 Pro Enhanced" label</a> for new and older patched games that will take advantage of its upcoming hardware, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-new-ps5-pro-gpu-details-emerge-including-a-235ghz-max-boost-clock">yet more technical details</a> leaked in May. Hopefully, all will be revealed soon.

		<p>The early access launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a> has disappointingly been plagued with server issues for the always-online game, as Nacon and developer KT Racing… race to find fixes to get the game’s server capacity solidified for the full launch on 12th September.</p>
<p>The studio has issued <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1249970/view/4593196713075894202">a statement on Steam</a> explaining the issues and the steps being taken to remedy the situation:</p>


<blockquote><p>Since the official server launch today at 08:00 AM UTC, many players have encountered severe connection issues with the game, mainly with login, lobbies, and various online features. These issues applies to all platforms: PC (Steam), PS5 &amp; Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>Our teams are working tirelessly to stabilize the servers so that everyone can enjoy the game as soon as possible. To give you more context on the current situation, we have tried multiple solutions to address these network issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our server team has actively investigated the root causes of connection failures.</li>
<li>We have implemented server optimizations to handle the high volume of players trying to access the game.</li>
<li>We have increased server capacity to reduce queues and connection failures.</li>
<li>Our quality assurance team has conducted thorough tests to ensure the stability of our fixes before deploying them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although each solution has helped partially, some of them have also introduced new technical challenges.</p>
<p>We are actively working to resolve all the network issues and thank you again for your patience.</p></blockquote>
<p>The issues were already a factor before this public launch, blocking us from reviewing the game as maintenance affected all journalists’ ability to play the game on Tuesday and Wednesday, and a separate bug and issue blocked us specifically before then.</p>
<p>A queueing system is currently in place for the game, noting around 1,600 players waiting on PS5 tonight, which gradually ticks down, and then in our case led to getting kicked out to a more general ‘Login Error’ screen. SteamDB notes a peak player count on PC of 4,300 – this will simply be a total of players with the client open, so it’s not clear how many are actively able to play.</p>
<p>All of this is a pretty serious issue, and one that immediately has fans of the series and early buyers either <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tdu3/">turning around and requesting refunds, or banging the drum over the game’s always-online requirement</a>. This would not have been such an issue with an offline play option, though that obviously has consequences for the game’s internal economy and progression.</p>

<p>Another potential factor is that developers have been going on strike against publisher Nacon in the last couple weeks, organising under the union banner of <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/category/news-en/">Le Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo (SJV)</a>. RPG developer Spiders went on strike last week, and on Monday they were joined by colleageues at Kylotonn, who complained:</p>
<p><em>“Management regularly brings up the studios’ supposed independence, but every demand we make gets rejected with the argument that there should be coherence within the Nacon group. Much in the same way, negotiations are hampered under the same pretense.</em></p>
<p><em>“If no improvement in our working conditions is offered because “it would drive other studios within the group to ask for the same”, it stands to reason then that we make those demands together.”</em></p>
<p>Nacon has entered into discussions with workers already last week, but complaints have not yet been fully addressed, and further strikes could potentially hamper Solar Crown’s launch.</p>
<p>All in all, it seems like a difficult time at KT Racing right now. We hope that they’re able to resolve the server issues soon, and also that negotiations with workers company-wide are able to reach a satisfactory conclusion.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-preview-bigger-better-and-more-approachable</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-preview-bigger-better-and-more-approachable.973569/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-preview-bigger-better-and-more-approachable<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Everything I loved about<em> Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> is back in the sequel, just done in a bigger and better way. More importantly for some, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is more refined -- easier to get a grip on.</p>
<p>Because <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> is so crunchy with so much emphasis on trying to be as realistic as possible, it’s an easy title to bounce off of. Layer on top of that a combat system that takes some time to get used to, and it can be an even tougher sale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thankfully, from the brief time I played with the sequel, a lot of that is much easier to get a grip on and understand right away. The sequel is just as deep with just as many moving pieces as before, just easier to manage this time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first place that is apparent is in the combat. It’s smoother, the visual cues are more clear, and it felt a lot more attainable to be competent enough quickly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to emphasize, however, that I don’t mean that <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em> is "dumbing down" what was already there. This is just a more refined system that has the side benefit of being more approachable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My ability to block, after not having played the original in years mind you, was already better than before. I wasn't perfect by any means, and this was just a demo of course, so there's still a lot of meat on the bone for people to sink their teeth into.</p>
<p>Taking on the role of Henry again, it was like sleeping into a comfortable pair of shoes. The same humor and tone is throughout the story and dialogue with NPCs. If you were a fan of the writing in the original, you’ll be more than satisfied with <em>KCD 2</em> I imagine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While various game systems have been streamlined a bit more, like the combat, the biggest upgrade I experienced in my demo was just the sheer scale of the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The demo took place in Kuttenberg, a large German city in Bohemia. A real place, it was full of buildings, market stalls, taverns, guild halls, and so much more. Hundreds of NPCs were walking around &nbsp;going about their daily tasks.</p>

<p>The original game featured &nbsp;nothing of that scale at all, so seeing all of the intricate systems of<em> Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> working together with so many NPCs densely packed together is going to be interesting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re interested in the historical aspects of the <em>Kingdom Come</em> series, then you’ll be happy to know that commitment to historical accuracy continues here as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em> is set in Bohemia, so we’ll be in an entirely new region from the first game. With historians on the team to keep things as close to accurate as possible, the time period and area have been meticulously recreated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, the game will feature some cool actual historical events you’ll get to experience as Henry. For example, the city of Kuttenberg will be under siege at some point, which actually happened and is something Henry will get to see firsthand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end, I think what I played shows that Warhorse Studios is doing exactly what they need to do with <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>. They've rounded some of the sharp edges while beefing up the best parts of the game. &nbsp;</p>
<hr><p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II was demoed on a PC at PAX West 2024.</p>

<p>One of the biggest selling points of a new system, whether part of the current generation or the follow-up, is the technical specifications. If a system isn’t more powerful than what’s currently available, then what’s the point? So, what are the PS5 Pro specifications? Here’s everything we know about what’s under the hood on Sony’s new system!</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-ps5-pro-specifications">Do We Know the PS5 Pro Specifications?</h2>



<p>Here’s what we currently know about the PS5 Pro specifications. Since we’re so close to the system’s rumored release date, it’s unlikely anything will change significantly between now and the release. If it does, however, we’ll update this guide to ensure you know precisely what you’re getting in the brand-new hardware!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>System Memory</strong>: 576 GB/s (18GT/s) – A staggering 28% increase over the current PlayStation 5 console.</li>



<li><strong>CPU</strong>: Identical to the current PlayStation 5 console but with “High CPU Frequency Mode,” which increases the CPU to 3.85GHZ.</li>



<li><strong>Audio</strong>: ACV at a higher clock speed than the current PlayStation 5 console, with a 35% increase in performance.</li>



<li><strong>GPU</strong>
<ul>
<li>45% faster rendering than the current PlayStation 5 console</li>



<li>2-3x Ray-tracing</li>



<li>33.5 Teraflops</li>



<li>PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution Upscaling)</li>



<li>Support for up to 8K resolutions</li>



<li>Custom machine learning architecture</li>



<li>AI Accelerator, supporting up to 300 TOPS of 8-bit computation / 67 TFLOPS of 16-bit floating point</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Software</strong>: SKD 9.00 (SKD 10.00 expected in Fall 2024)</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-is-the-ps5-pro-worth-it">Is The PS5 Pro Worth It?</h2>



<p>If you’re a big fan of high graphical fidelity in your video games, then you’ll likely find the new technical specifications of the PlayStation 5 Pro worthwhile. It’s a more robust system overall, meaning better graphics and a more streamlined experience when enjoying games at home on a 4K television.</p>

While Netflix’s original anime spin-off, <em>Terminator Zero</em>, doesn’t entirely shake the uncanny sameness of its predecessors, it boldly returns to the series long-lost core theme: “No fate but what we make.”<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195369" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Netflix's One Piece Live-Action Trailer Has A Treasure Trove Of Anime Easter Eggs" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="195369,193144,193799" data-current="195369"><div><p>Netflix's One Piece Live-Action Trailer Has A Treasure Trove Of Anime Easter Eggs</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195369/195369_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195369/195369_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195369/195369_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195369/195369_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20838.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>At first, it seems like<em> Terminator Zero</em>, written by <em>The Batman</em> co-writer Mattson Tomill and animated by <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> studio Production I.G., retreads the same narrative beats of every film from<em> Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines</em> to <em>Terminator: Dark Fate</em>: killer robots are going back in time to snuff out humanity. And intially at least, it seems that <em>Terminator Zero</em> is treading that teritory as well, with its time-jumping hero Eiko (played by <em>House of the Dragon</em>’s Sonoya Mizuno) tasked with protecting a scientist and his children from a Terminator hellbent on stopping a rival AI program from thwarting Skynet. To make matters worse, she has 24 hours to save them all from Timothy Olyphant’s terrifying Terminator before Skynet goes online and kickstarts a nuclear holocaust.</p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But while <em>Terminator Zero</em>’s eight episodes are filled with the typical gory killing sprees and callback catchphrases the series is known for, the anime offers a shocking revelation in its sixth episode: all this time traveling isn’t changing the existing futures, it’s creating separate timelines. Instead of using this twist to deter its hero on the futility of her mission, <em>Terminator </em>Zero weaponizes this revelation to light a fire under Eiko, just like the one that drove Sarah Connor in <em>Terminator 2</em>.<br></p><p>In the original <em>Terminator</em>, time-traveling hero Kyle Reese brings Sarah a message from her son John, the leader of humanity’s resistance in his grim future, which includes the phrase, “The future is not set.” From there, the idea that there is “no fate but what we make” became <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://terminator.fandom.com/wiki/No_Fate_(quote)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://terminator.fandom.com/wiki/No_Fate_(quote)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a refrain in the <em>Terminator </em>films</a></span>, and though Eiko has learned that she can’t change fate for the people she knows because her actions can only create a new branch in time, rather than alter an existing one,&nbsp;she nonetheless decides that a new present and a completely different future are something worth fighting for. Mix that in with some existential debates between an AI and its creator about whether or not humanity is a disease that should be purged, and a Terminator with a retrofitted crossbow attachment to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/videos/terminator-zero-exclusive-behind-the-scenes-clip&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/terminator-zero-exclusive-behind-the-scenes-clip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">circumvent Japanese gun laws</a></span>, and you’ve got a pretty smart anime on your hands.<br></p><p>Speaking with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/terminator-zero-mattson-tomlin-searched-reddit-ive-got-to-just-try-not-to-make-everybody-mad&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/terminator-zero-mattson-tomlin-searched-reddit-ive-got-to-just-try-not-to-make-everybody-mad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span>, Tomill recounted how he navigated developing a story for a world that already has its own—albeit uneven—canon while putting his own emotional spin on its storytelling.</p><p>“I don’t recommend you do what I did, [but] if you get on Reddit for four seconds, you very quickly go, ‘Okay, there’s a lot of things [fans] don’t want. And then there’s a lot of things that they do, and then there’s kind of this in-between area,’” Tomill said. “And so for me, it’s going on a journey of [asking], ‘Why does this need to exist in 2024? What is it that I have to say that is real, that is emotional?’<br></p><p>He continues: “For me, once I find something emotional and something where [I go], ‘Oh, I can use this as the vessel to tell an emotional story that really means something to me,’ then it’s just a matter of going, ‘Okay, what do people expect?’ Well, they expect Terminators. I think that they expect a level of time travel. They expect, whether or not they would articulate it this way, a story about families. The first movie is a love story between a man and a woman, and the second one is a mother-son story. And so I think it’s about sticking to those tenets and then going, ‘Okay, now I’ve got to just try not to make everybody mad.’”<br></p><p>While your mileage may vary with the Netflix anime’s surface-level moral quandaries,&nbsp;<em>Terminator Zero</em> boasts the best writing the troubled franchise has had in the last 30 years. Hopefully the series will steer clear of leaning on the crutch of Arnold Swarzenegger’s T-800 and Linda Hamilton’s Sarah Connor, should it get the green light for a second season.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It feels like this console generation is going on significantly longer than usual, though it’s not. If you look back at historical data for the major systems, we’re only about halfway through the lifespan of this current generation, give or take, which means there’s room for improvement and new versions to launch worldwide. First up is the PS5 Pro, right? When will the PS5 Pro be released to us eager fans?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-ps5-pro-release-date">When is the PS5 Pro Release Date?</h2>



<p>While we don’t yet have an official release date for the PS5 Pro, rumors indicate it will launch <strong>sometime in November</strong>. That’s perfect timing, of course. It’s right before the holiday season, before most people start buying all of their presents for friends and family, meaning Sony could snag a ton of holiday sales. Of course, that is dependent on the cost of the system. If it’s too expensive, many will wait.</p>



<p>Following the recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-pro-image-tease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30th-anniversary image leak</a>, which includes the PS5 Pro outline, Sony will either drip-feed us teasers until it’s time for an official reveal or showcase the whole system before any more leaks ruin the surprise. It’ll be interesting to see!</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-we-see-more-from-playstation">When Will We See More From PlayStation?</h2>



<p>Insider Gaming previously reported on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/september-2024-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation State of Play coming sometime in late September</a>. If that’s the case, the big console reveal will likely happen then and there. I can’t think of a better time for Sony to unveil such a massive bombshell like a brand-new system. If they reveal the system at the end of September, then a November launch certainly makes the most sense.</p>

Photo source: IGN Japan.</figcaption></figure></output><p><strong>How did the remaster of Shadows of the Damned come about?</strong></p><p><strong>Goichi Suda, Founder, Grasshopper Manufacture:</strong> We started receiving offers to port Shadows of the Damned about eight years ago. My studio Grasshopper Manufacture was keen to do it, but at the time, Shadows of the Damned was exclusive to Origin, the digital distribution platform operated by EA. As a result, the talks of a port fell through.</p><p>Since we couldn’t port the game, I gave up for a while. But I still had the desire to release some older Grasshopper Manufacture titles for modern consoles. I was able to make that happen with <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-silver-case">The Silver Case</a>, and I was also able to release <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/killer-7">Killer 7</a> on Steam, and then release No More Heroes 3 as a new title. I thought Shadows of the Damned would be next, and I was finally able to make it happen.”</p><p><strong>With Grasshopper Manufacture now under the umbrella of NetEase Games, did that help to make it possible?</strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> Yes. After I joined NetEase Games, I talked about wanting to release a remaster of Shadows of the Damned. That was about two years ago. At that time, it was no longer an Origin-exclusive title, so the situation had changed to the point where Shadows of the Damned could be released on other platforms. NetEase Games gave me the OK, so we started developing the remaster. NetEase Games gives me a great deal of freedom and creates an environment that makes it easy to work. I ended up telling Mikami after the fact that I was making a remaster of Shadows of the Damned [laughs]. I asked him for a comment as part of the promotion, and he came with me all the way to gamescom!”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I had thought [Tango Gameworks] would be safe as long as they continued to make Hi-Fi Rush games</p></div><p><strong>What are some of the differences in the remastered version? </strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> We added a New Game Plus mode, where players who have beaten the game can go back in and play again with all the upgrades they got the first time around. This game has an RPG element where you can upgrade your weapon, and by the end of the story you will be much stronger; so if you use that weapon from the beginning of your second playthrough, you can mow down weak enemies like an invincible force.</p><p>We had requests for a New Game Plus mode ever since the original game was released, so we definitely wanted to include it in the remastered version. We have also introduced new costumes, some of which you can unlock in the second playthrough, so keep an eye out for those as well. The remaster has allowed us to implement everything we had hoped to include in the original game.”</p><p><strong>How about the visual upgrades?</strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> The remastered version supports a maximum resolution of 4K. It also supports a smoother 60fps. The PS5/Xbox Series X/PC version supports 4K, and the Switch version is 30fps. In the original version, some cutscenes were pre-rendered, but in the remastered version, they have been changed to real-time cutscenes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Going back a little, why did you two first decide to work together on this game?</strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> I made a game with Mikami called Killer 7, which was released by Capcom in 2005. After Killer 7 was finished, I showed Mikami an idea for a game called Kurayami [Darkness].</p><p><strong>Shinji Mikami, Former Studio Head, Tango Gameworks:</strong> I really liked the outline for Kurayami, but there was no way the Capcom management would have approved it at the time. I had no choice but to give up, but we agreed to look out for other opportunities to work together.”</p><p><strong>Suda: </strong>A few years later, Grasshopper Manufacture started to think about expanding overseas. We decided to present several plans to publishers outside of Japan, including Kurayami, and Mikami accompanied us. About three companies were interested, but we ended up signing a contract with EA.</p><p><strong>Mr Mikami, what made you want to work with Mr Suda to develop a game?</strong></p><p><strong>Mikami:</strong> Because the idea for Kurayami was really good. The biggest reason was that I had been waiting for the day when I could make it a reality. Working with Suda is fun, so there’s no downside. When it was decided that we would work together on Shadows of the Damned, I was as excited as I could possibly be. Well, a lot happened after that.” [Laughs]</p><p><strong>Suda: </strong>[Laughs] I've always been indebted to Mikami.</p><p><strong>Mikami:</strong> When the development of Shadows of the Damned was reaching its climax, I was also working as the director of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/10/18/vanquish-review">Vanquish (2010) at PlatinumGames</a>, so it was really tough. In the middle of that busy time, I received an email from Suda. Apparently, he wanted to redesign the main character of Shadows of the Damned from scratch. I was surprised because the character design had already been finalized.</p><p><strong>Why did you suddenly decide to change the design of the main character?</strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> I got bored of it [laughs]. As I looked at the old design of the protagonist over and over, I started to feel like it didn’t quite fit. I thought that maybe players would feel the same, so I decided to change the character design. I think we changed him twice during development.”</p><p><strong>Mikami:</strong> That’s right, this was the second time – that’s when we landed on the final design of Garcia Hotspur. I was horrified at the time. I couldn’t believe we were changing the design of the protagonist at such a late stage!”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>And Mr. Suda, why did you want to develop a game with Mr Mikami?</strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> Mikami gives me a sense of security. Sometimes when a game director has been working on a game for a long time, they may become unsure of some of their ideas. You think something is interesting, but you don’t know if others will feel the same. In those situations, Mikami will always give accurate judgment calls. Sometimes he would guide me by saying, ‘It would be better if you did it this way.’</p><p>Without wanting to over-analyze his talents, Mikami’s experience as a director has enabled him to make accurate judgments. Even after working with him on Killer7, I wanted to work with him again on developing a game. As a producer, Mikami takes the stance of ‘protecting’ the project from external influence, so it’s very easy to work with him.”</p><p><strong>Mikami:</strong> I think we were able to fulfill most of Suda’s requests for Killer7. That said, we had wanted to rework the game’s cutscenes from scratch, but we weren’t able to.</p><p><strong>Mr. Mikami, last year you left Tango Gameworks, the studio you founded, and then the studio was closed down in June this year. Then in August it was announced that Krafton would buy the studio and continue the Hi-Fi Rush series. How did you feel about that news?</strong></p><p><strong>Mikami:</strong> I had thought the studio would be safe as long as they continued to make Hi-Fi Rush games. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shinji-mikami-wanted-to-leave-tango-gameworks-years-before-he-did">That’s one of the reasons I left Tango Gameworks</a>. So I was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tango-gameworks-founder-shinji-mikami-shares-brief-reaction-to-studio-closure">surprised</a> when the studio was closed down.</p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> It was a bolt from the blue, wasn’t it?” </p><p><strong>Mikami:</strong> Now <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-ip-and-tango-gameworks-acquired-by-krafton-from-xbox-studio-will-no-longer-be-shut-down">Krafton has taken over the business</a>, so I feel like it worked out well in the end. I was reminded that if you make a good game, someone will pick it up. The hard work of the Hi-Fi Rush development team led to a new chapter for the company. I think that for a development studio, making a good game is more directly related to survival than making a popular game.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><p><strong>Can either of you tell us anything about what games you’re making next?</strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> In addition to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hotel-barcelona-preview-a-game-by-2-japanese-legends-that-has-you-fight-alongside-yourself">Hotel Barcelona</a>, which Swery [Hidetaka Suehiro] is working on, we at Grasshopper are making a brand-new action game. It’s a completely new IP, so I can’t say much about it yet. But I'm glad that Hotel Barcelona was well received when it was shown recently at BitSummit.</p><p><strong>Mikami:</strong> As for me, I’m working directly on a game [at Kamuy], but I can’t tell you anything yet.”</p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> So you’re making something.”</p><p><strong>Mikami:</strong> Yes, I’m not just a producer – I’m directly involved in development.”</p><p><strong>If the two of you were to develop a new title together, what kind of thing would you like to make?</strong></p><p><strong>Mikami:</strong> I’d like to make a sequel to Killer 7. But it might be difficult, since Capcom owns the IP.</p><p><em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is due October 31, 2024, on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One and PC (Steam).</em></p><p><em></em><a href="https://x.com/NoMoreDaniels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>Daniel Robson</em></u></a><em> and </em><a href="https://x.com/RineD1987" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>Esra Krabbe</em></u></a><em> are editors for IGN Japan, and conducted the interview at gamescom. </em><a href="https://x.com/ryuichi_kataoka" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>Ryuichi Kataoka</em></u></a><em> is a freelance writer for IGN Japan.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>When I think of developer MachineGames, I think of dual-wielding shotguns in its Wolfenstein games, sprinting down tight corridors with guns blazing as the walls get a fresh coat of Nazi blood. After all, MachineGames' entire portfolio up to this point has been built on the brazen revival of Wolfenstein--a series of five no-holds-barred, blood-soaked action thrill-rides. And damn did it do it well. It's why I was caught by surprise when seeing its next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-platforms-release-date-and-everything-we-know/1100-6520456/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, is putting an emphasis on more methodical combat that will have you solving puzzles and using the environment as your weapon, rather than shooting your way out of every scenario and being covered in Nazi blood in the process ('tis a shame).</p><p dir="ltr">"It is always a big challenge to go from something known, into the unknown of what the Indiana Jones game was for us," Indiana Jones and the Great Circle's design director, Jens Andersson, told GameSpot at Gamescom 2024. "It's tough, because the way [MachineGames] is used to working--how we build levels, how we design enemies--everything is coming from this action [focus]. And now we're coming at it from a different side. So it took a long time. Like, honestly, a really long time for us at company meetings and stuff, talking about 'What is this game trying to do?'"</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qThZsYHca4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8qThZsYHca4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Don't worry, you'll still get to shoot your share of Nazis in the Great Circle, but as Indy, it's your wits, your mitts, your whip, and maybe the occasional rolling pin left on a kitchen table that will be your primary tools. In putting you in the shoes (and hat) of the globe-trotting Dr. Henry Walton "Indiana" Jones Jr., your agency as a player isn't <em>just action</em>, but exploration and investigation. It's a molding of genres and mechanics seldom seen all in one game, let alone a first-person one.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think even more for this particular game, there aren't too many references out there," Andersson said. "Like it's an adventure-first game. So what does a AAA adventure game look like today? We don't know. We had to figure it out."</p><p dir="ltr">The adventure-game genre is broad and rather hard to define. At one point in time, it was often linked to more traditional point-and-click games, like Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, for example. These games were heavily driven by narrative with puzzle-solving front-and-center of its design and very rarely, if at all, featured combat. Modern audiences, however, may point to the Uncharted series as a touching point for what a modern adventure game is--those are action-packed games that sees their Indiana Jones-inspired protagonist Nathan Drake mowing down hundreds of bad guys through blockbuster-sized set pieces. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle doesn't seem to fall in either category, and it even feels unfair to place it somewhere in the middle of that broad spectrum.</p><p dir="ltr">For game director Jerk Gustafasson, figuring out this game's identity started with a simple reminder to the team: This is a "MachineGames adventure."</p><p dir="ltr">"When that was mentioned in a meeting," said Andersson, "that's when a lot of the team began to say 'Oh, I see what you mean.' Like MachineGames means cinematic, immersive, action, first-person. So what's the adventure version of that?"</p><p dir="ltr">From there, creative director Axel Torvenius felt that meant doubling down on adventure and exploration rather than relying on the studio's tried-and-true action background. "There's a lot of slower moments. And because [they're] slower moments doesn't mean they're boring," said Torvenius. "Quite the opposite--it's very intense and exciting. It's slow-paced, but it's still high tension and filled with a sense of adventure, and that's what we've been trying to get. It's to get that balance right."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doFXwKJEHfA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/doFXwKJEHfA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Based on the hands-off gameplay I saw, those quieter moments that Torvenius referred to are spent using Indy's camera, taking pictures of artifacts that in turn fill your journal with information. This information is vital to informing the player on where to go next or answering questions within the game's mystery. That, of course, comes with its own challenge of pacing and assisting the player on what to do and where to go, without holding their hand too much.</p><p dir="ltr">"How do we push the player to do something, when before, everything we did were linear corridor shooters--which sometimes opened up a little bit, but never that much--to something in game style and game pace was vastly different," said Torvenius.</p><p dir="ltr">It couldn't be further from what I was used to seeing this team do with its games, and it's MachineGames' full embrace of something so different that began to get me most excited for what Indiana Jones and the Great Circle could be: something genuinely fresh to the first-person genre, regardless of the Indiana Jones IP.</p><blockquote><p>"The writing and the characters are front-and-center, rather than sidekicks to the action."</p><cite>Jens Andersson</cite></blockquote><p dir="ltr">This is a team, after all, that's had a long lineage in the first-person genre, long before MachineGames was formed. Many of the Great Circle's team had worked together at developer Starbreeze Entertainment on games like The Darkness, and before that, the slower-paced Chronicles of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay, which, like Indiana Jones, relied heavily on hand-to-hand combat and stealth. The two games, while both first-person, vary greatly in gameplay. But the team's approach to its design always starts with the story first. It's, as Andersson puts it, the MachineGames process.</p><p dir="ltr">"It starts with the story, as trivial as that sounds," Andersson said. "We adapt everything to sort of fit around that story rather than the other way around that I think a lot of other studios do. [...] The writing and the characters are front-and-center, rather than sidekicks to the action."</p><p dir="ltr">It's easy to be swept up in Wolfenstein's signature run-and-gun action, but it's MachineGames' approach to storytelling and character development which made Wolfenstein's The New Order and The New Colossus so memorable for me. When I think of Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus in particular, I instantly think of its softer moments: the surprise birthday party for B.J. Blazkowicz; the memories of his childhood sweetheart; or the relationship he had with his mother. These scenes gave its characters time to breathe between the fumes of gunsmoke and made it all the more memorable for doing so.</p><p dir="ltr">While it's too soon to say whether MachineGames can land the same writing heights in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, it is clear at the moment that it's translating the titular character's identity exceptionally well, especially in the game's combat.</p><p dir="ltr">During gameplay, the player used Indy's whip to disarm an enemy, causing them to lose their balance and fall face-first into a steel barrel, knocking them out cold. It was a small and brief moment, but one that rang of slapstick comedy and gave combat its own brand of charisma. For as quick as that encounter was, achieving that goal was by no means easy for the team.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4362874-indy_whip.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362874" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4362874-indy_whip.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362874"></a><figcaption>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4362874-indy_whip.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We have this very complicated system of people being pushed into the environment. So you can use the whip to get people around," Andersson explained. "A lot of work was involved in having enemies react and catch their balance. It was a scary proposition when we started pushing for it. Everyone was not happy with us. But like this combination of simulation and animation and being able to interact with the environment and being able to pick up stuff, like it's so Indy, right?"</p><p dir="ltr">There's a comical pacing in its combat that feels improvisational opposed to scripted, much like some of the film franchise's most-iconic scenes, whether it's pulling a gun out to shoot the flailing swordsman in Raiders of the Lost Ark, or Indy patiently waiting for the propellers of a plane to chop a Nazi to bits. It's these moments that reflect Indy as a character, and translating that organically through combat is very exciting.</p><p dir="ltr">Admittedly, as a hardcore Wolfenstein fan, I'm still pining for the next entry in the Blazkowicz family saga. However, I've become equally as excited to see how MachineGames expands its writing and design philosophies to story altogether, regardless of whether or not I'm an Indiana Jones fan.</p><p dir="ltr">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is expected to release December 9 for Xbox Series X|S and PC, and it will be a day-one Game Pass release.</p>

                <p>On December 3, 1994, Sony launched the original PlayStation in Japan and changed the video game industry forever. American gamers didn't get their hands on the PS until September 9, 1995, but Sony's not going to make us wait another year to start the celebration of PlayStation's 30th anniversary. And the first plans for that year-long party have been revealed.</p><p>From October to the end of January, Sony Music will release classic PlayStation game scores on Spotify and digital music storefronts. The confirmed titles include God of War, God of War II, God of War: Chains of Sparta, Twisted Metal, Starhawk, and Unit 13. ​</p><p>A free trial version of Gran Turismo 7 called My First GT will also be released. Sony hasn't set a date for the trial yet, but it will be released this holiday season for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 users with some of the fan-favorite cars, tracks, and more from Gran Turismo 7.</p><p>Sports gaming enthusiasts should take note that September 21 and 22 will be a free online multiplayer weekend with multiple esports tournaments for games like Madden NFL 24, MLB The Show 24, NBA 2K25, NBA 2K24, and even fighting games like Tekken 8, Guilty Gear Strive, and EA UFC 5. You won't need a paid PlayStation Plus membership to compete a PS 30th anniversary-themed avatar and other prizes, but you will need a copy of the previously mentioned titles.</p><p>This is just the beginning, as additional plans for PlayStation's 30th anniversary will be announced at a later time. Some fans believe that Sony used the initial announcement to reveal <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fans-think-sony-just-revealed-the-ps5-pro-design/1100-6526310/" data-ref-id="1100-6526310">the design of the PlayStation 5 Pro</a>, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-release-date-specs-price/1100-6523695/" data-ref-id="1100-6523695">rumored to be officially unveiled soon</a>.</p><p>This week also marks the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/astro-bot-review-fly-me-to-the-moon/1900-6418277/" data-ref-id="1900-6418277">Astro Bot</a>, which is receiving rave reviews and features numerous references to games from PlayStation's history.</p>

			<p>At Gamescom 2024, I caught up with Rich Lambert, Game Director for Elder Scrolls Online at ZeniMax. This wasn't the first time I interviewed Rich - I met him in person <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-e3-2019-interview-focusing-on-performance-improvements-team-is-aware-crossplay-is-what-players-want/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at E3 2019</a>, and then we had a number of remote interviews over the past five years or so. This year, though, is special for the MMORPG, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-10th-anniversary-qa-with-rich-lambert-looking-back-and-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has turned 10</a>. ZeniMax is doing several celebrations with the community throughout the whole year, with the excuse that the console version launched around a year after the PC version.</p>
<p>With the release of Gold Road, the yearly expansion (or Chapter, as they like to call them) firmly behind us, we looked to its making and then moved to the future, answering quite a few long-standing community questions on highly requested features.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Elder Scrolls Online - Welcome to Home Tours" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7i8xMctv4ss?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>You announced some new events as part of the 10-year celebration, right? In Milan and elsewhere.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, Milan, San Diego, and then I don't know if it's 100% announced yet, but we'll go to PAX Australia as well.</p>
<p><strong>Cool. Overall, how is the ten-year anniversary of Elder Scrolls Online going for you so far?</strong></p>
<p>It's been amazing. The players and the community that has gone to these events are just really enjoying themselves. They get to see us, but they go to see their friends. In Amsterdam, we had a group that has been doing podcasts together for almost 10 years, and they've never actually met in person. One lives in Turkey, the other guy lives in the United States, and the first time they met each other face-to-face was at our Amsterdam event, which is cool. That just kind of echoes all the way across things. Also, putting the event together was really cool because we had to look at stuff we hadn't looked at in years—literally years—and so it's just been really cool.</p>
<p><strong>I imagine this is also kind of a unique opportunity to get more feedback on the game live from the fans.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, one hundred percent. We sit down; we talk with them. Actually, at the tavern, which was in July earlier this year, I had a number of people come up to me with thick books with just notes of things. Some of them were poems and pictures and stuff like that, but others were like, hey, we polled our Guild, and these are the things that we would love to see added or changed or updated in Elder Scrolls Online, so it was really cool.</p>
<p><strong>You <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-gold-road-hands-on-with-scribing-plus-qa-with-rich-lambert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the Gold Road Chapter. What was the reception like compared to last year's Chapter, for instance?</strong></p>
<p>It's been really positive. Players have really reacted well to the zone. It's a forested type of area, but it's not greens and browns, right? It has bright colors and interesting environments. Then they love Ithelia, the new Daedric Prince we created. They absolutely love her.</p>
<p><strong>Since it was a different type of story from the ones you've done before in the game, what did you do differently? What were some of the challenges?</strong></p>
<p>I think the biggest challenge was that we were writing a brand new Daedric Prince, and that's never been done before. Figuring out how to make her stand on her own and not feel the same as all the others was a big challenge for us. And then like, what are her traits? Because a lot of the Daedric princes cover a lot of the different traits.</p>
<p>When we started going in and thinking about well, Hermaeus Mora is all about order and keeping everything in line and knowing everything. We started bouncing in on what's the antithesis of that? That's where we got into this chaos, the threads of fate and bouncing around, and so that was a really fun project to figure out. Once we got that, it helped inform some of the stories that are going on in this one.</p>
<p><strong>When you came up with the idea of Ithelia, was Bethesda Game Studios already on board with that, or did it take some convincing?</strong></p>
<p>It took a little negotiating. It's something new, right? And it's never been done before, but that's kind of how we work, frankly. We pitch ideas, we talk, we work things out. Dragons was a really good example of that as well. They didn't want us to do dragons initially at launch because they weren't in our timeline, or at least there was no recorded history in our timeline of dragons, and then we worked through 'What if we did it like this?'&nbsp;The players were the source of this. So, in the end, they were like, 'That's cool, it can work.'</p>
<p><strong>You've just released a new Elder Scrolls Online update dedicated to housing, right?</strong></p>
<p>On Monday, yeah, travel day to Gamescom. The team back home was hard at work launching Update 43. The big system that we added was Home Tours, which allows players to easily share their homes with other players so they can see what they've created with the housing system. Our housing system, as you know, is really unique in that you can build anything. You can put chairs and ceilings, you can put tables and chairs and sofas together to make some other objects, and so that creativity is something that was really hard to show off because you have to know somebody in order to go to their home. Now, they can just share it, and you can go there right away.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'With the crafting bag, it is a small number of items that stack nearly infinitely, but with a furnishing bag, it is a large number of items that don't stack. We're working through how to do that without destroying the Elder Scrolls Online servers and the database.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>On that note, here's a question from the community: they'd like to get a furnishing bag.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we've heard that a lot. It is something that we've been looking into for a while. It's not as easy to do as the crafting bag because with the crafting bag and how databases are set up, it is very cheap; I guess it is the easiest way to say, or less intensive, to just implement a number in a row in a database than it is to add more rows.</p>
<p>With the crafting bag, it is a small number of items that stack nearly infinitely, but with a furnishing bag, it is a large number of items that don't stack. We're working through how to do that without destroying the Elder Scrolls Online servers and the database, because it's really expensive. We have millions of players all having thousands of objects, so it adds up very quickly.</p>
<p><strong>What about an Armory bag?</strong></p>
<p>An armory bag. We've talked a lot about that when we did the Armory system, and we went back and forth on whether we can just pull stuff out of your bank or not. And there were actually a lot of scenarios where players could break the game. For instance, what if your inventory's full and you're pulling stuff out or into the bank? Or your bank is full. What if there's lag? What happens if two items get duplicated, right? There's lots and lots of issues with doing that.</p>
<p>What we decided was we were just gonna not give the player more inventory before their item sets, and instead go the route of what we did with the stable, where you could still collect them all and get them out of your inventory, but not easily be able to swap back-and-forth.</p>
<p><strong>With Gold Road, you added Scribing, a precursor to Spellcrafting, to Elder Scrolls Online. How are you planning to build upon this new system in the future?</strong></p>
<p>Actually, in Update 43, we did add some more scripts, which allow players to do more things with them. We added some Frost-based scripts, so now you can have Frosty magic if that's what you're into. I believe the updated number of unique combinations is 5500 or just over 5500, so there's lots of opportunities to mix and match stuff. But if players continue to play the system and really enjoy the system, we are going to continue to support it.</p>
<p><strong>Does that include styling as well?</strong></p>
<p>Styling actually had a bunch of new additions in Update 43 as well.</p>
<p><strong>What about new Sorcerer pet models or skins?</strong></p>
<p>We have had a lot of feedback on this well, ever since we did the Warden and the Bear skin with that. For the Sorcerer pets, it is not a 'we don't want to do it', it is more a 'how do we not blow the game up doing it'? Because there are a lot of performance issues with that. But we have absolutely been looking at that.</p>
<p><strong>Will companions be able to wear helmets in the future?</strong></p>
<p>We made the design decision really early on that we wanted the characters to always be visible because that is their one personality trait, the unique face. We kind of go back and forth on that, but that was the original intent. Players can customize their abilities and all that other stuff, but we still wanted their personality to show.</p>
<p><strong>What about them using player gear?</strong></p>
<p>I don't know. That's a good question. I'd have to dig into that war. Companion gear is different from player gear. We did that again for performance reasons. The player items are very, very expensive on the database, and all the companion items are not, so whether or not they could actually wear player gear in the future is something we have to talk about.</p>
<p><strong>Recently, you introduced curation for the Undaunted. What about curating other stuff like motif pages that can drop from city daily quests?</strong></p>
<p>We're slowly going through and looking at those pain points. We did the Undaunted this past update. I don't think I'm speaking out of turn, but we also did some Imperial City curation. We curated the weekly Trial rewards as well, so we're going through that and looking at what makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>Can you make mount upgrades work for all characters?</strong></p>
<p>We get that feedback a lot, too. Not easily.</p>
<p><strong>Could you ramp up the speed with which old styles are made available again?</strong></p>
<p>I can talk to the group that manages all that. There's a kind of a balance in that if you do it too much and too often, then players get overwhelmed, so we have to be careful.</p>
<p><strong>Can you increase the total furnishings in the house?</strong></p>
<p>We've got that one a lot, too, and those limits are there for performance. What we don't want to ever happen is a player puts something in their home and then they crash and can never get back in there. That's why the limits exist, but we are looking at ways to improve and increase that. But they're there for that reason. We don't ever want players to be in a situation where they can't access the house.</p>

<p><strong>Speaking of performance, you still support PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, but there are already whispers of the console generation that will follow PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X. The question is, how long do you plan to support them for Elder Scrolls Online? Will you maybe drop them at some point?</strong></p>
<p>As long as players are on them and playing, it doesn't make sense to remove them. We have shown in the past that we will do it when it makes sense. With Windows 7, we supported it for a very, very long time. When it became end-of-life and Microsoft stopped supporting it, and there were fewer and fewer players actually on it, we dropped support.</p>
<p><strong>So you still see a lot of players on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One?</strong></p>
<p>There's tons of players. And on Mac as well, that's another one we get questions about why we support Mac. Because there's players there to play. We don't ever want to take it away if we can.</p>
<p><strong>Elder Scrolls Online recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-adds-elder-scrolls-online-street-fighter-6-resident-evil-village-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> on GeForce NOW. Did you see an influx of new players from the cloud?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>I asked you before in a previous interview, but are there any talks with Microsoft about adding the game on Game Pass?</strong></p>
<p>It's on Game Pass for consoles but not on Game Pass PC. There are various technical reasons why it's not there, but we are looking at it because we get a lot of game continues, and it makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>I know you completed the server hardware upgrade a while ago. Are you still looking at ways to improve server performance beyond that?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, the new hardware helped, and for the most part, things are pretty stable and solid. However, there are absolutely still periods during peak hours when it's not as good as we want, so we're definitely looking into further improvement.</p>
<p><strong>The next update will focus primarily on PvP. Are there any tidbits that you can share? Anything at all?</strong></p>
<p>I believe Gina Bruno (<em>the Elder Scrolls Online Community Manager</em>) let slip that it might be Battleground-related.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'The new server hardware helped, and for the most part, things are pretty stable and solid. However, there are absolutely still periods during peak hours when it's not as good as we want, so we're definitely looking into further improvement.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What about the Alliance War? Are you doing anything about that?</strong></p>
<p>That's where we start to look at performance, and then also at some quality life, such as item curation. Then we're constantly adding new cosmetics that you can earn through PvP, adding new item sets and Rewards for the Worthy.</p>
<p><strong>I know this is a question you get asked repeatedly, but do you have any thoughts about crossplay? Is it even doable?</strong></p>
<p>It's never been a no; it's always been a holy hell. We made many decisions in 2007 that are very difficult to change, and then we'd have to get all of the first parties together to make sure that they're good with how we would go about implementing. It's a huge technical challenge to solve. Do I think we will get there in the future? Maybe. I think that's where technology is just going in general. People just want to be together and make it easy and remove all the friction to play with each other. But like I said, we started building this game in 2007, when that wasn't even remotely a thought in anybody's head back then.</p>
<p><strong>On that note. Elder Scrolls Online has turned 10. How long do you have a roadmap for internally?</strong></p>
<p>Game development, there's a fuzziness to that, right? We have a 5-year plan of where we want to go, then we have like a 3-year, more solidified plan of the things that we want to focus on, and then we have an 18-month locked-in roadmap. We're constantly iterating and updating that. Just because we have a 5-year plan doesn't mean we will stop after 5 years; it's just that's as far ahead as we have the brain power to think, at least right now, but as long as players want to continue playing the game, we're going to continue to support and update Elder Scrolls Online.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24236967/sony-ps5-pro-design-leak-image<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has started celebrating 30 years of PlayStation and seems to have confirmed a PS5 Pro design leak in the process. A <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/05/celebrating-30-years-of-playstation-my-first-gt-digital-soundtracks-shapes-of-play-collection-and-theres-more-to-come/">blog post</a> earlier today included a 30th anniversary image (above), and eagle-eyed observers <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1831772340218425426?t=K1MbVYnbDeXJP8fX75S4kg&amp;s=19">have spotted</a> a suspicious-looking PS5 design in the montage that looks identical to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/29/24231231/is-this-the-ps5-pro">PS5 Pro leak</a> from a week ago.</p><p><a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-nom-le-design-de-la-nouvelle-console-de-playstation-avec-plein-dautres-details-inedits-59094">Dealabs reported last week</a> that it had seen retail packaging for the PS5 Pro and created a sketch that showed three black stripes in the middle of the outer facades of the console. Those three black strips can be clearly seen in Sony’s montage image, looking rather Adidas-like and unlike the stripe you can find on the PS5. In fact, the existing PS5 model is also in the montage, with a single stripe through the middle.</p><div><figcaption><em>Sony’s image vs. the leaked PS5 Pro sketch.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Sony / <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-nom-le-design-de-la-nouvelle-console-de-playstation-avec-plein-dautres-details-inedits-59094">Dealabs</a></cite></p></div><div><figcaption><em>Sony’s Instagram story.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Sony</cite></p></div><p>Dealabs said it was expecting an announcement during the first half of September, but I don’t think anyone expected it would come in the form of a teaser image from Sony. The official PlayStation account on Instagram even <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/playstation/">posted the image</a> with a “Your first look 👀” link.</p><p>We’ve known for months the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/15/24130716/sony-ps5-pro-specs-release-date-rumors">PS5 Pro is real</a> and that developers have been getting their games ready for this new console. A source familiar with Sony’s PS5 Pro plans tells me that all games released on or after September 16th need to support the PS5 Pro, so that suggests that Sony’s official announcement of this console is coming real soon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>You'll need the original game to try it</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-white">Black &amp; White</a> was a god game that frustrated more often than it delighted, but which was nevertheless delivered with enough verve and ambition to be worth playing. It's a crying shame that it's not currently available to buy anywhere digitally, presumably because the rights are soaked in a gutter between EA (the original publisher) and Microsoft (who bought and closed developers Lionhead).
</p>
<p>If you do still own a physical copy of Black &amp; White however, you might be interested in Openblack. It's a fan-led project to create a modern, open source engine for running Black &amp; White, and its first build was just released yesterday.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Openblack has been in development for several years - since at least 2018 - with people contributing to the project over on Github. You can now <a href="https://github.com/openblack/openblack?tab=readme-ov-file">download it as a pre-built binary</a>, although there's still some command line fiddling necessary to actually get it to run.
</p>
<p>That command line requirement is a signal that it's still in many ways early days for the project. Its developers consider it v0.10, so I wouldn't necessarily rush to dig out your old discs yet. Still, there's a lot of potential here for those seeking a version of Black &amp; White that runs better on modern machines and which has support for more operating systems. There's already a Linux build available, for example.
</p>
<p>In short, I'd like to be able to play Black &amp; White on Steam Deck one day, and this is likely the only avenue by which that's ever going to happen.
</p>
<p>Even if it's impossible to buy digitally, it's not impossible to play Black &amp; White on modern computers if you do own a copy, merely less than ideal. For those willing to try, I think <a href="https://www.bwgame.net/threads/running-black-white-on-windows-10.7916/">these old instructions</a>, which includes installing a slightly-modernising fan patch, should still work.
</p>
<p>And of course, if it's a choice between following a fan-led open source project to modernise Black &amp; White, or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peter-molyneux-is-back-with-new-god-sim-masters-of-albion-which-looks-like-a-stripped-down-black-white">following Masters Of Albion</a>, I'd wager the former is more worth my time.</p>
<p><em>Thanks, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/black-white-2001-open-source-game-engine-sees-a-first-release/">GamingOnLinux</a>.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
