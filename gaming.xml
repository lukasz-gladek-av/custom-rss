			<p>Standing desks have become increasingly commonplace in not just offices, but also households as the number of people working from home becomes more widely accepted. Helping this along over the past few years, standing desks have become more robust, easier to set up, and thankfully, more affordable, with the FlexiSpot E7 range being an ideal choice for those wanting a more dynamic, adaptable home workspace.</p>
<p><iframe title="Next-Generation Height Adjustable Desk E7 PRO" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/30fykTUEPmo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The reasons for upgrading to a standing desk are pretty apparent. Spending the majority of your nine to five grind ensconced in even the fanciest of office chairs can begin to feel uncomfortable, especially if you’re prone to worrying about bad posture and the general unhealthiness of being sat in the same spot for hours on end. Using a standing desk like the FlexiSpot E7 Pro won’t immediately help you get in better shape, though I found that having the option to alternate between sitting and standing helps to boost productivity while also encouraging healthier habits like regular stretching and being more active during screen breaks.</p>


<p>Working in this way can definitely take some getting used to, and there will be those of you who simply can’t put a finger to keyboard without having your bottom firmly planted on a chair. While primarily marketed as a standing desk, the adjustable height of the FlexiSpot E7 alone makes it a tempting upgrade for those wanting to better utilise their home office space, especially if they share a desk with someone who prefers a higher or lower work surface. As someone who is 6’4” (we’re all relatively massive here at TSA) one of my biggest frustrations when buying desks in the past is making sure my legs can tuck comfortably underneath, which has often resulted in the need to buy various furniture pads and risers. The FlexiSpot E7 Pro has been a silver bullet in this respect, allowing me to adjust its height to the exact centimetre required, also meaning I no longer have to worry about dimensions when shopping for desk chairs.</p>


<p>The desk arrives well packaged – every component was neatly nested in quality foam inserts, protected by layers of reinforced cardboard, the desktop and frame supplied into two separate boxes. The assembly instructions were far from exhaustive with 12 steps to follow and, all in all, it took just over an hour to go from cutting into the first box to having a state-of-the-art standing desk ready to go.</p>
<p>That’s not to say the building process was seamless. Although the components were clearly marked (it’s always nice to have screws and bolts in individually lettered bags) the assembly required a drill and some handy guesswork. For instance, the underside of the desktop was covered in small holes that would typically, when assembling furniture, denote where to place screws. Most of these aren’t used at all during the assembly, and are presumably meant for upgrades such as drawers or different sets of legs. There were also some holes that didn’t quite line up with the metal frame and others that needed drilling, which kind of goes against the whole flatpack/quick assembly ethos even if it wasn’t too technical a hurdle to overcome. With some tight fastening, the finished desk is incredibly sturdy with no wiggle room and a hefty weight that will require two people to flip once fully assembled. Or one very impatient person wanting a quick dose of searing back pain.</p>

<p>For those who may have slightly uneven surfaces in their home, the four attachable feet can help mitigate any potential lean or wobble. However, for a newly carpeted floor, I chose to skip this step and found the desk surprisingly easy to move and reposition despite its weight.</p>
<p>With three frame colours (white, black, and grey) and a diverse selection of desktop finishes and sizes to choose from (the largest being 2000mm by 800mm), the FlexiSpot E7 can be customised to fit any setting. Supported by super stable, 3-stage adjustable legs, it has an impressive weight capacity of 160 kilos which is more than enough to handle any work or gaming setup, while the concealed cable tray allowing you to efficiently tidy the accompanying jungle of wires and adapters.</p>
<p>In terms of height range, the E7 Pro can more than double in size from 635mm to a max of 1285mm. You can adjust the height seamlessly by using the keypad included, attached to the underside of the desktop, which also has a USB power slot ideal for charging your phone or other devices. When in motion, the desk glides quietly up and down with a satisfying smoothness that will have you regularly playing around with the keypad upon first use. What’s particularly good it that there are four programmable buttons to save preferred height settings, making it easy to switch between the ideal standing and seated heights for two people, as well as a handy child lock toggle.</p>

<p>The FlexiSpot E7 Pro isn’t inherently designed for gaming, though the same can be said of the office desk or television cabinet that you’re using to play PC and console games. The colour options available (particularly black on black) slot into the “gamer” aesthetic touted by other desk ranges targeting this demographic, and the adjustable height means that the E7 can be used in combination with any gaming chair without worrying about your legs getting pinned beneath the desktop or having your arms reaching for the keyboard and mouse at an uncomfortable angle.</p>
<p>As someone whose work day demands long stints of being handcuffed to a computer, the degree of adjustability is a godsend and, as previously mentioned, being able to shift between standing has led to untapped bursts of productivity. The desk won’t turn you into Joe Wicks overnight, though it definitely helps encourage healthier habits while working and gaming that are bound to have an ongoing impact on posture – FlexiSpot even sells a treadmill upgrade for those serious about burning a few calories.</p>

			<p>Valve's Half-Life 2 has just reached its 20th anniversary (we muse on its significance and that of other games released in that incredible month <a href="https://wccftech.com/gaming-greatest-month-20-year-later-remembering-november-2004/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>). To celebrate the achievement, the developer is giving away free copies of the title (along with Episodes One and Two) until later today. You can get the game and its expansions by visiting the respective page on Steam, which can be done via the link <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220/HalfLife_2/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Valve has also uploaded a 20th anniversary documentary, which reveals many interesting tidbits about the game's making. Perhaps even more interesting, though, is Gabe Newell's explanation of why Half-Life 2 Episode Three was never released.</p>
<p><em>You can't get lazy and say, oh, we're moving the story forward. That's copping out of your obligation to gamers. Of course they love the story. They love many aspects of it, but saying that your reason to do it is because people want to know what happens next... You know, we could have shipped it. It wouldn't have been that hard. My personal failure was being stumped. I couldn't figure out why doing Half-Life 2 Episode Three was pushing anything forward.</em></p>
<p><em>I think that Half-Life represents a tool we have and promises made to customers to capitalize on innovation and opportunities to build game experiences that haven't been involved previously, and I think that there are no shortages of those opportunities facing us as an industry.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Half-Life 2: 20th Anniversary Documentary" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YCjNT9qGjh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Moreover, Valve pushed out a minor title update for Half-Life 2. The patch mainly focuses on quality improvements, along with subtle graphical changes. Here's the complete changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed pops, holes in the world, fading-out and disappearing objects across the game.</em></li>
<li><em>Rebalanced the lighting across Half-Life 2 to account for playing with HDR on or off, using the original release as reference.</em></li>
<li><em>Cleaner, smoother horizon lines thanks to new radial fog!</em></li>
<li><em>Added higher-resolution lightmaps across the game!</em></li>
<li><em>Removed green glow from the G-Man model’s eyes in the opening of the game, and restored the reflective glint as seen in the original release.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed missing grass sprites and blacked-out models throughout the game!</em></li>
</ul>
<h3><em>Updated Graphics Settings</em></h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Choose either the original launch day blood and fire effects, or those created for the episodes, when playing the Half-Life 2 base game!</em></li>
<li><em>Play with only the highest detail models in High Quality mode!</em></li>
<li><em>Get smoother lightmap shadows at Very High shader detail, thanks to new bicubic lightmap filtering!</em></li>
</ul>
<section id="deck">
<h3><em>Gamepad, Input, and Steam Deck Updates</em></h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Gamepad controls have been updated to match the Half-Life 1 anniversary update.</em></li>
<li><em>Aim Assistance has gotten an overhaul making it feel better to use, and there are more configuration options available. Aim Assistance can be enabled separately for gamepad or mouse/keyboard input. The amount of assistance can be tuned up and down, and it’s no longer tied to a skill setting. Want to play on Hard with high aim assist, or Easy with it off? Knock yourself out.</em></li>
<li><em>The Steam Deck main menu has been updated with all of today’s additions including the Episodes, Workshop, and new input configuration. The Steam Deck version of the main menu will also appear when you play Half-Life 2 on a PC running Big Picture Mode.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>NVIDIA is also celebrating the Half-Life 2 20th anniversary" by <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-half-life-2-themed-rtx-4080-super-giveaway-celebrate-20th-game-anniversary/">announcing a "Half-Life 2-themed" GPU giveaway</a> for the GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER. As a reminder, Orbifold Studios is currently making an RTX Remix <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-2-rtx-gets-stunning-new-video-to-celebrate-the-games-20th-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remaster</a>.</p>

The first episode, aptly titled “Hidden Hand,” shows the murderous origins of the Bene Gesserit, and their plans to arrange the right unions of families to keep the sisterhood in power. At the time, House Corrino are the ruling family of the Imperium after defeating the thinking machines feared to one day enslave mankind. Through silent communications and duplicitous advisory to  Emperor Javicco Corrino (played with an unflappable stoicism by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-penguin-the-batman-part-ii-questions-connections-1851693100&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-penguin-the-batman-part-ii-questions-connections-1851693100"><em>The Penguin</em></a></span>’s Mark Strong) from his Truthsayer and confidant Kasha (Jihae), we see how the hidden hand of the Bene Gesserit moves the pieces on the chess board how it wishes, to deadly results.</p><p>Every event in the <em>Dune </em>films takes place during wartime. Walking like a regular person on Arrakis dunes can get you devoured by a sandworm in moments, and a simple counter-suggestion to the terrifyingly hairless Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler) can get your throat slit quicker than you can finish their sentence. Brutality has always been used in the films as a way to never let the audience forget the life-or-death stakes at play. <em>Dune: Prophecy </em>takes that to a level we’ve never seen in the films.</p><h2 id="h295693"><a id=""></a>Desmond Hart and Pruwet Richese establish the stakes in <em>Dune: Prophecy</em></h2><figure id="" data-id="ac9ae3fa98d0894ece07bda064ee8840" data-recommend-id="image://ac9ae3fa98d0894ece07bda064ee8840" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Travis Fimmel staring menacingly " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Travis Fimmel staring menacingly " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Attila Szvacsek/HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ac9ae3fa98d0894ece07bda064ee8840" data-recommend-id="image://ac9ae3fa98d0894ece07bda064ee8840" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Travis Fimmel staring menacingly " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Poor little Pruwet. All he wanted to do was play with his absolutely adorable, potentially homicidal  AI-controlled lizard. As the nine-year-old Richese heir, he’s used as a pawn in the strategic union between his family and the imperial House Corrino. Emperor Corrino needs the Richese’s fleet of ships to protect his spice operation on Arrakis from the Fremen, and the duplicitous Duke Ferdinand Richese (Brendan Cowell) wants influential proximity to the Great Houses, so a marriage is arranged between pre-teen Pruwet and fully grown Princess Ynez (Sarah-Sofie Boussnina) to unite the families, with the surreptitious help of the Bene Gesserit.</p><p>Unfortunately for Pruwet, he becomes a sacrifice in an invisible war that soldier Desmond Hart implies is being waged against the Bene Gesserit’s manipulative influence over everyone’s actions. Just as death can come quick and sudden in the films, Pruwet goes from hanging on every word of Hart’s tales of war to writhing in pain as we see his skin begin to burn. Yes, for what seems to be the first time onscreen in Villeneuve’s <em>Dune</em> universe, a child is murdered...and we see it happen.</p><p>This isn’t, strictly speaking, the first time children have been killed in this series, as it’s safe to assume a number of them died when Feyd-Rautha bombed Sietch Tabr, which was inhabited by hundreds of Fremen. However, we never see any of the children’s deaths, nor has any one child been the focus of a killing on screen. In the films, children were seen but rarely ever heard. In <em>Dune: Prophecy</em>, even children can be taken out if it means winning the war. </p><h2 id="h295694"><a id=""></a>Why did Desmond Hart kill Pruwet Richese?</h2><figure id="" data-id="9c7884db1a9a19c9e5278df69e3ae6fc" data-recommend-id="image://9c7884db1a9a19c9e5278df69e3ae6fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Attila Szvacsek/HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9c7884db1a9a19c9e5278df69e3ae6fc" data-recommend-id="image://9c7884db1a9a19c9e5278df69e3ae6fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To oversimplify the reasoning for this shocking killing, Pruwet was killed by Hart because of his AI-controlled lizard toy. Expanding beyond that isolated incident, Pruwet was murdered because Hart had suspicions that an attack on his regimen and the theft of the Corrino family’s spice shipment were carried out in order to inspire their emperor to bring in the Richese’s fleet for protection, thusly bringing the family closer to the Great Houses through marriage. When Hart shared his report of the attack on the spice operation, which he suspiciously was not made aware of by Kasha, he remarked that equipment used in the attack was from the outside world. That toy, and the convenient marriage proposal from the Richese, was enough for Hart to believe they were behind the attack. </p><p>This is also why we see Kasha suffer the same burning fate as Pruwet. Hart has a feeling that the Bene Gesserit are manipulating powerful people like the Corrino emperor for their own ulterior motives. Pruwet’s death effectively dissolves the partnership between the families, removing them from inside of the Corrino family where they can do untold harm. </p><p>We still don’t know the true ramifications of Hart’s actions, or how he was able to kill both of these people in the same manner while only being next to one of them. But, if the series premiere is willing to cross a moral line the movies never explicitly touched, we can expect to find out, in graphic detail, just how violent this war can get. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Gaming has had many great periods over its fifty-four years of history (Computer Space, the first commercial game, was developed in 1970 and released the following year), and fans often have hot debates about the best year for new game releases. Today, however, I wanted to place the spotlight on what I consider to be, without a shred of doubt, the best month ever for gaming: November 2004.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, eight seminal games were released in twenty-eight days, breaking people's wallets but also forever marking the spot (and, in some cases, outright changing it) in the history of this entertainment medium. In this article, I'll explain why they were (and in many ways still are) so important while also remembering my feelings about them at the time. The list is strictly ordered based on their respective release dates.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/gta-sa-logo-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - October 26, 2004</h2>
<p>Rockstar's fifth main entry in the GTA series technically launched a few days before November, but it still fits the twenty-eight-day timeframe between it and the final game on this list. Moreover, I could never leave it out over something so trivial. While the previous installments in the franchise were already highly popular, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas reached an entirely new dimension when it dropped into the gaming market. The game outsold Vice City by 45% in its first week, selling 4.5 million units.</p>
<p>It would become the best-selling game in a crowded year, thanks to universal critical acclaim (95/100 on Metacritic) and some good old-fashioned mainstream controversy due to the infamous Hot Coffee minigame. The acclaim and sales were well-earned, as San Andreas improved over Vice City in every area: gameplay, visuals, world size, features, etc., setting a new standard for open-world titles.</p>
<p>As for my take at the time, I wasn't the biggest GTA fan back then, so it wasn't my most anticipated title. Perhaps it's because the previous title featured highly repetitive missions and merely passable plots, but San Andreas was the game that leveled up both areas, allowing Rockstar to sit on the open world games throne for a long time.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1494924-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Counter-Strike: Source - November 1, 2004</h2>
<p>The only remake on this list, Counter-Strike: Source brought the popular competitive first-person shooter game to modern technology. It was the first game to launch on the market with Valve's new Source engine, and the studio (which was helped by Turtle Rock Studios on this project) used it as a sort of Trojan horse for Half-Life 2, bundling it with all copies of that game before it was eventually released as a standalone product.</p>
<p>The visual upgrade was massive and certainly enticed many new users to check out the series, not to mention the praise from reviewers, who awarded the game an 88/100 score on average. While some hardcore players maintained that the original Counter-Strike had deeper gameplay, CS:S eventually won over the wider community, as evidenced by the 96% positive user reviews on Steam. It helped Counter-Strike stay relevant for another eight years before the launch of Global Offensive in 2012.</p>
<p>Personally, I was always way more of a fan of Rainbow Six, but Counter-Strike's tight-knit community impressed me even then. That they managed to not only maintain but even expand such a high level of commitment from fans after all these years is commendable.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/halo-2-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Halo 2 - November 15, 2004</h2>
<p>With Halo: Combat Evolved, Bungie forever changed the landscape for first-person shooters in console gaming. At that time, the consensus was that PC was the platform to go to when it came to FPS titles. Halo erased that stereotype and became the biggest Xbox exclusive, creating an enormous amount of hype for its sequel. Microsoft pushed for this to be more than just another game launch, treating it like the biggest blockbuster movies. Its trailer aired in theaters, and there was even an alternative reality game called I Love Bees that attracted a lot of attention to the release.</p>
<p>The goal was largely achieved, as the game grossed $125 million on its opening day, more than Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, cementing gaming's new status as the biggest entertainment medium in the world. Overall, Halo 2 was tied with GTA: San Andreas regarding the 95/100 review score, while GTA ultimately outsold it thanks to its availability on PlayStation 2.</p>
<p>In this case, I was absolutely part of the large user base that followed this launch very closely. I loved the predecessor and thoroughly enjoyed the sequel despite the controversial campaign choices. When it comes to gameplay and multiplayer features, Halo 2 might just be the best the series has ever been to this day.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SI_GCN_MetroidPrime2Echoes-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Metroid Prime 2: Echoes - November 15, 2004</h2>
<p>On the same day, Nintendo launched the sequel to 2002's Metroid, a first-person adventure game with shooter elements. Developed like the original by Texas-based company Retro Studios, it garnered widespread praise for its visuals, level design, and longevity (the game required more than 20 hours to complete), averaging a 92/100 score on Metacritic. It was also the first installment in the series to add multiplayer support, although it wasn't exactly its strongest feature.</p>
<p>Nintendo even tried to mimic Halo 2's viral marketing with some fake websites. However, the game's commercial success was nowhere near the likes of Halo 2 due to the underwhelming sales of Nintendo's GameCube platform. It took many years for Metroid Prime 2: Echoes to become a million-seller, although that is no fault of the game itself, which to this day is considered to be one of the best entries in a revered franchise.</p>
<p>While I owned a GameCube, I had sold it already by that point. As such, I did not play Metroid Prime 2 at launch, though I wished I had after seeing all the glowing reviews and impressions online. Despite the not-so-strong sales, this sequel ensured the IP would continue to be one of the most anticipated by Nintendo fans.</p>

<h2>Half-Life 2 - November 16, 2004</h2>
<p>The following day, Valve released Half-Life 2. It had been six years since the original game had reinvented the single player first-person shooter genre, and the hype was already at dangerously high levels. On top of that, as said before, Valve bundled Counter-Strike Source with the game, ensuring people would get Half-Life 2 despite the then-controversial requirement to install it through Steam, their new digital store.</p>
<p>That alone would probably be enough to make it worth remembering, given the huge impact Steam would have on the gaming landscape. But Half-Life 2 was far more than that. Like GTA: San Andreas for open world games, HL2 showed gaming that shooters could be much more immersive and story-driven without sacrificing any gameplay depth. Reviewers clearly agreed, rating it 96/100 on average, the highest score for a game released in 2004.</p>
<p>When I played it on my PC, I couldn't believe its visuals. Back then, the newly released Source engine was the most advanced piece of technology available, and it also came with the built-in Havok physics engine to deliver far higher levels of interactivity with the environments than gamers were used to. The combination of the two left me in awe, to say the least, although I did have a personal issue while playing: motion sickness. I've never had a problem playing first-person games, but something in Half-Life 2 always left me vaguely nauseous after around twenty minutes. A pity, as it's clearly one of the best shooters ever made. Now, I can't wait to see the <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-2-rtx-gets-stunning-new-video-to-celebrate-the-games-20th-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Remix project</a> be released and try once again to step in the shoes of Gordon Freeman.</p>

<h2>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines - November 16, 2004</h2>
<p>Half-Life 2 wasn't the only Source game to launch that day. Independent developer Troika Games, founded by some of the former creators of Fallout, also launched Vampire: The Masquerade -Bloodlines on November 16. However, being the first third-party developer to use Source came at a cost. The studio understandably had no experience with it and encountered several problems during development. As a result, the game was very buggy, which impacted its reception. Releasing in the middle of the busiest gaming month ever didn't help sales, which were a mere 80K units at launch.</p>
<p>Troika was later forced to close down, but the game garnered a lot of well-deserved respect and admiration over time for its excellent writing and atmosphere. For a long time, Bloodlines was synonymous with great choices and writing among RPG fans, becoming a respected IP despite the lack of big sales. This explains why a sequel is currently in the final stages of production. Bloodlines 2 will be a different game by a different developer, but at least there's another RTX Remix project for those who'd like to replay this classic RPG with modern graphics.</p>
<p>As an avid fan of roleplaying games, I absolutely loved Bloodlines and can still remember some of its most memorable moments, such as the creepy Ocean House Hotel mission. If you haven't played it yet and you are into the World of Darkness setting, it's still worth checking it out on the next Steam sale.</p>

<h2>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater - November 17, 2004</h2>
<p>Another day, another masterpiece. While Xbox had Halo 2 and Nintendo had Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, Sony could count on Konami's latest game in the revered MGS series. Once again designed and written by legendary creator Hideo Kojima, Snake Eater serves as a prequel to the entire franchise, featuring Naked Snake (also known as Big Boss) on a peculiar mission in the jungle. The game featured extensive new features, such as closed-quarter combat (CQC), camouflage, an injury system, and even some protosurvival elements that required players to eat regularly lest they suffer penalties to the stamina meter. With a Metacritic score of 91/100 and solid sales (2.6 million units by December 2004), the success was guaranteed.</p>
<p>To understand how iconic Metal Gear Solid 3 really is, just take a look at Konami's remake approach. They've picked Silent Hill 2 for their horror series and MGS3 for their action/adventure/stealth franchise because they are the most universally beloved installments in the respective franchises.</p>
<p>The great news is that if you haven't played the original, Konami has almost <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-is-playable-at-tgs-konami-provides-progress-update-explains-why-they-stayed-so-faithful/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finished</a> remaking it. Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater should launch early next year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, allowing an entirely new generation of fans to check out this masterpiece. This includes myself, as I did not own a PlayStation 2 anymore at that time.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/World-of-Warcraft-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>World of Warcraft - November 23, 2004</h2>
<p>Another hugely anticipated game was Blizzard's MMORPG set in the Warcraft universe. Fans had come to love the fantasy IP through three strategy games, but it was with World of Warcraft that Blizzard's franchise really exploded into critical mass. WoW was not the first MMORPG, but its innovations in accessibility (chiefly the reduced friction upon the player character's death), its vast and gorgeously styled game world, not to mention the well-designed classes, ushered in a new era for the genre. Following a highly positive critical reception of 93/100, the game continued attracting players for several years. The previous record for active subscribers was EverQuest's 500K accounts; World of Warcraft reached 12 million subscribers in 2010.</p>
<p>Rival companies spawned countless clones, but none ever came close to achieving the same level of success in the genre. World of Warcraft is, of course, the only game on the list that is still being <a href="https://wccftech.com/warcraft-iii-reforged-2-0-and-warcraft-i-ii-remastered-out-now-world-of-warcraft-to-get-housing-next-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated</a>, although the original gameplay style was so successful that Blizzard created the <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-classic-cataclysm-season-of-discovery-qa-we-want-to-explore-some-of-the-unfinished-bits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WoW Classic</a> mode.</p>
<p>For me, World of Warcraft was simply a home for so many years. I started playing in December 2004 during the European Closed Beta Test and remember being absolutely mesmerized by this huge online world despite not even being a big fan of the RTS games. MMORPGs turned out to be my favorite genre after all, and I spent countless hours between 2004 and 2011 in Azeroth, enjoying World of Warcraft's content and finding new friends in various guilds, too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/best-beginner-supports-to-play-in-league-of-legends-2024/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you're getting stuck into League of Legends and often find yourself in the Support position, there are a variety of ways you can help out your lane partner. Whether you want to <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/champions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">be someone</a> who has a lot of crowd control, healing, or shielding, there is a lot of variety available for the Support. Some are a lot easier than others, and this guide will tell you all about the easiest supports to pick up if you're just getting started in League of Legends.</p>
<p>Check out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-league-of-legends-adcs-for-beginners-in-2024/">other guide on the best ADCs to play in League of Legends</a>.</p>
<h2>Best Beginner Supports in League of Legends</h2>
<p>There are a ton of champions you can play as a support, with some of them being off-meta and not being listed as a support as their primary role. However, those champions tend to be a bit more complicated. If you're getting into the game and are planning on laning with a friend, being a Support is a great way to learn.</p>
<p><strong>Soraka</strong> is an excellent support and has been a mainstay in the game since her introduction to the title when it was first released. She has the capability to damage, silence, and heal, giving her plenty of versatility. You can use your ability to heal an ally, which will siphon your health. However, your damaging ability will heal you as long as you hit the enemy champion. Soraka's ultimate is one of the best support ultimate, as it can heal every living ally. This is great to utilize in team fights or if you're in an aggressive lane and need to clutch heal you or your ADC.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Sona</strong> is another fantastic support you can use, as she has a lot of utility, as she can heal, stun, damage and speed up allies. Sona is relatively easy to learn, as her abilities don't require any aiming except for her ultimate, which has a wide range. The only downside to Sona for beginners is trying to keep an eye on her mana usage and making sure to utilize her passive correctly.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Yuumi</strong> is quite possibly one of the easiest champions that you can play in League of Legends. The premise of Yuumi is to attach yourself to your laning partner so that you can heal them. However, during this time, you won't be able to deal any damage to the enemies. Despite that, you are completely invulnerable until the champion you're attached to dies, which is when you become separated and can heal and damage.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Blitzcrank</strong> takes a little bit more finesse but is still relatively easy to get to grips with as a beginner. Blitzcrank is a different kind of support in League of Legends, as he doesn't have any capability to heal or shield his allies. However, he has great crowd control, which can help set up some great kills. Depending on how you build Blitzcrank, you may even see yourself netting some of the kills, especially with your Ultimate.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>These are some of the best supports to start with in League of Legends if you're brand-new to the game. There are plenty more to try out, which you can do in bot games if you are worried about annoying your teammates.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Starbreeze To Invest ‘Significantly Less’ in Payday 3’s Second Year of Content]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/starbreeze-payday-3-less-investment/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starbreeze-to-invest-%E2%80%98significantly-less%E2%80%99-in-payday-3%E2%80%99s-second-year-of-content.1038033/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/starbreeze-payday-3-less-investment/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a recent financial update, Starbreeze’s leadership team revealed that it will shrink the team working on Payday 3 going into the game’s second year of content, and invest ‘significantly less’ overall. However, the company has assured players and shareholders that this won’t impact the value delivered to gamers worldwide.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-less-is-more">Less is More</h2>



<p>Starbreeze revealed in a recent financial report that Payday 2’s sales contributions were still a whopping 50% of the value of Payday 3’s contributions. That’s a representative example of the staying power of the second game, while the third game has long struggled with player retention.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.inderes.dk/releases/starbreeze-ab-publ-interim-report-january-september-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In a statement</a>, the interim CEO of Starbreeze, Mats Juhl, said that the company is ‘leveraging the strength of its franchises’ to continue succeeding going into 2025:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This time last year we had just launched PAYDAY 3 – a milestone for us as a studio, and a commercial success, but also a launch marred by a series of technical issues. Since then, we have worked tirelessly to improve the game and expand the amount of content and features. </p>



<p>By the end of the quarter, we had launched four major DLCs as well as a large amount of updates to both functionality and content for all of our players. At the end of October, one of our biggest updates since launch was launched, with a brand new user interface, server browser, VoIP and much more.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He mentioned midway through his statement that…</p>



<blockquote>
<p>… ahead of year two, we are confident in being able to continue delivering amounts of value to our players with a significantly lower level of investment.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was highlighted that the sentiment around Payday 3 is improving across all channels, which is true. The game has recovered somewhat from the terrible launch it underwent, even if the player base has dwindled considerably since release.</p>



<p>Starbeeze will continue to deliver content for Payday 3 going into 2025, but perhaps at a slower cadence. The team is hard at work on Project Baxter, and Juhl revealed that the company is on an expansion initiative, fleshing out roles to support the development of the new game.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/riot-games-suggests-more-league-shows-will-follow-in-arcane%E2%80%99s-footsteps.1038015/</guid>

<p>It was recently revealed that Arcane set a record as the most expensive animated television series ever, coming in at a whopping $250 million for just two seasons. It has been a roaring success, though – and fans are lapping up the content, especially now that the League of Legends World Championship has wrapped up.</p>



<p>Admittedly, Arcane is a masterclass in animation, and it’s picking up some seriously high praise from fans worldwide. In a recent post on Twitter, one of Riot Games’ co-founders, Marc Merrill, revealed that Riot Games isn’t done with these animated shows, despite the third season of Arcane being cancelled.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-want-more">We Want More</h2>



<p>In a simple post on Twitter, Marc Merrill revealed that ‘there are lots of other stories to tell’. He was responding to a question asking why there won’t be more seasons of Arcane.</p>



<p>Mere weeks ago, Merrill was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arcane-most-expensive-animated-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">defending the budget</a> that Riot Games blew through in the production of Arcane’s first and second seasons:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re more than comfortable with the spend it took to deliver a show that was worthy of our players’ time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>League of Legends has been running for more than a decade and remains one of the most storied and lore-heavy games in existence. It has a thriving community backing it up, and millions of people are more than willing to soak up whatever multimedia offerings Riot Games can produce.</p>



<p>Perhaps a budget adjustment will take place, though. With Riot Games spending $250 million to produce 18 episodes of a show, many have questioned the sustainability of the company’s coffers. If that’s trimmed up, maybe we’ll get something with more meat on the bones – who knows?</p>



<p>Do you want to see more animated shows coming out of the League of Legends camp? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<p>"The Game Awards aims to recognise the best creative and technical work each year, irrespective of the format of that content’s release," the website now says.

At its core, this HD-2D remake plays like an NES or SNES game with a fresh coat of paint. Yet, by the same token, it injects several new features and quality-of-life adjustments that will make this version of <em>Dragon Quest III</em> feel new for even longtime fans. I should know, as I played <em>Dragon Quest III</em> just a few years ago and was shocked by how long it took me to get my bearings. Fighters and Martial Artists start with MP bars?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-pro-matches-slim-model%E2%80%99s-power-consumption-while-delivering-significantly-better-performance.1037916/</guid>

			<p>Among the most impressive aspects of the PlayStation 5 Pro is its ability to deliver much better performance than the base model while consuming similar power.</p>
<p>As part of their in-depth testing of the recently released console by Sony, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDp1C_4AD4U" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> tested the PlayStation 5 Pro power consumption running different games, including Elden Ring, which was not patched to take advantage of the system's unique features, and Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which did receive a PS5 Pro patch. In both games, the mid-generation refresh in Quality Mode consumed as much as the PlayStation 5 Slim while delivering much better performance and image quality, although the Slim console used for the test may have had some issues, as it was consuming more power than expected. Still, even compared to the base launch model, the new console's efficiency is very impressive, consuming around the same power to deliver significant improvements in both patched and unpatched. Additionally, this is highly indicative that the two systems' SoCs were produced using different process nodes, likely 4nm for the PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Pro Power Consumption Tested vs PS5 Slim vs Launch PS5" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cDp1C_4AD4U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Despite its high price, the PlayStation 5 Pro is definitely a worthy purchase for those looking to experience PS5 games at their very best. In games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-god-of-war-ragnarok-pssr-framerate-down/">God of War Ragnarok</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-patch/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, the system delivers significant improvements that enhance the experience considerably. The system is also delivering great 8K modes, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-impressive-8k-resolution-no-mans-sky/">No Man's Sky 8K mode</a>, which is so good that it could start to change minds regarding the viability of such a high resolution.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-level-is-prestige-1-in-black-ops-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Call of Duty player base wanted the Prestige back to how it used to be, and Treyarch and Activision have delivered. The old-school setup is back, but you need to reach a certain level to hit Prestige 1 in Black Ops 6—and we know which one. </p>



<p>I fall into the boomer category when it comes to CoD. I miss having fewer attachments, need an abundance of intricately woven three-lane maps, and yearn for the classic Prestige system. Leveling up and earning a new Prestige icon was a joy, and the challenge of unlocking all weapons and equipment again was special. </p>



<p>Activision heard our cries, and the Prestige system many of us grew up with is back with a triumphant bang. For many of you, this way of Prestiging is probably foreign. So, I’m going to run through the level you need to reach to hit Prestige 1—and beyond—and give you a quick run-through of what happens.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-prestige-in-black-ops-6">How to Prestige in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The first of many Prestige screens. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You must complete Level 55 to unlock the ability to Prestige in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a clear set of instructions in case you missed the in-game prompts:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the Black Ops 6 main multiplayer menu.</li>



<li>Click on <strong>Barracks</strong>.</li>



<li>Press on <strong>Progression</strong>.</li>



<li>Now choose <strong>Prestige</strong>.</li>



<li><strong>Hold the Triangle on PlayStation, Y on Xbox</strong>, or the applicable button on other formats to see Prestige Details.</li>



<li>When it gives you the option, press <strong>Continue</strong>.</li>



<li>Press <strong>Continue </strong>again.</li>



<li>Finally, <strong>hold the required button for several seconds to officially Prestige</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<p>To be clear, if you reach Level 55, <strong>this isn’t enough</strong>—you need to get to the <em>end </em>of Level 55 to gain access to the Prestige option. Once you do this, BLOPS 6 informs you, and you’re left with a difficult decision, do you stay, or do you go on?</p>



<h2 id="h-what-happens-when-you-prestige-in-black-ops-6">What Happens When You Prestige in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>If you choose to Prestige,<strong> your player level resets to one</strong>, <strong>your player icon changes to a universal symbol that remains through your Prestige 1 run</strong>, and you can <strong>unlock a heap of goodies for hitting certain milestones</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-player-level">Player Level</h3>



<p>Yes, even though you’ve spent hours increasing your player rank, enabling the Prestige function resets the number straight back to one. Effectively, you start again, and it means you need to re-unlock everything—save for one weapon, piece of equipment, or Perk of your choosing.</p>



<h3 id="h-icon-change">Icon Change</h3>



<p>Your first run through Black Ops 6’s online multiplayer gives you a fresh icon for hitting new levels, However, with Prestige, each time you do it, you’re given a fixed icon from levels 1-55. Per <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launch-progression-leveling-prestiging-challenges-intel#master" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Activision</a>, Black Ops 6 Prestige icons are special though as they are “themed around a title in Black Ops history.”</p>



<h3 id="h-rewards">Rewards</h3>



<p>Prestiging gives you instant <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-prestige-rewards-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prestige rewards</a> but also offers incentives throughout the entire Prestige journey. For example, you can earn Calling Cards, Emblems, Charms, and even Blueprints. Think of Prestige less like a daunting endeavor, and more challenging and replayable journey to carry you to the ultimate glory—the final Prestige icon!</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Left 4 Dead 2 is celebrating its 15-year anniversary today, November 17, 2024. Below, we look at how its cast and their interactions set it apart from its contemporaries and modern imitators alike.</em></p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/left-4-dead-2/">Left 4 Dead 2</a> has been rightfully receiving its flowers for the past 15 years. The modding community has come up with everything from visual enhancements like <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=121339498">improved blood textures</a> to completely user-made <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=122444796">campaigns</a>. The last two DLCs for the game, Cold Stream and The Last Stand, were made by community members and officially endorsed by Valve. At the time of writing, there are over 45,000 players in-game on PC, and (if you somehow still don't own it) you can play it for free during this anniversary weekend. As such, the Steam discussions are filled with <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/550/discussions/">dozens of threads</a> about the Good Guy Nick Achievement, which can only be obtained when the game is on a free weekend, something that occurs every couple of years.</p><p dir="ltr">But there's a special legacy Left 4 Dead has left behind: Valve's shooter has been a catalyst for a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-made-left-4-dead-special-according-to-the-devs-making-games-like-it/1100-6503996/">new subgenre altogether</a>. Games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/back-4-blood-review-reanimated/1900-6417761/">Back 4 Blood</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-anacrusis/">The Anacrusis</a> follow the formula closely, which isn't surprising considering the development teams include people who worked on Left 4 Dead. Others, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warhammer-vermintide-2/">Warhammer: Vermintide</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deep-rock-galactic/">Deep Rock Galactic</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/aliens-fireteam-elite-suicide-squad/1900-6417719/">Aliens: Fireteam Elite</a> iterate on the concept of a co-op shooter by leaning closer to its own worlds, taking inspiration from existing franchises or coming up with brand-new mechanics to stand out from the rest. Yet, as more developers are taking the genre in interesting new directions, there's one crucial element that is often overlooked in these iterations.</p><p dir="ltr">The passage of time has not diminished Left 4 Dead 2's strengths. The clever "AI Director" dictating and reacting to the pace and behavior of your group to the B-movie flair embedded in every corner are standouts. But if there's one thing that entices me to return to the game, and a crucial aspect that none of the Left 4 Dead-likes have managed to achieve to a similar degree, is the cast of characters and the personality each of them oozes.</p><p dir="ltr">This was a strong suit even in the first Left 4 Dead with Zoey, Francis, Louis, and Bill. From the moment you set foot on the first rooftop on your way to Mercy Hospital, the frequent character interactions are put front and center. The quips can be further extended (on PC) by using a conversation wheel to express yourself drawing from a pool of hundreds of lines for laughing, cursing, and thanking others. While neither game was ever story-driven, you get to learn more about the characters' personalities thanks to these conversations, and how they interact with each other throughout the campaigns. As a result, I cared more for their survival within the world itself, and not just from a sole gameplay standpoint of reviving a friend during a horde rush. As time passed, I found Bill's incidental role as a parental figure to be endearing, and Francis' constant complaints became a running joke rather than making him an annoying character.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4400535-slack-imgs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4400535" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4400535-slack-imgs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4400535"></a><figcaption>The cast of Left 4 Dead </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4400535-slack-imgs.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Left 4 Dead 2 took this foundation further with Nick, Coach, Rochelle, and Ellis: Some smaller details include voice command shouts <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingDetails/comments/ag00r4/left_4_dead_2_your_character_will_shout_the/" rel="nofollow ">being louder or quieter</a> when calling other characters' names depending on the distance from each other, or the iconic Easter egg in the Dark Carnival campaign where the cast sings <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEs_dbZjyI">song excerpts</a> if you interact with the microphone on stage during the final fight. But there's a greater focus on highlighting the characters--unlike the first Left 4 Dead campaign, No Mercy, the group begins the sequel not knowing each other's names in Dead Center. They're eventually introduced to one another and establish a bond over the later episodes. The DLCs, as well as the integration of Left 4 Dead into Left 4 Dead 2, are proof of Valve extending the philosophy to the original cast as well, with The Passing uniting both groups in the same campaign, and The Sacrifice adding another sentimental layer as an overarching narrative involving Bill.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking back at all the late nights I've had playing with friends during the past 15 years, I believe the characters are responsible for tying the whole experience together. They remain singular in nature, resulting in a sense of personality that is yet to be matched. Some jokes and banter lines, such as Nick remarking on Ellis' excitement over the carnival Kiddie Land by saying, "He's like a five-year-old, with guns and a comprehensive grasp of every swear word in the English language," and the multiple variants for friendly fire reactions like Ellis' "I am not a zombie, shoot the zombies!" never get tiresome.</p><p dir="ltr">As it stands, the future of Left 4 Dead is uncertain. In 2023, people <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/left-4-dead-3-is-a-non-priority-according-to-counter-strike-2-files" rel="nofollow ">found a mention</a> of "Left4Dead3" in Counter-Strike 2's files, albeit with the downside that, according to the files, the project's priority is "none" for Valve. This follows a series of similar I Want to Believe mentions throughout the years in other titles like Half-Life: Alyx and Portal VR, including more concrete details in The Final Hours of Half-Life: Alyx documentary, where it was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-3-left-4-dead-3-details-cancelled-valve" rel="nofollow ">revealed</a> that Left 4 Dead 3 was supposed to be an open-world game set in Morocco, only to be canceled due to game engine Source 2's unfinished status at the time.</p><p dir="ltr">It's hard to know if a third entry could capture the charm and chemistry of the existing characters with a new group once more. Despite having replayed the campaigns dozens of times over the years, however, I'm still discovering interactions by the cast. And even when I'm not, joining a lobby feels like revisiting old friends at this point. Picking a character in Left 4 Dead 2 doesn't give you any different perks--each one of them can use all weapons, and their survival depends on your skills and cooperation with others alone. The game's most noteworthy achievement, then, is giving importance to that decision regardless of its importance--choosing the eyes from which to see the apocalypse through is as memorable as your efforts to make it out alive with that character.</p>

New releases like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24268103/metaphor-refantazio-review-atlus-xbox-persona"><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24281631/dragon-age-the-veilguard-early-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Dragon Age Absolution</em></a>, along with older titles like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc">including this year’s expansion</a>), <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23881536/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-update-2-0"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23861883/baldurs-gate-3-ps5-technical-review"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a> have sucked millions of people into their expansive worlds. They can be all-consuming experiences, offering players all kinds of freedom to explore their worlds and characters. But honestly? Sometimes I don’t want to fuss with conversation wheels or make difficult, narrative-altering choices. I just want to go on a big adventure and slowly turn into an overpowered hero fighting monsters — and that’s where the excellent new remake of <em>Dragon Quest 3</em> comes in.</p><p>The game originally came out way back in 1988 (it was initially called <em>Dragon Warrior 3</em> in North America) and it has a refreshingly straightforward premise: you’re on a quest to kill a great evil that your father failed to destroy many years before. There are a few colorful characters, but there isn’t a whole lot else to it beyond a quest for revenge. This isn’t a game you play for the story. Instead, it’s about going on adventures, exploring strange and dangerous locations, and killing lots of cute blue slimes.</p><p>That simplicity has stood the test of time rather well, with systems that are easy to grasp while still offering a challenge (even if the regular battles can eventually get tedious). This is a good thing, because the remake doesn’t change all that much. The exploration and turn-based battles all still feel largely as they did. This means that the game follows a largely predictable path, as you go from one dungeon to the next, visiting towns in between to rest and gear up for the next challenge. There are some additions, like a new character class that lets you collect monsters, along with additional story scenes to flesh out the barebones narrative.</p><p>Though it’s mostly the same as the original, there are major changes to the presentation and some notable quality of life features. To start, this version of <em>Dragon Quest 3</em> looks incredible. It uses the same visual style as games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/12/17561880/octopath-traveler-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Octopatch Traveller</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/4/22960053/triangle-strategy-nintendo-switch-interview"><em>Triangle Strategy</em></a>, which Square Enix awkwardly calls “HD 2D.” Basically, these are still games with pixel art characters, but they explore incredibly detailed worlds. The developers then throw in a tilt-shift effect that gives the whole thing a diorama-like appearance. The result is a game that looks decidedly old-school, but in a slick, modern way. I especially love the adorable monster animations in battle. There’s also an updated orchestral score performed by the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony, along with all-new voice acting.</p><p>It’s more than just an aesthetic overhaul, though. The <em>Dragon Quest 3</em> remake also makes some very smart tweaks that often make it less frustrating to play. These include a more useful map that makes it easier to find where you’re headed, an option to speed up battles so you can grind quicker, and a handful of difficulty options. These may sound small, but they’re the kind of modern conveniences that can make many older games difficult to play, especially ones built around repetitive combat like a classic RPG. Smoothing out those few rough edges has a big impact on the overall feel of a game like <em>Dragon Quest 3</em>.</p><p>Even though it’s technically the third game of the series, this version of <em>Dragon Quest</em> is also a great place for newcomers to see what the series is all about (and really, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/28/17790204/dragon-quest-11-review-ps4-steam">things haven’t changed all that much over the years</a>). It’s a pretty, approachable way to experience an epic quest without getting overwhelmed by story or features. It’s just you, some swords and magic, and a whole lot of monsters to defeat. Sometimes, that’s all you really need.</p><p><small>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D<em> is available now on the Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>20 years after its 2004 debuted, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> has broken its own concurrent player record on Steam.</p>
<p>According to SteamDB, the seminal shooter has secured just over a 61.7K player peak over the weekend, the highest number of simultaneous players the game has achieved since records began in 2008.</p>
<p>In fact, the number I've just written is probably already out of date - the number is still rising and has been all day, having increased several times in the time I've been writing this.</p>

<p>Given this weekend's surprise release of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-2-just-got-a-special-20th-anniversary-update-with-a-new-documentary-commentary-and-more">special anniversary update</a>, it's possible players are jumping back into the game to revel in nostalgia or possibly check out the new director's commentary. It's also possible - given Valve is currently giving away the game for free - new players are trying it for the first time.</p><p>If you haven't seen it yet, in the accompanying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCjNT9qGjh4">documentary now available on YouTube</a>, the Half-Life 2 development team revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-2-episode-3-doesnt-exist-because-left-4-dead-does">Episode 3 didn't make it after the team switched focus to concentrate on getting Left 4 Dead "out the door"</a>.</p>
<p>"<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> needed an all-hands-on effort to ship, and so we put down [Episode 3] to go help Left 4 Dead," explained developer David Speyre. "It took long enough that by the time we considered going back to Episode 3, the argument was made like, well, we missed it. It's too late now. We really need to make a new engine to continue the Half-Life series.</p>
<p>"Now, in hindsight, that seems so wrong. We could have definitely gone back and spent two years to make Episode 3."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Treyarch has enabled, disabled, and is now reintroducing legacy XP tokens in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>.</p>
<p>Along with five multiplayer maps - three of which are brand new - free and premium content, a new Zombies "experience in-season", and full integration with Call of Duty's spin-off battle royale, Warzone, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-1-has-so-much-content-this-infographic-hurts-our-eyes">Black Ops 6's Season 1</a> also introduced something else - legacy XP tokens.</p>
<p>Turns out the latter was an accident, though, as no sooner did players spot legacy XP tokens in the new shooter, developer Treyarch "fixed an issue that incorrectly allowed legacy XP tokens to be activated in Black Ops 6 UI".</p>

<p>If you were frustrated by the fix, you're not alone - which is why Treyarch is exploring a way to do this "correctly" in the future.</p>
<p>"With the start of Season 01, a UI bug allowed players to activate legacy XP tokens in Black Ops 6. Unfortunately, it also introduced some potential risk to game stability, which is why it was patched yesterday," Treyarch explained.</p> <div>

<p>"We realise how much players appreciate being able to redeem legacy XP tokens in both BO6 and Warzone, so we are currently testing a way to implement this change correctly in a future update. This allows us time to ensure stability is maintained before we reintroduce this feature.</p><p>"In the interim, players can activate any legacy XP tokens in Warzone. Any tokens applied in Warzone will also apply to Black Ops 6 should you switch titles or modes," Treyarch concluded, before revealing we should hear more about this change "next week".</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-update-breaks-assault-rifles-so-badly-theyre-pretty-much-useless-now">latest Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 update also nerfed assault rifles</a>. As the same time, the Ghost perk - which hides you from UAV and scout pulse -  also bugged out, as it seemingly couldn't be equipped anymore.</p>
<p>"For a series built on high-octane thrills and explosive gratification, its withdrawal to the well-trodden formula echoes the wider industry's continued allergy to risk," Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review">Eurogamer's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
