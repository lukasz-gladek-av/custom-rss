			<p>What's surprising about <strong>ARC Raiders</strong> isn't that it's a popular game that sold well; <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-opens-pre-orders-server-slam-oct-17-19/">there was a lot of hype leading up to its launch</a>, and developer <strong>Embark Studios</strong> already <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-tech-test-hands-on-promising-extractions/">had a lot of great feedback from the beta tests it ran</a>. Its staying power and continued upward momentum are what's surprising, as no one could have predicted it would continue to be one of the most-played games on Steam each and every day since it arrived. </p>



<p>Now, according to Alinea Analytics, Embark Studio's third-person extraction shooter has reached a new milestone, with over <strong>12 million copies sold</strong>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/superhys.bsky.social/post/3mbocqp3vzc2w">says analyst Rhys Elliot</a>. "<em>So ARC Raiders passed 12M copies sold over the weekend (Alinea estimates)</em>," Elliot wrote in a post on Bluesky.</p>



<p>Not only has it hit yet another sales milestone, but it also set a new record for its daily active users, with over 3.2 million players tuning in yesterday, January 4, to spend their final hours of the winter/holiday break playing some ARC Raiders.</p>







<p>When ARC Raiders launched in October 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-surpasses-200k-concurrent-players-on-steam-at-launch/">it was immediately Embark Studios' biggest game</a>, reaching over 200K concurrent players on Steam and who knows how many more on consoles. It <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sold-2-5-million-copies-in-debut-week/">hit 2.5 million copies in its debut week</a>, and barely a week later, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-has-sold-4-million-units-nexons-most-successful-global-launch/">it had surpassed 4 million copies sold</a>. Yes, there was a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-ceo-claims-we-should-assume-every-game-company-now-using-ai-game-devs-say-no/">fair bit of controversy around Embark Studios' use of GenAI</a>, but that never seemed to slow down the game's sales or the fact that it was dominating the conversation around multiplayer games heading into the end of the year and awards season.</p>



<p>It was <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-was-2025-most-searched-videogame-on-google-gta-vi-only-7th/">the most searched video game of the year according to Google</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">was one of Steam's best-selling games by revenue in 2025</a>. Embark Studios' <a href="https://wccftech.com/people-have-to-take-step-back-understand-ai-can-be-big-help-developers-benefit-players-says-arc-raiders-boss/">continued use and promotion of GenAI</a> still follows the game whenever it comes up in conversation, but it's clearly not a hindrance to it, as at the time of this writing, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/#1m">there are over 240K concurrent players in the game on Steam right now</a>. </p>



<p>It hasn't even dropped below 250K concurrent players since launch, according to SteamDB. Its staying power has been impressive, to say the least, and it wouldn't be surprising at all if the defining game of 2026 was this third-person extraction shooter from October 2025.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-is-weird-and-fcked-up-why-one-modder-is-pushing-artistic-flair-against-realism-and-boring-ray-tracing-trends/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>With the improvements made to the <strong>ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator</strong> in the past year, playing <strong><em>Bloodborne</em></strong> on PC has become a reality even without an official port. The emulation improvements also paved the way for mods that <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-4k-100-fps-rtx-4070/"><strong>unlock the game's framerate past the 30 FPS cap</strong></a> of the vanilla release and introduced <strong>visual enhancements</strong>.</p>



<p>Among the visual overhauls released for the now-classic PS4 action role-playing game is the <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-improved-pointlights/">Bloodborne Remaster Project</a></em></strong> created by <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@fromsoftserve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fromsoftserve</a></strong>, a known Souls series modder. Over the past few days, the project became <strong><em>Shadows of the Hunt</em></strong>, undergoing some massive changes fueled by the modder's desire to push <strong>"artistic flair"</strong> against realistic visuals and <strong>"boring" ray tracing trends</strong> that are dominating the industry of late.</p>



<p>The launch of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Shadows of the Hunt</em></strong> mod, now available from <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/45?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nexus Mods</a></strong>, was announced in a new video shared by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">fromsoftserve</strong> on YouTube, which goes over its features. The most notable are the inclusion of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">dynamic shadows</strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">parallax occlusion mapping</strong> to many surfaces, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">point lights</strong> for elements that emit no light in the vanilla version, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">higher resolution skyboxes,</strong> and more.</p>



<p>Possibly more interesting, however, is the inclusion of <strong>alternate color grading</strong>, which gives <strong><em>Bloodborne</em></strong> a rather peculiar feel. Although quite different from the vanilla grading, <strong>fromsoftserve</strong> believes it suits the game well: <em>"Bloodborne is cosmic and weird and f*cked up, and you can have a very weird looking game,"</em> the modder said in the video.</p>



<p><em>"I'm actually far more interested in an image being interesting than realistic. I think the industry is way too focused on realism, and they’re forgetting that we’re playing games. I think that’s more interesting and has more 'soul' to it than just trying to make it look like a photograph,"</em> fromsoftserve continued in the video to highlight how their approach has a more <strong>artistic flair</strong> that is in stark contrast to the <strong>almost obnoxious search for realism</strong> that is dominating video games as of late.</p>



<p><strong>Ray Tracing</strong> and <strong>Path Tracing</strong> are two other trends that have dominated the video game industry in recent months, and the new approach in the <strong><em>Bloodborne Shadows of the Hunt</em></strong> mod is also a pushback against how ray-traced features are being used.</p>



<p><em>"I love ray tracing and path tracing, but I think the industry is using it currently in a somewhat boring method where they’re just trying to make it look realistic. Making lighting unrealistic is also awesome and fun."</em> Seeing the visuals most of the industry, especially Western developers, is pushing nowadays that is making it difficult to distinguish one game from another, it's difficult not to agree with <strong>fromsoftserve</strong>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Besides any further improvements <strong><em>Shadows of the Hunt</em></strong> mod may bring in the next few months, <strong>2026</strong> is still setting out to be an exciting year for <strong><em>Bloodborne</em></strong> fans, even without an official remaster on the horizon. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-pc-online-play-is-no-longer-a-dream-shadps4-developer-showcases-working-multiplayer-milestone/">The </a></strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-pc-online-play-is-no-longer-a-dream-shadps4-developer-showcases-working-multiplayer-milestone/"><strong>ShadPS4 team is currently exploring the possibility of enabling the game's online multiplayer features on PC</strong></a>, which will truly transform the emulated version into the <strong>definitive edition</strong> of the game once they become available.</p>

The 8BitDo Ultimate 3E Controller for Xbox follows last August’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717994/8bitdo-wireless-xbox-controller-rare-40th-anniversary-edition">Ultimate 3-mode Controller for Xbox — Rare 40th Anniversary Edition</a> with some excellent upgrades, less branding, and a big price hike. It’s got <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) joysticks</a>, Hall effect triggers with adjustable stops for improved reaction times, and swappable ABXY buttons. It was announced at CES 2026 but isn’t expected to launch until sometime in Q2 of 2026 for $149.99, putting it in competition with more premium console controllers like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-ROG-II-Wireless-Controller/dp/B0G36827DR/ref=sr_1_3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">recently announced ASUS ROG Raikiri II</a>.</p><p>The Ultimate 3E Controller is also one of 8BitDo’s most customizable controllers. It comes preinstalled with two standard joysticks that can be replaced with two tall joysticks, a “thick-neck” joystick, or a dome-capped stick. The standard metal D-pad can be swapped out to one with a circular design, but it’s the controller’s ABXY buttons that stand out. Unlike the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/706967/8bitdo-pro-3-wireless-bluetooth-controller-tmr-swappable-buttons">8BitDo Pro 3, which only lets you swap out the button caps</a>, the Ultimate 3E includes two interchangeable button modules: one with squishy silicone membrane buttons, and one with clicky micro switches that are accessible by removing the controller’s faceplate.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</strong><span><figcaption><em>The controller’s ABXY buttons are part of a module that can be swapped out to provide a different feel when pressed.</em></figcaption> <cite>Image: 8BitDo</cite></span></p></section><p>In addition to the Hall effect triggers, the Ultimate 3E has two pairs of shoulder buttons, a pair of remappable bumpers on the back, and six-axis motion controls that are limited to PC gaming. The bases of both joysticks are surrounded with RGB rings that light up and react to movements, but battery life is still rated at a decent 18 hours of playtime between charges on an included dock.</p><p>The Ultimate 3E doesn’t connect to the Xbox using Microsoft’s native wireless protocol and instead relies on a bundled 2.4GHz USB dongle. But Bluetooth is included for connecting to Apple and Android devices, or you can tether to consoles and PCs using a USB cable to minimize lag. The controller is also compatible with 8BitDo’s Ultimate Software X (a variant of its Ultimate Software V2 for its Xbox controllers) so you can customize its performance and remap controls to make custom profiles that are swappable using a button on the Ultimate 3E.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/848331/8bitdo-ultimate-3e-controller-xbox-wireless-tmr-swappable-joysticks]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you're a fan of both the colour grey being draped all over designs that could be accurately described as both angular and slabby, you're in luck. A third brutalist map jam has hit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a>, with this one being less of a fan-made map pack and more of a huge overhaul mod - the concrete cavernousness of which dwarfs the original game.</p>

<p>Quake's first two brutalist map jams, which dropped in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/quake-goes-brutalist-in-a-new-map-pack-thats-all-about-concrete">2022</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/quake-goes-brutalist-again-in-another-free-map-pack-celebrating-concrete">2023</a>, contained 35 and 30 maps respectively. This third one contains 77. Imagine the sheer weight and density of all of those floors and walls. The maps aren't all this "megalithic community project more than a year in the making" has to offer, either.</p>
<p>"The goal for QBJ3 was to make something uniquely ambitious for the community to build with us," reads the project's intro blurb. "Beginning production in the winter of 2024, the team slow-cooked a total conversion mod in (semi) secret. In October 2025 the work-in-progress mod was unleashed upon the community, who spent the next six weeks exploring its tools, testing its limits, and ultimately creating the worlds for the mod to take place in."</p><p>Among the stuff being tested were a bunch of new weapons, monsters, powerups, and "a complete visual overhaul of Quake's existing roster". The armaments, which you can see shown off in a suitably grey armoury in the video below, include a pipe wrench dubbed Skullcracker and dual-wielded automatic nail guns. Oh, and in case those aren't brutalistic enough for you, there's the Rebar Cannon. It's an "industrial crossbow" which fires rusty metal bolts with a satisfying churm-kachunk sound effect that belongs woven into the percussive mix of some 90s German heavy metal.</p>

<p>To get your hands on the Rebar Cannon you'll need to pick one of the two options by which this third brutalist jam can be grabbed via <a href="https://qbj3.slipseer.com/">Slipseer</a>. The recommended version works like a regular mod, bolting to your copy of Quake and a source port of your choosing (the modders suggest <a href="https://github.com/andrei-drexler/ironwail">Ironwail</a>). Then, there's a version which works like a standalone game that you can extract and run right away, since it comes already set up with Ironwail and open source Quake remake project LibreQuake.</p>
<p>As with Alice O's writeup of the first Quake Brutalism Jam, I'll end this newsing by disclosing that this third jam also includes a map by <a href="https://x.com/radiatoryang/status/2007635685113770212">Robert Yang</a>, who's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/authors/robert-yang">written for RPS</a> about Quake and level design.</p>

              <p>2018’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-the-kotaku-review-1829984369"><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> </a>is a very big game. Rockstar’s open-world cowboy simulator is also chockablock with secrets and mysteries. And somehow, nearly a decade after launch, players have stumbled upon a whole new one to solve involving mysterious spider webs, feathers, and…guitars?</p> <p><a href="https://youtu.be/0T4J8LYqUi0">As expertly documented by <em>Red Dead</em> YouTuber StrangeMan,</a> in late December, <em>RDR2</em> players discovered <a href="https://youtu.be/OSQPMaU7yz8">a strange spider glyph</a> on a telegraph pole. Above the pole, players spotted a spider web that only appears between the in-game hours of 3 am and 4 am. On the web are some feathers, which can be shot off.</p>

  <p>Things got more interesting when players took the glyph below this secret web and overlaid it onto <em>RDR2</em>‘s map. This led them to more hidden spider webs on telegraph poles. And at the center of all this is a large spider-web hidden inside a tree, which seems to contain a message pointing players to a utility pole that hides a new clue pointing to more poles that seem to be connected to acoustic guitars found at a military fort.</p>

 <p>People have <a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-players-are-still-unraveling-all-1832303583">spent years and years digging through <em>RDR2</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-players-keep-finding-creepy-easte-1830502069">all of its mysteries and secrets</a>. Yet despite all those mystery hunters leaving no stone unturned, it seems there’s at least one more secret left unsolved in Rockstar’s massive open-world Western, with all of this apparently hiding in the game, undocumented by players, for the better part of a decade. Might all this also be connected to an obscure mystery in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chiliadmystery/comments/4l3n4o/a_guide_of_all_known_spider_webs/"><em> Grand Theft Auto V</em> involving spider webs?</a></p>

 <p>For now, investigators trying to piece it all together are stuck at <a href="https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Fort_Wallace">Fort Wallace</a>, where two guitars can be found that many believe are part of the next step in the mystery, but which (at least for now) nobody has cracked yet. There are some theories, some of which are very wild and seem hard to believe. But then again, it sure seems like players have found a seven-year-old secret in <em>RDR2</em> involving disappearing spider webs and glyphs hidden behind the breakable wood of random telegraph poles, so at this point, I’m open to basically any theory, because the reality is plenty weird. If you want to possibly help solve this new mystery before <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787"><em>GTA 6</em> arrives later this year</a>, head over to Fort Wallace and see what you can find.</p>

                <p>Sometimes you get so into a game that you scream uncontrollably. Whether that be a curse word or an SOS, if you yell loud enough, someone will come to your rescue. At least that's what happened to one <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> player, whose door was kicked in by a concerned neighbor after he heard the player yelling for help.</p><p>Redditor dreamthorp <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ARC_Raiders/comments/1q35psm/neighbor_heard_me_yelling_help_in_arc_raiders/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted a 16-second clip of the incident</a> on the Arc Raiders subreddit on January 3. They said they were playing a night raid on the Dam Battlegrounds, the game's very first map. While trying to extract from an elevator, a Leaper reportedly pounced on and downed them before the elevator doors shut. "I just wanted to get stabilized so I could leave," dreamthorp said in the comments of their Reddit post. It's at this point that they started screaming, "Somebody help me."</p><p>Well, somebody did come to help. As displayed on the door's Ring camera, a concerned neighbor walked over, knocked, and asked if they were "all good." Dreamthorp screamed for help again, at which point the concerned neighbor--a firefighter, according to dreamthorp--stepped back, assumed a stance, and kicked the door in, an action that allegedly corrupted the Ring camera's file.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CultureCrave/status/2007892644694024323" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Concerned neighbor attempts to break down door as player repeatedly shouts for 'help' during an 'ARC Raiders' game 😂<br>The player gave him a six-pack of beers for trying to help out<br>(via u/dreamthorp) <a href="https://t.co/6Qpufew4ID" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/6Qpufew4ID</a></p>  — Culture Crave 🍿 (@CultureCrave) <a href="https://twitter.com/CultureCrave/status/2007892644694024323?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2026</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Dreamthorp clarified in the comments that they were house-sitting for a friend when the incident happened. The door didn't break (and if it did, they said they would've bought their friend a new door), but dreamthorp figured that "one more kick and I’m pretty sure it would’ve busted." That's even with two deadbolts locked. After their heart nearly popped out of their chest because "the door bulged like an explosion was behind it," dreamthorp then unlocked the door, laughed with the supposed firefighter neighbor, and "dapped him up." They also dropped off a six-pack of Shiner Bock beers as a thank you for his natural instinct and quick action.</p><p>The commenters on dreamthorp's post were largely divided. Some found the moment very wholesome, calling the firefighter a "good dude" and a "real bro" for acting when someone might've been in need. (In a video game, that is.) Others questioned the veracity of dreamthorp's video, with folks wondering why it didn't show the firefighter neighbor actually kicking the door in.</p><p>Dreamthorp, who claimed to be a videographer in the comments, said corrupted files happen "all the time," especially when you turn off a camera while it's recording or pull out the SD card when transferring data. Regardless, dreamthorp purported that the two "scared the ever-living sh*t out of each other" in that moment.</p><p>Arc Raiders has found itself in the hot seat lately over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-sparks-debate-over-ai-voice-acting-in-games/1100-6536146/" data-ref-id="1100-6536146">its use of artificial intelligence</a>, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-defends-use-of-ai-yet-again/1100-6537166/" data-ref-id="1100-6537166">developer Embark Studios defending the controversial technology</a> because of the "tremendous benefits" it offers players and developers.

<p>Here's a look at the full announcement post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I began thinking seriously about preparing myself to continue drawing for many years to come, I decided to leave Square Enix at the end of last year. Last year marked a major milestone with the 25th anniversary of FINAL FANTASY IX, a truly significant event, and I was deeply grateful to see so many people celebrating FFIX.</p>
<p>With the illustration work and supervision related to the 25th anniversary now complete, I feel a strong sense of accomplishment in having fulfilled the role entrusted to me. At the same time, I felt this was the right moment to draw a line under this chapter and take on new challenges.</p>
<p>From here on, I will be working as a freelance illustrator and character designer. While remaining deeply grateful for all the connections I’ve been fortunate to receive through my work so far, I hope to draw upon my experience and continue creating a wide variety of new artwork.</p>
<p>At the moment, I’m still finding my way—listening to advice and learning from senior freelance illustrators—but if you happen to come across my work somewhere, I would be truly happy if you could support me.</p>
<p>To everyone who played the games I worked on at Square Enix, and to all those I had the pleasure of working with over the years, thank you very much. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude, and I sincerely hope for your continued support in the future.</p>
<p>May this new year be an exceptionally happy one for all of you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Final Fantasy IX is currently available via the Switch eShop. Many had hoped that the 25th Anniversary would include an announcement for the long-rumoured remake, but alas, that has yet to happen.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/silksong-goty-award-steam-clair-obscur-snub-2000656667</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Millions of votes later, <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> has officially taken home Steam’s Game of the Year award for 2025. It’s the highest-profile prize yet for the excellent Metroidvania Soulslike after it repeatedly <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261">lost out to <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> at recent events like the Game Awards. The game is finally getting its much-deserved flowers just as Valve’s storefront cracked an all-time concurrent player peak to kick off 2026.</p> <p>In addition to <em>Clair Obscur</em>, <em>Silksong</em> was also up against <em>Arc Raiders</em>, <em>Dispatch</em>, and <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 </em>for Steam’s GOTY, so winning is no small feat. It’s also been the platform’s best-selling game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-was-steams-best-selling-game-over-the-holiday-period">throughout the holiday season</a> and continues to set new concurrent player records on PC. Over the weekend <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/1808500">it cracked 450,000</a>.</p>

 <p>Here are the rest of the 2025 Steam Awards winners:</p> <ul> <li>VR Game of the Year: <em><strong>The Midnight Walk </strong></em></li> <li>Labor of Love: <em><strong>Baldur’s Gate 3 </strong></em></li> <li>Best Game on Steam Deck: <em><strong>Hades 2 </strong></em></li> <li>Better with Friends: <em><strong>Peak </strong></em></li> <li>Outstanding Visual Style: <em><strong>Silent Hill f </strong></em></li> <li>Most Innovative Gameplay: <em><strong>Arc Raiders </strong></em></li> <li>Best Game You Suck At: <strong><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em></strong></li> <li>Best Soundtrack: <strong><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </em></strong></li> <li>Outstanding Story-Rich Game: <strong><em>Dispatch </em></strong></li> <li>Sit Back and Relax: <strong><em>RV There Yet</em></strong></li> </ul> <p>Are the Steam Awards, where the winners are determined entirely based on user votes, basically a popularity contest? Yes. Could you have predicted most of these winners ahead of time? Probably! But it’s also neat to see so many great games given their flowers across unique categories in which they are unquestionably very deserving of praise.</p>

 <p>The results are certainly more interesting than those at this year’s Game Awards, where <em>Clair Obscur</em> swept and<em> Silksong</em> didn’t even nab the Player’s Voice award. That went to free-to-play gacha action-RPG <em>Wuthering Waves</em>. The Steam Awards are also by far the biggest community-voted prize in gaming. Anyone with an eligible Steam account can participate and the platform recently boasted a new record player peak of 41,746,984. Is it <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/roblox/roblox-smashes-concurrent-user-record-thanks-to-war-between-two-games-3242035/">catching up to<em> Roblox</em></a> any time soon? Doubtful. But it’s good news for everyone trying to actually make and sell games on Valve’s storefront.</p>

      <p>As of last summer, there were only <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/19/nx-s1-5476267/the-number-of-shakers-in-the-u-s-rises-to-3?ref=aftermath.site"><u>three Shakers</u></a> left, up from a more recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/magazine/shakers-utopia.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>two</u></a> but down from thousands in the religion’s height in the mid-1800s. Plenty of movements from that time have since died out, but the Shakers face a particular uphill battle given their commitment to celibacy, meaning they can’t just make a new generation of Shakers. The movement once grew through conversion and adopting children, but these days, few people want to live the Shaker life of communal austerity and hard work. But what feels outdated and even conservative today was once a radical break with the status quo, and it’s that perspective that the quasi-musical, quasi-biopic <em>The Testament of Ann Lee</em> viscerally captures.</p><p>The film stars Amanda Seyfried as the titular Ann Lee, a religiously-minded child in England who falls in with a group of “shaking Quakers,” later known as Shakers. Ann marries a neglectful husband and loses four children in infancy, and this drives her closer to the group and into the belief that sex is mankind’s ultimate sin and needs to be renounced. She comes to see herself as the second coming of Christ in female form, and as “Mother Ann” leads a small group of Shakers to America, where their unusual physical worship style and credo of “hands to work, hearts to God” spread throughout the country alongside other utopian movements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-zK_nzG36mk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="THE TESTAMENT OF ANN LEE | Official Teaser | Searchlight Pictures"></iframe></figure><p>The movie hews <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2025/12/testament-of-ann-lee-movie-shakers-true-story.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>fairly close</u></a> to what’s known of the actual life of Mother Ann, which has mostly been passed down through her adherents. (In a move that drives this home, the story is narrated by one of her followers.) The first half, before the group moves to America, is harsh and arresting; their worship moves in and out of intentional choreography and chaotic twitching, and composer <a href="https://www.avclub.com/cinemusic-daniel-blumberg-the-testament-of-ann-lee?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Daniel Blumberg</u></a> rearranges Shaker spirituals to include instruments or writes his own songs. <em>The Testament of Ann Lee</em> isn’t quite a musical, in that songs don’t happen at the peak of emotion; instead, song and dance weave themselves into both worship and narrative and then fade away, keeping the viewer off-balance and contributing to the sense of the Shaker movement as strange and otherworldly. Before seeing the movie, I’d <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3m4xuo5ta3c2g?ref=aftermath.site"><u>made fun of a teaser trailer quote</u></a> that called it “fearlessly feral,” but I get it now: For a movie about a religion devoted to celibacy, the whole thing is carnal and sexual, as the film’s young, attractive cast shakes and writhes to the Shakers’ distinctive music and Blumberg’s strange, creative arrangements.&nbsp;</p><p>It would be easy to fall into reductiveness here–Ann Lee was burned by sex, so she started a religion to rebuke it–and while <em>Testament</em>’s loose structure keeps it from coming to any kind of conclusion that would disappointingly drive that idea home, the film feels like it has more to say about sex than it does faith. Things lose focus and intensity once the group moves to America and builds its first commune in upstate New York. The passion that moves the group’s worship or its clashes with suspicious outsiders and societal institutions is largely absent once the community is on its own, and Seyfried never quite feels as convincing talking about God as she does defending the Shakers from the rest of the world. There are beautiful shots of the woods and of Shaker handicrafts and architecture, and a lovely montage of Shaker life set to a weird, moody arrangement of “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8Ko8aYr83U&amp;list=PLiGi2vh90YNkqyw6poDmKKHIj5kMHYFgf&amp;index=14&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>I Love Mother</u></a>,” but <em>Testament </em>becomes a bit adrift in the space between the group’s arrival in America and Mother Ann’s ultimate death.&nbsp;</p><p>While it might falter as a narrative, the music is what carries the movie through, and the way the arrangements and dance try to portray a specific feeling of Shaker worship. The film’s best intensity and emotion is here, and it’s here that it does the most with its subject matter. I’m a huge fan of Shaker spirituals and their <a href="https://www.americanmusicpreservation.com/simplicityofshakermusic.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u>unique musical structure</u></a>, and while I never think they’re improved by adding instrumentation, Blumberg’s bells and electric guitars and choruses make them feel otherworldly, not quite rock music and not quite worship songs. He turns “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN3jCMMZyxw&amp;list=PLiGi2vh90YNkqyw6poDmKKHIj5kMHYFgf&amp;index=2&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>I Hunger and Thirst</u></a>” into a moment that could be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlWVcKcqC3U&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>at home in any musical</u></a>; he turns “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hn9J7ykHGE&amp;list=RD9Hn9J7ykHGE&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Beautiful Treasure</u></a>” into something like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7aQW-8W5N9Q?ref=aftermath.site"><u>sad lounge number</u></a>. The plain language of Shaker songs, like many hymns of their day, have always stuck with me; unlike so much <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/god-gave-rock-and-roll-to-you-9780197555248?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>modern worship music</u></a> that seems to want to feel relatable to secular life, Shaker songs are so clearly about religious longing and the Shakers’ communal life, an honesty and intimacy that has kept them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv6nJM-C4P0&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>relevant</u></a> even as the movement itself has faded. They become something new here, but they still long so strongly for something other than this world, and this conveys the passion of faith in a way the film’s script doesn’t. I loved the way familiar-to-me refrains weaved in and out of the movie’s soundtrack, even if it was missing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdTFYETY5D4&amp;list=RDmdTFYETY5D4&amp;start_radio=1&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>some</u></a> of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8yXzjhQ0Zk&amp;list=PLiGi2vh90YNkqyw6poDmKKHIj5kMHYFgf&amp;index=3&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>my favorites</u></a> and, perhaps wisely, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZaTHJSUXqs&amp;list=PLiGi2vh90YNkqyw6poDmKKHIj5kMHYFgf&amp;index=9&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>better-known songs</u></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yDQmkyn6Xdk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="THE TESTAMENT OF ANN LEE | Agony &amp; Ecstasy: The Music &amp; Movement of Ann Lee | Searchlight Pictures"></iframe></figure><p>Likewise, <em>Testament</em>’s choreography grabs at what was so shocking and threatening about the early days of the Shaker movement. Shaker dance <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/history-of-the-shakers.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u>changed over time</u></a>, becoming more structured and eventually <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Shakers?ref=aftermath.site#ref459031"><u>fading away</u></a> altogether. Choreographer Celia Rowlson-Hall turns what we might today think of as old-timey dances into something aggressive and passionate, and in doing so, as Blumberg does with the music, expresses something challenging and even frightening about religious faith.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CLVGLPr1G1I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="THE TESTAMENT OF ANN LEE | &quot;All is Summer” Song Clip | Searchlight Pictures"></iframe></figure><p><em>Testament</em> doesn’t attempt to sum the Shakers up, or make a pitch for revitalizing the faith. The strange structure of the whole film, and the way the story just sort of <em>happens</em>, paints a picture of the flow of religious movements during the Shakers’ time, when new faith movements sprung up by the dozens in an effort to revamp not just religious institutions, but <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/220839/paradise-now-by-chris-jennings/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>society</u></a> as a whole. People tried to take life in new directions, directed their hopes and fears toward something bigger than themselves, and those things arose and fell away and new things took their place. The beliefs that mean the most to us, that can seem world-altering, become <a href="https://aftermath.site/death-by-lightning-knows-history-is-temporary/"><u>lost to history</u></a> or woven into it, and radical movements can become quaint oddities as time marches on.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lhc9PK2tG5k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Shaker Music &amp; Dance - Hancock Shaker Village"></iframe></figure><p><em>Testament</em>’s greatest strength, then, is expressing how Shakerism might have <em>felt</em> back then, the disruptive potential of its beliefs, worship, and way of life. The way its music and choreography aren’t separate from the story, and the way it infuses them with modern aesthetics, tells a story that feels new and weird in the current landscape of film in a way similar to how the movement itself would have felt in its society. Even as it stumbles in the space between the secular and the spiritual, it gets at something radical and true. &nbsp; </p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/pope-conclave-memes/"><div><p>Conclave Fandom Is The Religious Left - Aftermath</p><p>Pope fever sweeps nation</p><p><span>Riley MacLeod</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>CES 2026 is here, and Nvidia is set to reveal its latest major update to its Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology with DLSS 4.5.</p>



<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-dlss-4-5-to-feature-2nd-gen-transformer-model-and-dynamic-6x-frame-generation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Videocardz</a>, DLSS 4.5 will feature “changes centered on Super Resolution and a new ‘Dynamic Multi Frame Generation’ path”.</p>







<p>With Super Resolution, Nvidia is moving to a “2nd generation transformer” model that will cover more failure cases while using larger datasets. The goal of the updated technology is to offer “better temporal stability, less ghosting, and cleaner anti-aliasing”. Regarding Dynamic Multi Frame Generation, users will see three-to-six times more frames, depending on their settings. </p>



<p>DLSS 4.5 will be available through the Nvidia app, and will have day-one launch support for a number of games. The Dynamic Multi Frame Generation, however, is coming later on. </p>



<p><strong>“Nvidia also says that users will be able to set a target FPS in the app up to the display’s maximum refresh rate, with the feature dynamically adjusting how many frames are generated to meet that goal,”</strong> the report says.</p>







<p>DLSS 4.5 Super Resolution will be available for all GeForce RTX GPUs from the 20 series through 50 and beyond. That said, the new frame generation features are available exclusively for RTX 50 graphics cards, and will be available in Spring 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Sales Estimate Hits 12 MILLION As New Peak Player Record Looms]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-sales-estimate-hits-12-million/</link>
            <guid>1397356</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders is proving to be the gift that keeps on giving. In the last 24 hours, at the time of writing, the game soared to a peak player count of 466,372 users on Steam. That’s ever-so-slightly behind the all-time peak of 481,000 secured just after launch in November 2025.</p>



<p>In a recent data-driven estimation, it was claimed that ARC Raiders might have surpassed <strong>12 million sales</strong> in just over two months, a whopping 53.5% of which have landed on <strong>Steam</strong>. It was also claimed that the game is enjoying a daily active user count of a staggering 3.2 million gamers.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-continues-to-shatter-expectations">ARC Raiders Continues To Shatter Expectations</h2>



<p>When ARC Raiders was released on October 30, no one thought it would reach such lofty heights. It has become known as one of the (if not <strong>the</strong>) best extraction games ever made. The accessibility of the game has introduced millions of extraction novices to a genre previously populated almost exclusively by crushing and challenging titles.</p>



<p>Things have changed, and ARC Raiders is here not just to stay, but to evolve.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In a recent post on social media, Alinea Analytics’ Rhys Elliot <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/superhys.bsky.social/post/3mbocqp3vzc2w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published a graphic</a> showcasing some pretty stellar figures.</p>



<p>First, it was estimated that ARC Raiders now sits at a total sales count of 12 million units across Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox. It has made Embark Studios around $350 million, and it enjoys a daily active user count of 3.2 million players.</p>



<p>It was theorized that a sizeable discount over the festive period, a 20% price reduction, drove additional sales through December. The arrival of Cold Snap, the Flickering Flames event, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-second-expedition-window-confirmed/">first Expedition Project</a>, and a new Raider Deck all combined forces to welcome back stacks of players to the game that <strong>some </strong>thought was starting to slow down.</p>



<p>Far from it, though. Embark Studios has a stunning amount of content in the pipeline and is only just getting started with ARC Raiders. This post-apocalyptic extraction adventure title has legs that stretch on ad infinitum, and it’s easy to see why the developer originally pledged to support the game for ‘years to come’.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Code Vein 2: The Final Preview]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/code-vein-2-the-final-preview</link>
            <guid>1397353</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">“Anime Souls” is a term often used to describe the original Code Vein. And while that is a very simple but fair descriptor – it is after all one of the very few soulslike games with an undeniably anime aesthetic – it also doesn’t really describe what was <em>actually </em>cool about the 2019 action RPG. For instance: the emotional storylines of your companion characters, delivered in these excellent sequences where you relive their most tragic memories; the phenomenal score by the wonderful Go Shiina; the flexible Blood Code system that allowed players to switch up their stats and playstyle without having to respect their whole character while also being able to pick and choose skills from other “classes.” There was certainly room for improvement in the core combat and level design, but it had great ideas, and would benefit from some refinement and iteration.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s what Code Vein 2 seems to be all about: Refinement and iteration. Based on the three or so hours that I’ve played, Code Vein 2 felt familiar, but altogether much more confident and focused on the strengths of the original, while also getting off to an immediately more interesting start thanks to a brand new story with some intriguing time travel twists. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the first game, at the heart of Code Vein 2’s plot is a catastrophe that occurred many, many years ago. This time around, it’s known as the Resurgence, a calamity that corrupted everything it touched and gave rise to a new being known as a Revenant. Somehow, the Revenants managed to seal the Resurgence, but the victory was short-lived, as soon after, the Resurgence… well, surged again. This led to a battle that became known as the Upheaval, in which several heroes gave their lives to seal the Resurgence once again. One hundred years later, that seal is weakening, causing existence-erasing explosions all over the world, and this time, the means to save everything exists not in the present, but in the past. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And thus the stage is set for Code Vein 2’s time-hopping story that sees the nameless protagonist teaming up with Lou Magmell, a Revenant with the power to jump back and forth through time as they link up with the heroes of the past to try and find a way to stop the imminent world-ending threats of the future.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a pretty good hook! As someone who never really got invested in the world of Code Vein 1, outside of learning more about my companions, I was pretty happy that I was immediately invested this time around. I looked forward to seeing how the heroes of the past fought back against the Resurgence and what ultimately brought about their fates. I got a chance to ask Code Vein 2’s director, Hiroshi Yoshimura, if he looked to any specific sources of inspiration with regards to their interpretation of time travel, or the rules that govern it, and he said, “I wouldn’t say there’s one film or work in particular, but one golden rule that we had within the development was that once the player has observed or seen something happen within the game, then that becomes truth, or that becomes locked in the sense that it can’t be overturned.” </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Thicker Than Blood</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">On the gameplay side of things, much of the core of Code Vein 1 is still intact in the sequel. It’s still a stamina-governed combat system with a big focus on special abilities tied to various Blood Codes, which essentially determine your class or playstyle. Switching to a new Blood Code changes your stats, defense, and your max Ichor, which is essentially the mana that powers your special abilities. One of the interesting new twists of Blood Codes is that they also now come with a series of traits that can dramatically affect how you approach combat. For example, traditionally, the way combat works is you attack an enemy to inflict stacks of bleed, and then use a special technique known as a jail attack (previously known as “Drain Attacks”) to collect that blood, which then gets converted into the Ichor that you use to use your special skills.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Pretty much every aspect of Code Vein 2's combat is more customizable than before. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But if that doesn’t sound like your style of play, you could instead use Josée’s Blood Code, which lets you gain Ichor simply by attacking, but that boon comes with a catch. If you gain more than your maximum Ichor, you take a significant chunk of damage. This was my preferred method of play, as it meant that I didn’t have to fish for opportunities to use my jail attacks to regain my Ichor, and it helped me be extra vigilant about using my abilities regularly so I didn’t end up overflowing with Ichor. Of course, my attention would occasionally wane, and this would occasionally be the death of me, but regardless, I appreciated the added twist to the gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, pretty much every aspect of Code Vein 2’s combat is more customizable than before. While Drain Attacks used to be tied to your Blood Codes, they’re now got their own equippable slot in your inventory, and there are a ton of different types. You’ve got the returning Ogre claw for a fast and short ranged option; Hounds for a powerful two-hitting mid-range attack; Stinger to nail enemies from afar; and then you’ve got a handful of completely new attacks like Ivy, which caused spikes to emerge from the ground and can be placed by charging the attack and moving the targeting circle; Bat, which causes you to grow wings and sends out a swarm of bats, and Reaper, which is a scythe that can be swung around to hit enemies in an AOE.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to Jails, you can also equip powerful subweapons known as Bequeathed Formae, and you can also choose a Defensive Formae as well.. With regards to the Bequeathed Formae, I only got to see two of these in my demo: a Battle Axe known as Idris’s Conceit, and a Longbow called Statesman’s Longbow. I opted more for a strength build throughout most of my demo time, so I primarily used the Battle Axe, and it certainly was a difference- maker in fights where I would get swarmed by enemies. All I needed to do was create some space to account for the lengthy windup, and boom. Once it hit, it would create a temporal field that slowed everything down, making it easy to clean up the survivors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the Defensive Formae, you’re able to basically choose whether you want a standard block, a parry, or a dodge, with a couple of others thrown in there with some slight differences in how they perform. Im a huge fan of all these changes, as they allow even finer tuning of a build to your personal preference without becoming too overwhelming or complicated. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Big Question</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most common things that always gets discussed anytime there’s a new soulslike in town is how difficult it is, so let’s talk about it. For the most part, I got through this demo without much issue. Granted, this was a provided save, so it’s hard to say how things would have been if I got to this point on my own playthrough with my own loadout, but Bandai Namco was very generous in giving us a wide selection of weapons, Blood Codes, and jails, and I never felt like I was particularly under- or overlevelled. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Code Vein 2 also smartly lets you decide on whether you want your companion to follow you and participate in combat like an AI coop partner, or whether you’d prefer to have them be assimilated into you, providing you with specific buffs, but without giving you the benefit of another body to deal damage or distract enemies. It’s a great trade-off that allows Code Vein 2 to maintain the companion element that makes it such a distinct soulslike in the first place, while also allowing players who enjoy tackling these challenges as a solo player to do so without feeling like they’re being severely punished.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Where the difficulty really turned up several notches was in the two boss battles that I got to experience.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Where the difficulty really turned up several notches was in the two boss battles that I got to experience. These were true tests of skills and reflexes and took nearly half of my allotted three hours of playtime, and that’s without even delivering the final blow against the second one. The first boss could simply wipe out my health with just one or two hits, while also afflicting me with the acid status effect, which would deal damage over time. My windows to punish were very small, making me opt for a strength-oriented build so I could land a powerful and chargeable overhead slash with my greatsword to make the most out of those opportunities. Eventually, I prevailed, only to be hard stuck against the second boss. This boss was fast, had an extremely dangerous second phase that I didn’t get to see enough of to really learn its new attacks, and had the nasty habit of electrifying the floor and inflicting bind on me, which would paralyze me long enough for the boss to land another free attack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the difficulty spike, I loved both these encounters, and while I'm a bit salty that I couldn’t finish the job at the preview event, I’m looking forward to the runback once I get the full game in my hands and can attempt the boss with my own personal build. Overall, Code Vein 2 is shaping up to be a marked improvement over the original in just about every area. We’ll see if Bandai Namco is able to stick the landing when this soulslike sequel releases on January 30, 2026 for PlayStation 5,  Xbox Series X|S, and PC. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Mitchell Saltzman is an editorial producer at IGN.

            <p>Toshiyuki Itahana, character artist for the Final Fantasy series, including games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy 9</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-crystal-chronicles">Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>: Dawntrail, has left <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://note.com/itahana/n/n277aa9cc7148?sub_rt=share_pb">Writing to fans online</a>,  Itahana expressed that he decided to leave Square Enix last year after the 25th anniversary of the Final Fantasy series, feeling both "a strong sense of accomplishment" and that it was the "right moment" to move on.</p>
<p>Itahana revealed in the same post that he intends to move forward as a freelance illustrator and character designer, stating he's currently learning from senior freelance illustrators as well as asking fans of his to support him moving forward.</p>

<p>Itahana concluded the message by thanking fans who experienced his work so far, writing: "To everyone who played the games I worked on at Square Enix, and to all those I had the pleasure of working with over the years, thank you very much. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude, and I sincerely hope for your continued support in the future."</p><p>It's certainly an interesting time for the Final Fantasy franchise. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-major-shareholder-fundamental-reassessment-final-fantasy-future">Not only have major shareholders recently urged for a reassessment of the series</a>, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-do-you-want-to-happen-to-the-final-fantasy-franchise-youve-got-a-few-days-to-tell-square-enix-directly">Square Enix is asking fans directly what they want to see with Final Fantasy moving forward</a>. We may be in the verge of an era of great change with the series, who can say.</p>
<p>Regardless, with Itahana's departure Square Enix is waving goodbye to one of its most beloved artists. One that's likely to get a lot of work as a freelance in the future.</p>

            <guid>1397335</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It’s December 2025 in Los Angeles. Players are furiously posting on ResetERA or Reddit about what bonkers predictions will show up at The Game Awards: will Phantom Blade 0 get a release date, will Geoff bring up a Muppet or Kojima onto the stage first, and what the hell is that monolith in the Mojave Desert all about? Before any of that took place, Wccftech was invited out along with a core group of fellow Soulslike-experienced journalists and content creators to visit Bandai Namco for an all-day preview event, going hands-on with Code Vein II for the very first time.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Code-Vein-II-Character-Creation.png"></a></figure>



<p>Despite the obvious sequel numbering in its moniker, Bandai Namco Studios and Shift reiterated multiple times that this is intended to be its own standalone story from the first game, and no prior experience from the original game is required. Of course, with Code Vein II set to launch at the end of January, that’s plenty of time to dive into the original game on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, or PC.</p>



<p>In the first <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/678960/CODE_VEIN">Code Vein</a>, players assumed the role of a Revenant, an artificially-made vampire who requires some form of blood to sustain and maintain any sort of bloodthirst and cravings (Blood Beads being the most common way to satisfy those cravings without needing to seek out a human donor. Those same Revenants are being transformed into Horrors in the numbered sequel, necessitating the player in this new title to become a Revenant Hunter instead.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Code-Vein-II-Visit-the-Past.png"></a></figure>



<p>The core theme to Code Vein II is a future that’s not set in stone. While the first game was about continuing on a linear path and the occasional dive into the player’s memories to view events in the past, Code Vein II is largely about changing the past to affect the present. The story opens with a cutscene telling the tale of a great Upheaval and four heroes that sacrificed themselves to seal away calamity through something called the Luna Rapacis. In order to enact great change in a world that’s already on the brink of further extinction, the hands-on session focused on venturing into the past to destroy one of these seals.</p>



<p>Despite the role reversal between the hunter and the hunted, many core themes that gave Code Vein a unique sense of combat are present here in <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-announced-with-new-cinematic-trailer-launches-in-2026-on-pc-and-consoles/">Code Vein II</a>. Players still don’t have to venture into the dungeons of the world alone and are instead accompanied by an NPC to complement a player’s chosen gameplay style. Of course, there is the ability to absorb that NPC into yourself for several statistical buffs, but even against the bosses of Code Vein II, I found having that extra body helped, especially when it comes to keeping the enemy distracted while I charged up a hefty hammer swing.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Code-Vein-II-Slash.png"></a></figure>



<p>Defensive tech works a bit differently in Code Vein II than what players might expect. It all comes down to the defensive forma that players equip and set to the L1 button. One allows for blocking, another allows for timed parries. They’re each situational, but with enemy attacks being well telegraphed, the parry forma should be the perfect fit for Soulslike veterans.</p>



<p>On the other hand, combat skills and weapon forma are much like their counterparts from the first game. Players can set a palette of four different weapon skills between active attacks and passive temporary boosts, each with their own resource cost. Attacking and using a special drain attack both recharge this resource, allowing players to pull off vicious combos if they’ve accumulated enough stocked resources.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Code-Vein-II-Levelup.png"></a></figure>



<p>Leveling up has been simplified for the player's view in Code Vein II. Each level-up gives players a modest boost of HP, Stamina, and Attack, with the majority of other stats coming by way of the equipped Blood Code and boosters. This is where the real versatility in character builds comes into pla,y and tracking down a specific Blood Code will be necessary to optimize the player’s build depending on their chosen weapon type and form of engagement. It’s these Blood Codes that give players six different stats (Strength, Dexterity, Mind, Willpower, Vitality, and Fortitude), with equipped gear requiring enough of a particular stat to be wielded effectively without placing a Burden upon the player if they go over one of these thresholds. Take Strength for example; if your gear is too heavy or you picked a massive hammer to go with a more nimble Blood Code, the burden placed on the character is twofold: your attacks will deal more damage, but you’ll also consume more stamina for these attacks if you swing and miss the target completely.</p>



<p>Heft is something that I found the original Code Vein was lacking, as with Shift Inc.’s earlier works with the God Eater franchise. In those games, it didn’t matter how massive a metal tool your character was wielding: the visual impact and weight to strikes felt next to nothing, and the enemy reactions never quite matched up with what one would expect from being struck by a forty-kilogram chunk of solid iron. In this numbered sequel, I felt proud to be picking up a hammer and knocking the ever-living daylights of whatever stood in my way. Charged attacks both feel and deal the amount of damage one would expect, compared to a much lighter and more nimble single-handed weapon.</p>

<p>While Code Vein II does away with the traditional multiplayer (meaning no summoning players to join in if you’re stuck on a particular encounter), the Partner system from the first game has been brought back, giving players a better fighting chance. Much like the first game, these fellow Hunters will complement the player’s given style, providing unique active/passive boons depending on who you pick to accompany you. There is also a system to “absorb” the Partner, forcing the player to venture off solo but with an additional set of unique boons. Partners also serve as a sort of second life for the player. Take enough damage and go down, and your Partner will automatically get you back on your feet, albeit at the cost of some of their own life and a recharge timer. Die a second time before your Partner has a chance to recover, and you’re dead for good, dropping your collected Haze on the ground and respawning at the last checkpoint.</p>



<p>I can’t speak definitively to the level design in Code Vein II quite yet, but I was a fan of the first game’s looping paths and recursive design, where shortcuts found often cut down on large chunks of time spent navigating through decrepit or horrific dungeons. There was the occasional branching path and secret stash of loot, so the exploration spirit in me will be eager to see just what secrets lie in the past to uncover.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Code-Vein-II-Demo-Announcement.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Code Vein II launches on January 30th, 2026, but players eager to step into the shoes of a Revenant Hunter or invest hours in the character creator will have their chance to rewrite history with a public demo launching on January 23rd.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>[Editor’s Note: Code Vein II was previewed on the PlayStation 5 Pro. Travel and accommodations was provided by Bandai Namco for this preview event.]</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Toshiyuki Itahana, the man behind <em>Final Fantasy IX</em>'s iconic character designs, has departed Square Enix in order to become a freelance artist and illustrator.</p><p>In <a href="https://note.com/itahana/n/n277aa9cc7148" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">a post on Japanese platform Note</a> (which is in both Japanese and English and which was spotted by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/toshiyuki-itahana-ffix-character-designer-has-left-square-enix.1397110/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">ResetEra user Xenosaga</a>), Itahana says he left Square Enix following a period of "thinking seriously about preparing [himself] to continue drawing for many years to come". His departure actually came at the end of 2025.</p><p>Itahana goes on to say that while he feels "deeply grateful" towards those who celebrated <em>Final Fantasy IX</em> for the JRPG's 25th anniversary last year, completing the "illustration work and supervision" for the occasion led him to "draw a line under this chapter and take on new challenges".</p><figure role="group">

<p>In conclusion to his post, Itahana says he's hoping to "continue creating a wide variety of new artwork" as a freelancer and expresses his "heartfelt gratitude" to former colleagues both at Square Enix and elsewhere.</p><p>As well as <em>Final Fantasy IX</em>, Itahana has worked on a number of other Square Enix projects, including the likes of <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>'s <em>Dawntrail </em>expansion, where he provided character concept art (but nothing beyond that, so I <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review-inconsistent-vacation" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d75083ba-0c32-43b2-b2b6-430355d89eb0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">won't blame <em>Dawntrail </em>on him</a>).</p><p>He's also worked on the <em>Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles </em>games, as well as projects like <em>Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/chocobo-gp" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="979e8964-98c5-46aa-9190-d7479f9d3832" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">2022 racer <em>Chocobo GP</em></a>.

It is, of course, still possible that the project is on the way, but the 25th anniversary would have been the perfect time to reveal it if so. I wouldn't hold my breath, personally.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what lies in Itahana's future, but whatever it is, it'll probably be outside of Square Enix's purview. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>You know, to some degree, I gotta feel for the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-reaction-byler-acting-2000656424"><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>creators</span></a><span>. Matt and Ross Duffer just wrapped up a decade-long streaming phenomenon that has certainly received a fair bit of praise from critics and fans over the years but, with its finale, has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-coming-out-scene-will-byers-season-5-2000655961"><span>absolutely flopped in the eyes of some very loud viewers</span></a><span> who weren’t pleased with how the show wrapped up. And now those creators have to do a press tour in which everything they say is picked apart by people ready to tear them to shreds for a final season they feel didn’t land. So I guess it’s not too surprising that Matt Duffer maybe regrets doing postmortem interviews at all, though I’m surprised he said that out loud and on the record.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoyIdbhGg-E"><span>Josh Horowitz</span></a><span>, both Duffers talked for about an hour about the </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>finale, and at roughly the 25-minute mark, while the two are talking about soliciting input from actors about how they saw their characters ending up, , Matt asks, “Did Maya (Hawke) want to die, Ross, or am I making that up?” to which Ross responds that he might be making that up. Horowitz asks why he would have fabricated such a thing, and then Matt admits that he’s not been happy with how these interviews have been going, saying his brain is “fried.”</span></p>

  <p><span>“I really shouldn’t have done any of these postmortem interviews,” he said. “I’m not in a good place. Like, why the hell we did any of them yesterday is beyond me. I’m like, fried. I’m getting over the flu, you know. So anyone mad at any answers we gave yesterday, just give me a break. cut me some slack.”</span></p>

 <p><span>I get it. As someone who has interviewed many creatives who are dealing with an onslaught of questions from several journalists in rapid succession, I know it can be exhausting work. At a certain point it’s entirely possible that the mental spend becomes enough of a burden, you start being less practiced with your responses. And given the nature of </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>and the fandom around it, the interviews the Duffers have been doing have spent a lot of time on fan theories and unanswered questions, with the Duffer brothers readily handing out answers.</span></p>

 <p><span>Unsatisfied fans are hanging onto these interviews as if they’re going to possibly </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-5-bad-dialogue-clips-video-will-mike-2000651378"><span>redeem </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i></a><span> or at least give them closure on some threads the show seemed incapable or unwilling to make good on. Several of the interviews the two have given since the show ended have only stirred the pot further, and some fans are hopping on Matt Duffer’s comments and interpreting them as just the latest evidence that they are justified in feeling that the bros didn’t approach the finale with the proper care and forethought.</span></p>

              <p>New year, fresh start. You’ve tired of breathing potentially unclean air at home? You don’t have to resign yourself to a life of allergens and pollen and dust, not on our watch. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6664/">Amazon has reduced the price of the BLUEAIR Air Purifiers to $159.99, from its original price of $229.99.</a> This is a $70 discount, or approximately a 30% savings.</p>
<p>BLUEAIR Air Purifiers can help you remove pollen, pet dander, smoke and many other airborne particles through its HEPA filtration system. It’s the perfect home option for getting rid of all those pesky allergens in your house that make you wake up sniffling, affect your asthma, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6664/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>An air purifier that takes cleaning your air seriously</h2>
<p>This particular unit goes way beyond the ones you’d find at stores like Target or Walmart, with a markedly improved filtration system that can get down to the nitty gritty and rid small to large areas of those little nasties you’re breathing in every day.</p>
<p>Plus, replacing the filter is super simple. When it is time to replace the filter, the unit alerts you so you can easily replace it. Replacing the filter regularly keeps the unit performing optimally by allowing the air purifier to continue to draw in particles efficiently.</p>



<p>If you’re running one of these air purifiers, you can feel a bit better about doing your part to breathe easily and not worry about doing much harm to the environment. There are several ways having unclean air in your home can adversely affect your health, from dredging up asthma issues you might not be aware you have to aggravating sicknesses that could be floating around.</p>
<p>You may not realize it, but there are so many particulates floating around at any time in your home that it can be difficult to cleanse everything. It’s a good idea to do so, however, as breathing in pathogens, allergens, and even pet dander is hard on the respiratory system. You also never know what kind of potential germs are floating around your home, possibly getting you sick.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Highguard Could Be Dead on Arrival as Gamers Fear a Flop is Inbound]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-dead-on-arrival-gamers-fear-a-flop/</link>
            <guid>1397323</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It was always going to be tough for Highguard to succeed after the anticlimactic reveal it experienced during December’s The Game Awards ceremony. Many millions of viewers sat through hours of trailers and speeches to see what the ‘final reveal’ would be, and then Highguard graced screens worldwide, falling somewhat flat and leaving gamers disappointed.</p>



<p>Highguard is a new PvP shooter from former Apex Legends and Titanfall developers, and it’s set to drop in just <strong>three weeks</strong>. Aside from the prestigious trailer spot at The Game Awards, almost nothing has been shown, revealed, or discussed regarding the game that many have dubbed ‘Concord 2’.</p>



<p>Is Highguard going to be dead on arrival? The consensus isn’t looking good.</p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-has-already-drawn-negative-impressions">Highguard Has Already Drawn Negative Impressions</h2>



<p>Highguard took up the most anticipated trailer spot at The Game Awards, but it might have blown back on Wildlight, the game’s developer. It has already been labelled DOA by many owing to an almost complete lack of marketing, a slew of negative first impressions, and a mishandled reveal that didn’t inspire much confidence.</p>



<p>It was unexpected, but ultimately it’s just another live-service hero shooter that was too quickly compared to titles like VALORANT, Overwatch, and yes, Concord, the ill-fated PlayStation shooter that was so bad <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-shut-down-by-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it killed an entire studio</a>.</p>



<p>Many were left bewildered by the cacophonic trailer that didn’t explain much. It was a visual showcase, revealing players scooting across maps on the backs of horses and bears while wielding swords, magic, and assault rifles, all in a bid to resolve classic first-person shooter arena modes set in destructible maps.</p>



<p>There’s so much going on there, it’s unreal.</p>



<p>That’s one of the first failures of Highguard – it’s trying to be so unique while taking inspiration from many other games, that it has spawned with a twisted, hard-to-place identity that gets lost in the complexity of it all.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Highguard | Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9v_z7SmcUUE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-track-record">Track Record</h2>



<p>The hero shooter and live-service FPS space is overcrowded and bursting at the seams with recent failures. Players are arguably fatigued by now, and Highguard’s reveal just failed to convince them that it brings anything <strong>new </strong>to the table, despite Geoff Keighley’s attempt to hype the game up at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a>.</p>



<p>Right now, the most glaring red flag is the radio silence and lack of marketing for Highguard. It’s coming out in just <strong>three weeks </strong>and has no major marketing beats, no influencer previews or campaigns lined up, and absolutely no social media momentum.</p>



<p>On Steam, the game boasts <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">just <strong>7,460 followers</strong></a><strong> </strong>at the time of writing, which is a pinprick in the userbase compared to other, similar titles. It echoes Concord, which only had a few thousand before it launched in August 2024.</p>



<p>Even a cursory glance at Highguard on search engine trend platforms reveals nobody is curious about the title.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The official channel uploaded the game’s inaugural trailer on December 12, and it has garnered just 90,000 views at the time of writing. It has an overwhelmingly negative like-to-dislike ratio (89% disliked). IGN managed to get 400,000 views on the same trailer, but that came with a 92% count of dislikes and an alarming number of negative comments:</p>



<ul>
<li>‘ChatGPT, generate a hero shooter with fantasy elements.’</li>



<li>‘This was outdated when the developer first imagined it.’</li>



<li>‘Oh God, I thought people were joking. It actually does look like Concord.’</li>
</ul>



<p>The game’s<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HighGuardgame/comments/1q27yex/what_are_you_playign_with_23_days_to_go_for/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> fan-created subreddit</a> has just 113 members, and on there, most of the posts concern questions about the lack of updates from the developers. One user wrote, ‘Either the devs are stupid, or this game is getting delayed.’</p>



<p>It might boil down to the backlash being more emotional than anything else, as many have written the game off without a) seeing raw gameplay, and b) without trying it out for a single second. Perception is reality in gaming, but the community is firmly unconvinced, and that might drive prospective users away without giving this free-to-play shooter even a first glance.</p>



<p>Unless Wildlight Entertainment pulls off a rapid and aggressive marketing campaign to compel users to invest, the narrative of Highguard being dead on arrival might be a prophetic one.</p>



<p>Let’s just hope they didn’t spend too much on The Game Awards ad spot.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Hytale on PlayStation 5 & Xbox Series X|S? All Platforms, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-platforms-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The long wait for Hytale is rapidly approaching a conclusion, but not every player around the world will be able to dive in immediately due to platform restrictions.</p>



<p>Hytale’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early access release is set for January 13</a>, which marks the start of a long development journey before the full release of the game, and there are plenty of hurdles to overcome.</p>



<p>If you want to know what platforms Hytale can be played on, this Insider Gaming guide has all the details you need.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-hytale-on-playstation-5">Is Hytale on PlayStation 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Long wait. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Hytale is not available for PlayStation 5 and launches as a PC early access exclusive. However, there are plans to expand to other platforms in the future.</strong></p>



<p>While no specific consoles were mentioned, executive director Patrick ‘Lyall’ Derbic <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-skipping-steam-initially-to-avoid-negative-reviews-console-launch-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed plans for a console release</a> in future, but that it would likely come after the early access period has concluded.</p>



<p>There is no indication of how long the early access period for Hytale will last, and it likely depends on the development process and will be subject to change, so expect a pretty long wait before you can play the title on PlayStation.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-hytale-on-xbox-series-x-s">Is Hytale on Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>No, as Hytale launches as a PC early access exclusive, the game is not available on Xbox Series X|S. However, Hypixel Studios plans to bring the game to other platforms in the future.</strong></p>



<p>Confirmation of plans for a console release came ahead of the start of early access, though it was stated it would not arrive during that period. Instead, Xbox players will have to wait until the full release of Hytale, at the earliest, before the game can be played on the Microsoft consoles.</p>



<p>Given there’s no indication of how long early access will last, the game could skip Xbox Series X|S entirely and instead launch on the next generation of consoles.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-hytale-on-nintendo-switch-2">Is Hytale on Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>No, Hytale is not available on Nintendo Switch 2, as it is a PC early access exclusive, and while there are plans to expand to additional platforms, it’s not clear yet whether that includes Nintendo Switch 2.</strong></p>



<p>While plans for a release on other platforms are confirmed, Nintendo Switch 2 is slightly different due to the system requirements, although Nintendo did make huge strides to lessen the gap between the console and its rivals with the Switch 2, as shown by the likes of Cyberpunk 2077 releasing on the platform.</p>



<p>There’s no guarantee Hytale will arrive on the console, however, and a priority would likely be to bring the game to Xbox and PlayStation first, especially if a release on Nintendo Switch 2 requires detailed attention.</p>

                <p>Arc Raiders was a breakout hit in 2025, and it's still growing. New data from <a href="https://x.com/superhys/status/2008134792043458724" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Alinea Analytics</a> states that the game enjoyed its biggest day ever on Sunday, January 4, when it came to daily active users.</p><p>It was reported to have had 3.2 million daily active users on January 4 across platforms. Additionally, the research group said Arc Raiders passed 12 million copies sold over the weekend.</p><p>The number of Arc Raiders copies sold daily began to "stabilize" in early December, but the recent 20%- off sale--which brought the price down to $32--along with a boost related to people being off from school and work for the holidays, helped pump up daily sales figures, the report said.</p><p>Alinea also reported that the $40 Arc Raiders has now reached more than $350 million in estimated revenue across all platforms. On Steam, the game is faring particularly well, accounting for 53.5% of total sales in January so far. Additionally, the game's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">24-hour peak concurrent figure of 466,372</a> is just about 3% off the game's all-time peak of 481,966 players on Steam.</p><p>Arc Raiders is a big success, but it also has its critics who took issue with the game's use of artificial intelligence systems for its voice lines. Developer Embark <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-defends-use-of-ai-yet-again/1100-6537166/" data-ref-id="1100-6537166">recently defended the use of AI</a>, with Embark boss Patrick Söderlund saying, "People have to take a step back and understand what it is and how it can be a big help to developers and be a tremendous benefit to players."</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Time is running out to play Anthem, BioWare's live-service game that originally launched in early 2019. In just one week, EA will take the online-multiplayer game offline, meaning it won't be playable starting January 12.</p><p dir="ltr">EA officially announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-anthem-shutting-down-entirely-will-be-unplayable-starting-next-year/1100-6532956/">Anthem would be shut down</a> in July 2025. This gave players roughly half-a-year to return to the RPG and to spend any leftover currency they had for the title. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthems-end-is-nearly-here" rel="nofollow ">Eurogamer</a> is looking at whether any sort of in-game event is planned to make the occasion, but that seems very unlikely at this point.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Anthem Video Review</p>

<p dir="ltr">After that announcement, former BioWare producer Mark Darrah <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-bioware-producer-details-what-went-wrong-with-anthem/1100-6533735/">discussed what went wrong with Anthem</a>--at least from his point of view. For instance, Darrah noted that Mass Effect director Casey Hudson pitched Anthem to EA as a whole new direction for BioWare, but then Hudson left the studio and couldn't lead that proposed transformation. Hudson is now overseeing the team that's working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-is-probably-many-years-away-from-release/1100-6536942/">the recently revealed Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition, Darrah admitted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/as-anthem-approaches-its-shutdown-ex-bioware-boss-reflects-on-what-could-have-been/1100-6534123/">Anthem was going to become unplayable at some point</a>, regardless of whether it was successful or not. That's just <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/concord-is-shutting-down-after-two-weeks-but-is-that-unprecedented/2900-5747/">the nature of the beast with live-service games</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Years ago, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/anthem-2-0-reboot-canceled-but-current-servers-will-remain-live/1100-6488005/">Anthem was planned to be rebooted with a major update</a>, but that was scrapped in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The next project from BioWare is expected to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-everything-we-know-about-bioware-upcoming-rpg/1100-6485779/">Mass Effect 5</a>, but the studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioware-reportedly-has-fewer-than-100-staff-members-left/1100-6529194/">reportedly has fewer than 100 employees left</a>.</p>

                <p>Over two years after its release, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is enjoying an all-time peak on Steam, likely in large part due to the game's new DLC that ties in directly to the film franchise's latest installment.</p><p>Data from <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2840770/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a> showed that the Ubisoft-published open-world game hit a record number of 15,283 players this week--a gain from its previous peak of 12,496 players last month when Avatar: Fire and Ash hit cinemas on December 19.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora – From the Ashes Hands-On Impressions</p>
      </div>
<p>With the release of the movie came a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-dlc-arrives-same-day-as-fire-and-ash-movie/1100-6534953/" data-ref-id="1100-6534953">DLC expansion for Frontiers of Pandora on the same day</a>--titled From the Ashes, the story expansion takes place weeks after the events of Fire and Ash and is thematically linked to the film. The DLC costs $25, though a From the Ashes edition of the game that includes the base game retails for $40.</p><p>It's little surprise that the new story content, along with the related film being a box-office hit that has <a href="https://variety.com/2026/film/box-office/avatar-fire-and-ash-1-billion-benchmark-james-cameron-1236618729/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">just crossed $1 billion</a>, gave Frontiers of Pandora a hefty boost in player interest and engagement.</p><p>The latest updates for Frontiers of Pandora gave players several excuses for returning to the game, most notably a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-getting-third-person-update-just-ahead-of-avatar-3/1100-6533311/" data-ref-id="1100-6533311">third-person mode and New Game Plus support</a>. Those additions were patched in on December 5, a couple of weeks before From the Ashes released.</p><p>From the Ashes puts players in the role of So'lek, a Na'vi seeking revenge against the RDA and the warmongering Ash clan featured in Fire and Ash. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avatar-dlc-hands-on-how-the-new-movie-sets-frontiers-of-pandoras-world-aflame/1100-6536707/" data-ref-id="1100-6536707">hands-on preview of From the Ashes</a> said the expansion does "just enough to make the experience feel fresh all over again."</p>

                <p>Fans have had over 20 years of the Saw franchise, and John Wick is already celebrating over 10 years, with a fifth installment possibly on the way. Saw has become a contemporary iconic horror series that has spun off into a slew of merchandise, had its own Halloween Horror Nights house, and even a video game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/saw-review/1900-6232574/" data-ref-id="1900-6232574">back in 2009</a> and its sequel. While Wick doesn't have the level of crossover appeal--though both Wick and Jigsaw's puppet have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-wick-arrives-in-fortnite-skin-ltm-challenges-/1100-6466952/" data-ref-id="1100-6466952">appeared in Fortnite</a>--Lionsgate is looking to take both Jigsaw and Wick into video games for a new generation. </p><p>On a recent earnings call, Lionsgate chairman Adam Fogelson mentioned that there is "increased interest and increased opportunity" to make new AAA games based on Lionsgate IPs. Fogelson specifically mentioned Wick and Saw. </p><p>"Our AAA game opportunities and other gaming opportunities around John Wick and Saw and some others that we'll be announcing soon, we're seeing increased interest and increased opportunity, and we remain on schedule," he said (via <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4839872-lionsgate-studios-corp-lion-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Seeking Alpha</a>). "So I think in totality, you are going to see a meaningfully additive financial opportunity coming in the coming years."</p><p>Back in 2023, Lionsgate admitted that it was looking <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-wick-5-confirmed-john-wick-video-game-proposals-moving-ahead/1100-6514599/" data-ref-id="1100-6514599">into a video game adaptation for Wick</a>. Lionsgate president Joe Drake said Lionsgate is "continuing to have those conversations" about moving the Keanu Reeves-led franchise to games, adding that there was a ton of energy" around the prospect of making a John Wick video game. Nothing came out of those proposals; instead, the world expanded with the spin-off film Ballerina and the prequel series The Continental. </p><p>With Saw, both games weren't well-received, and so maybe the third time's the charm for Jigsaw and his macabre puzzles and deathtraps. Lionsgate had previously adapted the Blair Witch franchise into a game as well, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/blair-witch-game-review-prying-eyes/1900-6417290/" data-ref-id="1900-6417290">equal tepid fanfare</a>. </p>

<p><em><strong>Game Informer's Wesley LeBlanc:</strong></em><strong> How would you describe Neowiz’s 2025? Were there any particular standout moments or surprises for Neowiz, or did it feel like a year of consistency?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em><strong>Neowiz co-CEO Sean Kim: </strong></em>Late last year, we did have some concerns; however, the year ultimately delivered results that exceeded our expectations. As a co-CEO of a public company, there is a clear responsibility to achieve a certain level of financial performance each year. We knew that we had developed something new and extraordinary with Lies of P, but forecasting its financial performance was something of a challenge. We bet heavily on the remarkable skill and passion of our development and publishing teams, and it paid off. Lies of P sales and sentiment numbers were very strong.</p><p>Overture also had a material impact on the base game numbers, bringing in a wave of new players and expanding the community in untold ways. In that sense, the release was particularly significant, as it solidified the foundation of an emerging pillar franchise for us moving forward.&nbsp;</p><p>Winning the Golden Joystick and the Lenovo 3D Juego awards in a stacked field of competitors this year was an added bonus. Having the game acclaimed by players and critics alike made the experience as personally gratifying as it was financially fruitful.</p><p><strong>I think, because of the success of Lies of P, Neowiz is most closely associated with that series now. But what else is Neowiz up to beyond Lies of P?</strong></p><p>Our goal is to consistently introduce successful IP that fans will continue to support and look forward to over the long haul, even five or ten years down the line.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, we are internally developing more than five new PC and console titles, while also focusing on discovering global IP through collaborations with Western studios such as Zakazane and Wolfeye. We plan to continue investing in strong partners worldwide as we move forward.&nbsp;</p><p>Our lineup of third-party indie titles, many of them developed by talented local Korean teams, is also worth highlighting. In particular, Shape of Dreams and SANABI recently achieved both critical and commercial success.</p><p><strong>Neowiz recently shared word of five unannounced games in development, ranging from Lies of P’s sequel to a narrative-based RPG to life simulation and more – how does Neowiz chart its path forward, and does genre play a role?&nbsp;</strong></p><div><p>Our core strategy is to expand the size of our fanbase and deepen engagement among players who enjoy our games. We like to define IP as "content + fans." No matter how much effort goes into making great content, we believe it is difficult to call a game “great” if it fails to satisfy its fans.&nbsp;</p><p>We don’t set out to pursue a wide range of genres as a matter of strategic direction; rather, we’re circumspect about what we currently have and opportunistic about what we could execute well. Of course, the Lies of P franchise will need to be continued. That’s a given. But in general, our development cycle does not begin with a particular genre. Instead, it starts with the creative vision of our directors. We tend not to begin development by fixating on a play style or game concept first.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, we evaluate proposals from our directors based on a few key criteria.&nbsp;First, is the genre attractive, considering the current market size and competitive landscape? Next, are we able to assemble a solid team that can deliver the project at a high level of quality? Finally, is there a long-term strategy for growing the game's fanbase and engagement?&nbsp;</p><p>We regularly revisit our ongoing projects using these same criteria to make sure that they stay aligned with our strategy, which is centered on both content and fans.</p></div><p><strong>Can you tell me anything about the Lies of P sequel?</strong></p><div><p>At this point, there is nothing specific we can share in detail. I can tell you that the team at Round8 Studio is excited about their work and fully focused on development.&nbsp;</p><p>With the Lies of P DLC receiving further recognition through its various award wins and director Choi Ji-Won expressing strong confidence in the studio’s next project, we hope fans will continue to look forward to what’s ahead as much as we are.</p></div><p><strong>How do Neowiz and Round8 feel about Overture’s release earlier this year?&nbsp;</strong></p><div><p>We are grateful to see that players around the world have responded so positively to our vision and work product. It was a watershed moment, adding clear insight into the importance and potential of Neowiz’s franchise-driven IP strategy, while also practicing what it takes operationally to deliver solid results in the global market.&nbsp;</p><p>For Round8 Studio, the success of Overture was especially validating, as it clearly demonstrated the competitiveness of the Lies of P IP on the worldwide stage, while recognizing the creativity, dedication, and ambition shown by the entire development team.</p></div><p><strong>Neowiz is publishing two third-party games – one for Wolfeye and one for Zakazane. What does Neowiz look for in third-party partners, and what stood out about these studios and what they’re working on?</strong></p><div><p>We first look at a game’s vision and potential, as well as the team’s experience and capabilities. It’s about making sure we’re the publisher that can truly elevate them. For us, partnering isn’t solely about discovering strong projects.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, we try to understand whether a prospective team has a long-term plan to grow their game’s fanbase and build an IP at scale. If a game shows promise but falls outside of areas where we can add value, we’d rather guide the developers toward someone who can do the best job with them. Ultimately, our priority is seeing creators succeed, because the games themselves are what matter most.</p><p>In the case of Wolfeye, we saw the potential for the rich and compelling worlds they are building to grow into a franchise IP with us. Similarly, our publishing partnership with Zakazane was driven by our confidence that their strong narrative foundation would allow them to expand the current project into sequels with our support.</p></div><p><strong>When you, as a publishing lead, look at 2025, what do you think defines gaming this year? Any surprises? Any disappointments?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>For 2025, our focus was to continue to create high-quality projects and solidify Neowiz’s position in the global PC and console market. As we’ve reached the end of the year, it’s felt like the start of a new era of gaming. Smaller teams are achieving strong results, including our publishing relationship with Lizard Smoothie. The release of their debut title, Shape of Dreams, sold 500,000 copies in its first month, and the team is still dedicated to delivering the best experience for their community. We look to take these successes and expand our publishing efforts in narrative-driven game development with developers from around the world.</p><p><strong>Generative AI is a hot topic this year, with some studios/publishers getting behind it and others staying away from it. Does generative AI have a place within Neowiz’s publishing house, and how does it work with developers?</strong></p><p>Korea is reportedly one of the countries where ChatGPT is used most actively. It’s hard to find a game company here today that isn’t using AI in some way. At the very least, companies are using either ChatGPT or Gemini.&nbsp;</p><p>For us, like any forward-thinking technology company, we are actively exploring how advanced learning tools can enhance our internal publishing productivity. Our primary focus is on research and development to automate routine operational tasks, such as test case processing and analyzing large volumes of operational data.&nbsp;</p><p>AI utilization can also enable our expert teams to work faster and focus their energy on refining core strategies with our partners to maximize player engagement. By processing data faster, our teams will arrive at better, more informed strategic decisions on how best to support our developers and engage with our community.</p><p><strong>South Korea, in particular, is becoming more and more of a major player in game development/publishing. Mobile is a big part of the market there, but I’ve spoken to enough devs there to learn that there seems to be a push to consoles/PCs and triple-A projects – do you agree, and if so, why do you think this is?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>That does seem to be the case. Given the current landscape, it’s understandable that leadership teams would see PC and console as important areas for future growth. Competition in the mobile market has become increasingly intense, and a number of traditionally mobile-focused companies are clearly looking to pivot toward PC and console development. We’re already seeing studios in that space begin to show results.</p><p><strong>How are Neowiz’s mobile offerings doing in relation to its console/PC releases?</strong></p><p>We are actively operating live-service mobile games that are well-received by players worldwide. We still view our mobile business as an important pillar of our company. We found that our cozy games resonate with Western consumers, with titles like Cats &amp; Soup. In particular, Cats &amp; Soup celebrated its fourth anniversary in August and recorded over 60 million downloads of the game last year. We also expanded the IP with the launch of Cats &amp; Soup: Magic Recipe this April, which was developed by the original team.</p><p><strong>Anything else I missed or didn’t ask about you’d like to discuss?</strong></p><p>Not only does Neowiz have a Korean team with direct experience in the global success of Lies of P, but it also has a strong global publishing team across North America and Europe. With this foundation, we look forward to meeting great teams around the world and building long-term partnerships.</p><hr><p><em>This email Q&amp;A took place in December of 2025.&nbsp;</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2026/01/05/ceo-of-lies-of-p-publisher-neowiz-talks-2025-overture-expansion]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Alicia Vikander's turn as Lara Croft in 2018's Tomb Raider adaptation is having a bit of a renaissance it seems. The film, which is largely based on the rebooted Survivor timeline, recently popped up on the Netflix top 10 films list, seven years (give or take) since its initial release.</p>
<p>Most recent Netflix data reveals Tomb Raider is sitting at number nine for global film releases, ahead of the more seasonal Jingle Bell Heist, making it one of the most watched films worldwide between 22nd and 28th December.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10">According to Netflix</a>, Tomb Raider has so far enjoyed two weeks on the streaming service's top 10 for films, with over 4m views. That equates to 8.2m hours watched.</p>
<p>The rest of the top 10 is made up of seasonal favourites such as Dr. Seuss' The Grinch or more recent releases like Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery. K Pop Demon Hunters is, of course, still in there as well.</p><p>So, why the sudden interest in Tomb Raider? Well, there are a number of factors that have likely had an impact on its renewed popularity. Netflix could have seen an uptick in Tomb Raider viewers as this year marks the series' 30th anniversary. Yep, the first Tomb Raider came out in 1996, which is wild because I am still only 21, so not sure how that works…</p>
<p>Another reason could be the announcement last month that two new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider games</a> are in the pipeline. The first, known as Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, is a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fully-fledged-from-the-ground-up-tomb-raider-remake-announced">from the ground up remake of the original Tomb Raider</a>, with Flying Wild Hog handling development with Crystal Dynamics. This chap is due to be released some time this year, though we don't have an exact date yet.</p>
<p>The second game, meanwhile, is coming from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon, and is known as Tomb Raider: Catalyst. This will be an all-new series entry, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-where-tomb-raider-catalyst-sits-on-the-series-timeline">which takes place after Tomb Raider: Underworld</a> (that's the game where Lara pops along to Helheim whilst wielding Thor's hammer, Mjolnir). Catalyst <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-tomb-raider-game-known-as-catalyst-finally-revealed-at-the-game-awards">will see the globe-trotting Lara Croft heading to Northern India</a>, and is due to be released in 2027.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alicia-vikanders-tomb-raider-sequel-in-limbo-following-amazon-buyout">a sequel to Vikander's Tomb Raider film was being planned</a>. However, in 2022, it was reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alicia-vikander-no-longer-lara-croft-as-tomb-raider-movie-series-sits-in-limbo">MGM had lost the rights to the Tomb Raider films</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Amazon is working on a live action Tomb Raider TV series, with Sophie Turner as Lara Croft. Filming is expected to kick off later this month. Other <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-tomb-raider-series-adds-white-lotus-star-to-the-cast">cast members include Sigourney Weaver and Jason Isaacs</a>.</p>
<p>Weaver will play a character called Wallace on the show's release, and has stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-scripts-are-incredible-and-very-funny-sigourney-weaver-confirms-she-will-play-wallace-in-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Tomb Raider scripts are "incredible, and very funny, very charming, very witty"</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Styx: Blades of Greed Won’t Be For Everyone, But That’s Okay – Hands-On Preview]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-wont-be-for-everyone-but-thats-okay-hands-on-preview/</link>
            <guid>1397266</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Over the years, the Styx series has become the series for those looking for involving stealth gameplay. Cyanide's hardcore approach to stealth mechanics prevented the series from being popular among audiences that weren't the stealth games fanatics, but it's undeniable that this approach, combined with a dark fantasy setting and a chatty, irreverent main character, made the series what it is.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-gamescom-hands-on-preview-not-for-the-faint-of-heart/"><strong>After having had the chance to try out Styx: Blades of Greed</strong></a>, the next entry in the series, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-delayed-out-of-2025-now-set-to-arrive-in-february-2026/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">now set to launch this February on PC and consoles</strong></a>, I couldn't help but notice how Cyanide wasn't going to compromise on its hardcore approach to widen the series' appeal. The contrary, actually. </p>



<p>While Styx continues to be the likeable goblin rogue he has always been, everything else has been expanded considerably, with an open-world setting with sandbox features that provides new challenges, but also new tools to dispose of surprisingly attentive enemies that leave no stone unturned if they believe to have spotted something suspicious. This early build was unsurprisingly a little rough around the edges, but the experience's potential was evident.</p>



<p>Last month, I was given a second chance to try out Styx: Blades of Greed before its release. While in terms of content this new build wasn't different from the one I tried during Gamescom 2025, except for a new intro sequence teaching the game's basics while setting up the story, the prior experience (and the more relaxed testing environment) made me appreciate even more the focus on verticality, and the sandbox design of the Slums, where the build's main mission takes place.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Styx-Blades-of-Greed-January-Hands-On-Gameplay.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>As part of this build's main mission, Styx is supposed to talk with a drunken dwarf who is staying at a nearby tavern to recover the Zeppelin. With little knowledge of the game mechanics, in my Gamescom 202 test, I went through the tavern's main door, using every opportunity to distract enemies to make it to the dwarf's room, with some difficulty, as the enemies have solid AI that makes them smarter than your usual enemy in non-stealth-focused games. However, now knowing where the room is, I took a completely different approach. </p>



<p>Taking advantage of the map's verticality, I climbed the tavern from the outside, making sure to crouch under windows to avoid enemies spotting me. This approach provided not only a different experience but also highlighted how the sandbox design of Styx: Blades of Greed will allow players to complete missions in any way they like.</p>



<p>The second part of the mission, which involved taking down all enemies in a somewhat closed-off location with an intricate design with multiple passages between rooms, likewise showed how many options are at Styx's disposal to take enemies out, even without using any of the special abilities that can be learned via the different skill trees or new tools like the grappling hook and the glider. One option I didn't see back in the Gamescom 2025 build is the ability to poison food, which highlights once more how varied the player's approach can be to clear missions.</p>



<p>Besides being able to appreciate better what Styx: Blades of Greed tries to do, the new build also showcased a higher degree of polish over the Gamescom 2025 demo, with little to no visual and gameplay glitches. Unfortunately, I can't really evaluate the game's performance, as the preview was conducted via cloud streaming; however, things felt smooth enough, even with multiple characters on screen.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>While I don't expect Styx: Blades of Greed to set the market on fire, as its hardcore stealth approach is still going to leave anyone who isn't a stealth game fanatic frustrated, the new entry in the series by Cyanide seems to evolve the series' formula considerably, providing a sandbox stealth experience that works incredibly well with its wealth of options. </p>



<p>As such, I am looking forward to seeing what the game will offer beyond what I have already experienced twice, and whether the map and encounter design will hold up as well as they do in these missions when it launches on February 19 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with <em>Tomba!</em>, it's a rather curious game from the halcyon days of the original PlayStation, having launched in Japan in 1997, followed by a release in America and Europe the following year.</p><p>The game is essentially a Metroidvania platformer that follows the titular Tomba, a feral child who must defeat a battalion of pigs in order to recover a sacred bracelet belonging to his grandfather.</p><p>To do so, he'll have to explore a large non-linear map filled with areas to explore in both the foreground and background, as well as quests to complete in the course of exploration.</p><p>Since release, <em>Tomba!</em>, which was released as <em>Tombi! </em>in Europe, has attracted a cult following, leading to the launch of a sequel, <em>Tomba! 2: The Evil Swine Return</em>, in 1999. The sequel netted itself a release for modern systems, including the Switch 2, in December last year.</p>
