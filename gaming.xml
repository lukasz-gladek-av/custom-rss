On Twitter, Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford chimed in on how the 95% discount on Borderlands 3--dropping the price from $60 to $3--has happened over five years after the game was first released. However, don't expect to see Borderlands 4 retail for the price of a cup of coffee--or land on subscription services like Xbox Game Pass--for a long time after launch, as Pitchford wanted to temper expectations.</p><p>"Sales like this and Borderlands 3 showing up on console subscription programs took over five years from the game's launch to happen. Take advantage when it's here! And to set expectations, it will be even longer before this kind of thing happens in the next cycle with Borderlands 4," <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1938309648320500181" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pitchford tweeted</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - Official Story Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>At a time when the average price of a AAA video game has jumped from $70 to $80--following decades of it being set at $60--the news that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-is-happy-the-game-is-not-80-and-has-no-paid-early-access/1100-6532526/" data-ref-id="1100-6532526">Borderlands 4 would be priced at $70</a> was welcomed by many fans. Of course, that's for the standard edition of the game, as the more deluxe versions of the looter-shooter will retail at a higher price. Discounts also come and go, and typically, the price on a new release drops around 10-15% several months after launch.</p><p>Of course, with enough incentive, plans can change. Borderlands 3 was given away as an Epic Games Store freebie back in May 2022, just a few years after it first launched, and it was also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-free-games-for-july-2024/1100-6524517/" data-ref-id="1100-6524517">given away through PS Plus in July 2024</a>.</p><p>Pitchford's comment also comes at an interesting time for subscription services, as there have been discussions by developers and publishers regarding programs like Xbox Game Pass. Former PlayStation Studios boss Shuhei Yoshida <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-approach-to-video-game-subscriptions-is-healthier-than-xbox-former-exec-says/1100-6531904/">recently expressed concern about these services</a>, but he also added that Sony's approach is "healthier" as the company only adds first-party releases years after launch.</p><p>Meanwhile, developer Rebellion's newest game, Atomfall, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-release-atomfall-was-immediately-profitable-report/1100-6531671/">was "immediately profitable"</a> and the studio spoke about<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atomfall-dev-discusses-game-pass-launch-and-risk-of-cannibalizing-sales/1100-6530925/"> why it was a good business decision</a> to release it through Game Pass. On the other hand, other developers have spoken <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-hurts-sales-says-dev-behind-xbox-game-pass-title/1100-6514084/">about the risks of Game Pass</a>, and Microsoft has also had to address statements about how the service can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-clarifies-its-own-admission-that-game-pass-cannibalizes-some-game-sales/1100-6511503/">potentially cannibalize game sales</a>.</p>

Kennedy may play a role in the game, possibly as another playable character. Director Koshi Nakanishi seemingly silenced these rumors during last night’s Capcom Spotlight, where he revealed that Leon S. Kennedy was initially considered for Requiem's starring role but was ultimately considered a bad fit for the game.&nbsp;</p><p>Nakanishi states that while they considered including the popular hero of Resident Evil 2 and 4, Requiem’s core concept of “addictive fear,” an experience so oppressively terrifying that players enjoy overcoming their fear, didn’t fit with Leon’s generally fearless and capable characterization.</p><p>“We always thought about making Leon the protagonist, but making a horror game based around him is difficult,” says Nakanishi. “He wouldn’t jump at something like a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing. So he’s actually a bad match for horror.”</p>

<p>While this doesn't necessarily rule out that Leon could appear in a non-playable capacity, it seems like fans won't be getting their wish of controlling the former cop-turned-government agent in the new game. Capcom Spotlight also shared more about Resident Evil Requiem's story premise, themes, and the decision behind making Grace Ashcroft the lead.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Last night’s Capcom Spotlight provided new information and snippets of gameplay for <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/sgf-2025/2025/06/06/resident-evil-requiem-is-arriving-february-2026">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, the ninth mainline entry in the series. We learned the game's central theme and story setup, why Capcom chose Grace Ashcroft as its protagonist, and more.</p><p>Director Koshi Nakanishi and producer Masachika Kawata explain that Requiem is a single-player offline adventure, and they dive into how the protagonist, Grace Ashcroft, represents a new type of lead for the franchise. Unlike previous stars like Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield, the FBI analyst is shy, timid, and not adept at fighting; she instead relies on her wits to gradually overcome her fears. This approach is designed to make players better identify with Grace since she’s essentially a normal person thrown into an extraordinarily horrifying situation.&nbsp;</p><p>Grace's relative helplessness also feeds into the game's core concept of "addictive horror", &nbsp;which Nakanishi explains is an experience so overwhelmingly scary that players become addicted to the challenge of conquering their fears. He also unexpectedly drops that Leon S. Kennedy was considered for the starring role but was ultimately <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/06/27/capcom-considered-leon-s-kennedy-a-bad-match-for-resident-evil-requiem">declared a bad fit</a>. &nbsp;You can watch Requiem's Spotlight segment starting at the 19:06 mark.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/omnl-EMxfYE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/omnl-EMxfYE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In addition to showing off new gameplay footage from the upcoming game, the presentation lays out the premise: Requiem unfolds 30 years after the destruction of Raccoon City. The designers discuss how the city spawned so many stories, characters, and hardships for everyone connected to it, and that the new game is “a requiem, a eulogy to those who came before,”, hence the choice of the title. This theme of reflection is fitting, given that Requiem launches one month shy of the series’ 30th anniversary in March 2026.</p><p>Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 27 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/wreckfest-2">Wreckfest 2</a> Content Update 2 is here, bringing another batch of tracks, vehicles and general improvements to the smash-happy racer. Of particular highlights are the eminently crushable motorhomes, and a working scrap yard!</p>
<p><iframe title="Wreckfest 2 | Content Update #2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8srHD006lIc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>An addition that will be a joy to fans of peak Top Gear – a TV show that famously loved destroying caravans in particular, if not motorhomes specifically – thoroughly crashable RVs are joined by the large American sedan, the Cardinal.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to take these racing around the Banger Racing dirt track in both oval and figure 8 layouts, but the showstopper is the Scrapyard demolition derby arena, which features large armed crane grabbers, and car crushers to deal damage. You can get grabbed and dragged along to your inevitable doom, which looks quite hilarious.</p>
<p>Aside from that, Bugbear has sought to bring more polish to the game. Certain kinds of collision and vehicle damage have improved, the Last Man Standing demolition derby mode has returned, and there’s a bunch of other quality of life improvements and general tweaks.</p>

<p>Playing the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/19/wreckfest-2-early-access-preview/">Wreckfest 2 Early Access</a> at its initial release, with its very limited content, I said, “At this point in time, fans of the original are probably best served by actually continuing to play the original, but if you know that Wreckfest 2 will be a part of your racing game future and want to get in at the earliest possible point to see it develop, then the Steam Early Access release might just be for you. It is distinctly limited right now, little more than a demo or technical test, but there’s plenty for fans to look forward to in the months ahead.”</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-unveils-hexe-marie-boss-fight-in-crimson-desert/">Pearl Abyss</a> is bringing <a href="https://crimsondesert.pearlabyss.com/en-US/Main">Crimson Desert</a> back to Gamescom with another demo available for those in attendance at Gamescom 2025 to try out for themselves ahead of the game's launch sometime this fall.</p>
<p>Crimson Desert was playable at <a href="https://wccftech.com/three-bosses-revealed-in-crimson-desert-demo-at-gamescom-2024/">Gamescom 2024</a>, and before the event, there were rumblings that we'd see the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-rumored-to-launch-early-next-year-following-gamescom-demo/">launch sometime in early 2025</a>. That didn't happen, of course, with Pearl Abyss announcing a fall 2025 release date at <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/">The Game Awards 2024</a>.</p>
<p>We nearly had a release date revealed last week, with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-on-november-2-says-korean-website/">Korean website reporting that Crimson Desert would arrive on November 2, 2025</a>. Pearl Abyss released a statement following the report, simply saying, "<em>When the company is ready to announce a release date, it will come from official channels</em>."</p>
<p>That statement doesn't exactly deny the November 2 date, though, of course, it doesn't confirm it either. We'll have to wait for Pearl Abyss to properly announce the date, which could potentially come at Gamescom 2025.</p>
<p>If you do check out Crimson Desert at Gamescom 2025, then you'll be playing it on an AMD-powered PC with Samsung G6 and G8 monitors on display. You'll also walk away with a bag of Crimson Desert merchandise, according to a press release from Pearl Abyss.</p>
<p>"<em>We're thrilled to debut Crimson Desert's latest public demo for the very first time here at Gamescom 2025</em>," said chief executive officer of Pearl Abyss Europe, Lybee Park.</p>
<p>"<em>We can't wait for fans to get hands-on with the experience we've crafted. From the immersive booth to the gameplay itself, we hope every visitor walks away feeling part of Crimson Desert - and excited for what's to come at launch</em>."</p>
<p>If you want to run right to the Pearl Abyss booth once you break through the Gamescom doors, you'll be able to find them in the Entertainment Area in Hall 06.1, Stand B041-A040.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/short-hike-dev-untitled-paper-rpg-demo</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-short-hike-dev-releases-demo-for-sort-of-canceled-rpg.1230102/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>A Short Hike&nbsp;</em>developer Adam Robinson-Yu has announced that he's ceased work on his project&nbsp;<em>Untitled Paper RPG</em>, but he's released a free demo if you want to know how the game would have turned out.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://adamgryu.itch.io/paper-game/devlog/971220/i-might-never-finish-this-game-so-im-releasing-the-demo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> on his Itch.io page, Robinson-Yu says that after taking a break from <i>Untitled Paper RPG&nbsp;</i>to work on&nbsp;<em>A Short Hike</em>, as well as its various ports and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/short-hike-99-is-multiplayer-mod-for-up-to-99-players" rel="nofollow">updates</a>, he found he "didn't really want to go back to [<em>Untitled Paper RPG</em>]".</p>

<p>He says development on the project "had become difficult", which was the reason for taking a break from it in order to work on&nbsp;<em>A Short Hike</em>. The game technically isn't completely canceled; Robinson-Yu says he "might return" to it someday, but that he "[doesn't] see [himself] making time for this RPG in near future".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/a-short-hike-dev-untitled-paper-rpg-dialogue.jpg?itok=kUUB0vD2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/a-short-hike-dev-untitled-paper-rpg-dialogue.jpg?itok=6LChqLSU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Untitled Paper RPG&nbsp;</em>is no more, at least for now.</figcaption></figure><p>Robinson-Yu gives various reasons for&nbsp;<em>Untitled Paper RPG</em>'s development becoming difficult, including overscoping, a lack of narrative focus, and "doubts" about the game's turn-based combat, which he says ended up feeling like "an annoying obstacle".</p>

<p>In the end, Robinson-Yu says he simply "started to lose the joy that [he] felt working on [<em>Untitled Paper RPG</em>]", which is usually a pretty good sign that it's time to stop and look for something new, if you ask me.</p>

<p>However, if you do want to know how&nbsp;<em>Untitled Paper RPG&nbsp;</em>might have turned out, then there's a free demo available from <a href="https://adamgryu.itch.io/paper-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Robinson-Yu's Itch.io page</a> right now. It constitutes around an hour or two of gameplay, but don't expect it to feel like a finished product.</p>

It's not clear whether any of these games will see the light of day, of course.</p>

<p>If you want to check out what Robinson-Yu was doing during his&nbsp;<em>Untitled Paper RPG&nbsp;</em>sabbatical,&nbsp;<em>A Short Hike&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1055540/A_Short_Hike/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/a-short-hike/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/a-short-hike/9nk78df207sd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/a-short-hike-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and you can play it on all of those consoles' successors through backwards compatibility as well.</p>

            <p>It's here. No, not the end of the world as we know it, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s long-awaited review bomb cape.</p>
<p>Arrowhead had been teasing adding said cape, dubbed "Pillars of Freedom", to the game as an inside joke since that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">whole PSN controversy last year</a>, when HD2 got so many negative reviews from folks angry at account linking being made mandatory that its Steam graph's red lines were long enough inspire amateur fashion designers. The developers and Sony have since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-spider-man-2-and-more-playstation-titles-have-been-freed-from-their-region-lock-prison-on-pc">restored access</a> to the game in a bunch of countries the PSN change rendered it unpurchasable in, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-latest-patch-nerfs-leviathans-and-might-have-snuck-that-review-bomb-cape-in-behind-the-scenes">paving the way</a> for this gear gag.</p>

<p>"In honor of their unquestioning commitment to the defense of Managed Democracy, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> have been awarded a commemorative cape," Arrowhead tweeted upon deploying this back-covering cloth that resembles the Steam review graph at the time of the review bombing, "The new uniform piece will be available in all Super Destroyer Armories as soon as the rollout is complete.</p>
<p>"This cape will be awarded to all existing players. As with our previous item rollouts, please allow some time for the item to arrive in your inbox."</p> <div>

<p>Cue raucous celebrations in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1llsfy9/review_bomb_cape_is_here/">Redditosphere</a> and on Discord. "I can’t believe they actually did it," wrote one joyous player, "And good on them for waiting until Sony actually opened the game back up to all those countries, instead of last year when everyone was celebrating the half-victory."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another declared: "I'm not taking it off. I waited a long year for my country to be removed from [the] region block." Yep, this really has been a long time in the making.</p>
<p>Sony walked back their plans to make the account mandatory on May 6, 2024. It's now June 27, 2025. 13 months. 60 weeks. 417 days. Something in the region of 9,998 hours. Something in the region of 599,910 minutes. Something in the region of 35,994,615 seconds.</p>
<p>Babies have been born. People have died. Countless hells have been dived.</p>
<p>And now, cape.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/417-days-on-from-helldivers-2s-big-psn-backlash-players-have-finally-gotten-their-review-bomb-cape]]></content:encoded>

Is it <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em>? <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>?? <em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</em>??? No, it’s <em>Super Mario Strikers</em>, the inaugural entry in Nintendo’s soccer franchise, arriving July 1. While that might be disappointing to some fans, diehard Strikers will rejoice that there’s finally a good one of those playable on modern hardware. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196452" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Clear Your Calendar For Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="149" data-playlist="196452,197567,197531" data-current="196452"><div><p>Clear Your Calendar For Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22004.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>See, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-strikers-battle-league-review-nintendo-switch-mul-1849047762&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-strikers-battle-league-review-nintendo-switch-mul-1849047762">before<em> Mario Strikers: Battle League</em> came out in 2022</a></span>, long-time fans were cautiously optimistic. The GameCube original didn’t sell great, but won a loyal following thanks to its simple-but-fun spin on the beautiful game. <em>Mario Strikers</em> <em>Charged</em> for the Wii was decent as well, and depending on who you ask was a clear upgrade over the original, especially thanks to its online multiplayer. <em>Battle League</em>, on the other hand, just didn’t feel like it had the juice. It was light on content and the more strategic gameplay could be a bit soulless compared to the more arcade-y fun of the earlier games. </p><p>So it’s nice to see that <em>Super Mario Strikers</em> will now be playable on Switch 2 as well, improved by the Switch Online app’s multiplayer options with others on your friends list.

It’s also another reason to pick up Nintendo’s modern GameCube controller replica that released alongside the new console. </p><p>That accessory will come in handy once<em> Smash Bros. Melee </em>arrives. I mean, Nintendo has to be getting ready to bring that over too, right? (<em>Oh, Ethan...—Anti-Naivety Ed</em>) While <em>Super Mario Strikers</em> isn’t my personal pick for the fourth GameCube game to join the Switch 2's retro library, there are plenty of excellent games we should be getting now that Nintendo has a solution for porting them beyond individual remasters. That includes a bunch of other sports spin-offs. <em>Mario Superstar Baseball </em>when? And don’t forget about<em> Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix</em>. Maybe Nintendo will ship a new dance pad just in time for the holidays. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-mario-strikers-gamecube-smash-bros-melee-1851785199]]></content:encoded>

I can confirm that the gestures do inflict damage when they hit a monster, but it’s a pretty negligible amount. They also all require real money to unlock. Here are the remaining items and how much they cost:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>SF6 Hadoken Gesture:</strong> $3.99</li><li><strong>SF6 Shoryuken Gesture:</strong> $3.99</li><li><strong>SF6 Tatsumaki Senpu-Kyaku Gesture:</strong> $3.99</li><li><strong>Street Fighter 6 Sticker Set:</strong> $1.99</li><li><strong>Blanka-Chan Doll Pendant:</strong> $1.49</li></ul><h2 id="h334340"><a id=""></a>How to Get SF6 Tickets</h2><figure id="" data-id="c4b0fbb1e6e5e500fcd30e94dcebd5a2" data-recommend-id="image://c4b0fbb1e6e5e500fcd30e94dcebd5a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The rewards screen for the Demonic Strength quest, highlighting the SF6 Ticket material." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The rewards screen for the Demonic Strength quest, highlighting the SF6 Ticket material." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c4b0fbb1e6e5e500fcd30e94dcebd5a2" data-recommend-id="image://c4b0fbb1e6e5e500fcd30e94dcebd5a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The rewards screen for the Demonic Strength quest, highlighting the SF6 Ticket material." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Just like with the Blossomdance Festival event and the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762">Arch-Tempered Rey Dau</a></span> equipment, the new forgeable items from this collaboration require a new material. Appropriately, that material is called <em>SF6 </em>Ticket. <strong>The only way to get </strong><em><strong>SF6 </strong></em><strong>Tickets are as rewards from the Demonic Strength and True Strength Arena Quests.</strong> Both of these are unlocked as you complete the Ultimate Strength side mission in the Oilwell Basin. Akuma will give you the first of these after you find him in the small cave near the Area 14 Mining Cave Tent pop-up camp. You’ll unlock True Strength after finishing the side mission.</p><p>These Arena Quests are pretty similar. You’ll face off against a Tempered Ajarakan while wearing Akuma armor. Demonic Strength is a solo run against a three-star Ajarakan, while True Strength allows for two hunters to take on a five-star Ajarakan. Farming the easier Demonic Strength quest is the best way to get <em>SF6 </em>Tickets fast. I was able to breeze through it with A-rank speed and almost solely using the Akuma armor attacks.</p><p><strong>You need ten total <em>SF6 </em>Tickets to forge all the related items.</strong> The Akuma armor set requires five; the Blanka-Chan palico armor set requires two; and the new Mighty Charm III requires three. Keep in mind that any other required materials will have to be gathered from other hunts.</p><h2 id="h334341"><a id=""></a>How to play as Akuma</h2><figure id="" data-id="4831320cf7ef266a1ca21940d7c10052" data-recommend-id="image://4831320cf7ef266a1ca21940d7c10052" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The new Akuma tab in the Basic Controls menu lists out the benefits of wearing his full armor set." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The new Akuma tab in the Basic Controls menu lists out the benefits of wearing his full armor set." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4831320cf7ef266a1ca21940d7c10052" data-recommend-id="image://4831320cf7ef266a1ca21940d7c10052" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The new Akuma tab in the Basic Controls menu lists out the benefits of wearing his full armor set." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Breaking the head of a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-defeat-mizutsune-bubbles-temper-1851781466&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-defeat-mizutsune-bubbles-temper-1851781466">Mizutsune</a></span> with an uppercut is a satisfying experience, and you can live that dream too by wearing the Akuma armor. However, this unique mechanic sadly isn’t without some key downsides. You’ll be given the following three Item Bar options when you wear the Akuma armor set or use the Layered Armor version:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Assisted Combo: Akuma</strong>: Leaving your Item Bar centered over this option is how you gain access to most of the fighter’s moves. You always have to press Square/X to begin Assisted Combo 1, but you can then switch over to Triangle/Y or Circle/B for Assisted Combos 2 and 3. Pressing X/A during a combo will change your roll into an Ashura Senku teleport</li><li><strong>Gou Hadoken</strong>: Equipping this provides you with a special Hadoken projectile that functions like Slinger ammo</li><li><strong>Drive Impact</strong>: This action only works if the green six-bar Drive Gauge above the Item Bar is full. Landing a Drive Impact against a monster’s wound will destroy it with a Shun Goku Satsu. Drive Impact can also gain <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-offset-attack-monster-weapons-1851775743&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-offset-attack-monster-weapons-1851775743">Offset Attack</a></span> priorities if the full Akuma armor is equipped</li></ul><p>Additionally, Akuma armor allows the use of the Gou Shoryuken gesture that’s awarded after completing the Ultimate Strength side mission. This gesture inflicts a bit more damage than the paid ones, but more importantly, it enhances into an OD Gou Shoryuken when performed after a combo.</p><p>I can’t deny that this sounds awkward and overly complicated. The trick is to make use of the various button shortcuts. Although assigning these actions to a Radial Menu is great for quicker access, relying on the following button shortcuts will allow you to fight with only the Assisted Combo option equipped:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Drive Impact Shortcut:</strong> Activated with a Focus Strike input (L2+R1/LT+RB) during an Assisted Combo</li><li><strong>Raging Demon Shortcut:</strong> An offshoot of his Drive Impact that you can cancel animations into and begins with an Ashura Senku teleport. Activated by <em>very quickly</em> pressing Square, Square, Triangle+Circle or X, X, Y+B</li><li><strong>OD Gou Shoryuken:</strong> Activated during or after combos by inputting right, down, right, and then any of the attack buttons. Those directional inputs have to be done with the stick and not a Directional pad.</li></ul><p>Many of Akuma’s attacks are short-range with limited movement. His iconic hurricane kick is ideal for repositioning, which is performed by pressing Circle/B three times for a full Assisted Combo 3 string. <strong>Akuma’s best combo connects the entire strings from all three of his Assisted Combos.</strong> That means pressing Square/X three times, Triangle/Y three times, and then Circle/B three times. Throwing out an OD Gou Shoryuken is a nice way to round it out. This should be the go-to when monsters are knocked down, since they won’t be able to interrupt you.</p><p>All of the above covers Akuma’s actions, but it means nothing without a good base. All of his techniques scale with your primary weapon’s raw damage and affinity. Equipping something with significant base damage will result in stronger Akuma attacks. Armor selection also makes a difference. <strong>Compared to Layered armor, having the full Akuma armor equipped provides a big attack boost, stun properties, and the Offset Effect for Drive Impact.</strong> You should use the full armor if you want all of his tools at your disposal.</p><p>Even though Akuma was also featured in the previous game, his inclusion in <em>Wilds</em> is a lot more fleshed out. Here’s hoping the next collaborations are just as deep and feature crossovers with some fun franchises.</p><p>Or Capcom could just make me happier and throw in some love for <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-street-fighter-6-sf6-ticket-akuma-1851785172]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I can happily say that a further week with the Switch 2 is cementing it as my current console of choice. I’ve been playing a lot of Splatoon 3, which I think I’m doing alright at, or just being very lucky with my teammates. It remains a great game, and having cooled on my Overwatch obsession, it’s filling the competitive shooter void in my life. Besides that, I’ve been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/27/ruffy-and-the-riverside-review/">Ruffy and the Riverside</a>, which is a delightful throwback to the days of the N64, as well as Lost In Random: The Eternal Die, more family Mario Kart World, and more Rune Factory Guardians of Azuma.</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> has had a frustrating week, but one with some romance in it, telling us, “After a particularly gruelling boss fight in Clair Obscur which I found intensely irritating – so much so my controller almost got lobbed, something I’ve not done in decades – so I took a break from all that stress by reviewing the sand-box dating sim <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/25/date-everything-review/">Date Everything</a>&nbsp;and succeeded in seducing my lamp. So that’s nice.”</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> had a busy one this week, saying, “In addition to Atomfall, Maestro, Zombie Army VR, and Chains of Freedom for review, I also started Death Stranding. I also did a sci-fi DND one-shot that I based on a book over the weekend, which was cool.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> was on <em>BIG REVIEW DUTY</em> this week with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/23/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review/">Death Stranding 2</a>. He says it’s got it all wrong though, “Death Stranding 2: Not On The Beach At All The Title Is Very Misleading. I have also played Sand Land, which I later found out is based on a manga, it’s rather fun.” See, at least that one sounds like it is on a beach.</p>


<p>Spending a good chunk of time playing Split/Second from the PlayStation Plus classics streaming library, Jim says, “It’s still a sublime arcade racer that doesn’t pull its punches with cheap rubber banding – then, of course, there’s the massively destructible tracks. I’m having great fun and will definitely complete a playthrough of the campaign before not doubt going back and grabbing 1st place in tougher races using the game’s best motors.” He continues, “After dipping in and out of the game for what feels like multiple years, I also wrapped Valiant Hearts. It transported me back in time, not just to The Great War, but a time when Ubisoft were taking more risks and banging out some stellar, smaller-scale titles.”</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> played some <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/19/rematch-review/">Rematch</a>, saying, “It is fine but needs a community where players know how to pass. I also played a Contra inspired run and gun game called Wild Dogs which let’s you use pilot a mech suit with a dog. I’ve also started Strangers of Paradise Final Fantasy Origins, and the combat is good in that. I’ve also started I Am Your Beast for review.”</p>
<p>Going for something gaming adjacent, <strong>Nic B</strong> tells us, “I have finally had a chance to catch up on Final Fantasy in Magic the Gathering. It is very, very good.” Meanwhile, <strong>Miguel</strong> has played lots of Elden Ring: Nightrein, a bit of Peak, and the global release of Umamusume: Pretty Derby.</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> tried out The Alters, but says, “I found it got too stressful as I kept on running out of food so will return to that when I’m feeling up to it.’ He then joined me by starting Lost In Random: The Eternal Die which he thinks is, “A really fun Hades clone that’s well worth playing on Game Pass”. He’s been carrying on though with his path to Metroid Prime 4, telling us, “I’m deep into the incredible fanmade AMR2. I played Samus Returns back on the 3DS and that was mostly a matter of parrying so playing an alternative take on Metroid 2 that doesn’t have this mechanic feels very different. It is still a bit too easy to get lost as many essential areas are hidden in secret rooms.” Finally, he started exploring the Switch 2 Welcome Tour and played a few rounds of Mario Kart World.</p>

<p>And finally,&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> has played a bunch of upcoming games. He went hands on with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/hands-on-pragmata-exploring-the-enigmatic-lunar-hacking-shooter/">Pragmata</a> just hours before the gameplay reveal in last night’s Capcom Spotlight stream, and really enjoyed the unusual hacking minigame being thrown into the shooting. He also visited Raw Fury to check out a bunch of their upcoming games, already sharing impressions of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/monsters-are-coming-preview-tower-survivor-mash-up/">Monsters Are Coming!</a>, and with Esoteric Ebb and more to come soon. He was then complimented on some a Mario Kart World win by an onlooking stranger on the flight back home.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what about you? Played anything good?</em></p>

<p>"The response far exceeded our expectations"</p>

<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4b229a5954056/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has today held its 85th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, during which president Shuntaro Furukawa apologised for not being able to meet initial demand for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>As highlighted by <a href="https://x.com/NStyles" tabindex="-1">@NStyles</a> on X, a shareholder asked whether there was a specific reason for the shortage of consoles and whether Nintendo had failed to predict the overwhelming response from consumers at launch.</p>
<p>Furukawa was understandably coy regarding specifics, but apologised for not being able to meet demand, acknowledging that even a few shareholders have not been able to get their hands on the Switch 2 yet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Currently, in many countries, the demand for Switch2 exceeds the supply, and we are unable to meet it. We understand that some shareholders have also been unable to obtain it. We started accepting lottery sales at My Nintendo Store in April. The response far exceeded our expectations, and I announced in my name on X that there were 2.2 million applicants, along with an apology.</p>
<p>"Since then, we have conducted four lottery sales, but some people were not selected. We have announced that the fifth lottery will take place starting in July. Many general retailers have also conducted lottery sales. The number of stores offering in-store sales is gradually increasing.</p>
<p>"As a company, we are working to improve our production system to deliver as many units as possible. We apologise for the inconvenience caused by this initial demand, which greatly exceeded our expectations."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When discussing the lottery system in more detail during a later question, Furukawa stated that the company had received both positive and negative feedback, and aims to improve the system further for future product launches.</p>
<p>Furukawa also states the importance of including the Nintendo Account as a qualifying factor in applying for the lottery, noting that relationships with customers often ended in the past when moving onto a new hardware generation. He believes the Nintendo Account is crucial in maintaining "long and positive" relationships with customers.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/vigor-pc-release-early-access/">Bohemia Interactive</a> has announced the next expansion for DayZ, titled Badlands, which adds a new desert environment in the Nasdara province, new variants of infected that have adapted to the harsh rule of the desert, and more when it arrives sometime in 2026.</p>
<p>Badlands adds "<em>the largest official map in the game's history,</em>" according to Bohemia Interactive in a press release, with 267 square kilometers of desert for players to explore in Nasdara's desert. It's also not just dry sand as far as the eye can see. There are towns, ruins, oil fields, and plenty of environmental storytelling to discover in the post-war desert.</p>
<p><iframe title="DayZ Badlands - Expansion Announcement Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2oad7AX7gWM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The desert also brings a few desert-specific survival elements, meaning players will need to keep an eye on how hydrated they are and stay out of the sun to keep cool and alive. And as previously mentioned, there's more to watch out for beyond the regular-world desert hazards, with new variants of infected that have all been warped by the desert.</p>
<p>Bohemia Interactive also adds that this expansion will feature "<em>player-driven storytelling</em>," as players form factions and discover "<em>forgotten secrets.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Bohemia Interactive vows to push the boundaries of what survival means in the DayZ universe with DayZ Badlands</em>," the studio writes in a press release. "<em>From the scorched cities to the silent sands, Nasdara is a land shaped by war, reset by the outbreak, now waiting for new stories to be written in its sands</em>."</p>
<p>This is a big switch from the last major expansion for DayZ, which was<a href="https://wccftech.com/dayz-frostline-expansion-announced-livonia-dlc-free/"> Frostline</a>, taking players to the dead of winter, instead of the desert. Hopefully, we'll know more about this expansion soon, like a proper release date instead of its current release window for next year, and get a better look at what to expect when we head into the desert.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From web-slinging teenagers to mutants with god-like powers, I think just about any gamer who's ever read a Marvel comic or watched a Marvel movie or show has thought to themselves&nbsp;<em>this would be pretty sick to play in an RPG</em>. And while RPG systems have come and gone, the newest entry in town,&nbsp;<em>The Marvel Multiverse RPG</em>, from CMON is here to help you get right into the action. Distributor Asmodee USA sent along a copy of the new Starter Set for us to check out, so you know what to do... read on for my thoughts!</p>

<h2>What's Included In <em>The Marvel Multiverse RPG</em> Escape From Planet Hulk Starter Kit?</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-multiverse-roleplaying-contents.jpg?itok=Hwz2G0_o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-multiverse-roleplaying-contents.jpg?itok=XO1szYQz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Escape from Planet Hulk Starter Kit comes with everyone you need to get your group of gamers suited up and ready to fight the big bads. Each set contains:</p>

<ul><li>Booklet with Starter Set Rules, 64 pages</li>
	<li>Booklet with Power References, 8 pages</li>
	<li>Booklet with “Escape from Planet Hulk Adventure”, 24 pages</li>
	<li>6 Character Sheet Folios</li>
	<li>One 2-sided giant map, sized 864x1120 mm &nbsp;</li>
	<li>1 Punchboard with 6 Heroes and 50 round tokens for Villains and other Characters</li>
	<li>3 custom “616” Dice (2 regular dice and 1 Marvel dice)</li>
</ul><p>With one Game Master and six available characters to play with, you could potentially run this box set for a group of 7! I wouldn't recommend it, that feels a little on the heavy side to me, but it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;possible. The included characters are an interesting mix, allowing you to play as Black Panther, Captain America, Black Widow, Storm, Spider-man (Miles Morales), and Wolverine (Laura Kinney).</p>

<h2>The Adventure In The Box</h2>

<p>The adventure contained in the box begins with a bang, as our characters find themselves instantly and magically transported to Planet Hulk by The Grandmaster, where they're forced to face off against robotic drones in a televised bout. But as a captured Hulk begins doing what he does best, chaos erupts and offers our heroes a chance for escape.</p>

<p>Without spoiling too much of the story for interested players, you'll spend the rest of the adventure finding other captured (and unexpected) allies, battling back against the Grandmaster, and using your strength, speed, and cunning to make an escape - but not before an iconic villain steps into your path to mess things up.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-multiverse-roleplaying-rules.jpg?itok=l4PfTFXx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-multiverse-roleplaying-rules.jpg?itok=gUb1b99W 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Powers are central to the game, and the introductory rulebook gives us a nice intro. There's a much more intense additional book of powers, too.</figcaption></figure><p>This adventure works really well as a teaching device, slowly introducing the many different systems of the game. The funny thing about&nbsp;<em>Marvel Multiverse&nbsp;</em>is that, for a system designed around such a popular IP, it's honestly kind of crunchy! So having an introductory adventure to guide both the game master and the players through is crucial. I'm honestly not sure that I'd want to run this game straight out of the core rulebook for new players.</p>

<h2>The Core Mechanic Behind <em>Marvel Multiverse RPG</em></h2>

<p>The core mechanic of the game revolves around the ingenious d616 system. In essence, this system sees you rolling 3d6, with one of the three d6's being designated the Marvel die. Those dice are rolled, added up (along with any relevant modifiers), and set against a target number to beat. If you beat the number, your action (attacking a villain, throwing a car, shooting laser beams from your eyes) is successful (and damage will be rolled if relevant).</p>

<p>But here's where the system has a fun twist - the Marvel die. If you roll a six on that die,&nbsp;<em>something</em>&nbsp;good will happen whether you succeed or fail the check. So, for example, let's say you're playing as Captain America, and you want to use your shield to smash a control panel before automatic doors slam shut, locking you inside a chamber. You roll your dice and fail the check, but that Marvel die is a 6!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-multiverse-roleplaying-tokens-and-dice.jpg?itok=Du4gy4La 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-multiverse-roleplaying-tokens-and-dice.jpg?itok=zZiL4_qZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A roll like this is a huge success, and creates even better situations for the heroes.</figcaption></figure><p>How do we squeak out some benefit from this failure? Maybe the shield ricochets off of the console and, while it doesn't shut it down, it bounces and crashes into an air duct, opening up a new (but potentially more complicated or dangerous) route of escape! Or maybe the shield misses the console completely, but knocks out a few of the guards coming to take you down!</p>

<p>Though the game can get complicated with its damage and powers, this element really shines bright for me. It reminds me of the Fantasy Flight <i>Star Wars</i>&nbsp;RPG's like&nbsp;<em>Edge of Empire</em>, where you would roll custom dice with pips that could see you failing a check but still getting some sort of benefit (or the opposite, succeeding with some bad luck thrown in). This leads to a lot of narrative flexibility, inviting both the players and the DM to get into character and think creatively about the situation they find themselves in.</p>

<h2>BONUS:&nbsp;<em>Marvel Multiverse RPG&nbsp;</em>2D Miniatures</h2>

<p>The adventure itself only includes cardboard tokens for your heroes and villains, but Asmodee also sent along their two new kits of 2D miniatures, which each feature a random assortment of heroes and villains. It should be noted that this product wasn't made with the adventure in mind - so none of these characters show up in the adventure itself.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-multiverse-roleplaying-2d-minis-2.jpg?itok=uJZ4fyVu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-multiverse-roleplaying-2d-minis-2.jpg?itok=OdVQ2zUO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first pack contains Captain Marvel, Photon, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, Titania, Iron Man, Bullseye, Jessica Jones, Kraven the Hunter, and Doctor Doom. That's quite the mix!</p>

<p>I really like the quality of these 2D acrylic miniatures - in a world where plastic painted minis are constantly elbowing for space on my shelves, it's nice to be able to tuck twenty miniatures into a tuck box.</p>

<p>And I think the 2D nature even adds to the experience when playing with these comic book characters. It's like they're jumping off the page!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-multiverse-roleplaying-2d-minis-1.jpg?itok=BB-lHZqw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-multiverse-roleplaying-2d-minis-1.jpg?itok=aw1H9-9I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The second set contains the following characters: Ms. Marvel, Wasp, Thanos, Sabretooth, Luke Cage, Doctor Strange, Doctor Octopus, America Chavez, Hela, and Iceman.</p>

<p>It's an odd assortment across these two kits, but I think it encourages players and GM's to incorporate these heroes and villains into the game in a fun way. It's kind of like hero and villain adlibs! I could see a GM looking at this pile of miniatures and, in a pinch, throwing Doctor Octopus, Titania, and Luke Cage into a scene just to see what happens.</p>



<p>Giving final thoughts on this product is interesting, because I have different thoughts about the game system itself and this box, but how do they intersect with one another?</p>

<p>I find the game itself to have a really fun core mechanic, I love that d616 dice rolling mechanic, it's clean and easy to grasp, but then there are other elements - like the way you calculate damage - that either feel unbalanced or overly complicated.</p>

<p>But here's where it gets confusing for me - I'm not&nbsp;<em>just</em>&nbsp;reviewing the core system, and I think this box itself is pretty damn great! With a nice and slow intro into the game, and good components, this Starter Set could help a lot of players get past the learning curve.</p>

<p>If you love comic book action, and the Marvel comic book world, this is a great entry point - but be warned, this isn't going to be the Kapow! kind of action you might expect from a Marvel RPG.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bohemia Interactive has announced&nbsp;<em>Badlands</em>, the third major expansion for zombie survival sandbox&nbsp;<em>DayZ</em>, and it's bringing the game's biggest map ever and more next year.</p>

<p>As you might have guessed from the name,&nbsp;<em>Badlands</em>, which is due out next year,&nbsp;will take place in a desert environment, namely the province of Nasdara, described by Bohemia as "a war-scarred desert region where thirst is lethal".</p>

<p>Nasdara offers the biggest map in&nbsp;<em>DayZ&nbsp;</em>history, according to the developers; it'll provide you with a staggering 267 kilometers squared to explore, which works out at roughly 103 square miles. That's a lot of wandering.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dayz-badlands-2026-vista.jpg?itok=ICG8zKWO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dayz-badlands-2026-vista.jpg?itok=4SR6VN19 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Badlands</em>, the third major&nbsp;<em>DayZ&nbsp;</em>expansion, is due out next year.</figcaption></figure><p>Bohemia Interactive is promising the chance to "endure droughts, manage hydration, and survive a harsh arid spring climate" as you explore Nasdara, which, the developer says, will tell "a story of failed invasions, abandoned cities, and the silence that followed decades of war".</p>

<p>Not only will you find "dense towns, abandoned ruins, oil fields, and infrastructure left behind by war", but you'll also get the chance to encounter specific infected variants unique to Nasdara. You'll also find loot "tailored to the region".</p>

<p>Of course, the new region also offers the opportunity for some more of&nbsp;<em>DayZ</em>'s classic player-driven storytelling, so there will be plenty of stalking through silent towns only to get suddenly sniped by someone a hundred meters away. Joy of joys.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>DayZ Badlands&nbsp;</em>right here. It doesn't give too much away about what you can expect from the expansion, but it will give you a sense of what the vibe will be.</p>




<p>Last year saw developer Bohemia <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bohemia-interactive-revenue-up-2024" rel="nofollow">enjoy an "extremely successful" twelve months</a>, driven by the success of&nbsp;<em>Arma Reforger</em>&nbsp;and other titles (including&nbsp;<em>DayZ</em>, no doubt).</p>

<p>Alongside the long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Arma 4</em>,&nbsp;Bohemia is also currently hard at work on&nbsp;<em>KSA</em>, a so-called "<em>Kerbal Space Program&nbsp;</em>killer" that should help to fill the (quite literal) void left by Take-Two's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-denies-roll7-intercept-closure" rel="nofollow">supposed dastardly machinations</a>.</p>

<p><em>DayZ Badlands&nbsp;</em>launches across PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One (and current-gen machines thanks to backwards compatibility) next year. We don't have a more specific release date for it than that yet, unfortunately.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/riot-games-responsibly-opens-esports-betting-sponsorships.1230057/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has announced it will open up "betting sponsorship opportunities" for Tier 1&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>and<em>&nbsp;Valorant&nbsp;</em>teams in the Americas and EMEA regions, but the studio says it's implemented "safeguards to protect competitive integrity and the fan experience".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/esports-betting-sponsorships" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official Riot website, the studio's esports head John Needham says that since sports betting "already exists" around Riot's games and "will continue whether we engage with it or not", the studio made the choice to open up sports betting sponsorships "to create more revenue opportunities for teams".</p>

<p>Needham says that although he knows "some fans have strong feelings" about sports betting, it's "a space that more fans choose to engage with every year", and so it's better for Riot to "engage in allowing betting sponsorships" with appropriate protections "than to sit on the sidelines while risks to fans and integrity go unchecked".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/valorant-riot-games-esports-betting.jpg?itok=QSukDiW2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/valorant-riot-games-esports-betting.jpg?itok=FBACfTyV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Riot is opening up esports betting sponsorships for some&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>and<em>&nbsp;Valorant&nbsp;</em>esports teams.</figcaption></figure><p>In practical terms, this means that esports teams in the&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Valorant&nbsp;</i>spaces will be allowed to seek sponsorships from sports betting companies, many of whom already take bets on esports.</p>

<p>Riot says it's taking a "guardrails first" approach to this decision. The studio promises to "vet and approve all potential sports betting partners", as well as to require teams to create and enforce an Internal Integrity Program to ensure competitive integrity.</p>

<p>Additionally, although Tier 2 teams can't seek esports betting sponsorships, Riot says it'll invest some of the revenues from its new sports betting program into Tier 2. This will involve boosting prize pools, more training, and "additional integrity system developments".</p>

<p>What's more, if you're watching Tier 1 Riot esports, the studio says all of its broadcast and social channels "will stay betting-free", so you won't see sports betting ads or logos on team apparel. You may, however, see this stuff on official non-Riot team channels.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/league-of-legends-riot-games-esports-betting.jpg?itok=4krBl_nl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/league-of-legends-riot-games-esports-betting.jpg?itok=2ps_kInn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Riot has promised you won't see esports betting content during official Riot-owned broadcasts.</figcaption></figure><p>There's some truth to Riot's statement that this kind of thing will go on anyway, regardless of whether the company gets involved or not. According to Statista (via <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/esports-betting-statistics-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Esports Insider</a>), the esports betting industry brought in $2.5 billion in revenue in 2024 alone, and that number is only set to grow.</p>

<p>However, according to the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/gambling" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">World Health Organization</a>, around 5.5% of women and about 12% of men around the world "experience some level of harm from gambling", with one Swedish study suggesting that those suffering from gambling disorders were "15 times more likely to due by suicide than the general population".</p>

<p>With stats like that floating around, it's no wonder some are squeamish when it comes to esports betting sponsorships; after all, betting on video game events is still betting, and it comes with all of the usual associated risks and harms that betting does.</p>

<p>Still, it looks like Riot is determined to press on with this decision, so expect to start seeing more and more esports betting sites on the jerseys of&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>esports teams (as long as you're not viewing through Riot, of course).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><em>You never stay in the same place forever, and every move, whether by choice or by circumstance, leaves a mark. </em></p><p><em>Absent a money chest falling from the heavens, Patrick is locked into his house until his children leave for college. He's in a great neighborhood, lucked into buying a place when prices were normal and interest rates were criminally low, and managed to put up a pool in his backyard.</em></p><p><em>Rob, on the other hand, has been where many are these days: stuck. At the age where, if you've had a successful career, you "should" be able to buy a place, especially if you're sharing it with a partner. But "should" these days isn't what it used to be, and you need luck—or money.</em></p><p><em>Or both?</em></p><p><em>As Rob prepares to move, he talks to Patrick about the process of moving, what it's been like to move in the past, and lessons from old moves.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Rob: </strong>Knock on wood, we’re going to be moving to a new home in the next month or so. It’s our first move in almost ten years, meaning we’ve lived in our condo for longer than anywhere else in our adult lives. Moving was a regular feature of our twenties and early thirties, and we never expected when we rented our condo in 2016 that our wandering days were behind us. The stability has been nice, but my God are we out of practice. By the time we moved here, we were pretty much able to book movers and have the entire thing done over the course of an afternoon. Now, I’ll be stunned if it doesn’t take us two or three days just to get our stuff into the new place.</p><p>Sometimes I start to panic thinking about the fact that this is the Big One. Barring hugely unforeseen circumstances, this is the last move prior to the life changes that come with old age. The thought of not having to deal with this again is causing me to vibrate with joy, and yet there’s a part of me that’s almost perplexed by the idea. I’ve <em>always </em>had moving or home-buying at the back of my mind. I’ve been in this condo for a long time, but it was never the <em>destination</em>. I’m struggling to know how to describe what feels so strange about this. It’s like you always have some murky impression of the future you intend and you spend a lot of time and organize a lot of your life around bringing it closer. Then suddenly the fog burns away and you are dealing with the concrete reality of your life. But a sense of possibility and time are exchanged for it. Your home isn’t waiting for you out there “someday.” It’s here. This is where you’re going to live. This is how the story turned out.</p><p>The best way I can describe how life feels right now is that at any moment the soundtrack might be the bittersweet bliss of “This Must Be the Place” or the slightly baffled panic of “Once in a Lifetime” but the thing I can’t do is stop the music. At any moment of the day, David Byrne might start singing at me about love and death, happiness and regret. Oh, you need to go get the groceries? By chance do you find yourself at the wheel of a large automobile? Shame if you started wondering where that highway goes to and asking, “My God, what have I done?”</p><p>Dave, I’m just trying to close on this place and buy some frozen pizzas. Give me a fucking break, man.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@dinaamazing?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Dina Badamshina</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>With only a few exceptions, we moved every single year that we lived in both San Francisco and Los Angeles throughout my 20s. Part of that was because we didn’t have any money, so the moment one of us would switch jobs or get a pay raise and we suddenly didn’t <em>have</em> to drink malt liquor before going out to avoid paying for drinks at the bar, we’d move elsewhere. Plus, though it went mostly unsaid at the time, we both knew California was not where we were going to end up. Both of us wanted kids, both of us wanted to be closer to family. It wasn’t clear at the time that we’d be doing that together, but that created a permission structure where every year, we just made peace with boxing up our shit, convincing some friends to swing by in exchange for pizza and beer, and making the trek to a new crappy apartment in a neighborhood that was unfamiliar to us. It didn’t seem hard because I knew later in life, it actually <em>would</em> be really hard, so while I have no belongings and attachments, why not see as much of the world as I can?</p><p>The one time we used actual movers was going from San Francisco back to Chicago, where our continued squeamishness over spending money did bite me in the ass a little bit. We had this extremely cool strandup arcade machine that was technically a Bust a Move/Puzzle Bobble machine, that game with the cute dinosaurs where you match colored balloons and, if done in great enough numbers, send them to the other player. It’s awesome. At an arcade festival south of San Francisco, my wife and I rented a hotel room at the place the event was attached to. I joked about getting an arcade machine, but my wife balked at spending the money. Plus, we’d driven there in a tiny car. How the hell would we get the machine back?</p><p>Several drinks into the night, though, my wife became transfixed by this Puzzle Bobble machine. She does not play many video games but she <em>is</em> good at games like Tetris. She lined up to play and proceeded to absolutely wrecking shop. I’m sure everyone has a memory of the older kid at the Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter II machine taking advantage of the young kids stepping up, never losing and never giving up their spot. This was my wife in Puzzle Bobble, except she was drunk and tearing apart all these other adults.</p><p>It ruled! Great memory. But it’s at this point she notices the price of the machine is, I don’t know, let’s say $600. She recalled how a friend of ours is an arcade collector and offered to A) negotiate the price down and B) find a way to make it back to our apartment in San Francisco. Looking me in the eye, thinking about the next Miller Lite, she gave me a simple request: “Put in the call and see if we can get that thing.”</p>

When it was first released in 1997, <em>Turok</em> introduced gamers to a world teeming with cunning enemies, traps, puzzles, and deadly weapons, all within a vast 3D environment ready to explore.

The Chronoscepter was shattered thousands of years ago in an effort to keep it from falling into evil hands. The Campaigner has constructed a massive focusing array which he plans to use to magnify and contain the power of the Chronoscepter to shatter the barriers between the ages and rule the universe. Turok has vowed to find the eight pieces of the Chronoscepter spread throughout the Lost Land and put an end to The Campaigner’s evil plot…</p><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>Raccoon City was the American setting where Resident Evil began. After multiple instalments set around the world, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-requiem/">Resident Evil Requiem</a> producer Masato Kumazawa shared why the series is returning to the ruins of this iconic city.</p><p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/26/resident-evil-requiem-producer-masato-kumazawa-qa/" rel="nofollow ">PlayStation Blog</a> interview, Kumazawa explained that after more recent titles that had explored "the broader universe" of Resident Evil, Capcom wanted a story that "continues the overarching narrative rooted in Raccoon City and the secret machinations of the Umbrella Corporation."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lW8ZCgihDQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9lW8ZCgihDQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Following the T-virus outbreak, the US government ordered a missile strike to destroy the city in order to eradicate the virus. In having players return to its ruins about 30 years later, Kumazawa said that the team also wanted a character "with a personal connection to the city itself," introducing Grace Ashcroft, the presumed daughter of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-outbreak/">Resident Evil: Outbreak</a>'s Alyssa Ashcroft.</p><p dir="ltr">Kumazawa described Grace as a "relatable protagonist," adding, "By making Grace someone who reflects the player’s own vulnerability, we believe players will enjoy a gameplay experience filled with tension and immersion. When walking alone down a dark hallway, her breathing becomes erratic; when an enemy suddenly appears, she jumps in fright. Grace is a character with a low tolerance for fear, but she grows throughout the story and eventually begins to confront various horrors with courage."</p><p dir="ltr">The game's director Koshi Nakanishi had also echoed this sentiment during the game's appearance at a Capcom showcase, when explaining that the decision not to have Leon Kennedy as a protagonist was that he would have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-games/1100-6532769/">"a bad match for horror."</a></p><p dir="ltr">Kumazawa also elaborated on Resident Evil Requiem's concept of "addictive fear," a compulsion to want to know what will happen next even though you might find it terrifying. "The reason behind this concept is that recent entries in the series, such as Resident Evil Village and Resident Evil 4, while still horror titles, leaned heavily into action," he explained. "With the latest installment we wanted to return to a game that puts a strong focus on horror."</p><p dir="ltr">The return to Raccoon City and to the series' horror roots is also good timing for Resident Evil's 30th anniversary next year, when Resident Evil Requiem releases. It hits Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC on February 27, 2026.</p>

		<p>While the Mortal Kombat movies seem to be happy with casting lesser known actors the new Street Fighter movie seems to be following the pattern set by the 1994 movie, which had wacky stunt casting with Jean Claude Van Damme facing against Australian pop princess, Kylie Minogue.</p>
<p>Here’s the cast for the new Street Fighter movie so far:</p>


<ul>
<li>Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson should need no introduction and he will be playing Balrog, which seems a good fit.</li>
<li>Jason Momoa will be playing Blanka. Mr. Momao while muscly, is is notably not a hulk, and also not green, so how this is going to work remains to be seen.</li>
<li>Noah Centineo is a teen idol over in the United States but over here in the UK you may remember him (and I’m being generous here) as Atom Smasher in the Black Adam movie.</li>
<li>Andrew Koji is a British actor who specialise in martials art. You may have seen him as Storm Shadow in Snake Eyes and Yuichi “The Father” Kimura in the excellent Bullet Train, and he will be playing Ryu.</li>
<li>Orville Peck, the gay country and western singer, will be playing Vega. This is genius casting, Vega is camp as tits. Also it links back to the original movie as Orville and Kylie recently released a single together, so Vega and Cammy can duet!</li>
<li>Joe Anoa’i will be more familiar to you as WWE superstar Roman Reign, and he has been cast as Akuma.</li>
<li>Callina Liang is a Canadian actress best known for Steven Soderbergh’s Presence her role in the ITVX teen drama Tell Me Everything.</li>
<li>Andrew Schulz is the latest casting, the American stand-up comedian, actor, and podcaster, will be playing a lesser know character, Dan Hibiki.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kitao Sakurai will be directing the movie, his previous directing credits include the 2021 Netflix film Bad Trip… and that’s it.</p>
<p>It is said that the cast are already in training, although there is no word on a script yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Review: DBrand Switch 2 Killswitch case 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b7ec4f834f7cb/review-dbrand-switch-2-killswitch-case-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: James Mielke / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Dbrand knows its target audience. Excited new Switch 2 owners are, of course, the <em>perfect</em> consumers to sell a protective cover/skin/case to, with early adopters eager for reliable ways to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-2-cases-to-carry-and-protect-your-console">protect their pricey new handhelds</a> before it accidentally slips out of hand (or in my case, off of lap and onto the floor). The resulting damage (mild scuffs on the top of my left JoyCon) wasn’t bad enough to cause deep regret, but it was enough for me to wish I didn’t have to wait for my pre-ordered Dbrand Killswitch case to arrive, and that I could just buy it in-store. But one holds out for quality, even if it’s not a Day One acquisition.</p>
<p>I was confident in preordering <a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/killswitch/nintendo-switch-2-cases">Dbrand’s Switch 2 Killswitch case</a> (despite the suspect name) because I have had a great experience with their <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/reviews/steam-deck-oled-the-best-just-got-better">Steam Deck</a> case, which was, in turn, recommended to me by an internet friend. Up until I purchased a <a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/killswitch/steam-deck-cases">Killswitch for my Steam Deck</a>, I had been using the also-excellent <a href="https://www.amazon.com/JSAUX-PC0104-Detachable-Accessories-Protective/dp/B0BY2G5V4Z/ref=asc_df_B0BRXHK2QL?th=1&amp;tag=nlife-20" rel="sponsored noopener">JSAUX Mod Case for Steam Decks</a>, which is maybe the best budget case for Decks, but the Killswitch was superior enough in my eyes to warrant the upgrade.</p>
<p>Seeing as Dbrand's Steam Deck case is so sturdy and perfect at its job, I had every confidence the Switch equivalent would be too — and for the most part it is, with a couple of caveats.</p>
<p>But first, here are your options when deciding on which Killswitch bundle to get:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Essential</strong>: (1) Killswitch case, (1) skin of your choice, and (1) Dock Adapter (<a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/killswitch/nintendo-switch-2-cases?design=ns2-colormatch&amp;kit=essential#buy">$59.95</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Travel</strong>: Which comes with the same as the Essential bundle, but with the Travel Cover with Game Card Holder and a set of Stick Grips to put on top of the default JoyCon sticks to provide extra, er, grip (<a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/killswitch/nintendo-switch-2-cases?design=ns2-colormatch&amp;kit=travel#buy">$79.85</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Ultra</strong>: Which includes all of the above, plus two screen protectors (<a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/killswitch/nintendo-switch-2-cases?design=ns2-colormatch&amp;kit=ultra#buy">$99.80</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Other items that come with whichever bundle you opt for are two soft screen cloths, a stiff cardboard bubble squeegee, and a packet of “spare adhesive” (which I never needed in any aspect of popping the console into the case). All of the items come packaged in a box laden with die-cut foam resting places for each piece, and the box itself has a smart-looking schematic of the case itself, on all sides of its glorious matte finish. To be honest, the box is almost <em>too</em> nice for something that’ll be shelved or, god forbid, discarded after the case is applied. Even the bag the KillSwitch box is shipped in is heavy-duty, insulated, and waterproof. Your carrier would have to go out of their way to damage your goods here.</p>
<figure><a title="Review: DBrand Switch 2 Killswitch case 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8452995c0174a/review-dbrand-switch-2-killswitch-case-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>The Dock Adapter and Killswitch side-by-side — <em>Image: James Mielke / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can also add an additional Game Card Holder for an extra $15 bucks USD, but I skipped that because it’s basically the exact same tray included with the Travel Cover, and it’s not designed to stack with the Travel Cover’s included card holder, or anything. It’s a snap-in tray that holds 10 Switch carts (compatible with Switch 1 and 2, of course, since they’re the same shape) — and by itself, an extra Card Holder would just leave the carts awkwardly exposed, compared to a proper clamshell game case that closes shut. I can’t really imagine anyone needing a second Game Card Holder as their primary option for bringing extra games with them. Is 10 games not enough to go? <em>Are you not entertained?</em> Personally, I’m confident that between physical and digital, 10 carts will hold me over to wherever I’m going, even on a month-long vacation.</p>
<p>So the Switch 2 Killswitch case is made from, as Dbrand puts it, a “blend of impact-resistant and structurally rigid thermoplastics... engineered to absorb shock, diffuse force, and dramatically improve your odds of walking away from a drop with both your console and dignity intact.” The Switch 2 version, then, is made from the same materials as the Steam Deck and ROG Ally cases, which are confidence-inspiring and tough. It’s not that brittle plastic that cheap toys and cases are made out of. When you feel it, you know this is the type of material that is built to outlast the console itself.</p>
<p>I don’t make a habit of dropping my Steam Deck, but it is big, heavy, and bulky for a handheld, and in the rare instances I <em>have</em> dropped it, it has survived each time, intact. While the Joy-Con 2 shoulder buttons are exposed, the Switch 2 Killswitch's grip covers (sans Travel Cover) extend by a millimetre all around — similar to minimalistic smartphone cases — significantly reducing the potential for major damage to the controllers. With the Travel Cover on, every aspect of the Switch 2 is covered by the case.</p>
<p>The controllers, in the worst case scenario, are replaceable; the Switch 2’s body and screen are less easily replaced. Fortunately, the Killswitch provides excellent protection. The main chassis of the case is beautifully engineered, with bevelled, die-cut openings for all the buttons, vents, USB, speaker, headphone, and cartridge ports, which means you can take advantage of either top or bottom USB-C port to charge the system even when encased. The Switch 2’s redesigned kickstand also gets a lovingly engineered opening to allow it to extend easily to its full range of motion if desired, <em>and</em> Dbrand includes an adhesive-backed kickstand cover to add comprehensive protection to the backside of your Switch 2, keeping all of the ‘puzzle pieces’ protected.</p>

<p>Of course, the various ‘skin’ options are a nice way to dress up your Joy-Con 2 controllers if you don’t feel like rolling out with the standard orange and blue theme. I opted for the ‘X-ray (dark)’ skin, because I like translucent ‘skeleton’ consoles whenever they’re available (which is not as often as I’d like). The skins, which basically just cover the front of your Joy-Con 2, are a quality vinyl with tacky, removable backing which fit seamlessly with the grips, without causing any bubble-up on the edges, and offer a nice, tactile matte finish that protects the surface of your Joy-Con 2.</p>
<p>A subtle consideration is that they also give the console a less pronounced Switch 2 ‘look,’ which may help the handheld stick out a little bit <em>less</em>. While I ordered the ‘X-ray (dark)’ skin, for whatever reason, Dbrand also included a ‘X-Ray (light)’ skin, for a total of two skins. Early adopter perk? I dunno, but it was a nice bonus either way.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck cover, for comparison, is form-fitting, primarily because the handheld is actually designed with heft to the handgrips, whereas the Switch 2 version adds actual, grabbable grips (very helpful for bigger hands) to the Joy-Cons otherwise flat profile, which while offering a lighter, streamlined profile to hold, can actually cause fatigue as the controllers are notoriously <em>thin</em>. The Killswitch grips offer a satisfying amount of tactile surface space to wrap your hands around, with the same textured feel as their other cases, and the same, smooth, signature stripes found on the Steam Deck and <a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/killswitch/rog-ally-cases">ROG Ally</a> models.</p>
<p>This, of course, is where the Switch 2 Killswitch differs from the other Dbrand handheld cases, because while those are single-piece cases, the Switch 2 version arrives in three pieces, if you’re not counting the Dock Adapter (which comes free with every case, by the way). While the grips fit the Joy-Con 2 quite neatly, the case just comes to a stop, flush with the inner part of the Joy-Con, without really clamping on or snapping into place in a satisfying way.</p>

<p>I thought this was going to be a problem at first — can’t be helped, it’s the only handheld with removable controllers — but ever since I put the grips on the Joy-Cons, I haven’t had any issues, especially since I spend most of my time in handheld mode. If you’re not accidentally pressing down on the Joy-Con ‘release’ button, the controllers stay where they should, as they should (at least for me, they did).</p>
<p>Even with the Killswitch equipped, the Switch 2 is still slightly narrower by a few millimetres on the left and right than an un-cased Steam Deck, with the Switch 2 certainly thinner from front to back. While it is heavier than an un-cased Switch 2, overall it’s not as fatigue-inducing as a fully-kitted Steam Deck. However, this added weight is seemingly responsible for one of the main complaints about the Switch 2-specific Killswitch, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/psa-dbrands-switch-2-killswitch-dock-adapters-seamless-docking-apparently-isnt-quite-seamless">and that’s that Joy-Con can become detached a <em>little</em> too easily</a> if you hold the console in the wrong way. The Switch 2 with Killswitch case installed weighs 670 grams, while a similarly equipped Steam Deck comes in at 832 grams. A significant weight difference, surely, but the moral of the story here is don’t expect your magnets to save the day, case or no case.</p>
<p>While I <em>personally</em> didn’t encounter this problem because I am experienced enough not to expect a discreetly embedded array of magnetic points to carry the weight of the entire console in motion, not everyone will be so lucky. All I'll say is it pays to be careful and support the body of your Switch 2 with a couple of fingers, just to be safe.</p>
<p>Regardless of my experience, enough people <em>have</em> had this issue to compel Dbrand to issue a statement about it. Well, two statements actually. The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/psa-dbrands-switch-2-killswitch-dock-adapters-seamless-docking-apparently-isnt-quite-seamless">first one</a> sort of blames the problem on the way people hold their Switch 2, and the second one apologises for blaming the way people hold their Switch 2. More importantly, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/dbrand-admits-its-joy-con-detachment-response-was-spectacularly-terrible">Dbrand said in this second statement</a> that they would replace everyone’s Joy-Con grips, whether they’ve had this issue or not.</p>

<p>While it is certainly optional, I consider the Travel Cover/Game Card Holder essential. Why go through all this trouble to damage-proof your Switch 2 and not protect its most vulnerable asset: the screen? Not only is the Travel Cover made from the same sturdy polymers as the rest of the case, it also doubles as an attractive, translucent, smoky-coloured screen and button shield that also lets you carry 10 carts (plus the one in the Switch 2 cart slot) to boot.</p>
<p>While the Steam Deck equivalent features a confidence-inspiring grille design to keep things from applying pressure or poking at your OLED screen, the Switch 2 Travel Cover has a flat but raised profile that keeps ample space between the exterior of the cover, and your fragile, plastic screen. The surface of the Travel Cover is also embossed with decorative button moulding to help you orient the direction of the cover before you put it on.</p>
<p>The ‘Ultra’ bundle I got comes with two screen protectors — Dbrand describes these as “tempered glass screen protectors with idiot-proof installation trays” — so, if you’re an idiot, they designed this to save you from yourself. In practice, the box comes complete with a screen applicator similar to the excessive plastic contraptions that come with Spigen smartphone screen protectors, ensuring a perfect screen application and fit onto your Switch 2.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I already applied the screen protector that came with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-carry-case-the-official-option-is-a-solid-one">official Nintendo Switch 2 carrying case</a> (I didn’t expect Nintendo to be so generous like that, actually), since I had to wait a few extra weeks for my Killswitch to arrive. So until my current one needs replacing, I’ll keep these on standby.</p>
<figure><a title="Review: DBrand Switch 2 Killswitch case 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/605170e92ad00/review-dbrand-switch-2-killswitch-case-5.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>The Game Card Holder is an excellent, well-designed way to carry up to 10 carts (plus the one in the chamber) without needing an extra HORI or Power A game case. It's held in place by magnets embedded in the case — <em>Image: James Mielke / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike the Steam Deck/ROG Ally equivalent of the Travel Cover, which is clamped into place by a tab at the bottom of the cover and handheld, the Switch 2 version is actually held in place by a high-quality, braided elastic cable mounted on the back by two extremely sturdy toggles. This cable is then contained at the anchor point within a heavy-duty tube that wraps around from back to front and rests in a perfectly fitting clasp.</p>
<p>While I have no doubts that this cable system is built to last, and will likely outlive the device itself, I do sort of miss the snap-into-place design of the Steam Deck version. It is possible, however, that Dbrand designed it like this to keep the kickstand in place, should the kickstand ever become loose, <em>or</em> to prevent from applying any pressure on the Switch 2’s delicate array of grilles and USB ports on the bottom of the device.</p>
<p>The main concern I had with Travel Cover is with the Game Card Holder itself, which is basically a tray with some tabs and hard edges that may or may not touch the screen itself when closed into place. So I performed a little experiment with a dry erase marker, which I used to colour the edges of the Card Holder, and then I quickly put the Travel Cover in place with a piece of paper over the screen. After removing the Cover, there were no colour marks transferred to the paper, so there must be enough space between the Card Holder and the screen surface. <em>Phew!</em></p>
<p>The Dock Adapter. There’s not a lot to complain about since it comes with the case for ‘free,’ and it provides a good resting place for charging and for propping up your Switch 2 to play. It’s well-designed, too, with thoughtful vents placed beneath the console’s bottom speaker vents. An upwards-facing USB-C port allows the console to rest and charge at the same time, while an additional USB-C port lets you plug this into an external charging cable. Soft rubber mounts help keep the console in place, although the USB-C does that too. The bottom of the Dock Adapter has rubber feet, keeping the base in place.</p>
<figure><a title="Review: DBrand Switch 2 Killswitch case 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c29aa67da542e/review-dbrand-switch-2-killswitch-case-7.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: James Mielke / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Dock Adapter features "built-in 4k60 passthrough via USB-C", which enables you to dock the Switch 2 without removing your Killswitch case. Overall, it’s a nice bonus inclusion — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/psa-dbrands-switch-2-killswitch-dock-adapters-seamless-docking-apparently-isnt-quite-seamless">just don't expect it to be as seamless a docking experience as Dbrand originally boasted</a>.</p>
<p>While it wouldn’t have hurt to add a USB-A port, it’s hard to complain about a well-designed dock that comes free with every case. That said, it doesn’t really do anything that the Switch 2 couldn’t do on its own, with the kickstand out, and the same cables performing the same functions. It does make things a little more stable, and it does make both USB-C ports accessible, though, so it’s a welcome inclusion in any case.</p>
<p>Overall, Dbrand’s Switch 2 Killswitch is a considerately designed, well-built piece of kit that comes from a fine pedigree of products designed to extend the life of your handheld device, and on this count, the Killswitch very neatly fulfils this promise. It’s a well-made case that’s superior to the usual slew of mediocre options lining store shelves. The Killswitch is tough, beautifully designed, and even has a built-in cart carrying solution. While the jury is still out on whether the Joy-Con grips issue is a widespread problem or something that only affects a small percentage of users, at least Dbrand’s gone on record saying they’ll do right by everyone who bought a Switch 2 Killswitch.</p>
<p>I’d still recommend this case, especially since replacement grips will be sent out to everyone, whether you’re having this issue or not. My confidence in the all-around design of this means I can throw it in my bag on my upcoming month-long trip to Japan (and accompanying 12-hour flight) without any worries for my Switch 2 getting messed up in transit. While slightly pricey for a game case, I’ve found the investment well worth it.</p>

        <p>Quite the gamble, but here's why it's happening.</p>

            <p>Betting sponsorships are being introduced into tier one Valorant and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> esports, Riot Games has revealed.</p>
<p>This announcement <a href="https://x.com/riotgames/status/1938282007148253261">came in the form of a lengthy post by John Needham</a>, head of publishing and esports at Riot Games. In it, Needham justifies the inclusion of sports betting as part of the company's desire to build "a sustainable ecosystem" for its games.</p>
<p>Needham said this is something professional teams "have been asking us to consider for years". Gambling sponsors will be permitted across the Americas and EMEA regions, with no stated plans to permit these sorts of sponsorships among other regions around the world.</p>

<figcaption>Riot Games is promoting esports heavily in League of Legends right now, focused on pro player Uzi.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwYOQl1vptg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Needham goes on to explain: "We know sports betting isn't for everyone, and that some fans have strong feelings about it, and we respect that. However, the reality is that betting activity already exists around our sports and will continue whether we engage with it or not."</p>
<p>He continued: "Historically, this has been a restricted sponsorship category, and Riot has not engaged with betting companies. Teams have asked us to reconsider our stance, and after years of analysis to ensure we got it right, we agreed it was time to open up this category to create more revenue opportunities for teams."</p>
<p>Needham goes on to explain that, according to sports technology company Sportradar, total betting turnover in just League of Legends esports exceeded $10.7bn, with 70 percent of those bets taking place on unregulated sites via unlicensed bookmakers. As such, it is Riot's position from here on out that if betting is going to happen, it may as well happen under its watch.</p>
<p>Needham also established three "guardrails" for its new sports betting partnership program. These include opening up sponsorship opportunities with betting brands to generate revenue, supporting the development of regulations and education programs around esports betting, and strengthening competitive integrity around Riot's esports events.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>If you can believe it, this sort of event is expensive. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Riot Games/ Lol Esports</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's worth noting that recently the tier two Valorant scene was in the midst of a serious competitive integrity scandal, as Sean Gares, general manager of esports team Shopify Rebels, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-hHuBN27Nk&amp;t=2s&amp;ab_channel=seangares">released a video exposing </a>the prevalence of match-fixing and the intentional throwing of games.</p>
<p>In the post Needham then stated Riot would be vetting all betting partners, mandate team integrity checks, and that it would use the proceeds of these betting partnerships to maintain its tier two competitive scene. That tier two scene being an aspect of the wider Riot esports space that has struggled immensely with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23619393/disguised-toast-twitch-streamer-valorant-dsg">financial stability</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, Needham assured the public that no Riot-owned broadcasts would feature advertisements for betting companies. A nice stance, though it's worth noting that <a href="https://escharts.com/news/top-casters-viewership-results-worlds-2024">according to a report by esports charts</a>, 40 percent of English speaking viewership for Worlds (the biggest annual event for League of Legends) come from co-streams. These aren't Riot-owned, and judging by Needham's statement won't be barred from taking betting sponsorships.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>many esports watchers spectate events with streamers like this, rather than directly. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Twitch / Caedrel</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Okay, so why is this happening? Well, as you may or may not know, esports has largely been a hole in which you burn money in. It has historically struggled with generating profit. It has long been true that esports has been sold as a way to reach a younger audience to plenty of massive companies, many of them have since pulled back from the industry <a href="https://digiday.com/media/how-the-worlds-most-ambitious-esports-league-shrank-to-nothing-an-oral-history-of-the-overwatch-league/">following the collapse of the Overwatch League</a>.</p>
<p>Add on top of this an increase in expansion and investment during Covid when interest in gaming was incredibly high. This growth did not continue as expected, leading to a real financial crisis for the esports sector <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2024/03/esports-layoff-tracker-2024">with layoffs hitting the sector in the years </a>following. If you've been paying attention to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">ongoing game development layoffs these past years</a>, it's a similar thing.</p>
<p>But it's actually worse. The problem is that throughout all these years esports teams have either failed to, or ignored the need to, use the money they had to create a stable income revenue. If you release a game, you can sell the game itself or microtransactions. If you own an esports team, you sell… T-shirts? All the games are streamed online for free, you don't have the equivalent of a football stadium. It's dire.</p>
<p>As such esports teams have essentially spent the last few years hopping from one wallet to another, looking for capital to stay afloat. With the speculative investors walking out the door, they've turned to the Saudi Arabian government and its Esports World Cup in recent years. Saudi Arabia, a country with <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/">an ongoing history of human rights abuses</a>, also happens to have a lot of money, and is keen on spending it on PR to make the country look appealing. This is called Sportswashing: it's prevalent in football, F1, and yes, video games.</p>
<p>But even this isn't sustainable. Saudi Arabia could twist the money faucet off any time it wants to, and given the country will be <a href="https://www.olympics.com/ioc/news/inaugural-olympic-esports-games-to-be-held-in-riyadh-in-2027-road-to-the-games-to-start-this-year">hosting the video game olympics starting in 2027</a>, maybe the need to throw away so much money will lessen.</p>
<p>So esports teams need another source of income: gambling. As you can see yourself in Needham's statement, it repeatedly mentions the push from the teams themselves to implement betting sponsors into the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Ultimately, regardless of all the guardrails Riot Games may implement, it's a bummer. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gambling-related-harms-evidence-review/gambling-related-harms-evidence-review-summary--2">Sports betting is addictive</a>. It has and will ruin lives. A UK government report cites two quantitative studies that found deaths from suicide were "significantly higher among adults with gambling disorder or problems compared to the general adult population."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-opens-the-door-to-betting-sponsorships-in-professional-league-of-legends-and-valorant]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-cube-q-a-%E2%80%93-mundfish-confirms-dungeon-like-zones-dynamic-events-and-regular-post-launch-support.1229988/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The unveiling of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-cube-is-an-mmorpg-shooter-set-in-the-atomic-heart-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The CUBE</a> certainly surprised fans of Atomic Heart. While a sequel was more than warranted given that over 10 million people played the original game, they definitely weren't expecting to also get an online multiplayer spin-off featuring MMORPG elements.</p>
<p>When we contacted Mundfish to <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-2-qa-its-a-few-years-out-were-taking-the-time-to-make-it-tighter-and-more-immersive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learn more about Atomic Heart 2</a>, we also set up an interview to discuss The CUBE. Once again, studio founder, CEO, and game director Robert Bagratuni kindly obliged, allowing us to craft this exclusive interview dedicated to the exciting project and the brand new split-rendering technology created specifically for it. Bagratuni also discussed the increased team size to handle all these projects, the current state of the game (internal playtesting), and the desire to support The CUBE well after launch with new content and features.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'I was absentmindedly sketching a tic-tac-toe grid and squares on a notepad. Then a thought hit me: what if these cube tiles rotated? What if its surfaces shifted, folded, expanded? What if this structure wasn’t just abstract, but alive - a space that actually impacted traversal, physics, logic, even multiplayer behavior? That single moment sparked something.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>How many developers from Mundfish are working on The CUBE?</strong></p>
<p>We've grown significantly since the development of Atomic Heart 1. Back then, the entire game was created by a team of around 50 developers, growing to about 80 by the time of release. Today, the structure is quite different: the team has more than doubled in size, and we now have multiple dedicated teams. One team is fully focused on DLC#4 for Atomic Heart 1, another is working on Atomic Heart 2, and a separate team is developing The CUBE.</p>
<p>Many of those working on The CUBE joined the studio after the project received internal greenlight, especially given its multiplayer focus, which required new expertise. That said, of course, there’s crossover between teams, particularly in areas like narrative, where maintaining consistency across our universe is essential. The same goes for shared characters and cutscene production. So, while it’s difficult to give a precise headcount, what’s clear is that each current project is being developed by equally strong teams that are significantly larger than what we had during AH1.</p>
<p><strong>How did you come up with the concept for this game?</strong></p>
<p>It all started with a phone call - one of those long, uneventful conversations where your mind begins to drift. I was absentmindedly sketching a tic-tac-toe grid and squares on a notepad. Then a thought hit me: what if these cube tiles rotated? What if its surfaces shifted, folded, expanded?</p>
<p>What if this structure wasn’t just abstract, but alive - a space that actually impacted traversal, physics, logic, even multiplayer behavior? That single moment sparked something. Oleg Gorodishenin, our executive producer and co-founder, and I quietly excused ourselves from the call. The next two hours were pure creative flow - and by the end of it, The CUBE was born.</p>
<p><strong>Chronologically, does it take place before or after Atomic Heart 2?</strong></p>
<p>Great question, but we’re being careful not to reveal too much just yet. What we can say is that The CUBE takes place after the events of Atomic Heart 1. As for how it connects to Atomic Heart 2, there’s definitely a timeline relationship, but we’ll let players piece that together as more is revealed. The CUBE isn’t just a standalone concept, it’s a key part of the evolving universe.</p>
<p><strong>Can you discuss the split-rendering system? Why is it unique and how does it work?</strong></p>
<p>To bring The CUBE to life, we had to develop entirely new systems that could support a world in constant motion, both structurally and technically. At the heart of this is our split-rendering system, a breakthrough method that allows thousands of objects on what we call “tiles” (or world clusters) to move and rotate in real time across massive multiplayer environments. This isn’t just visual spectacle - it directly affects gameplay, traversal, and the rules of physics inside the world.</p>
<p>The system works by splitting how motion, rendering, and synchronization are handled between client and server, making it possible to maintain seamless transitions, dynamic gravity, and accurate object tracking, even when the entire world around you is shifting. It enables what we think of as a truly living environment, and it's currently patent-pending.</p>
<p>The CUBE is developed on Unreal Engine 5, and we’ve implemented several custom modifications to both its physics and rendering subsystems to fully support our approach. UE5 gives us so much development freedom and the visual fidelity to match the scale and ambition of this concept. At the end of the day, this isn’t just tech for the sake of tech - it’s what allows The Cube to feel unique, unpredictable, and fully alive in the hands of the player.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'The CUBE is not about static quest hubs or routine grinds - it’s about exploration, discovery, and adapting to a shifting, surreal environment that changes over time. Players will engage in cooperative missions, dynamic world events, and possibly confront other players in certain regions, depending on the context. The CUBE itself acts as a living system - part structure, part mystery - and what you do inside it affects both your journey and the shape of the world for others.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You've presented the game as an MMORPG shooter. Could you share which MMORPG elements will be featured?</strong></p>
<p>At its core, The CUBE is built around a deep narrative set in the evolving Atomic Universe. We’re calling it an MMORPG shooter because it blends that strong narrative foundation with large-scale systems: deep and persistent character progression, customizable loadouts, long-term gear upgrades, quests, and evolving objectives, like expeditions, shaped by the community. But unlike traditional MMOs, The CUBE is not about static quest hubs or routine grinds - it’s about exploration, discovery, and adapting to a shifting, surreal environment that changes over time.</p>
<p>Players will engage in cooperative missions, dynamic world events, and possibly confront other players in certain regions, depending on the context. The CUBE itself acts as a living system - part structure, part mystery - and what you do inside it affects both your journey and the shape of the world for others.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any extraction shooter modes or elements in the game? How does PvP work in the game?</strong></p>
<p>While The CUBE offers a wide range of gameplay experiences from exploration and constant progression to narrative-driven quests and deep social interactions, combat is just one of the tools players use to achieve their goals. At its core, The CUBE is closer to classic MMORPGs than to extraction shooters or battle royales, which usually don’t focus on the above.</p>
<p>That said, elements commonly associated with extraction gameplay, like venturing into dangerous zones and returning with valuable loot, are present in many RPGs such as Diablo, WoW, and Destiny, right? In that medium, The CUBE shares a similar dynamic: players will have opportunities to explore, take risks and return with meaningful rewards. But that’s only one layer or, let’s say, face of The CUBE - the overall experience will consist of a mix of many more gameplay elements. Our task is to offer players something fresh - something they really want and are not tired of yet.</p>
<p>Even though we’re not ready to reveal everything just yet, observant players may have already noticed several hints about what’s to come on the game’s Steam page. A closer look might uncover some intriguing new details. So, stay tuned, more details about the game systems are coming soon.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be any dungeon-like experiences?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, as part of the exploration, players will find dungeon-like zones with high stakes, tough enemies, and unique rewards. The deeper you go, the weirder it gets.</p>
<p><strong>What are the differences in terms of character progression with AH2?</strong></p>
<p>It’s a great question, but it’s still too early to go into detail. We’ll share more when the time is right. But we can say that, as a multiplayer project, The CUBE will let you shape and adapt your gameplay style to respond effectively to the ever-changing world around you.</p>
<p><strong>Can you share the business model for The CUBE (free to play or premium)?</strong></p>
<p>We’re still finalizing the business model for The CUBE, so it’s not something we’re ready to reveal just yet. Our focus right now is on building a great game, and whatever model we choose, it will be designed to support a fair, player-first experience.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Right now, The CUBE is in active internal playtesting. We’re using this phase to refine core systems and ensure the experience feels right. At the same time, we’re already thinking about how to approach open testing - we definitely want to involve the community and gather feedback as early as it makes sense to fine-tune the final gaming experience. More on that soon.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What is the current state of the game? Are you planning several beta tests to receive feedback from fans?</strong></p>
<p>Right now, The CUBE is in active internal playtesting. We’re using this phase to refine core systems and ensure the experience feels right. At the same time, we’re already thinking about how to approach open testing - we definitely want to involve the community and gather feedback as early as it makes sense to fine-tune the final gaming experience. More on that soon.</p>
<p><strong>What are your plans for the post-launch support of The CUBE?</strong></p>
<p>The CUBE is designed from the ground up as a continuing experience. Post-launch, we’ll be regularly rolling out new content, quests, story beats, events, and features to keep the world evolving. This world is built to grow, impress, and surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

                <p>Summer sales have begun kicking off everywhere--from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gog-summer-game-sale-2025-best-deals/1100-6532543/" data-ref-id="1100-6532543">GOG</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-steam-summer-sale-2025-game-deals/2900-6667/" data-ref-id="2900-6667">Steam</a>--and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/sales-and-deals/summer-sale/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo is also throwing its hat</a> into the commerce ring with discounts on dozens of its games. The Nintendo Summer Sale is primarily focused on digital games, and right now, there are some great deals for Switch exclusives and third-party titles from a number of studios. All of these games will work on both Switch and Switch 2 consoles, and considering that the Switch 2 has a decent amount of storage capacity, this is a nice way to fill up the library on that machine.</p><p>On the Nintendo side, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/super-mario-odyssey-switch/">Super Mario Odyssey</a> has been discounted to $40, and considering that it just got a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-free-nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-changes/2900-6591/" data-ref-id="2900-6591">graphical upgrade for Switch 2</a>, it's definitely worth picking up if you've got the new hybrid console. <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/super-mario-3d-world-plus-bowsers-fury-switch/">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</a> also got a free upgrade for Switch 2, and it's on sale for $40 (was $60). 3D Super Mario games are generally some of the best in any Nintendo library, and this upgraded version of the Wii U/Switch classic doesn't disappoint.</p><p>Not one to be left out, Mario's brother Luigi is also ready to rock in a discounted adventure. <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/luigis-mansion-2-hd-switch/">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</a> is a lovely game starring the lanky plumber as he embarks on a ghost-busting career, and you can grab this for $42. One of the biggest bargains here is for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mario-plus-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-switch/">Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope</a>, as it has been discounted from $60 to $15. If you love turn-based strategy, then this is a marvelous game to pick up, especially at this price. It's charming, hilarious, and the gameplay features an impressive amount of depth to it.</p><p>We've also listed several third-party games below, so don't miss out on a chance to enjoy modern-day classics like <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/it-takes-two-switch/">It Takes Two</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sonic-x-shadow-generations-digital-deluxe-edition-switch/">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a>, or <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-plucky-squire-switch/">The Plucky Squire</a>.</p><h2>Nintendo Store Summer Sale</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> -- $42 (<strike>$60</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/cult-of-the-lamb-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cult of the Lamb</a> -- $12.49 (<strike>$25</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/doom-eternal-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doom Eternal</a> -- $10 (<strike>$40</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dragon-ball-fighterz-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a> -- $9.59 (<strike>$60</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/ea-sports-fc-25-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EA Sports FC 25</a> -- $18 (<strike>$60</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/enter-the-gungeon-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enter the Gungeon</a> -- $3.74 (<strike>$15</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/fitness-boxing-3-your-personal-trainer-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fitness Boxing 3</a> -- $35 (<strike>$50</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/freedom-wars-remastered-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freedom Wars Remastered</a> -- $30 (<strike>$40</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/it-takes-two-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It Takes Two</a> --$20 (<strike>$40</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/just-dance-2025-edition-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Just Dance 2025 Edition</a> -- $25 (<strike>$50</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</a> -- $42 (<strike>$60</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/luigis-mansion-2-hd-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</a> -- $42 (<strike>$60</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mario-plus-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario and Rabbids: Sparks of Hope</a> -- $15 (<strike>$60</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mario-and-sonic-at-the-olympic-games-tokyo-2020-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario &amp;

			<p>A new Nintendo Switch 2 graphics mod test was shared online this week, highlighting how much the new system can improve ARK: Survival Evolved, one of the worst original Switch ports released to date, even at resolutions higher than the vanilla 1080p.</p>
<p>The new test video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">naga</a>, compares the game running on an overclocked Nintendo Switch and on the current generation system with some graphics mods like an FPS unlocker setting the cap to 60 FPS and increased resolution. At base 1080p resolution, ARK runs great on Nintendo Switch 2, consistently hitting the modded 60 FPS cap without the massive stuttering seen on the original console. The new generation system handles 1440p resolution quite well, not hitting the 60 FPS, but keeping a relatively steady 50 FPS range performance that's more than playable. At 4K resolution, however, the system begins to struggle, as the game runs in the 25 FPS range, and textures start showing some issues likely related to RAM, although the absence of the massive stuttering seen on the original system still makes this impressive.</p>
<p><iframe title="ARK Graphics Mods on Switch 2 - 60 FPS / 4K Resolution" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mY16ahbIAB8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For those not in the know, seeing Nintendo Switch 2 graphics mods already may seem surprising, especially as the console hasn't been hacked yet, but unlocking framerates and increasing resolution in select backward-compatible titles is entirely possible by importing a modded save file where graphics settings have been changed. Using this method, naga tested out how much the system can be pushed by running games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-graphics-mods-unlock-framerate-and-increase-graphics-settings/">Grid Autosport and Alien Isolation</a> with higher resolutions and unlocked framerates.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch 2 graphics mods, however, are not needed to enjoy improved backward-compatible titles, as many games can use the system's increased hardware specifications over its predecessor to offer improved framerates and more, even without dedicated patches.</p>
