            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-we-finally-played-obsidians-first-person-rpg-and-its-fantastic<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Avowed was a surprising delight to play for the first time. After a lot of questions about the shift in art direction from the teaser trailer, questions about the length, and a combat demo on the Xbox stage that had many asking if the game was earlier in development than expected, I’m happy to report that Avowed is feeling great, looking great, and offering a compelling story based on the early slice I played at an event.</p><p>My journey began just after the opening main mission in Avowed, and we’ve been sent on a task to find an Aedyran Expedition team. It turns out, as it often does with RPGs, that fate had other plans for them. Kai, our green-skinned companion who just happens to be voiced by Mass Effect’s Garrus Vakarian actor Brandon Keener, keeps things light-hearted with quips and remarks about this new area we’re exploring. The banter is welcome and sparse, only chiming in occasionally to make a quip, like when I paused to admire the view.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Avowed - Gamescom 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>And the view is very pretty. Avowed has done a great job leaning into the art style the larger Pillars of Eternity series is known for and had me stopping to admire waterfalls in the distance and moss-covered structures that set the aesthetic tone for this mysterious cavern we are diving deeper into. Avowed’s world design is shaping up nicely too, and as I dove deeper I would discover walls that could be blown up to traverse a new path, or puzzles that would open a secret new area with a large chest if I threw my shock explosives at a few tucked away circuits I found by exploring off the beaten path, only to find a hole in the wall. These puzzles have the added bonus of revealing coveted loot like a powerful ring that would offer some choice stat bonuses for my character.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Avowed has done a great job leaning into the art style the larger Pillars of Eternity series is known for.</p></div><p>When I wasn’t exploring the depths of the oceanic cave I had to swim through it only to find myself facing off against a Xaurip. These are Lizard-like creatures with your standard human weapons like swords, shields, and bows, and they make for good fodder as you learn your beginning attacks. Combat in Avowed is much better than I had anticipated. You quickly become accustomed to using flasks to regenerate not just your health, but more importantly your essence, which allows the execution of your most powerful attacks. As the barbarian, I found myself stalking spiders in the caverns and plotting my attack. To begin, I use Kai’s ability Fire and Ice via the radial wheel you access by holding down the left bumper (if you’re playing with a gamepad, obviously). Fire and Ice sees Kai Teleport to the target and then unload a powerful bullet into the spider’s Chelicerae, aka its face. Then I command him to use his area of effect attack, Leap of Daring, that has him slam into the ground and briefly stun everyone around him. During that time I’d been closing the gap, and using the two weapons I first charged up my right-handed axe which offers a powerful attack that inflicts frost damage accumulation to nearby enemies. After holding the right trigger to empower this attack I manage to freeze my opponents for just a moment. Then I unleash my more powerful essence abilities. First I shout to push back the smaller spiders who are also surrounding me, and while stunned, I then select charge and ram my body with force into the biggest guy in the room. Then, I follow it up with a flurry of blows with the left trigger, which holds my nimble sword for a small flurry of strikes that results in the dispatch of the last spider standing in the room.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Later, I would return as a mage, which was described as the most difficult of the three classes available to use. Abilities for this character included an ethereal staff that you could materialize with essence, orb projectiles that would track your target, and standard attacks that had you flicking your wand to and fro while smaller spells did damage to your target. Additional Essense abilities included a spear that was a bit faster than the staff (as you’d expect), and several different protection or buff spells to help your hits land with a bit harder thud. My personal favorite, however, was an ability that had you snap your book of magic shut to send a wave of damage-dealing aura at everything around you. It just looked cool seeing a book wreck everything in the immediate vicinity.</p><p>Make no mistake though, combat was also challenging. I was chugging potions with recklessness as I knew this was just a demo, but it was clear that you’ll need to master the balance between your spell casting, defense, and gear options for maximum efficiency. Digging into the menus, I found that you could spec out your character with a 2nd weapon set that would be accessed with the press of the Y button on the controller. The potential that something so simple offers had me excited because with one press you could access a significantly different playstyle. Combat felt clean, intuitive, and had a depth I didn’t expect. I can’t wait to dive into it more. And fortunately, the oomph of your attack animations that many felt were missing from a demo on the Xbox stage earlier this year have seemingly been implemented; enemies react how you’d expect them to when you slash them with a sword or blast them with a spell.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Eventually, on our journey, Kai and I would run into Caedmon, a young explorer who had managed to survive the Xaurip assault. His friends from the expedition team weren’t so lucky, however. After lamenting that he’s “never touched a girl” and his looming fate wasn’t fair, we were given several conversation options:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>“Kai, we can’t let this kid die a virgin. Can you help him?”</li><li>“Give Caedmon a healing option. Let’s get you back on your feet!”</li><li>“Toughen up kid. I’m not wasting my supplies on you.”</li></ul><p>I, of course, picked the top one.</p><p>Kai responded: “Not with that… OH you mean with healing him.” He would then go on to make me offer my potion instead. Caedmon was back on his feet and offered us some advice that would help us continue our journey.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But because I also wanted to try out combat as a Mage, I got to see what happened if you always picked the bottom option. “Toughen up Kid!” my character shouted. Caedmon said something Kai called nonsense, and pleaded with me to help him. I however refused to offer him the life saving potion, resulting in his immediate death. Did I loot his corpse? You’re damn right I did.</p><p>It’s situations like this that will make Avowed really stand out if they are plentiful enough. Can you really be that evil? Apparently so, and I look forward to doing a sane-person playthrough where I don’t murder everyone if I can avoid it, and a playthrough where I’m the biggest jerk possible because… well, that’s where the fun lies now, isn’t it?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The demo ended with an encounter where we met Sargamis. Sargamis is a gold-skinned deity-like creature who sent us to find an item and return it. But like our explorer friends from earlier in the demo, there were other plans afoot and it wasn’t long until we came face-to-face with the Skeleton boss and a pesky Skeleton priest that would heal the large group of enemies we were facing off against. This was all triggered immediately after getting to the object Sargamis sent us to retrieve, to which Kai quipped, “It can’t be this easy… can it?” No, Kai, it apparently cannot be.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Can you really be that evil in Avowed? Apparently so.</p></div><p>Once in battle and realizing I was greatly outnumbered, I ran out of the room to survey the battlefield. After taking out a few of the lower rank-and-file skeletons just outside of the priest’s healing aura, I identified the one thwarting my plans of murder (can you murder a skeleton?) and I turned his bones to ice and dust. Just as I had cleared the grunts, I was finally ready to take on the Skeleton boss with Kai, but just as I had him on the ropes…. The power in the building went out for everyone playing the demo.</p><p>It’s OK, though, because Avowed had made its impression. My doubts about it have faded away, and I’m left excited for its release in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-delayed-to-february-2025-to-give-players-backlogs-some-breathing-room">February</a>. This small slice Obsidian gave us the opportunity to play was a treat, and while it’s a tiny glimpse, our 50-minute demo session flew by in the blink of an eye. And that’s always a good sign.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warcraft-story-gives-players-personalized-video-ahead-of-war-within<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Marketing is coming at players in full force with <em>World of Warcraft: The War Within</em>'s impending launch. This brand new expansion for the undying MMORPG might give you a hankering to jump back in, but before doing so, you should check out this neat website -- <a href="https://warcraftstory.com/">Warcraft Story </a>-- Blizzard made to welcome players back.</p>
<p><a href="https://warcraftstory.com/">Warcraft Story</a> is an official <em>World of Warcraft</em> website that searches "over 20 years of game data" and creates a personalized video chronicling some neat stats on your character. It takes several minutes to load, and while you're waiting for the video to conjure up, a loading screen chronicles some other miscellaneous stats like quests completed and total deaths.</p>
<p>My main since <em>Warlords of Draenor</em>, for instance, has completed a whopping 7,000 quests. It also talks about critters killed, number of deaths, et cetera, but let's not talk about those too much so as not to embarrass myself.</p>

<p>As a result of the loading, players are met with a video narrated by <em>The War Within</em>'s villain, Xal'atath. She narrates a short clip featuring your character's achievements (or failures). In one video for my Mag'har Hunter, she commended me for the amount of raid bosses I defeated. And apparently, I've cheered 83 times on this character. I definitely need to bump up those numbers!</p>
<p>From what I can tell, videos can vary, even for the same character as I got two different ones for my Troll Mage. Though Xal'atath made note of my class in both videos, I was met with different stats like how many kills I had on the prior expansion's first major boss, Raszageth, as well as how many times I've died to gravity.</p>
<p>While your own, personalized Warcraft Story could definitely merit being longer, it's a fun little tool to have in the background and see what it comes up with. If you're the type of player who has stuck around with <em>World of Warcraft</em> since the early days, it's a nice little incentive to jump back into things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new expansion is less than a week away, too<em>: World of Warcraft: The War Within</em> launches on August 26, 2024.</p>

        <ul><li><strong>The End Has Come</strong> – A strange plague sweeps the countryside, transforming men into monsters, and cities into slaughterhouses. You are one of the last survivors of Birmingham, alone against the shambling corpses of your former friends and neighbors, with only your wits to protect you.</li><li><strong>Nourish Thy Body</strong> – Even after the end of the world, life goes on. Forage for supplies, craft tools and weapons, then set out on the hunt for food, water, and shelter. The clock is always ticking, and the horde is always near.</li><li><strong>Master Medieval Physics</strong> – Wriggle your way out of harrowing situations with physics-based mechanics that reward quick wits and skill. Stack furniture to barricade doors, leap low fences to trip your clumsy foes, and sever limbs to reduce the undead to angry, wriggling torsos. Just be careful not to stumble over a bucket while fleeing for your life.</li><li><strong>Take a Bite Out of History</strong> – Explore a carefully reconstructed 14th century Birmingham, in all its bucolic, bubonic glory. Stop by the Markets or the Burgage Plots to forage for resources. Raid boarded-up smithies for tools, grab a drink at the nearest tavern, and explore historic architecture at the Church of St. Martin in the Bull Ring.</li></ul><p>The Early Access version of the game will contain about one-quarter of the entire town, with the rest coming between the Early Access and full releases.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="God Save Birmingham - Official Game Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jmeG7DHhcTk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/nobody-needs-to-know-how-many-people-are-playing-a-singleplayer-video-game-nobody</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nobody-needs-to-know-how-many-people-are-playing-a-singleplayer-video-game-nobody.960480/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/nobody-needs-to-know-how-many-people-are-playing-a-singleplayer-video-game-nobody<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the worst aspects of current, toxic video game discourse has been the idea that, at any given moment, every single video game can and must have its playerbase statistically scrutinised. If the number of people playing a game is ever found to be an unacceptable number, then I'm afraid that's it. That game is in trouble. Maybe even dead.</p><p>Whether it's the press or an irate group of fans making the call, the process involved in this kangaroo court is normally the same: people take a look on Steam and console charts, see how many folks are playing a game, then report on their findings, usually as some kind of proof that the game is "dead".</p><p>Here is a prominent example from November 2023:</p><p>Aside from other issues with this headline--what do you mean "Could be", who's making the call here?--let's break this down. <em>Starfield </em>was released on September 6, means it had been out for almost three months at the time of that tweet. It's a singleplayer video game, one with huge preorder/launch week interest that subsequently reviewed...not poorly, but not what Bethesda would have been expecting or hoping for, either. It would have taken most players around 20-30 hours to finish up, and while a few obsessives will always play longer trying to rinse it, and there will always be a trickle of new players, for the vast majority of people taking part in online discourse about video games in November 2023, <em>Starfield </em>was done.</p><p>So of course its player numbers plummeted. It's not a live service or multiplayer game! If we were tracking the number of people playing <em>Destiny </em>or <em>Fortnite</em>, games specifically reliant on the number of people playing them, then sure, surges and drops in that count are important. But <em>Starfield </em>is a singleplayer video game! Most people who bought it are done with it. This is normal, and the fact it has been turned into <em>something </em>here is weird and gross.</p><p>Anyone concerned with a singleplayer video game's player count has been live service-pilled. The AAA video game industry's insistence that every major video game must now be played forever--<a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-valhalla-is-too-damn-long-1846138833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">look at the death march <em>Assassin's Creed Odyssey</em> and <em>Valhalla </em>subjected players to</a>--has begun soaking into the wider consciousness, and so when a game fails to hold our interest for months on end, it's somehow--for the live service-pilled among us, anyway--now seen as a failure.</p><p>Speaking of <em>Assassin's Creed</em>, its latest release, <em>Mirage</em>, is another game I've seen subjected to the same kind of scrutiny, and for the same deranged reasons.<a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/n24527/assassins-creed-mirage-one-month-player-count" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Here's a story with the headline "Assassin's Creed Mirage has big 68% drop in PS5 players in first month"</a>, which then goes onto...spell out the exact reason for this, namely that it's a singleplayer game in a busy time of the year for video game releases. And here's GameSpot<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-phantom-liberty-launch-cyberpunk-2077s-player-count-leaves-starfield-in-the-dust/1100-6517999/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> not just talking about <em>Cyberpunk 2077's</em> player count, but using that number as a stick to beat <em>Starfield </em>with</a>. Two different games, unrelated to each other except for the fact they're singleplayer video releases.</p><p>More recently, here's PCGamesN making note of what looks like a huge drop in <em>Black Myth: Wukong's</em> playerbase, a game that has only been out<em> for a few days</em>:</p><p>If you're a games writer, you don't need to be worrying about this shit! If you're a normal person taking part in video game discussions, you <em>definitely </em>do not need to be worrying about this shit. At best you're doing a AAA publisher's work in helping condition people to the idea all games must be played forever, and at worst you're doing your part in propagating toxic tribalism in video game fandom.</p><p>What you could be doing instead of scrutinizing numbers is enjoying a singleplayer video game for what it is, then getting on with your lives. Indeed, that's the best way to enjoy them!</p><p><em>This article was originally published in November 2023. It has been updated with more recent examples. </em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Located in the Pyrenees, this time-worn Jesuit monastery is home to a madhouse and an inquisitorial prison. Five prisoners—plagued by cruel punishment, madness, and despair—pool their skills and resources to face their phobias, stave off insanity, uncover the mysteries of the Monastery, and find a way to escape.</p><p><strong>Escape the Monastery</strong></p><p>Escaping such a well-guarded monastery is no easy task, but Agnes, Leonora, Eduardo, Amelia, and Alfredo are determined to see it through. Alternate control of all five characters and use their unique upgradable skills to cast spells, assassinate targets, distract enemies, stun evil spirits, explore hard-to-reach areas, and more.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Explore your surroundings and combine the characters’ abilities to find clues and tools scattered throughout the monastery. Be careful though, if you’re caught being somewhere you shouldn’t be, the guards will not be kind.</p><p><strong><a title="Series > Mana [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ge the Madness</strong></p><p>To effectively navigate the monastery, you must be mindful of the characters’ mental health.</p><p>Each playable character possesses a fully realized set of traumas and phobias. Triggering these traits depletes a character’s sanity, ultimately triggering a traumatic event with negative effects such as paranoia, dementia, or bouts of violence; fundamentally changing how the afflicted character is played.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_908846"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Discover the Secrets Within</strong></p><p>Choose from two different escape plans to execute, each with its own stories, objectives, special characters, and other surprises.</p><p>Time is continuous in <em>The Stone of Madness</em>. <a title="Genres > Action [2,105 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a>s have consequences, and players must consider their time of day as they make decisions.</p><p>Sneaking, exploring, and gathering materials are all ideal tasks to complete during the day when security guards are easily distracted. But as morning gives way to evening, the paranormal inhabitants of the Monastery will start to reveal themselves; posing a threat to the characters’ sanity.</p><p>Nighttime is most wisely spent planning and managing the escape plan. Any player who explores the monastery after curfew will be met with an extra challenge. Security is tighter, and guards will not take kindly to any prisoners wandering about. But sometimes, the risk is worth the reward.</p><p><strong><a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> a Stunning Hand-Painted Art Style</strong></p><p>The visuals in <em>The Stone of Madness</em> have been lovingly hand-painted and animated frame by frame, drawing heavy inspiration from 18th century artist Francisco De Goya.</p><p>The game’s isometric perspective acts as the perfect showcase for the eye-catching visuals, allowing players to observe every minute detail and feel as if they’re adventuring through a Goya painting brought to life.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.

<p>Bethesda's <em>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</em> is the latest game from a Microsoft subsidiary that will make its way to the PlayStation 5. The game will hit Sony's console in the spring of 2025, Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/the-great-circle-is-indiana-jones-for-a-post-uncharted-world/">announced yesterday</a>, months after a planned December launch on Xbox Series S/X and Windows.
</p><p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_o61DN93ik">an interview with YouTube channel Xbox On</a>, Microsoft's Phil Spencer expanded on that decision, implying that multiplatform releases for Microsoft gaming properties were important to the Xbox division's bottom line. "We run a business," he said, "It's definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery that we have to give back to the company, because we get a level of support from the company that's just amazing in what we're able to go do."</p>
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0_o61DN93ik?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p> Phil Spencer's comments come about three minutes into this interview.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Amid massive layoffs that have hit <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/microsoft-cancels-blizzard-survival-game-lays-off-1900/">Xbox</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/report-embracers-ongoing-layoffs-kill-a-new-deus-ex-game-after-2-years-work/">other</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/unity-cuts-25-percent-of-workforce-as-it-refocuses-on-game-engine-business/">gaming companies</a> in recent months, Spencer noted that there's "a lot of pressure on the [game] industry" these days. "[The industry] has been growing for a long, long time and now people are looking for ways to grow," he said. "And I think that us, as fans, as players of games, we just have to anticipate there's going to be more change in how some of the traditional ways that games were built and distributed [ars] going to change... for all of us."</p>
<h2>“It’s just going to be a strategy that works for us”</h2>
<p>Although Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/microsoft-confirms-which-xbox-games-are-going-to-switch-playstation/">released four former Xbox exclusives on other platforms</a> months ago, Spencer suggested that there hasn't been any commensurate dip in total Xbox usage. "What I see when I look is our franchises are getting stronger; our Xbox console players are as high this year as they've ever been," he said.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>"So I look at it, and I say, 'Okay, our player numbers are going up for the console platform, our franchises are as strong as they've ever been... So I look at this [as] 'How can we make our games as strong as possible?'" our platform continues to grow both on console on PC and on cloud and I think it's just going to be a strategy that works for us."</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/xboxmulti.jpg" data-height="864" data-width="1536" alt="Microsoft's last four multiplatform game releases were a bit smaller than <em>Indiana Jones</em>."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/xboxmulti.jpg" data-height="864" data-width="1536">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Microsoft's last four multiplatform game releases were a bit smaller than <em>Indiana Jones</em>.</p><p>Microsoft</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Microsoft has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/xbox-chief-we-want-to-regain-trust-more-than-we-want-to-beat-sony/">long prioritized maintaining a healthy number of overall Xbox players</a> over selling more raw consoles than competitors like Sony. Still, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/xbox-console-sales-continue-to-crater-with-massive-42-revenue-drop/">continuing cratering of sales revenue from Xbox hardware</a> likely contributes heavily to Microsoft's decision to release its games on competing platforms.
</p><p>A big-budget, big-name Bethesda release like <em>Indiana Jones</em> could act as more of an Xbox system seller than <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/microsoft-confirms-which-xbox-games-are-going-to-switch-playstation/">the four older, smaller games</a> that Microsoft recently let go multiplatform. Then again, <em>The Great Circle</em>'s multiple months of Xbox exclusivity—which include the 2024 holiday buying season—could still provide a bit of a relative advantage for Microsoft's consoles.</p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</em>'s PS5 availability may come as a particular surprise to readers who remember Spencer <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/microsoft-says-its-taking-four-unnamed-xbox-games-to-the-other-consoles/">saying in February</a> that neither <em>The Great Circle</em> nor <em>Starfield</em> were a part of the company's current multiplatform plans. But a careful parsing of Spencer's words at the time shows that he only promised those titles were not among the four multiplatform titles they were announcing at that time.
</p><p>Back then, Spencer said that those four multiplatform releases didn't represent "a change to our fundamental exclusive strategy." But he added that there was a desire to "use what some of the other platforms have right now to help grow our franchises" to help "the long-term health of Xbox."</p>
<p>"[I have] a fundamental belief that over the next five or ten years... games that are exclusive to one piece of hardware are going to be a smaller and smaller part of the game industry," Spencer said in February.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/vp-candidate-tim-walz-was-a-big-dreamcast-fan-and-we-think-weve-found-his-favorite-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It’s been a while since a known gamer frequented The White House. The first, and last, to do so was former President Barack Obama, who <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2009-01-08-the-first-wii-obama-brings-video-games-to-the-white-house.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>brought a Nintendo Wii</u></a> with him when he took office and, according to someone who played against him, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-president-barack-obama-is-a-captain-falcon-main-in-smash-bros"><u>apparently mains Captain Falcon in Super Smash Bros</u></a>. But depending on the outcome of the 2024 election, The White House may soon have a second gamer milling around: current Minnesota governor and vice presidential candidate Tim Walz.</p><p>But Gov. Walz isn’t bringing a Nintendo Wii with him (that we know of), nor has he attempted to settle his political disputes in Smash to our knowledge. His gaming habits are, surprisingly, a bit deeper a cut than that. It turns out that Gov. Walz is reportedly a fan of the Sega Dreamcast. And through some sleuthing, we’ve managed to not only track down Walz’s old Dreamcast console, but we may have also uncovered at least one game that the former teacher-turned-politician has historically enjoyed: Crazy Taxi.</p><h2>Little Dreamcast, Big Adventure</h2><p>We first learned that Gov. Walz was, at one point, a Dreamcast enjoyer due to an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/us/tim-walz-coach.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>article in The New York Times</u></a>. In the report, a former student of Walz’s recalls that he used to share “unusually relatable” stories with his classes, “like the time his wife had seized his Dreamcast, the Sega video game console, because he had been playing to excess.”</p><p>Obviously, this immediately sparked a flurry of community memes speculating what game had Walz so enraptured. Was it Sega Bass Fishing, a quintessential “dad” game that seemed in keeping with Gov. Walz’s overall demeanor? Was it Sega Sports NFL 2K, an apropos choice given he was a football coach and then-Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Randy Moss was on the cover? Was it something more left-field like Shenmue or Skies of Arcadia? Theories abounded. We, and probably a number of other journalists, reached out to Gov. Walz’s office weeks ago looking for the answer, but didn’t get any response.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I get a little kick out of knowing our future VP might know who Big the Cat is.</p></div><p>That would have been the end of it, but for one member of gaming forum ResetEra. The user, Bryn Tanner (who goes by Aaron on the forum), had <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/us-poliera-ot12-the-moscow-project.79540/page-108#post-14807787" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>posted way back in 2018</u></a> that they were in possession of Gov. Walz’s old Dreamcast. “Oh I bought a Dreamcast for $25 back in 2012 from one of his former high school students who worked on his campaign. Walz was just like ‘hey we have this old video game thing, do you want it?’ And the guy took it.”</p><p>When I reached out to him, Tanner was <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/us-politics-ot-3-walzing-into-the-future.947364/page-103#post-126973017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>taking a well-deserved and humorous victory lap</u></a> as news about the Dreamcast surfaced. “lmao yes I still have that Dreamcast this fucking rules,” he wrote in a post following the NYT piece. Tanner went on to tell me that while the Dreamcast he purchased at the time came with a VMU, a third-party rumble pack, two controllers, and a controller extension cable, the VMU didn't have any data on it. And the console did not come with any games, though Tanner bought a copy of Crazy Taxi for $4 at Pawn America later on the day of the purchase.</p><p>“I get a little kick out of knowing our future VP might know who Big the Cat is if he ever played Sonic Adventure,” Tanner tells me.</p><p>Though Tanner didn’t know what games Walz played, he did know someone who might. He referred me to Alex Gaterud, one of Walz’s former Global Geography students at Mankato West. Though Gaterud doesn’t remember Walz ever speaking with him about video games, he was roommates in college with another Mankato graduate who brought along the Dreamcast in question and left it behind when he moved out. Gaterud then says he sold the Dreamcast to Tanner, though he points out to me that "advertising something ‘formerly owned by a U.S. Congressman’ doesn't add any value on Craigslist.”</p><p>What games came with the Dreamcast? Gaterud doesn’t know - there weren’t any around when he handed it off to Tanner, and he can’t recall ever playing anything on it. Fortunately, Gaterud was able to connect me to one more person who might be able to sort this out once and for all. So I called up Tom Johnson, another Mankato West graduate and a former campaign intern for Gov. Walz.</p><h2>Tim Walz and the Nerd Herd</h2><p>Tom Johnson graduated Mankato West in 2007, and spent the summer before he went to college working for Walz’s congressional campaign. As an intern, he would send out mailers, coordinate volunteers, and drive around Minnesota, occasionally with Walz along for the ride. </p><p>Given that it wasn’t an election year, Johnson says the vibes were fairly relaxed and quiet, and the campaign office had a break area in the back with a mini putt set, a couch, and a TV. One day, he recalls, Walz brought in a box of stuff that he had planned to donate, saying he thought the staff might like to use it. Inside, of course, was the Dreamcast.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Johnson and the other staff didn’t play the Dreamcast much during its stint in the campaign office, so when he left for college, Johnson just took it with him, which is how it reached Gaterud and later Tanner. But while Johnson wasn’t doing much Dreamcast gaming, he tells me that in high school he was a part of a group of individuals known (“affectionately, I hope”) as the “Nerd Herd” at Mankato West. The group would have LAN parties together, and play World of Warcraft late into the night. Many Nerd Herd members, Johnson says, went on to work on Walz’s campaign for Congress in 2006. “I would say the Nerd Herd of Mankato contributed greatly to [Walz’s] election to Congress in 2006, which had the domino effect of him being nominated for vice president of the United States.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/img-0719-1724268368202.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Gov. Tim Walz with several members of the "Nerd Herd." Photo credit: Tom Johnson</figcaption></figure></output><p>“Walz really is just such a great, normal guy,” Johnson continues. “He’s one of those guys, it’s like, he’s your friendly neighbor, and then you find out that guy has the Guiness Book of World Records for free throw shooting. He’s just a normal guy, he just happens to be a governor too. Everything people say about him being this down to earth guy, really nice, really friendly, really earnest, it’s all true.”</p><p>But what video games does he play? Johnson thinks he remembers one disc sitting inside the Dreamcast when he took it from the office to go to college.</p><p>“I wanna say there was Crazy Taxi,” Johnson says.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Is Crazy Taxi the game Gov. and VP candidate Tim Walz played so much that his wife took his Dreamcast away? We still don’t know for sure. It is, as Gaterud put it to me, “basically law that all Dreamcasts need a copy of Crazy Taxi,” so at minimum, Gov. Walz almost certainly owned a copy. And in <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@brynjtanner/video/7401650958280723743?_r=1&amp;_t=8p3wZPih1LC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a TikTok video posted by Tanner about the Dreamcast</a>, one commenter seems to imply they at one point knew Walz, and that he talked about Crazy Taxi a lot - we've reached out to them for more details. I’ve also reached out to his office again to see if he’ll confirm, but nothing so far. And I reached out to Sega for comment on the possibility that their goofy driving franchise played a tiny role in the current presidential election. No comment there either.</p><p>Whatever the case, Gov. Walz’s however-brief flirtation with the Dreamcast would make him the first known gamer vice president if he and current vice president Kamala Harris are elected. Given that Crazy Taxi is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crazy-taxi-reboot-an-open-world-massively-multiplayer-aaa-game-sega-says"><u>apparently getting an open-world reboot</u></a>, maybe we’ll see it make an appearance in the White House one of these days.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

It’s a video that confirmed a release date of December 9, 2024, for PC and Xbox Series X | S, while also revealing that PlayStation 5 players will be able to join in on the adventure next spring. In between shots of Indiana punching nazis and solving ancient puzzles, X/Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/tylerllewtaing/status/1825989356462498094" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@tylerllewtaing</a> noticed that the footage briefly namedrops the location featured in Disneyland’s Indiana Jones Adventure, the Temple of the Forbidden Eye.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Indy has visited all sorts of distant lands... <a href="https://t.co/Dc3Zr8nX3m" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/Dc3Zr8nX3m</a></p>— Bethesda (@bethesda) <a href="https://twitter.com/bethesda/status/1826303376847425578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 21, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Disneyland’s Indiana Jones Adventure: Temple of the Forbidden Eye opened in the ‘90s and sees park attendees immerse themselves in the world of Harrison Ford’s legendary adventurer. It involves exploring abandoned areas, uncovering long-forgotten treasures, and coming face to face with powerful, magical forces. It’s a Pirates of the Caribbean-style ride that has guests tag along on a classic Indy adventure, and it’ll be mentioned, at least in some form, in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p><p>Bethesda did officially acknowledge the cute reference, though it’s unclear if players will actually be able to visit or interact with the temple in-game in any way. While MachineGames hasn't gone as far as to outright confirm the extent to which the Temple of the Forbidden Eye is included, fans were quick to speculate and hope for a full-on tie-in.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Brian Saeger (@SkywalkerBrian) <a href="https://twitter.com/SkywalkerBrian/status/1826063301580579319?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 21, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If there’s an entire segment that’s the Temple of the Forbidden Eye, I will literally pass out.

From now until September 11, horror fans can get 11 Resident Evil games, including every mainline entry, for only $30.</p><p>You'd normally pay almost $300 for all of these games, but this bundle deal offers a terrific discount and a portion of your purchase will be donated to Children's Miracle Network Hospitals and Breakthrough TD, two wonderful organizations helping children across the United States and Canada.</p><h2>Humble Bundle Resident Evil Decades of Horror</h2><p><em>Pay at least $30 to get the following games (Steam keys):</em></p><ul><li>Resident Evil 0 HD Remaster</li><li>Resident Evil</li><li>Resident Evil 2 (remake)</li><li>Resident Evil 3 (remake)</li><li>Resident Evil 4 (original)</li><li>Resident Evil 5 Gold Edition</li><li>Resident Evil 6 Complete</li><li>Resident Evil 7 Biohazard</li><li>Resident Evil Village Gold Edition</li><li>Resident Evil Revelations</li><li>Resident Evil Revelations 2 Deluxe Edition</li></ul><p>If you already own some of those Resident Evil titles, there are three lower tiers to choose from, too.

Lastly, there's a $20 tier that comes with every game in bundle <em>except </em>for Resident Evil Village.</p><p><strong>Resident Evil Village Gold Edition </strong>still has a list price of $50 on Steam, so finding it in a bundle like this is pretty awesome. A direct sequel to <strong>Resident Evil 7</strong>, which kicked off a new golden age for the franchise, protagonist Ethan Winters ventures to a secluded Eastern-European village to face a new breed of horror. This was also the game that made the Internet lose its collective mind for Lady Dimetrescu, a <em>very tall </em>antagonist in the game. The Gold Edition of Village comes with multiple DLC add-ons, including the Winters' story expansion.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4354825-residentevilvillage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4354825" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4354825-residentevilvillage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4354825"></a><figcaption>Resident Evil Village</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4354825-residentevilvillage.jpg"></figure><p>You'll definitely want to play Resident Evil 7 before Village to understand the story. A return to form for the franchise, RE7 shifted the series to first-person gameplay, and offered an isolating atmosphere within a more confined space, which amplified the frights. An incredibly creepy cast of antagonists also helped pave the way for the franchise's current renaissance.</p><p>Kicking things off with <strong>Resident Evil 0</strong>, the HD Remaster on offer here is a prequel to the first game in the series and follows police officer Rebecca Chambers and convict Billy Coen as they get mixed up in Umbrella's nasty business.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4354500-resident-evil-3-remake.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4354500" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4354500-resident-evil-3-remake.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4354500"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4354500-resident-evil-3-remake.jpg"></figure><p>The original <strong>Resident Evil</strong> is quaint by today's standards, but it's still a rock-solid game with a spooky atmosphere and memes that have stood the test of time. Things take a dramatic leap forward once you get to <strong>Resident Evil 2 and 3</strong>, as this bundle is offering the gorgeously gory remakes of those games. These set a new benchmark for the series, as they retained the core DNA of the original games and enhanced them with new features, more effective terror, and modern-day graphics to hammer home the horror of being trapped in a city full of flesh-eating zombies.</p><p>While you're not getting the remake of <strong>Resident Evil 4</strong>, the original version is still a ton of fun to play. This was where the franchise ventured into survival-action territory, and you can grab a free mod online to spruce up the GameCube-era visuals on your PC. Moving into the modern era, <strong>Resident Evil 5</strong> added even more action the franchise formula--this time with co-op--it's still a blast to play as you work your way through infected villages, ancient tombs, and Umbrella's most dangerous bioweapon experiments.</p><p><strong>Resident Evil 6</strong> is largely considered to be the black sheep of the series, as it veered further from its roots and went all-in on spectacle. It's not a total disaster, and it certainly has moments of brilliance, but you'll have to work to find those highlights. Resident Evil 7 felt like a return to form for the franchise when it first came out, as its smaller focus, shift to first-person gameplay, and an incredibly creepy cast of antagonists paved the way for Resident Evil's current Renaissance.</p><p><span>Outside of the mainline entries, you're also getting both </span><strong>Resident Evil Revelations</strong><span> games as well. These Resident Evils emphasized survival, evasion, and exploration, and were seen as being closer to the survival-horror origins of the series when compared to later entries.</span></p><h3>More Humble Bundles</h3><p>There's another great Capcom-flavored Humble Bundle on offer this month, and it's one that fighting game fans won't want to miss out on.

                <p>Minnesota Governor Tim Walz is preparing to formally accept the Democratic party nomination for Vice President this week at the Democratic National Convention. And just before that happens, we may have learned more about his classic gaming habits.</p><p>Following his selection as the running-mate for presumptive nominee Kamala Harris, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/us/tim-walz-coach.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">profile in the New York Times</a> outed Walz as a Dreamcast fan. Players on the high school football team, where he coached, recalled him sharing stories that the kids found relatable, like when his wife took away his Dreamcast because he played it too much. Naturally this sparked speculation about what game had hooked him so deeply.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vp-candidate-tim-walz-was-a-big-dreamcast-fan-and-we-think-weve-found-his-favorite-game" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> reports that it tracked down a series of subsequent owners of Walz's Dreamcast, tracing it back to a man named Tom Johnson. Johnson worked as an intern for Walz's congressional campaign, and one day Walz brought in a box of personal items he had planned to donate, but that the interns might like to use instead. Among them was a Dreamcast, which went mostly unused in the congressional office. Johnson ultimately took the Dreamcast with him to college and said that he recalls seeing a copy of Crazy Taxi already in the system when he took it.</p><p>As Johnson notes, Crazy Taxi was a common game for Dreamcast owners, so it may not have necessarily been Walz's favorite. But that it was sitting in the console suggests at least some level of affection for the driving game. And that's probably the most definitive answer we'll get on the matter--unless he happens to bring it up during his DNC speech. Given his jovial demeanor in other speeches, that's not outside the realm of possibility.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Image credit: Getty Images/Andrew Harnik</em></p>
