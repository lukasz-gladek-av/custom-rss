		<p>Rebellion has announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/atomfall">Atomfall</a>: The Red Strain, the next expansion for their hit 50s Northern England disaster survival game. The new story expansion pack is set to arrive on 16th September across all platforms – PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, and PC. The base game is also still a part of Game Pass.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomfall The Red Strain Teaser Trailer | Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, PS5 &amp; PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Ti8cwDNGxI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Details are very thin on the ground right now, but there’s a big new robot in town, seemingly taking a smidgeon of inspiration from RoboCop by shoving a brain up into the glass jar on top, and from Doctor Who Daleks for the voice box. Intriguingly, there’s a new acronym organisation involved here, as C.O.R.E. is stamped across the front of the robot’s chest and we see an ominous looking entrance hall to the institution, as well as some reddish mists to contrast with the main game’s blueish hues.</p>
<p>This is the second story expansion for Atomfall, following on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/29/atomfalls-wicked-isle-story-dlc-launches-on-june-3rd/">the Wicked Isle which launched back in June</a>. This took players away from Wyndham Vilage and off to Midsummer Island for another adjacent story – in our review, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/24/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-review/">we did complain</a> that it followed the themes of the main game a bit too closely, so hopefully a bit more time has allowed Rebellion to inject a bit more variety for this second expansion.</p>

<p>Of the main game, though, we rather enjoyed it. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/24/atomfall-review/">Atomfall review</a>,&nbsp;Gareth said,<em> “Atomfall is an interesting game. It might not be wholly unique in anything it does, but it combines its core ideas in a way that feels fresh. A big part of that comes through the drip feed of the underlying story, whilst another is the glorious British countryside that makes up its maps. It likely isn’t going to blow your mind, but it’s an enjoyable journey and you would still be missing out if you didn’t give Atomfall a go.”</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-age-verification-kicks-in-for-uk-users-credit-card-required-to-pass.1284129/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Steam has introduced age verification for UK users, with mature pages on the storefront now requiring valid credit card details showing that you're 18 or over to access.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/292B-3DA3-CFC8-97F6" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new FAQ</a>, Steam's new UK age verification process has been introduced in order to comply with the country's new Online Safety Act, which has also affected other gaming-related websites <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nexus-mods-age-verification-uk-eu" rel="nofollow">like Nexus Mods</a>, as well as various key sellers.</p>

<p>In order to access mature content on Steam, you'll now need to provide valid credit card information, and your account will be "considered age verified" for as long as that information is stored. If you delete it, you'll need to add another one in order to access mature pages again.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steam-age-verification-uk-storefront.jpg?itok=9R1luE50 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steam-age-verification-uk-storefront.jpg?itok=-wPvY87Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Steam will now require you to verify your age to access mature content if you're in the UK.</figcaption></figure><p>If you haven't added a card to your Steam account yet, you can do so via the Account Details page's "add a payment method to this account" option. The process is fairly straightforward; once you've been through it, you can change your store preferences to allow mature content.</p>

<p>Valve says it's using this particular method of verification because it "preserves the maximum degree of user privacy"; the data processed through verification is "identical to that of the millions of other Steam users who make purchases", according to Valve.</p>

<p>If you're concerned about not owning a credit card, I was able to add a valid debit card in order to verify my age, but it's possible that this isn't an intended verification method; in its own FAQ, Valve says individuals must be 18 to obtain a credit card, but in the UK, debit cards can be used by those as young as 16.</p>

<p>If Steam does indeed require users to specifically add a credit card to verify their age, that feels like an unfortunate oversight for the <a href="https://www.money.co.uk/credit-cards/credit-card-statistics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">roughly 36%</a> of UK adults who don't have credit cards (myself included).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nexus-mods-steam-uk-age-verification.jpg?itok=Fzh6IRuC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nexus-mods-steam-uk-age-verification.jpg?itok=FpinpH_3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Other sites, like Nexus Mods, now also require age verification for UK users.</figcaption></figure><p>It looks like pages for games with mature content, like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">recent release&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em></a>, aren't affected; this age verification system appears only to apply specifically to adult content on Steam. That may change in the future, however.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that this new system only applies to UK users; if you're in the US, or anywhere else that doesn't have a similar law to the Online Safety Act, then you can continue using Steam just as you have been.</p>

<p>The Online Safety Act is likely to mean that more and more gaming-related sites and platforms incorporate age verification for UK users, so if you're based in the UK, you can expect this kind of thing to become more common as time goes by. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/msi-titan-18-hx-ai-review-the-ultimate-laptop-with-limits/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/msi-titan-18-hx-ai-review-the-ultimate-laptop-with-limits.1284126/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>MSI’s Titan 18 HX AI isn’t really a laptop in the traditional sense. It’s more like a full-on desktop packed into a form you can technically carry around. Of course, that’s if you don’t mind lugging eight pounds of aluminum alloy plus a hefty power brick. This isn’t something you casually throw in a backpack for a coffee shop session. It’s a machine built for people who want raw, uncompromising power in a device that still folds shut.</p>



<p>It has all the bells and whistles you could ever want, but with a hefty price tag and some frustrating design aspects,&nbsp;is it really one that you should invest in?</p>



<h2 id="h-msi-titan-18-hx-ai-review">MSI Titan 18 HX AI Review</h2>



<p>The first thing that stands out is the massive 18-inch Mini-LED display. It runs at 4K UHD+ with a 120Hz refresh rate, delivers excellent color coverage, and pushes brightness high enough for work or play in just about any environment. Whether you’re gaming or doing creative work, it’s a screen that feels built for both. And the hardware driving it has the muscle to match. </p>



<p>MSI crammed in Intel’s Core Ultra 9 285HX processor and NVIDIA’s RTX 5090 laptop GPU, which means the Titan 18 HX handles modern games at 4K with ease. Frame rates in demanding titles hold strong, and production tasks like video rendering or 3D modeling run faster than most dedicated desktops. Simply put, it does whatever you ask of it.</p>



<p>I don’t want to spend too much time going over benchmarks because, as I mentioned, this machine will do whatever you need with ease. Still, it’s worth going over a couple for the Core Ultra 9 285HX. </p>



<p>On Geekbench, it received a single-core average score of 3,169 and a multi-core score average of 22,135. Compared to the MSI Raider GE78 with an Intel Core i9-14900K (single-core: 3,000/multi-core: 18,262), and you are looking at an average increase of roughly 21% for the multi-core and 5% for the single-core. Other synthetic benchmarks from software like 3D mark also showed impressive results with it hitting a CPU profile score of 17,815 for Max Threads on stock settings and 1,311 on a single thread.</p>



<p>Moving to productivity, and I was rendering five-minute 4K videos in roughly three minutes with 1080 being done, on average, between 60-90 seconds. &nbsp;Obviously, if you are someone who uses a lot of transitions and edits, it might take a bit longer, but nothing that would become concerning.</p>

<h2 id="h-upgradeability">Upgradeability</h2>



<p>One of the big debates between laptops and desktops comes with how easy they are to upgrade and repair. Desktop machines will, likely, always have the advantage because of how easy it is for people to buy new components and swap them as they need. For laptops, that’s a bit more of a challenge.</p>



<p>Truth be told, it’s not overly difficult to access what you need inside. In fact, it’s kind of easy as long as you take your time.</p>



<p>With the Titan 18 HX, upgrading your memory and storage is pretty easy once you get through all of the screws at the bottom of your machine. But that’s really where the upgrades end, as you would expect. Swapping out the CPU or GPU just isn’t going to happen. And if you reach a point where you need to replace the display or other internal, you’ll have to have a long talk about how much you trust yourself to make a swap.  </p>



<h2 id="h-general-usage-comes-with-some-concerns">General Usage Comes With Some Concerns</h2>



<p>Typing on the Titan 18 HX is a different kind of highlight. The Cherry MX ultra-low-profile mechanical keyboard is, to me, one of the best you’ll find on a laptop, offering satisfying key travel and feedback. Long typing sessions actually feel good, which isn’t something you can always say for a gaming notebook. That said, the keyboard does tend to heat up under heavy loads, which can get uncomfortable during longer stretches of play or work. The touchpad, on the other hand, feels like a complete a miss. MSI went with a built-in haptic design that blends into the palm rest, and while it looks futuristic, it’s not always practical. Precision can be frustrating, and most people will end up relying on a mouse instead. More on that in a moment.</p>



<p>Naturally, performance at this level comes with tradeoffs. The cooling system—dual fans paired with a vapor chamber—does a solid job of keeping things in check, but when the laptop is under stress, it gets loud. The fans spin up past the point where you’ll want a headset just to drown them out. The system also pulls a ton of power, so battery life isn’t great. You can expect maybe two-to-three hours of light use and closer to 90 minutes or so when gaming, making it clear this is a machine meant to stay plugged in most of the time. </p>



<p>Portability isn’t just about battery life, though. Between the size of the machine itself and the power brick required to feed it, taking the Titan 18 HX on the go feels more like hauling around a workstation than a laptop. Yes, you can travel with it, but it’s not a device you’ll be setting up on a cramped airplane tray table. I actually tried to take it to various events throughout the summer, but quickly realized there was no way I was going to walk around for hours with it on my back. Plus, the the combined space required for the power brick and the laptop in a bag will have you lucky to fit anything else inside.</p>



<p>On the plus side, the Titan 18 HX is well-equipped for the future. It’s packed with ports—dual Thunderbolt 5, HDMI 2.1, USB-A, Ethernet, Wi-Fi 7, and even SD card support—making it ready for whatever setup you want to throw at it. The AI tuning engine MSI built in can automatically adjust performance and cooling depending on what you’re doing, and storage flexibility means you’ll be able to keep expanding as needs grow. In other words, this laptop isn’t just about today’s games and workloads; it’s built with an eye toward what’s coming next.</p>



<h2 id="h-msi-titan-18-hx-ai-verdict">MSI Titan 18 HX AI Verdict</h2>



<p>The MSI Titan 18 HX AI is a monster of a laptop. It’s loud, heavy, and not something you’ll want to really carry around for long stretches, but it delivers performance that few portable machines can match. From high-end gaming to intensive creative work, it handles everything you throw at it with ease. Sure, the keyboard can get warm, the fans are noisy, and battery life is limited, but these are the trade-offs for having desktop-level power in a “laptop” form.</p>



<p>This isn’t a device for everyone, but for creators, gamers, or tech enthusiasts who want a, somewhat, future-proof powerhouse they can move between locations, the Titan 18 HX makes a strong case. It’s a showcase of what’s possible when performance takes priority, and for those who need the absolute best, it’s hard to ignore.</p>

                <p>This week, the Communications Workers of America (CWA) announced that more than 450 developers of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Blizzard Entertainment's Diablo</a> team have voted to unionize under the CWA. The successful outcome of this effort means workers will now be represented by CWA Local 9510 in Irvine, California; Local 1118 in Albany, New York; and Local 6215 in Austin, Texas.</p><p>The newly formed union will represent a wide range of jobs across Blizzard, including designers, engineers, artists, and support staff. Microsoft, Blizzard's parent company, has officially recognized the union. This unionization campaign is not an isolated event at Blizzard, as earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-story-team-has-voted-to-unionize/1100-6533931/" data-ref-id="1100-6533931">the studio's Story and Franchise Development team also voted to unionize</a>.</p><p>"With every subsequent round of mass layoffs, I've witnessed the dread in my coworkers grow stronger because it feels like no amount of hard work is enough to protect us," said Diablo producer and organizing committee member Kelly Yeo (via <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/450-diablo-developers-vote-to-unionize-under-cwa" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>). "This is just the first step for us joining a movement spreading across an industry that is tired of living in fear."</p><p>Workers also shared personal experiences that illustrate the atmosphere of uncertainty and instability driving the union effort. "The day after the third round of mass layoffs, I walked into the office, and when I tried to open the door to the cafeteria, my badge was denied. For a moment, I wondered if getting breakfast was how I'd find out I was part of that round," added designer Ryan Littleton. While Littleton's situation ended up being just a technical glitch, it doesn't help the overall cloud of uncertainty. "None of us should have to live with that constant worry that we might be let go at the drop of a hat."</p><p>Senior software engineer Nav Bhatti framed the initiative as a response to long-standing industry challenges, saying this sort of stress puts people in a fight-or-flight mode, but the union helps them to be able to "stand our ground in the industry."</p><p>CWA Local 9510 president Jason Justice pointed to California's growing role in labor movements. "What's happening here is part of a much larger story about turning the tide in an industry that has long overlooked its labor," he said. "Entertainment workers across film, television, music, and now video games are standing together to have a seat at the table."</p>

		<p>Bugbear has released Content Update 3 for their smashtastic racer <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/wreckfest-2">Wreckfest 2</a>, adding two new cars, nine new tracks and/or layouts, better AI and plenty more improvements across the Early Access game.</p>
<p>There’s also been fresh teasers of the single player campaign, modding support and more features that will be added, but for now the focus has been on fleshing out and optimising the core content of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wreckfest 2 | Content Update #03" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LDq8IFt87p8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The two new cars are the Switchback American muscle car, and the Popper European “folk racing” car. You can race them both around the Cannonhill and Savolax tracks (in both directions), while there’s new layouts for the Scrapyard Speedbowl, Figure 8 and Main Circuit, a small oval at Speedway, and the Rallycross 1 circuit can be run in reverse.</p>
<p>More broadly, AI difficulty can now be set to novice, amateur and expert, there’s improved online multiplayer latency, support for telemetry for SimHub and generic systems, and plenty more.</p>

<p>Here’s the patch notes:</p>

<p>Thankfully, accessory maker Genki has you covered on both counts with two of its next Switch 2-focused products: the Force Field 2 And Energy Pack.</p>
<p>We're covering both in this dual-review.</p>
<h2>Genki Force Field 2 Review</h2>
<figure><a title="Review: Genki Force Field 2 And Energy Pack - The Ultimate Switch 2 'On The Road' Combo? 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1ffb5b3839d72/review-genki-force-field-2-and-energy-pack-the-ultimate-switch-2-on-the-road-combo-6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We've already covered several of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-2-cases">best Switch 2 cases</a> on this very site, but Genki's Force Field 2 (<a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/force-field-2">£25 / $29.99 on its own, £35 / $39.99 with the Travel Cover</a>) is somewhat unique in this field; like the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/dbrand-switch-2-killswitch-case-teething-troubles-aside-this-case-is-killer">Dbrand Switch 2 Killswitch</a>, it's not a carry case you place the console inside when it's not in use, but a clip-on shell which is intended to remain in situ during gameplay.</p>
<p>The case is fashioned from smoky plastic and clips onto the back of the Switch 2 with the minimum of fuss. It's designed to offer lightweight protection during use but comes with some additional benefits – for example, there are ergonomic bulges on the back of the case that make the console easier to hold. I genuinely found that my Switch 2 was a lot more comfortable to use over prolonged periods as a result.</p>
<p>Thanks to its hinge system, the Force Field 2's sides can be opened up to grant access to the Joy-Con 2, revealing another cool feature – there's space for two game cards, one on each side. This doesn't quite make up for the fact that many other carry cases offer storage for multiple cards, but it's still a neat bonus. My only complaint is that the fit is <em>really</em> tight, and it often feels like the cartridge is going to break as you unclip it from the slot. This will almost certainly ease up over time, but it's worth mentioning nonetheless.</p>

<p>Once in place, the Force Field 2 leaves all of your buttons and ports clear, making them easy to reach – even the kickstand can be deployed without any issue as there's an aperture allowing access. It's also possible to dock your Switch 2 without removing the Force Field 2, although it's quite a snug fit.</p>
<p>The Force Field 2 is available on its own or with the optional Travel Cover. This clips over the front of the console, covering the screen and controls – as well as the shoulder triggers – preventing them from being pressed during transit. The only hole on this cover is located on the bottom, and it allows you to charge your Switch 2 while the case is in place.</p>
<p>While many people want their Switch 2 consoles to be protected by a carry case which is soft on the inside and hard on the outside, the Force Field 2 relies on a tough, unibody design to prevent damage. According to Genki, this approach "distributes force evenly during drops", but I'm not entirely sure the Force Field 2 is capable of offering the same level of protection as, say, Genki's "virtually indestructible" <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-sleeper-case-a-virtually-indestructible-switch-2-carry-case-that-looks-as-good-as-it-protects">Sleeper Case</a> – and I'm not brave enough to perform a drop test! Another thing to note is that because this isn't a 'zipped' case, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-carry-case-the-official-option-is-a-solid-one">like the official Nintendo option</a>, you're going to get dust and other gunk drifting in over time.</p>
<p>Still, it does provide some protection, at least, and has the added bonus of improving the ergonomics of the console itself. There's also an Apple MagSafe-style ring on the rear, which will lead us neatly into the second part of this double review.</p>



<h2>Genki Energy Pack Review</h2>
<figure><a title="Review: Genki Force Field 2 And Energy Pack - The Ultimate Switch 2 'On The Road' Combo? 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7ced3c513871d/review-genki-force-field-2-and-energy-pack-the-ultimate-switch-2-on-the-road-combo-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Energy Pack (<a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/energy-pack">£59 / $69.99</a>) is a 10,000mAh capacity fast-charging battery that can deliver power to Switch 2 and any other device which charges over USB-C – that includes the Steam Deck and even your smartphone.</p>
<p>It attaches to the aforementioned MagSafe ring on the Force Field 2 (and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-attack-vector-a-modular-switch-2-case-which-opts-for-comfort-over-protection">Attack Vector</a>) and connects to your Switch 2 using the bundled USB-C-to-USB-C cable, which is the perfect length for reaching either of the console's ports. This means you can effectively triple the battery life of your Switch 2 while you're on the move.</p>
<p>Constructed from CNC aluminium and boasting a real-time "digital dashboard" which gives you information on charging speed, remaining capacity and temperature, the Energy Pack works really well with the Force Field 2. The MagSafe connection is pretty strong, and it's the easiest thing in the world to simply bolt it onto the rear of the case and hook up the cable. Having said that, it does add quite a bit of weight to the console, and, if you're not careful, you can accidentally knock it during gameplay, causing it to fall off.</p>

<p>The aluminium body helps with heat dissipation, according to Genki, and there's a rubberised texture on the top so that when you lay your console down on a table, it doesn't scratch the Energy Pack's shell.</p>
<p>Another plus is that, thanks to Qi2 wireless charging compatibility, the Energy Pack works with Apple smartphones without the need for a charging cable. You just drop it onto your phone's MagSafe connector, and it starts charging. This is a real bonus for iPhone owners, as the official MagSafe Battery Pack has a lower capacity, lacks the real-time display and cost $99 at launch (it has since been discontinued and can be picked up for less than that, however).</p>
<p>If you don't have a MagSafe-compatible case on your Switch 2, you can affix one of the three MagSafe rings included with the Energy Pack to get the same effect. This does mean you're applying the ring directly to the rear of your Switch 2's case, which might make some people feel uneasy.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-dev-put-a-lot-of-effort-into-making-the-game-hit-performance-targets-on-wide-range-of-hardware-even-minimum-specs.1284096/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A good portion of the Battlefield 6 open beta PC players were on or below minimum specs, but the game's development team made sure all players could enjoy the open beta properly, regardless of their system configuration.</p>



<p>Speaking in a new interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-dev-says-a-significant-number-of-users-played-the-game-below-the-minimum-recommended-specs-as-ea-points-to-the-importance-of-weaker-hardware">Eurogamer</a>, technical director Christian Buhl confirmed that of the millions of players who joined the Battlefield 6 open beta, a substantial number of them were on minimum specs or below. The team, however, wasn't caught unprepared, as they went to great lengths to ensure the open beta and the game would be playable on a wide range of system configurations, making sure maps were performant enough to hit certain performance targets regardless of the hardware. "<em>Min spec is certainly one of our most important spec, it's super important from both a commercial and business perspective - we want as many people as possible playing the game,"</em> Buhl added.</p>



<p>With the rising costs of living and PC hardware, Battlefield 6 running well on low-end hardware is welcome, although it remains to be seen if the remainder of the game will run as nicely as the open beta did. Some players will get the chance to test this out themselves before the game launches in a little over a month, as another round of testing via <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battlefield-labs-playtesting-resumes/">Battlefield Labs</a> is planned to test some of the changes coming to the game based on beta feedback, new maps like Operation Firestorm, and server browsing.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on October 10 worldwide.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-luna-i</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/genshin-impact-version-luna-i-kicks-off-a-year-long-event-in-september.1284093/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version Luna I, a brand new update that's kicking off a year-long series of events themed around the moon.</p>

<p>Version Luna I, also known as "Song of the Welkin Moon: Segue", breaks with&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>tradition by eschewing the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-58-july" rel="nofollow">numbered designations</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-57-release-date" rel="nofollow">previous updates</a>. It's due to land on all platforms on September 10th.</p>

<p>First off, Version Luna I introduces the new region of Nod-Krai, where you'll "become entangled in rising conflicts between factions", as well as meeting three new Nod-Krai natives who you'll have a chance to recruit for your team.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-version-luna-i-release-date-enemies.jpg?itok=9q3Eepz4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-version-luna-i-release-date-enemies.jpg?itok=Ikpz3ZbA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version Luna I will bring new enemies for you to fight and more.</figcaption></figure><p>The new region will bring new enemies and boss encounters for you to take on, as well as a new elemental lifeform that acts as a way to explore Nod-Krai and surmount its traversal puzzles.</p>

<p>Of course, it wouldn't be a&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>update without new characters to recruit, and the first of three new warriors for your team in this update is Lauma, a five-star Catalyst wielder who can boost Bloom damage and transform into a new half-human, half-deer form.</p>

<p>Joining her is Flins, a five-star Electro polearm user who can unleash powerful Lunar-charged strikes and "hear the whispers of the Wild Hunt during exploration". Lastly, Aino, a four-star Hydro Claymore user, adds "playful new interactions" to&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>, and you can recruit her for free.</p>

<p>We also got some more information about&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>'s user-generated content system, otherwise known as the Miliastra Sandbox, which will allow you to create your own experiences within the game,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>-style. It's coming as part of the next update after this one.</p>




<p>As always, news of the new&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>update also came alongside codes you can use to get yourself some free goodies in the game, and here they are!</p>

<ul><li>LunaI0910 - 100 Primogems, 10 Mystic Enhancement Ore</li>
	<li>LaumaNodKraiFlins - 100 Primogems, 5 Hero's Wit</li>
	<li>HiFiveTraveler - 100 Primogems, 50,000 Mora</li>
</ul><p>News of&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>'s latest update comes after developer HoYoverse announced it will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending" rel="nofollow">stop supporting the PS4 version</a> of the gacha RPG next year.</p>

<p>The date of Version Luna I is also the day on which you'll no longer be able to download&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>on Sony's last-gen machine if you've never done so before, but don't worry; you can still play if you've downloaded it already, and what's more, the PS5 version will be unaffected by this change.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">With Battlefield 6’s open beta done and dusted and its October 10 release date in sight, developer DICE is prepping the shooter for launch across PC and console. But it is on PC specifically that EA's anti-cheat efforts have raised eyebrows, and even caused some fans to miss out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PC gamers who played the Battlefield 6 open beta might have run into the following on-screen warning: ‘Secure Boot is not enabled.’ Indeed, if you want to play Battlefield 6 on PC you have no choice but to enable Secure Boot. And based on the open beta, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-forces-pc-gamers-to-mess-about-with-their-bios-to-enable-secure-boot-and-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-is-next">some had trouble with it</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enabling Secure Boot involves tinkering with a part of a computer not all PC gamers will be instantly familiar with: the BIOS (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/How_to_Enable_Secure_Boot">check out IGN's guide for more</a>). There are things like TPM 2.0 (which must be turned on) to deal with, and you need to make sure your Windows disk is GPT and not MBR (not everyone will know what these are). All this before you can even enable Secure Boot — and then you may not be able to enable it anyway, which then means you need to refer to your manufacturer for guidance.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While this won’t be a problem for more experienced PC gamers, it will be an intimidating process for some. And according to DICE, it knows these anti-cheat measures will prevent some people from playing Battlefield 6 at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-really-sucks-battlefield-6-technical-director-bummed-out-about-those-unable-to-play-due-to-secure-boot-requirement-believes-anti-cheat-cat-and-mouse-game-will-never-end" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a>, Battlefield 6 technical director Christian Buhl lamented the situation. "The fact is I wish we didn't have to do things like Secure Boot," Buhl said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It does prevent some players from playing the game. Some people's PCs can't handle it and they can't play; that really sucks. I wish everyone could play the game with low friction and not have to do these sorts of things."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/29/screenshot-2025-08-06-214819-1754555745386-1756471937073.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Battlefield 6 forces players to enable Secure Boot on PC.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Buhl sounds pleased with the effectiveness of the likes of Secure Boot, which are “some of the strongest tools in our toolbox to stop cheating.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We were pretty happy with how the anti-cheat performed. Obviously I'll say we can never be perfect, anti-cheat is always a cat-and-mouse game where we're constantly going back and forth and keeping on top of what the cheaters are doing. But from the beginning this was something we put a high priority on, so when we launch this game we have a really strong anti-cheat program in place."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Buhl continued: “Again, nothing makes cheating impossible, but enabling Secure Boot and having kernel-level access makes it so much harder to cheat and so much easier for us to find and stop cheating."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s no secret that cheating in competitive multiplayer games is a huge problem for publishers. Activision, for example, has spent millions trying to reverse the narrative for Call of Duty, and TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot are in place for Black Ops 7 on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Secure Boot caused some people problems, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-a-huge-queue-to-get-in-the-battlefield-6-open-beta-before-its-even-out"><u>the Battlefield 6 open beta enjoyed huge player numbers on Steam</u></a>, so it will be interesting to see how this goes at launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>
PC modders have already begun optimising <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, even before Konami has released further updates.
</p>
<p>
The Metal Gear remake has been criticised for its poor performance, with videos shared on social media of jarring stuttering. In particular, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> version has come under fire.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-issues-acknowledged-by-konami-patch-on-the-way">Konami acknowledged a handful of specific issues</a> ahead of launch, though general optimisation wasn't included. In just a couple of days, though, PC modders have taken matters into their own hands.

Modder FrancisLouis, for instance, has created the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsoliddeltasnakeeater/mods/4">Metal Gear Optimiser mod</a> on NexusMods, which "reduces stuttering by optimising shader compilation and assets streaming". FrancisLouis notes results can vary depending on hardware.
</p>
<p>
Other mods - such as <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsoliddeltasnakeeater/mods/47">Better Uncap FPS v1.2 from Mstrthief</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsoliddeltasnakeeater/mods/46">Unlocked FPS from Hybred</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsoliddeltasnakeeater/mods/40">Unlock FG and FPS from Velasquez</a> among others - seek to provide an unlocked framerate and other benefits
</p>
<p>
It's clear optimisation is a priority among modders, who have seemingly been able to make improvements quicker than an official patch from Konami - though of course, mods aren't always reliable.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the funniest mod for the game, though, is from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsoliddeltasnakeeater/mods/33">Fiend</a>, which allows players to swap Snake for Metal Gear creator <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>.</p>
<p>Kojima has stated in interviews <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-hideo-kojima-wont-be-playing-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">he won't be playing the remake himself</a>, likely due to his acrimonious split from Konami. But that hasn't stopped players putting him in the game instead.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-ceo-blames-unreal-engine-5-issues-on-developers-but-more-support-incoming">Epic boss Tim Sweeney blamed developers for any optimisation issues when using Unreal Engine 5</a> - Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater being one such game to use the engine.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As a response to the enforcement of the UK Online Safety Act (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/steam-now-requires-age-verification-in-the-uk-for-mature-game-pages/">VGC</a>), Valve has begun requesting and requiring that UK players verify their age if they want to access any content pages marked as 'mature' on the platform.</p>



<p>Unlike other age verification processes we've started to see that <a href="https://wccftech.com/youtube-tests-ai-powered-age-verification-in-the-u-s-to-safeguard-teens/">rely on AI tools</a>, Valve is taking a simpler approach, and enforcing age verification through users inputting their credit card on Steam. A <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/fr/faqs/view/292B-3DA3-CFC8-97F6">support page outlining how it'll work</a> explains that this route was chosen due to UK regulations around needing to be 18 years of age to have a credit card in your name, and because "<em>this process preserves the maximum degree of user privacy</em>."</p>



<p>Users online began to notice this was in effect as of last Friday, according to VGC, though if you're over 18 with your own credit card registered to your Steam account, then you wouldn't have known the verification had begun since you would already be past its requirements.</p>



<p>"<em>In the UK, Ofcom is the independent regulator for online safety. Ofcom's guidance on the OSA states that one highly effective age assurance measure is credit card checks. This is because, in the UK, an individual must be at least 18 years of age to obtain a credit card, therefore credit card issuers are obliged to verify the age of an applicant before providing them with a credit card.</em>..<em>The data processed in the verification process is identical to that of the millions of other Steam users who make purchases or store their payment details for convenience. The verification process therefore provides no information about a user's content preferences to payment providers or other third parties.</em>"</p>



<p>Valve is one of several companies that have begun instituting age verification. Some, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexus-mods-age-verification-changes-uk-eu-users/">Nexus Mods</a>, are still trying to work out how age verification will be implemented, but have confirmed that it is coming. Others, like Rockstar's <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-online-age-verification/">GTA Online</a> have yet to confirm that it is being implemented, but some version of verification being enforced seems highly likely. So far, these verification implementations have mostly impacted users in the UK and the EU.</p>

            <p>Are you from the UK and partial to risque adult Steam games, such as Amarillo's Butt Slapper - the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> of Butt Slapping - or the timelessly iconic MILFs of Sunville? Bad! Naughty! GO DIRECTLY TO BED. Unless you have a valid credit card. Steam have begun rolling out a requirement for all UK-based users to verify their ages, if they wish to access store pages for games rated mature.</p>
<p>You should already have done this, of course, if you've bought anything on Steam, which I'm going to assume is 90% of you, with the other 10% being GOG stopouts, holier-than-thou Itch lovers and stinky pirates. According to reports, debit cards are acceptable too.</p> <!--more-->
<p>The regulation follows the passing of the UK's Online Safety Act, which now requires a host of online platforms to impose age verification systems, so as to protect younger people from pornography (among other things). I will offer no further comment on the OSA at this stage - it's after 2pm on Friday, which is far too late in the week to have Opinions - but I'm relieved to discover that I can still google images of donkey willies on a work PC. Eurogamer's Ed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nightingale">Nightingale</a> has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-online-safety-act-explainer">a fuller write-up</a>, if you're interested.</p>
<p>Valve have a <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/fr/faqs/view/292B-3DA3-CFC8-97F6">Steam blog</a> up, which explains the process for age verification and the need for a credit card in particular.</p>
<p>"In the UK, Ofcom is the independent regulator for online safety. Ofcom's guidance on the OSA states that one highly effective age assurance measure is credit card checks," it reads. "This is because, in the UK, an individual must be at least 18 years of age to obtain a credit card, therefore credit card issuers are obliged to verify the age of an applicant before providing them with a credit card.
</p>
<p>"Having the credit card stored as a payment method acts as an additional deterrent against circumventing age verification by sharing a single Steam user account among multiple persons," the post continues.
</p>
<p>According to the Redditors who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1n34vzd/uk_users_must_verify_their_age_to_access_steam/">spotted all this earlier today</a> (ta, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/steam-now-requires-age-verification-in-the-uk-for-mature-game-pages/">VGC</a>), debit cards appear to be acceptable at least for the time being. Which is good, because I don't have a credit card, and I'd sure hate to be unable to buy *googles random adult games again* "Ideology In Friction"? I didn't know Althusser made a porno.</p><p>Valve have had a busy few months in terms of adult-rated controversy. As you're hopefully very well aware, given that we wouldn't shut up about it, they've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">changed</a> Steam's regulations to give banks and credit card networks a say on the definition of acceptable NSFW games. A bunch of games have been delisted as a consequence. In connection to all that, Paypal recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-explain-why-using-paypal-for-steam-purchases-isnt-currently-an-option-in-a-whole-bunch-of-countries">pulled support for Steam purchases in certain countries</a> at the behest of one of their acquiring banks.</p>

              <p>Hit the button! The big red one. Over <em>there</em>. Fine, I’ll hit it. *LOUD MUSIC STARTS* Folks, it’s Friday! We made it to the weekend. But first, before you go off and enjoy the last work day of the week, please read today’s Morning Checkpoint. Today, we’re talking about <em>The Last of Us </em>TV show, looking at the future of S<em>pace Marine 2,</em> checking out some sales data for<em> Cyberpunk 2077,</em> and learning what Kojima thinks of AI. Someone hit that button again. It’s too loud, I can’t think.</p> <h2>Hideo Kojima thinks AI is the next big gaming revolution</h2> <p>The <em>Death Stranding 2</em> director was in the midst of his Saudi Arabia tour stop when he opined on how games are changing. “Gaming is always about technology,” he said during a panel discussion, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/hideo-kojima-nicolas-winding-refn-blur-lines-games-cinema-1235416035/"><em>Rolling Stone</em> reports</a>. “At first, the games were all 2D, about 16 colors, 16 bits…the biggest, first change was [that] games became 3D. The second is we [became] connected by [the] internet, and you could play [online]. The third is the trend right now that AI is now coming into game creation, and we have not just ChatGPT, but they learn from how the players control. And I think that you’ll take advantage of that.”</p> <p>But Kojima seems more interested in going to the movies or visiting museums than chatting with bots and playing games. “I probably just play maybe one game a year,” he said.</p>

 <h2><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on Switch 2 sold far more physical copies than digital</h2> <p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/75-of-cyberpunk-2077s-nintendo-switch-2-sales-were-physical/">As spotted by <em>VGC</em></a>, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> developer CD Projekt revealed during the company’s latest financial results that its open-world sci-fi RPG featuring Keanu Reeves was a big hit on Switch 2. Interestingly, 75 percent of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> copies sold on Switch 2 in June were physical game cards. This is notable as CD Projekt Red opted not to use the controversial game key card system, and instead, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> was one of the biggest third-party Switch 2 launch window games to ship entirely on a physical game cart.</p> <p>Considering <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> was reportedly the <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-switch-2-set-a-us-launch-month-record-at-1-6-million-units/">best-selling third-party game on Nintendo’s new console</a>, it seems Switch 2 owners, at least for now, prefer a real physical copy over key card shenanigans.</p>

 <h2><em>Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</em> is getting a brand new class in 2026</h2> <p><em>Space Marine 2</em> launched a year ago this month. To celebrate the third-person shooter entering its second year, <a href="https://www.focus-entmt.com/en/news/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-unveils-its-year-2-roadmap-and-sets-its-anniversary-update-to-september-4">Saber Interactive has released a new roadmap</a> for it that promises a lot of new content, including a new class: The Techmarine. The studio didn’t share many details about the new class, but did confirm that Techmarines will get to wield Omnissiah Axes, a new exclusive weapon. Beyond the new class, the next year of content includes new PVE missions, PVP maps, fresh cosmetic options, and more.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Space Marine 2 - Year 2 Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CxtlJ06u_lc?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <h2>New report claims Sony is planning a Switch-like PS6 handheld</h2> <p>YouTube channel and reliable tech leaker and reporter <a href="https://youtu.be/x-A3Bl2hXoQ">Moore’s Law Is Dead claims in a new video</a> to have seen multiple documents mentioning that Sony is working on a portable, handheld PlayStation 6 console that will launch alongside a more powerful, traditional machine. Notably, the channel claims that this PS6 handheld will support the ability to dock and connect to a TV, like the Switch, turning it into a more traditional home console. Moore’s Law Is Dead speculates that this PS6 portable console might cost around $500 and could ship sometime in 2027.</p>

 <h2>Bella Ramsey tells <em>Last of Us</em> TV show haters to go play the game</h2> <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-star-bella-ramsey-has-a-message-for-the-haters/1100-6534348/">As reported by <em>GameSpot</em> and <em>Culture Crave</em>,&nbsp;</a> Ellie actor Bella Ramsey talked about HBO’s <em>The Last of Us</em> and its already aired season two, as well as the upcoming season three. She discussed the death of Joel in season two and negative reactions to the show’s second year, saying:</p> <p>“There is nothing I can do about it anyway. The show is out. There is nothing that can be changed or altered [for Season 2]. There is not really any point in reading or looking at anything. People are of course entitled to their opinions. It doesn’t affect the show, it doesn’t affect how the show continues or anything, in any way, so they’re very separate things to me. So no, I just don’t really engage.”</p> <p>She also added that people who dislike the series can stop watching, explaining, “I would say, you don’t have to watch it. If you hate it that much, the game exists. You can just play the game again. You don’t have to watch [Season 3]. If you do want to watch it, I hope you enjoy it,”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/voidbreaker-fps-review-steam-pc-gamepass-titanfall-roguelike-roguelite-2000621067">The best new game you’re not playing is <i>Hades</i>&nbsp;meets&nbsp;<i>Portal</i>&nbsp;meets&nbsp;<i>Titanfall</i>&nbsp;meets&nbsp;<i>Battlefield</i></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-blizzard-union-ai-layoffs-microsoft-2000621003"><em>Diablo</em> developers unionized: “Passion can’t protect us from job instability”</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/hitman-woa-freelancer-world-of-assassination-roguelike-2000620985"><em>Hitman: World of Assassination</em> quietly became a lot more than just the best stealth game around</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="I Bought 100 Copies of Mario Paint for the Art" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aHuQZVtzdIo?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

<p>Video games can take a long time to make. Certain titles receive extensive development time—Hollow Knight: Silksong being an apt case study. Its development became one of myth and legend at one point, but Team Cherry’s carefully created baby is ready to be born into the world.</p>



<p>I played <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-pre-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong at Gamescom 2025</a>. My 15-minute demo gave me instant hope that the sequel is going to live up to the fevered hype. I’ve said before that you will struggle to find an indie sequel with this much popularity and pressure resting on its nimble shoulders.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>‘s development ride has taken a few detours. Let’s revisit history and fill in some blanks for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-has-team-cherry-developed-hollow-knight-silksong-for">How Long Has Team Cherry Developed Hollow Knight: Silksong For?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hopefully, it’s worth the wait. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s estimated that Hollow Knight: Silksong’s development first began in 2018, meaning the game has been in development for seven long years!</strong></p>



<p>This means official work on Silksong began only one year after Hollow Knight was released, and a year before the general public was introduced to Hollow Knight: Silksong altogether.</p>



<p>A fascinating article was released in August 2025 detailing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-hollow-knight-silksong-took-so-long-to-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why Hollow Knight: Silksong took so long to release</a>. Quite simply, Team Cherry was having too much fun crafting the game, experimenting with new ideas, and making sure Silksong was worthy of being a sequel—instead of the DLC it was originally intended as.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-was-hollow-knight-silksong-first-announced">When Was Hollow Knight: Silksong First Announced?</h2>



<p><strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong was first revealed to the world on Feb. 14, 2019, through its reveal trailer.</strong></p>



<p>You can find the “Hollow Knight: Silksong Reveal Trailer” on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TeamCherry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Team Cherry</a>‘s YouTube channel. The two-minute trailer shows off a decent amount of Silksong, and it seemed like it wouldn’t be <em>that </em>long until we got our hands on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-hollow-knight-silksong-a-sequel-or-prequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sequel</a>.</p>



<p>Little did we know that it would take over six years until the game launched (and it’s still not technically out yet).</p>



<p>Check out the original reveal trailer below and see if you can spot anything from the Silksong demo or recent trailers and footage.</p>

<hr>



<p>You can throw the words myth and legend into the bin. Silksong is coming. Team Cherry’s effort should be worth the wait, and I’ll be diving into Pharloom the second it launches. I’m genuinely so excited for Silksong, but let me know your thoughts on it through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>



<p>You should also stick around and see if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silksong is on the Switch or Switch 2</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-you-need-to-play-hollow-knight-before-silksong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">if you need to play Hollow Knight before Silksong</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/analysis-key-takeaways-from-gamescom-the-worlds-largest-games-event.1284018/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The recent slowdown in the global games market has had a noticeable impact on industry events, with many leading conferences and trade shows experiencing reduced footfall or struggling to expand their show floors. It was therefore an encouraging sign for the industry to see Gamescom, the world's largest games event, continue to buck the trend. This year's event welcomed 357,000 visitors from 128 countries, an increase of 7 percent over 2024, with over 34,000 trade visitors, up 6 percent year-on-year. The number of exhibitors also grew by 7 percent.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile, the developer-focused sister event, Devcom—soon to be rebranded as "Gamescom Dev"—also enjoyed record attendance, with 5,400 participants, signaling sustained interest in developer-oriented sessions despite broader market challenges. The contrast between Gamescom's bustling floors and the struggles of other events over the past year underscores its position as a central meeting point for both trade and consumer audiences.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All major game companies, with the exception of PlayStation, participated in Gamescom 2025. As in previous years, China-based publishers maintained a particularly strong presence at Gamescom, not through traditional publisher branding, but through content-focused booths emphasizing live-service offerings. Many of these companies are still seeking to expand their footprint in Western markets, using Gamescom as a platform to showcase their IP to a broader audience.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While an event of this scale inevitably encompasses countless news stories and themes, a number of key topics stood out to the Omdia analyst team at this year's show. These trends and developments provide a window into the broader dynamics shaping the global games industry in 2025 and beyond.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Nascent PC handhelds category plant roots for Xbox's future&nbsp;">Nascent PC handhelds category plant roots for Xbox's future&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the start of this decade, Microsoft set out an ambitious goal—to reach a billion gamers worldwide. The strategy relied on three pillars the rapid growth of Xbox Game Pass, cloud streaming to multiple devices, and strong adoption of the Xbox Series X/S consoles. Five years later, none of these have scaled as the company hoped. Game Pass growth has stalled and cloud gaming hasn't resonated to a new audience, meanwhile, active installed base of Xbox consoles is estimated to be flatlining around 42m players by the end of 2025, according to Omdia's Games Addressable Market Metrics Database.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gamescom 2025 highlighted Microsoft's evolving strategy to reach its goal. Aside from its continued commitment to bring games to competing consoles including the Switch 2, the company is now placing much greater emphasis on PC as a core engagement platform, and making much-needed investments in Windows to serve as an aggregator of PC games content.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This strategy is being led by the new full-screen experience for Windows—an Xbox-like interface on the PC—which is scheduled to debut alongside Microsoft's first co-branded PC gaming handheld: The Asus ROG Xbox Ally. The new full screen experience solves a core challenge plaguing PC gaming handhelds to date, most notably Windows' poor suitability for the form factor.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But it also pulls through content from additional storefronts such as Steam. This integration offers a clearer picture of Microsoft's broader ambition: to leverage the massive PC gaming audience as a touchpoint for Xbox software and services. Omdia's Addressable Market Metrics Database estimates Steam had 316 million yearly active users at the end of 2024, representing a huge audience for Microsoft to engage. Yet many questions remain unanswered, including the mismatch of Xbox content between console platforms and the PC. Furthermore, much needed functionality, such as advanced shader delivery and the Handheld Compatibility Program, are unlikely to bear fruit for years.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nonetheless, Microsoft is playing a long game. The functionality revealed at Gamescom provides a solid starting point, and handheld PCs running Windows will soon get a much-overdue shot in the arm. Omdia estimates 2.3 million devices will be sold through to consumers in 2025—representing a small, but meaningful avenue to expand Xbox's presence on PC.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Focus turns to practical applications of AI in game development">Focus turns to practical applications of AI in game development</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">AI was not as immediately visible at Gamescom this year as at some recent trade shows, perhaps reflecting that the initial phase of the hype cycle may have peaked. Beneath the surface, it's clear that more substantive applications of AI are coming to the fore. Companies such as AWS and Google are shifting from promoting AI in the abstract to working with customers on the details of implementation. A similar shift could be seen in the content program at Devcom with a higher proportion of AI-related talks focusing on specific applications.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is also increasing clarity about where these early AI implementations can have most impact. While AI tools will almost certainly eventually have an enormous impact on the core creative workflows of game development, immediate gains have been slow to emerge due to a combination of challenges of integration and limitations of the underlying technology. On the other hand, business-focused use cases—especially in marketing, user acquisition, and LiveOps—are already showing increasing compelling results, suggesting that these are the areas where the impact of AI will be most immediately felt in the games industry.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Nintendo Switch 2 remains in a state of soft launch">Nintendo Switch 2 remains in a state of soft launch</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite its record-breaking launch in June, Switch 2 saw a limited presence on the show floor, outside of Nintendo's own booth. Omdia learned that a shortage of development hardware continues – even amongst long-time publishing partners – and has greatly hampered publishers' ability to release Switch 2 content.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The wider event brought few surprises in terms of reveals for previously-unannounced Switch 2 games. This extends to major titles such as Microsoft's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which was slated for a vague 2026 release window. In short, Omdia believes the wider publishing opportunity for Switch 2 will remain uncontestable to all third-party publishers until at least 2026.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For 2025, Nintendo's strategy appears focused on building Switch 2's installed base through a highly curated approach: monthly first-party releases, select second-party releases such as Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, and a limited selection of hand-picked third-party content from its most trusted partners. This is in line with Omdia's prediction that Nintendo would throttle the volume of new releases to Switch 2 software breathing room on a crowded Nintendo eShop. Nevertheless, for publishers, the wider content opportunity remains on the horizon.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Backend infrastructure providers face headwinds&nbsp;">Backend infrastructure providers face headwinds&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The AI boom stands in contrast to a noticeably more gloomy mood in the market for traditional servers in backend infrastructure, particularly the smaller players hoping to break the dependance of the majority of game studios on hyperscale cloud and in-house tooling. There are undoubtedly success stories in the backend market, notably Heroic Labs which hosted a lavish celebration of its tenth anniversary at Gamescom. The desire to showcase the company's longevity is itself telling, however, serving to highlight a challenge faced by all startups hoping to provide studios with critical infrastructure: convincing prospective customers that you will be around for the long haul. The resulting chicken-and-egg problem—as studios wait for their peers to adopt new solutions before committing themselves—has proven hard to solve.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Few question the fundamental thesis which has driven the proliferation of backend service providers: that developers are better off working with specialized partners to deliver best-in-class solutions than wasting resources each building duplicative systems. But with the market highly fragmented and momentum slow to develop, it seems inevitable that many backend service providers will fail over the next few years. The survivors may yet deliver on their early promise, but there was increasing acceptance from industry insiders at Gamescom that the prospects of rapid growth were receding and winning over developers would be a long-term project.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Appendix">Appendix</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Further reading:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Omdia and Game Developer are sibling organizations under Informa.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Authors</h2><div><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Principal Analyst, Games Tech, Omdia</p><div data-testid="contributor-summary-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Liam leads Omdia’s games tech coverage with his research focusing on the technology and services that power the video games market, and exploring the B2B value chain connecting games development to service providers to consumers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Prior to joining Omdia, Liam worked at Irdeto, a digital platform security company and owner of Denuvo, a leading provider of security technology to the games industry, where he advised senior management and product teams on market trends and strategy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Long Story Short&nbsp;</em>is the latest animated series from&nbsp;<em>Bojack Horseman</em>&nbsp;creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg, with art by Lisa Hanawalt of&nbsp;<em>Bojack</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Tuca &amp; Bertie</em>. Despite this pedigree, it feels like it's slipped under the radar a bit, with many folks we know remarking that they didn't even know it was out. Riley and Isaiah have both watched it, and we're here to talk what we loved about it, and what hit a bit too close to home.</p><p><strong>(Spoilers for <em>Long Story Short</em> follow.)</strong></p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Hello, Isaiah! You and I have both finished Netflix's <em>Long Story Short</em>. I totally loved it, and was shocked--which sounds weird to say--by how funny it was. What did you think?</p><p><strong>Isaiah: </strong>When I first caught wind that the creator of<em>&nbsp;Bojack Horseman</em>&nbsp;was back with a new animated series about a family, I was really worried it'd be another oppressively depressing watch like&nbsp;<em>Bojack&nbsp;</em>was. And, like, for all the wonderful writing and brutally honest things <em>Bojack</em> had to say about Hollywood and how stars cope or make their scandals worse, that show was a huge feel-bad watch from pillar to post. So I assumed <em>Long Story Short</em> would be more the same, with the added feel-bad factor of it following a family over time. Long story short on my preface here: I was surprised with how much it didn't suck to watch!</p><p>If anything, I feel I might've enjoyed the show more because it was about a tight-knit family and their problems over Hollywood bullshit.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Long Story Short | Official Trailer | Netflix" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wWziW_vQ_L4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I feel like the tide has really turned on how people feel about&nbsp;<em>Bojack</em>, and I'm not quite sure when or why that happened. Maybe because I got sober while <em>Bojack</em> was airing, and then Bojack the character&nbsp;got sober in the show's final season, but I found that show really moving and I rewatch it a lot, and I always feel a little miffy that people seem to not like it now. If anything, I found&nbsp;<em>Long Story Short</em>&nbsp;a bit grimmer in the way its characters are trapped in a familial cycle of hurt and bickering, with a certain kind of "no way out" vibe that I think&nbsp;<em>Bojack&nbsp;</em>does, eventually, find a way to free its characters from.</p><p><strong>Isaiah: </strong>I think for me,&nbsp;<em>Bojack</em>'s gap between moments of levity and everything else became so large as the series went on that it, on top of being pretty prescient with Me Too and folks wrestling with separating the art from the artist, made it feel a little too raw at times. </p><p>Yet somehow, for me, watching<em>&nbsp;Long Story Short</em>&nbsp;tell a non-linear tale about a family and their achievements and their attempts to foist the perpetuation of generational trauma was more a "the devil I know" kind of comedy show. The Schwooper family's whole "joke through the pain" vibe to get at deeper problems was something I felt was more relatable than the more parasocial news headlines of an actor's fall from grace.</p><p>Which is kinda funny to say that I related more to the Jewish family's generational trauma than the anthropomorphic horse's cancellation.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I think I said this to you when we were first talking about <em>Long Story Short</em>, but as someone raised Jewish (despite my name, lol), I was really delighted by how funny and relatable the show was. The ninth episode in particular, where mother Naomi is being honored by the JCC and her son Avi learns all these new things about her--how she's been supportive of all these people in ways he never knew, while he thinks she's been so harsh and exacting with him--is almost entirely something that happened to me with my own mom that still looms really large in my relationship with her. How&nbsp;<em>loud</em>&nbsp;the family is, how there's this endless stream of jokes and insults and chatter, is something my friends have remarked on when they've come to my house, and feels like every childhood get-together with the Jewish side of my family, where you leave a gathering unsure if everyone had a nice visit or was just fighting the whole time. The flipside of that dynamic, though, can be a kind of cruelty that gets painted as love because your family&nbsp;<em>says</em>&nbsp;it's love, which is certainly not unique to Jewish families but definitely... can be expressed in a unique way in Jewish families, maybe.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Long Story Short | Story Time | Sneak Peek | Netflix" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jxW71mWwHRA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>Isaiah: </strong>While I don't think it entirely pertains to the show, growing up in a Lutheran family who was a staple in our church in Cabrini Green had tons of crossover with how decorum would occasionally give way to joking relationships that were sharp jabs at festering issues under the surface between church members and my own family. I had to read between the lines and decipher those kind of battle lines of what is and isn't a touchy subject. I felt that was perfectly encompassed in the first episode with how Avi characterized his girlfriend getting berated by his mother with mean asides as a sign that she likes her. I feel like I've been both on the receiving end of that refrain and the one delivering it to my own partner. The show is really good about playing with humor to get at deeper truths and how eventually, the jokes have to get put to the side to air out grievances.</p><p>I think I related more to Avi's whole storyline by virtue of that being the stage I am in my own life, but I was enamored by how by the end of the first episode I felt I knew every character's whole deal and wanted to witness how they matured from moments that might've traumatized them and, in turn, discover what watershed moment led them to cope with issues the way they do in the show's whole&nbsp;<em>Memento&nbsp;</em>approach to non-linear storytelling.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I wasn't sold on the way the story is told non-chronologically at first, but it eventually really grew on me. Like you say, you get all the main beats pretty much right away, and what happened when sort of doesn't matter as much. It's a real departure from the sort of relentless linearity of&nbsp;<em>Bojack</em>, which really did a lot to make characters have to live with their actions and sit through their shit. Here, jumping in time really paints the emotional vibe of the show, and I think really captures the way family stuff can fester over the years.</p><p><strong>Isaiah: </strong>I think too, the show's also just really funny. Oftentimes, I feel animated shows will either rely on referential humor to whatever funny thing happened in Hollywood or memes that wind up dating its jokes upon revisits. <em>Long Story Short</em> is a show rife with the kind of natural situational humor or observations I would stifle a laugh at in my own life. Moments like trying to save a seat for multiple people in a theater or trying to discreetly argue outside of said theater next to another group also arguing is the kind of tapped-in, evergreen humor that made shows like <em>The Simpsons</em> seminal. <em>Long Story Short</em> is filled with those moments and then some. </p><p>It's also occasionally absurdist. My favorite moments tend to be whenever the youngest son, Yoshi, is on his Todd Chavez misadventures, like a visual gag of him being in a car crash with produce trucks making a sandwich and his whole harebrained mattress-in-a-tube scheme turning into ticking timebombs.</p><figure><figcaption>Netflix</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Haha, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOVfl4uskFI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mattress tube</a> episode. I was worried his character was, like, too zany given the largely grounded nature of the show, but I really came around in the intervention episode, when it turns out his big secret isn't that he's using drugs or alcohol, but that he's become Orthodox. I thought that was such a weird, lovely kind of religion deep cut, and I really liked how it played out in the finale.</p><p>I think the show does a good job, by and large, of blending that sort of zany stuff that <em>Bojack</em> could get away with by virtue of everyone being animals with the more grounded, realistic stuff. In some ways it could have probably just as easily been live action instead of animation, but at the same time it takes advantage of not being that to have these really nice visual gags that Hanawalt is so good at.</p><p><strong>Isaiah: </strong>By the time I hit credits on the finale, I felt both satisfied and I wanted more. Of course, being the kind of person who'd usually write or critique a show like this, my blog brain had me wondering if there was any more story to tell knowing it'd already been renewed for a <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/long-story-short-renewed-season-2-netflix-season-1-release-1236475449/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second season</a>. But I think the show left enough room creatively to keep going for another ten episodes and did an exceptional job with instilling the feeling in me as a viewer to want the show to keep going. It feels almost&nbsp;<em>JoJo's</em>-esque with how they've already established the next generation in the Schwooper family. It'll be interesting to see cycles get broken and how they'll handle not making new&nbsp; problematic spokes for their young'uns to dismantle.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I did feel at the end that it both was and wasn't finished-- it might have been the nature of my watching it in a few big chunks for prospective blog purposes, but it did start to feel a little bit like it was circling the same problems, and I worry that while the story didn't&nbsp;<em>feel</em>&nbsp;resolved at the end, more show will just start to feel oppressive the way you highlight <em>Bojack</em> as feeling. I would be happy if it was just done, but since it's not, I hope they find some new material to mine within that format.</p><p><strong>Isaiah: </strong>That's fair. I spaced out my viewing on a Saturday between getting groceries and doing other odd things, so I kind of gave myself some time to ruminate on things that happened in episodic chunks before circling back to it. Maybe that influenced how I felt walking away from the show more glowingly than letting Netflix's whole binge-watch model make it feel like having "the -itis" from a hearty Thanksgiving feast. I do hope that what I felt got resolved won't become a retread for future seasons, but in a way, that's families to a T, so I'll give a wide birth to the show should that be some big-brained point of the whole series.</p><figure><figcaption>Netflix</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I'll be honest that it's tough for me to watch shows about families, especially when they feature older parents. My own parents are quite up there in years, and our relationship has always been... well gosh, it's hard to say. It was definitely "bad" in the traditional sense when I first came out as trans, and over the years it's changed in this way where I'll sometimes say "yeah, we get along well now" and then my friends will remind me that my mom still uses the wrong name and pronoun for me 20+ years since my coming out and I'm like, "right, gosh,&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;this good?" In that way, a lot of the kids' relationship with Naomi really resonated with me, again this kind of "I can be as cruel as I want because I love you, and I love you because I say I do" thing. </p><p>But we see the kids also really wrangle with, what kind of mom was their mom and what kind of family did they have? And I think it's something we all have to wrestle with as our parents get old. Like I think a lot about how one day--not soon, hopefully, but&nbsp;<em>soon</em>--my relationship with my folks will be the whole of it, and anything we don't resolve will just never be resolved, and have I been my best self and what do I need to do to feel good about that inevitable ending, and... ah. It's a lot, and <em>Long Story Short</em> really dug a lot of that stuff up for me.</p><p><strong>Isaiah: </strong>I feel that on the family front. While me and my mom are on all accounts good in the kind of parent-child relationship where we're both the quiet ones in our otherwise loud family, seeing Avi go a bit overboard with calling out his mom for her bullshit made me remember a time when I told my mom that I couldn't forgive her for a well-meaning wellness call gone awry during covid. The whole waking up to police outside my door to take me to the hospital, not giving me enough time to splash water on my face and hours in the ER with folks who were legit sick was something my Buddha-like patience couldn't excuse, so I related to Avi's crash out at his mom for the harm she caused. I think the whole "I love you say it back" deal with Naomi and her kids and grandkids highlighted that that love isn't the kind of assured thing that lets you get away with how someone makes their loved ones feel, even if its well intentioned.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>The show is really good at interrogating what love and care really&nbsp;<em>are</em>, in a way I think <em>Bojack</em> was too--not cutting away from relationships at the most dramatic moments but instead really sitting with them and their aftermaths. I think making the show animated definitely keeps it from being&nbsp;<em>too much</em>, though I am also a big fan of adult animation, whereas I know some folks aren't.</p><p><strong>Isaiah: </strong>For sure. The show's whole aesthetic definitely helps make its more contentious moments more palatable. Just another reason why I champion animated shows being the shit, and&nbsp;<em>Long Story Short</em>&nbsp;is no exception.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/vivi-is-screwing-up-magic-the-gathering-and-you-know-what-good-for-him"><h3>Vivi Is Screwing Up Magic: The Gathering, And You Know What?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Time Takers is a new PvP third-person action-hero-shooter that was debuted by publisher NCSOFT and developer Mistill Games during <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom ONL 2025</a>. Instead of picking one side of combat, where you're either focused on melee or ranged engagements, Mistill Games wants you to have total freedom with how you play. The studio's chief executive officer and the game's director, Yongmin Jo, also calls it giving more players a chance to win "<em>even if your aim isn't perfect."</em></p>



<p>The game was revealed at Gamescom ONL 2025, with its debut trailer focused more on its fantastical setting, which is one where the heroes you play as are pulled from all different corners of time. A medieval-era knight fights alongside a futuristic astronaut monkey and a bionic samurai with insanely powerful robot legs. To call it a mash-up is almost an understatement.</p>



<p>More recently, a new developer video featuring Yongmin Jo digs into the core features of the game, showing how teamwork and the freedom to develop your own strategy is at the heart of real success in Time Takers, as you're constantly racing against the clock, trying to give yourself more time on the battlefield to be the last squad standing.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Time Takers | Dev Video : CORE GAME FEATURES" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W9Bvd-iknp0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As part of its teamwork focus, the core mechanic in Time Takers is the fact that you are always trying to take more time for yourself and your squad to survive. You'll constantly make decisions around your Time Energy, whether to save it to help you survive for longer, or to use it to charge your abilities and help you be more aggressive in each match.</p>



<p>It seems to be a mechanical way of trying to prevent each match from having a surplus of players that just  try to wait the whole match out and try to win by taking the final two fighting squads by surprise. It's a strategy you could surely employ, but you'd be doing so from a disadvantage, as you've had to spend your energy on staying in the game, instead of trying to win it.</p>



<p>If Time Takers looks like the kind of game you'd want to try, then you'll soon be able to, as there is an upcoming playtest you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3596040/Time_Takers/">currently sign up for on its Steam page.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s open beta may be over, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a> might also have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-pave-over-battlefield-2042s-bullet-casing-filled-potholes-with-a-road-to-battlefield-6">transformed into Battlefield 6</a>, but there must be more battles in the fields of six, so sign-ups for another round of Labs testing are now open. Two fresh maps with plenty of room for vehicle-based fisticuffs will be on offer, as well as a chance to check out the server browser that may well be chock full of 24/7 scraps once the final game launches.</p>
<p>EA have wheeled out all of this info in two separate <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-battlefield-labs-testing">blog</a> <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1961084754091995529">posts</a>, which follow neatly on from them running down <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bunnyhop-elsewhere-streamers-ea-are-making-battlefield-6-more-strategic-less-run-and-gun-following-the-beta">all of their learnings from the open beta</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First of all, the two maps. Operation Firestorm and Mirak Valley are set to debut, and if you were among the many miffed at the open beta <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-betas-rush-mode-gets-a-balancing-tweak-with-ea-monitoring-the-situation-amid-player-complaints-about-battle-bigness">largely sticking to smaller maps</a>, you'll be glad to hear that they facilitate larger scraps with "a diverse range of vehicles, from quad bikes to tanks and aircraft".</p>
<p>As you might expect, their inclusion's part of EA working to ensure "balancing occurs across different-sized environments" following the open beta. "Improvements to weapons, large-scale vehicular combat, gadget balancing, and more" are all on the publisher's radar to monitor and tweak. This round of testing'll  also be used to lock in "the official setting for Hardcore mode", so put on your best killing pants.</p><p>If you hop into this latest Labs test, you'll also get your first chance to muck around with a work-in-progress version of Battlefield 6's server browser. Its features will be "intentionally limited" so EA can focus on making sure it's stable and useable at a basic level. Basically, making sure folks can set up a server via a shortcode, fill out its description and tags, then host away trouble-free as other players join and leave.</p>
<p>Those who've grown up jumping into 24/7 servers that serve you one map on repeat and don't disappear when everyone goes to bed at the end of the first day will be glad to know EA have confirmed custom servers will be persistent. It won't cost you any extra over the base price of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> either, which is a nice bit of non-money-grabbing from EA, and should mean Battlefield 6 has less trouble establishing a strong sense of community out of the gate.</p>
<p>If you've not taken part in any Battlefield 6 Labs tests to this point, you can <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-labs">head here to sign up</a>. Though, there's no guarantee you'll be granted access either right away or at all, as the spots are much more limted than the open beta.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-world-championship-closing-ceremony-recap-z-a-2000618195"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>is shaking up the series’ formula in more ways than one when it launches in October. It’s got real-time combat, it all takes place in one city rather than an entire region, and it has a new take on multiplayer to take advantage of that new battle system. Even with all this newness, perhaps the most exciting thing Game Freak is adding is more of something old: Mega Evolutions. These superpowered temporary transformations have long been one of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans’ </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-battle-best-gimmicks-mega-evolution-tera-types-1850736746"><span>favorite battle gimmicks</span></a><span> from over the years, and since we’re heading back to Kalos, their region of origin, what better time than now to add a wave of new Mega Evolutions? A list of possible new forms </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolutions-new-leak-starters-1851772521"><span>leaked earlier this year</span></a><span>, and so far it seems to be accurate. Here are all the Mega Evolutions we know of so far.</span></p> <h2><b>Mega Dragonite</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Start a New Story in Lumiose City with Pokémon Legends: Z-A!" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fWDx1omjIwM?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>  <p><span>Mega Dragonite was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-legends-za-champions-friends-concierge-1851786682"><span>the first new form</span></a><span> revealed for </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>. It emphasizes traits from its pre-evolution, Dragonair, by including a jewel on its tail and adding wings to the sides of its head. It maintains its Dragon/Flying typing, but becomes exceptionally faster and stronger in this form. Mega Dragonite views taking out an enemy quickly as an act of kindness, and has a jolly big smile when it uses powerful attacks because it knows all this violence will be over soon. It’s basically Superman.</span></p> <h2><b>Mega Victreebel</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Mega Victreebel Raises a Stink! | Pokémon Legends: Z-A" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f79j5pSboEQ?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>used a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-victreebel-evolution-trailer-2000619134"><span>spooky found footage video</span></a><span> to reveal Mega Victreebel, but if you take it out of that environment, it is one of the goofier looking Mega Evolutions in the series. The pitcher plant Pokémon’s body has become so engorged with acid that it ties one of its own vines around its throat in order to contain all of it within its bulbous stomach. Now it hops around on its belly as it stalks its prey and loosens the grip around its neck when it needs to projectile vomit its acid onto an enemy.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Mega Hawlucha</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Mega Hawlucha Makes a Comeback! | Pokémon Legends: Z-A" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xt4ccSMw870?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-hawlucha-machamp-trailer-2000620960"><span>Hawlucha’s new Mega form</span></a><span> is probably the most straightforward one we’ve seen thus far. It gets buff like it’s been downing creatine, dons a new mask and cape combo, and its feathers form a belt around its waist. Mega Hawlucha also gets a signature move called Flying Press that it used on Machamp in its reveal cinematic.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>That’s all the Mega Evolutions we know of so far. Game Freak will no doubt reveal more between now and when </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>comes to Switch and Switch 2 on October 16. Will Mega Raichu be among them, or will I be made to suffer </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-raichu-alolan-pikachu-anime-1851011570"><span>another slight for my favorite electric rodent</span></a><span>? We all know the answer. I don’t need you to rub it in.</span></p>
