At one point, it looked like the player-count for Stellar Blade would be negatively impacted due to an unknown issue that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stellar-blade-on-pc-has-been-blocked-in-over-130-countries-catching-its-developer-by-surprise/1100-6531596/" data-ref-id="1100-6531596">prevented it from being sold in dozens of countries</a>, but that problem was addressed before launch.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VyeH5uteVk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_VyeH5uteVk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>If you're interested in trying out this action-RPG, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-pc-version-of-stellar-blade-has-a-steam-demo/1100-6531966/">a Stellar Blade demo</a> is available on Steam.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-is-being-dominated-by-one-busted-technique-crushing-people-with-helicopters<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune Awakening</a> is currently in the primordial ooze phase of its PvP meta, as players hit the end game and figure out which weapons and strategies are the best for taking out their fellow man. In this soup they've discovered a busted technique that's strong - so strong that the developers are stepping in to fix it.</p>
<p>That technique is repeatedly landing your orniphopter (the Dune equivalent of a helicopter) onto someone until they die. You see, a player packing a pistol or powerful rifle may be able to outshoot a foe on foot, but these weapons won't do much against a vehicle.</p>
<p>While a buggy or bike can be avoided by climbing to higher ground, an orniphopter crushing from above is significantly harder to avoid. Add on top of this the fact that landing on a player doesn't damage the vehicle in any way, and you've got an ammoless, largely skilless method of taking out any player you find in a PvP environment.</p>

<figcaption>Check out the latest cinematic trailer for Dune Awakening here!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOGwZO_i-6o" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>This scenario is perfectly captured by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1l92wsl/dune_developpers_i_agree_to_have_a_defeat_in_pvp/">Bombe18 on the Dune Reddit</a>, who provided a video of them being repeatedly crushed in the Deep Desert. What's particularly funny about this video is the pilots appear to be letting Mr Bombe18 self revive each time before crushing them again.</p>
<p>Later in the video, another orniphopter flies over and joins in, at which point Bombe uses the in-game proximity voice chat to concede defeat. To this surrender, the pilots silently continue to crush Bombe.</p>
<p>In the replies to this video, Funcom's very own CCO Joel Bylos responded to say: "Yeah sorry about this. We have people working on fixing the goomba stomping ASAP."</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="566"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1l92wsl/dune_developpers_i_agree_to_have_a_defeat_in_pvp/">Dune developpers, I agree to have a defeat in PVP. But been crushed by orni that do not take any damage. No.</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Bombe18/">u/Bombe18</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/">duneawakening</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>So there are multiple ways of looking at this. Let's start at the obvious. This is quite funny. Not for Bombe, or anyone else on the receiving end of orniphopter "goomba stomping", but for those watching it happen. Especially the pilots, one can only assume.</p>
<p>But it probably isn't healthy for the game either. One could argue, as I was initially inclined, that the game provides weapons better suited for dealing with vehicles. The missile launcher is the obvious example.</p>
<p>But, then again, should every Dune Awakening player have to pack a missile launcher for a trip to the Deep Desert, <a href="https://youtu.be/xE0V-TmqTP8?t=168">lest they end up like Romano in ER</a>? The answer is probably no.</p>
<p>You could also argue that the game has only been out for a short while,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-hits-142000-concurrent-players-during-full-launch-smashing-past-record"> and its substantial playerbase</a> could have adapted to the orniphopter crushing strategy with techniques of their own. Perhaps widespread adoption of the missile launcher, sure. Or maybe a standard practice of keeping a bike in your vehicle storage, so that you can quickly drop a bike and hop on it before you get stuck in the great limbo of orniphotercide.</p>
<p>This would be more convincing if crashing into people from above was an intended use of the orniphopter, and not an obvious oversight. Bylos' quick response and promise to remedy the situation reveals this to be true. So, as funny as it is to watch videos of Dune Awakening Goomba stomps happen, the sooner this technique is banished from the game the better.</p>

<figure><a title="MK1 Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/35a1c18445e5f/mk1-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Fellow fatality fans, it seems there's currently a bit of a problem in the six realms, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mortal_kombat_1">Mortal Kombat 1</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/mortal-kombat-1">a game that received a scathing review from yours truly</a> for its hideous Switch performance, has been made unavailable to either purchase or download via the Nintendo Switch 2 eShop. However, if you already own the game on Switch 1, then you can indeed play it on the console.</p>
<p>You can understand this writer's surprise when trying to locate a game that they'd already purchased in order to retest its performance on Nintendo's slick new console, only to be met with no way to get it on said console. Taking a look at the game on the eShop, it's greyed out and tells us that it's incompatible with the Switch 2. <a href="https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-Games+with+issues+that+prevent+progress+on+Nintendo+Switch+2%2C+including+games+with+start+up+issues-EN.pdf?_gl=1*1bbhfx2*_gcl_au*MTE5NDE2ODI3Ni4xNzQzNTk4NTIz*_ga*MTMyNTgyODQ1Ny4xNzQzNTk4NTI0*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*czE3NDk3MTg2NTQkbzMwJGcwJHQxNzQ5NzE4NjU2JGo1OCRsMCRoMjEzNzM0NjMyMQ..">Flipping over to Nintendo's official list of incompatible games</a> does show us MK1 has a problem, but it simply says <em>"issue is being investigated".</em></p><p><figure data-videoid="-ftUzIFBTSc" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-ftUzIFBTSc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-ftUzIFBTSc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-ftUzIFBTSc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed379e42nqirmy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ftUzIFBTSc">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>However, if you already own the game and are having the same issues in trying to get it on your Switch 2, simply make sure to do a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-system-transfer-how-to-move-all-games-saves-profiles-from-switch-1">full and proper system transfer</a> from your OG Switch - which you hopefully had done anyway - and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/how-do-nintendo-switch-2-virtual-game-cards-work-game-transfer-and-lending-guide">Virtual Game Card</a> will pop up in your collection.</p>
<p>Simple, straightforward, but still confusing enough when players aren't entirely au fait with the ins and outs of the new console.</p>

<p>Now, the most interesting part of all this, to us at least, is once you manage to download the game, it looks far less blurry and plays much, <em>much</em> better. Incompatible my arse, as the man says. Menus that used to crawl to the point you might turn it off before getting into a fight, are now slick and quick to browse through. That's a huge improvement, and the resolution seems to have auto-upgraded itself to a very crisp level.</p>
<p>The fights feel properly smooth, it's fully enjoyable - well, it has been for the ten or so scraps we've had...and even the (almost entirely dead) online is working. Oh, and the loading times, which were <em>awfu</em>l, are now almost non-existent. It's all very zippy.</p>
<p>In bouts, the graphics <em>are</em> still noticeably downgraded, and the transitions between cutscene and fight, which are so magically seamless on next-gen consoles, are clunky-looking as a result. But! And it's a big old but, it plays better.</p>

<p>It's not entirely free of micro-stutters during cutscenes, and maybe it still chugs somewhere along the line during the huge campaign, but hey, you can now play and enjoy this game fully - which given it was truly unplayable or thereabouts, is a good thing! And, if you own the Definitive Edition there's a ton of fun solo stuff to be doing here, even if the online is a ghost town.</p>
<p>So, unavailable to purchase or download on Switch 2 as it may be, if you own it already (or just buy it on your Switch 1 and then transfer it), now is the best time to dive into Mortal Kombat on a Nintendo console.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/grave-seasons-preview-farming-sim-with-killer-vibes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>No matter the season, a farming sim is sure to provide some good fun. Though, if I were to play&nbsp;<em>Grave Seasons</em>, October might just be the time to do it. Innocuous at first glance,&nbsp;<em>Grave Seasons</em>&nbsp;has something sinister lurking just below the surface.</p>

<p>At Summer Game Fest 2025, we had the chance to check out&nbsp;<em>Grave Seasons</em>, an upcoming farming sim game from developer Perfect Garbage and publisher Blumhouse Games. If you know what kind of genre Blumhouse is known for, you might see where this one is going.</p>



<h2>Farming in Unfamiliar Territory</h2>

<p>My demo with&nbsp;<em>Grave Seasons&nbsp;</em>starts out simple enough. You've just become the owner of a farm; really, this is the start of your new life in a strange town, filled with individuals you don't yet know. As soon as you leave the farmhouse, you're met with a burly man named Hari who introduces himself.</p>

<p>He's a little strange and has some large scars on his body, but I don't judge. Supposedly, he's a farmer as well. The previous owner of the farm is someone he knew, but no one seems to know what happened to them. Either way, Hari lets us be and we get a lay of the land.</p>



<p>Our new farm is quite large and already has a bunch of crops growing. There are various sheds and other farming-related equipment in various states of disrepair, so one can assume that, as time goes on, you'll be able to renovate and utilize these. The main purpose of the farm, at least on a surface level, is to make money.</p>

<p>And so, my first day was spent getting familiar with the surrounding lands and doing a bit of cleanup. If you're familiar with games such as&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon</em>, it's a game that should click with you pretty quickly.</p>

<p>You have a handy radial menu to utilize various tools like a watering can, axe, and others, so switching equipment is super simple. I went around and harvested whatever crops were already growing, and even found a few seeds to plant. It ain't much, but it's honest work. And I'm going to just ignore the fact that I dug up a severed hand.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>A Dark Turn</h2>

<p>A bit later on in the day, another neighbor introduces themselves. This is Pilar, and she has an interesting sense of fashion, but seems friendly enough. She invites me to scrounge around in the forest later that evening, so I make a mental note and continue on until it's time.</p>

<p>After mulling around for a bit, doing more cleanup and cutting down some trees, I arrive at the forest at around 10 p.m., only for our reunion to be cut short by a sight of absolute horror. From the dark shadows of the forest come a beast with vivid white fangs and eyes.</p>

<p>It absolutely tears Pilar apart, spreading a trail of carnage in its wake. Blood and guts are everywhere. The once charming pixel art turns into something shockingly gory. The beast, though it's gone, left plenty of evidence in its wake. We need to investigate what happened, because Pilar just got eviscerated before our very eyes.</p>



<p>Clearly, the town in&nbsp;<em>Grave Seasons</em>&nbsp;holds dark secrets. There's a killer about, and some supernatural seems to be at play. That's the big twist in&nbsp;<em>Grave Seasons</em>: There's a killer that you need to catch. On top of farming, you're investigating the killer in an effort to save the town.</p>

<p>Presumably save the town, anyways, as there's a large emphasis on narrative choice. Pilar, who died? She was predetermined to die in our demo, but in a normal playthrough, I'm told you can prevent her murder. Who lives and who dies is determined by the player's actions, meaning there's a great degree of narrative variance. Heck, you can also romance the murderer.</p>

<p>The killer also changes from playthrough to playthrough, so you can never be too sure who to trust.&nbsp;<em>Grave Seasons</em>&nbsp;seems to be a game that encourages multiple runs, then, as I'm certainly keen on seeing why certain killers are motivated to do what they do.</p>



<h2><em>Grave Seasons</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I'm also told that breaking and entering into villager's homes plays a big part in&nbsp;<em>Grave Seasons</em>. Unlike, say,&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley</em>&nbsp;where you can mosey on into a home,&nbsp;<em>Grave Seasons</em>' villagers have secrets to hide.</p>

<p>Gaining clues from their homes will help you pin down the killer and, apparently, the interiors of houses can change season by season. Your curiosity might be a little dangerous, but who can resist?</p>

<p><em>Grave Seasons</em>&nbsp;seems like a breath of fresh air for the farming sim genre. Turning a normally "chill" type of game into something a bit more complex has me intrigued, and I'm dying to see the true breadth of&nbsp;<em>Grave Seasons</em>' narrative. We'll find out when it launches at some point in the future!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-sales-1m-new-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>has reached another major sales milestone, developer and publisher Level-5 has revealed, and there's a big new update available for the game as well.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/AkihiroHino/status/1933052974169010308" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X (for which we're using machine translation), Level-5 CEO Akihiko Hino says the game has reached a million copies sold. That figure counts across all platforms, and it accounts for physical and digital sales as well.</p>

<p>The sales figure will doubtless be exciting for Level-5; earlier this month, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-sales-800k" rel="nofollow">said</a>&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>sales "might even hit a million copies by the end of June", and the game has reached that milestone with time to spare.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fantasy-life-i-sales-1m-crafting.jpg?itok=DlH0QcHV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fantasy-life-i-sales-1m-crafting.jpg?itok=dWDxNcSL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>is continuing to sell well for Level-5.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the new sales milestone, Level-5 also runs down what's contained in the latest update for&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</em>. Updates for Nintendo's platforms and for all other platforms are slightly different, frustratingly enough.</p>

<p>In version 1.3.1 for PC and non-Nintendo consoles, new features include an adjusted lock-on that allows you to automatically select targets, as well as an expansion for the camera's range in certain areas, allowing you to see further into the distance.</p>

<p>Other changes include the ability to listen to Life Songs whenever you like, as well as changes to farming actions and more. You can read the <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/patchnote/ver_1_3_1/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full patch notes here</a>.</p>

<p>When it comes to the Switch versions of the update, some things are the same, but features like the aforementioned camera range expansion and the ability to listen to Life Songs again will instead arrive as part of version 1.4.0 at some point in the future.</p>




<p><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2993780/FANTASY_LIFE_i_The_Girl_Who_Steals_Time/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time/9pp7tdrdzghd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and both <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/FANTASY-LIFE-i-The-Girl-Who-Steals-Time-2339978.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> and Switch 2.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-alters-brings-kojima-esque-weirdness-to-a-tale-of-sci-fi-survival.1216452/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/685213/the-alters-review-ps5-xbox-steam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Rolling across rugged alien wilds, your circular base in <em>The Alters</em> offers a twinkling haven from the whipping winds and nauseating radiation. At least, that’s how it feels for the first few hours. Gradually, as the in-game days stack up, my view of the vessel changes: protagonist Jan Dolski seems to be stuck on what is essentially a very expensive, very large hamster wheel, eking out an existence within modular rooms that look a lot like shipping containers. For the corporation funding this venture, Ally Corp (pah!), Jan and his crewmates are just like the resources they’re seeking to extract: commodities. </p><p>The hamster wheel stylings of your ship evoke the visual storytelling of filmmaker Bong Joon-ho: the speeding train in <em>Snowpiercer</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/movie-reviews/625496/mickey-17-review">or the repetitive clone deaths of <em>Mickey 17</em></a>, each distilling class and the flow of capital into raw images. This should tell you something about how ambitious and frequently weird this sci-fi game is. In part, <em>The Alters</em> is a base-building survival experience of the kind that developer 11 Bit Studios received plaudits for with the <em>Frostpunk </em>series.</p><p>But there’s a wrinkle: in <em>The Alters</em>, you’re directing Jan about the ship, getting him to interact with menus rather than seeing everything from the omniscient top-down perspective. Beyond your base walls, the game snaps into a third-person action-exploration mode as you comb the ravishing extraterrestrial planet for resources, and maybe even the key to life itself. </p><p>Twenty minutes in, the game evokes another modern great, Hideo Kojima, when you build the most important — and weirdest — room in the whole game: the Womb. Using a shimmering, highly volatile substance called Rapidium, Jan, the sole surviving member of the original crew, is able to replicate himself thanks to a scientific breakthrough involving the multiple universes theory. It sounds heady but is straightforward enough in practice: Jan punches the “alter” that he wants to create into a quantum computer and out pops an all-new, yet strangely familiar, assembly of flesh and bones. There is Jan Botanist, Jan Miner, Jan Doctor, and more. Each represents a fork in the space-time continuum of the original Jan’s life. Conveniently, each is also suited to a particular task on the massive rotating mining vessel. </p><p>The game quickly settles into the min-maxing groove typical of survival games. Such are the demands of the economy on default difficulty, it feels as if you need to optimize every single second of the game’s 24-hour day-and-night cycle. Jan Botanist gets to work making veggies in the garden, then rustles up nourishing meals in the kitchen. Jan Refiner processes the raw materials; Jan Scientist researches new technologies in his lab. The day’s labor consumes your attention with its pleasing machinic rhythm. Outside, 11 Bit flexes its art chops with considerable verve. Gnarled, tree-like rock formations curl across the arid terrain; matter swirls within shimmering physics-defying anomalies; a vast cosmic sea churns menacingly.</p><p>Everything is running smoothly until — oh no! — it’s not. The crew are peeved, overworked, and understandably terrified. So you build a gym, social room, and, in true corpo-hell style, a contemplation room. Get the exercise endorphins flowing, kick back and watch a movie (which are live-action shorts by comedy sketch duo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ChrisandJack/featured">Chris &amp; Jack</a>), or play a few rounds of beer pong. Your crew’s anxiety fades; their designs on rebellion dissipate. </p><p>Fittingly, for a game that can be read as an exploration of dissociative identity disorder, <em>The Alters</em> has its own split personality: the actual work of maintaining your base and the interactions that emerge between your crew. The former can become rote; the latter provide moments of spontaneous drama. One touching early-game scene involves the death of a sheep, the initial test subject for the Womb. Your crew are gutted; they decide to hold a wake honoring the doe-eyed Molly. She was a friend, after all. Despite the psychedelic strangeness of their creation, this oddball assortment of Jans are still human, possessing an innate desire for ritual. </p><p>Elsewhere, the script doesn’t quite sparkle. Original Jan asks his alters the same set of control questions each time they emerge from the Womb, moving through clockwork beats of dismay and outrage as the new arrivals grapple with the baffling nature of their existence. Indeed, as the hours accrue, the conversations naturally take on a kind of eerie, echoey feel, such is the way that Jan is, in essence, talking to himself. The result is a kind of maddeningly claustrophobic nightmare — and perhaps not wholly in the way 11 Bit necessarily intended. </p><p>There are exciting, sometimes downright devious decisions to make, like choosing between the unscrupulous company you work for or an unhinged scientist to solve a deadly health issue (goodness knows how long I <em>umm</em>ed and <em>ahh</em>ed on that one). Beyond such big, plot-altering choices, you’ll spend most of your time agonizing over actions befitting your role as the ship’s de facto boss. Are you getting in extra gym equipment solely because it will brighten Refiner Jan’s day or because it will make him <a href="https://youtu.be/O4SzvsMFaek">fitter, happier, and more productive</a>?</p><p>11 Bit has long explored questions of labor, notably in its <em>Frostpunk</em> games, but the zoomed-in, up-close-and-personal perspective of <em>The Alters</em> successfully reframes them — and in timely fashion. Recent years have shown starkly how most real-world corporations (including those that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24009039/video-game-layoffs-2023">make and publish video games</a>) feel about their workers: i.e., as an inherently disposable resource, especially when firing them presents an opportunity to swell profits.</p><p>In outer space, this disposability becomes existential. Original Jan, and all the other Jans, feel the supercharged, life-and-death stakes of their precarious predicament. Not all of them will make it, spending their final moments toiling under the yoke of corporate labor. They are reduced and then, in turn, extinguished — their bodies considered little more than grist for the cosmic mill.</p><p><sub>The Alters <em>launches June 13th on the PS5, Xbox, and PC.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>In 2018, as part of the promotion for Avengers: Infinity War, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/thanos-arrives-in-fortnite-for-avengers-infinity-w/1100-6458760/" data-ref-id="1100-6458760">Thanos was added to Fortnite</a>, complete with the Infinity Gauntlet and some dance moves that would make John Travolta blush.

"And Joe and Anthony got together and had a phone call with Donald. It was supposed to be a half-hour call, but five-and-a-half hours later, they were still talking about it.

                <p>Charles Martinet--once the voice actor for one of gaming's most iconic characters and now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-will-no-longer-be-voiced-by-longtime-actor-charles-martinet/1100-6517020/" data-ref-id="1100-6517020">Nintendo's official Mario Ambassador</a>--has had to clarify his stance on voicing Mario for fans. After a viral post claimed Martinet was no longer allowed to do Mario's voice, Martinet posted to explain that he simply won't improvise lines for Mario.</p><p>After meeting with Martinet at a convention, YouTuber Ricky Berwick <a href="https://x.com/rickyberwick/status/1931740018596585814" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted to X</a> claiming the actor "wasn't even allowed to do the voice of Mario or any of his iconic character's voices." In the replies, another user <a href="https://x.com/MEBJR1001/status/1931859944938078582" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted</a> a similar story claiming Martinet couldn't do the voice because he was "under a contract." Berwick later clarified in a reply to his original post that Martinet did the Mario voice for him off camera, but "wasn't allowed to" on video.</p><p>While fans were concerned about the possibility of a restrictive contract with Nintendo, Martinet replied to the post directly, explaining that what he will and won't voice for fans at conventions is due to his own choices.</p><p>"I do the voice for every fan I meet," Martinet promised in a reply. "I just don't improvise non-Mario phrases or dialogue. That's my choice to be sure. I always maintain the integrity of the character."</p><p>Martinet first voiced Mario for 1996's Super Mario 64, and has reprised his role for countless games since. Martinet was replaced as the character's voice actor as of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-bros-wonder/" data-ref-id="5000-591688">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>, but has been given the official--if <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/charles-martinet-has-no-idea-what-a-mario-ambassador-does/1100-6517466/" data-ref-id="1100-6517466">somewhat vague</a>--title of Mario Ambassador. The role of Mario has now been taken up by voice actor Kevin Afghani, and Nintendo didn't make a big fuss about the recasting--telling fans they could find out who the new actor was in the end credits for the game.</p>

			<p>Have you ever played a video game that you could objectively discern was very good, and yet you just didn’t like? That’s The Alters for me, a clearly excellent game, though one I found so unpleasantly stressful I slightly resented playing it.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Alters | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/965Km7t6KwM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Jan Dolski is having a very bad day. He’s just crash-landed on a hostile planet, and while he’s initially grateful to have survived, that’s before realising the rest of his crew have clearly not. Nope, they are all very dead, and Jan is stranded and alone. As he explores the planet from a third-person perspective, he – and you – discover a huge-wheeled mobile base that landed on the planet prior to the crew’s arrival. So, things are looking up then? Nope. Day is about to dawn, and the scorching flames of the nuclear-like sun will evaporate everything in its path, including Jan. Cue a desperate escape in The Alters’ thrilling prologue.</p>


<p>Jan has one hope: Rapidium. This badly named element that has some mysterious properties, the primary one being that it allows Jan to clone himself. The Quantum Computer aboard the mobile base allows Jan to see his own life branch, all the crucial moments of his existence that made him, him. His relationship with his father, his decision to leave University, his divorce from his wife, all the variables led to Jan being where he is today. Thing is, using quantum gubbins, Jan can see alternative life branches, the version of him that would exist if he’d committed to university, or perhaps stood up to his abusive father. Those alternative versions – those Alters, if you will – can then be cloned.</p>


<p>They awake with memories of their imagined lives, confused and afraid, but eminently helpful in keeping Jan alive. Each Alter is the same – they are clones of Jan, after all – but entirely unique due to their differing life experiences. One’s a scientist who can research new tech, another a miner who can gather resources from the planet, another a gardener who can grow food to eat, you get the idea. They can also be an unruly bunch, and a huge part of the game is keeping everyone happy. Telling them what they want to hear, guiding them, comforting them, fulfilling side-tasks for them. Fail to keep them on side and they’ll become rebellious and distant. Lose your the support of your Alters and you’ll be doomed to a fiery death when you fail to escape the sun’s path.</p>
<p>It’s a fascinating sci-fi concept, and one that is elegantly and intriguingly explored by developer 11 bit Studios. There’s philosophical navel-gazing aplenty, but things never drag, thanks to a sharp script, engaging characterisation, and sterling voice acting from Alex Jordan who manages to provide each of Jan’s clones with a distinct personality. Indeed, the emotional beats really deliver, as Jan learns about himself, and perhaps, ultimately, maybe even learns to love himself too. The narrative is punchy, fascinating, and deeply compelling. It even kept me going through all the stress of the rest of the game.</p>

<p>Other than all of the cloning and getting to know yourself – both literally and figuratively, I guess – your time will be spent surviving. There are numerous resources to gather from the planet’s surface by setting up mining rigs, you’ll need these to keep constructing all the items that keep your mobile base rolling to safety, radiation filters, repair kits, all that stuff. You’ll also need to make food, construct new rooms, and overcome numerous obstacles that you’ll meet on your travels. Just when you think you’ve got a handle on the game, more demands are placed on you, more systems to balance against each other. 11 Bit Studios demand you make a house of cards before repeatedly and masochistically blowing at it.</p>
<p>It’s all incredibly tense and claustrophobic, in latter stages of the game, one wrong choice – perhaps one you made hours ago – can mean disaster. It is, of course, intended to be that way, and is no doubt an authentic take on surviving on a hostile planet. Indeed, the game is built to be replayed, and it even reminds you which dialogue choices you made in a previous play through so you can try something different.</p>

<p>I found myself feeling increasingly harassed. Managing dwindling resources, making difficult choices, trying to keep your Alters happy, the sun getting closer and closer and closer, never being able to quite get on top of things, despite how hard you try… it was all a bit too much like being a mid-level manager for my liking. Perhaps I was just having flashbacks to my time as a retail manager in a popular UK shop, but playing The Alters was more stressful than an enjoyable undertaking. The pressure keeps on getting cranked up and up until it’s all too much.</p>
<p>Now, don’t get me wrong, The Alters is brilliant. Finely balanced gameplay mechanics and an engaging narrative are to be celebrated. In fact, other than a few silly glitches, such as Jan getting stuck on scenery exploring the environment, this is something of a masterpiece. It’s just an unrelenting masterpiece that you’ll be happy to have survived.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/interview-with-ndreams-and-shuhei-yoshida-about-reach-vr-and-what-indies-can-do-to<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of my big personal blind spots in gaming is VR. With new titles always on the horizon like nDreams' Action-Adventure title <em>Reach </em>always coming out I see continued evidence or rapid development, features to allow for more comfortable gameplay, and experiences that you just wouldn't be able to replicate on a 2D screen.</p>

<p>At this years' Summer Game Fest I not only got to play through a demo of the first level of <em>Reach</em>, but then got to talk with the development team and Shuhei Yoshida, their games' ambassador, about creating <em>Reach </em>as an experience for all to enjoy, how Yoshida became involved, how VR titles all lift each other up, and how the indie VR scene is a good place to be.</p>

<h2>Experiencing <em>Reach </em>Firsthand</h2>

<p>As my appointment began, I got strapped into the Quest 3 headset that was connected to a nearby computer. Having been asked if I'd worn a VR headset before, luckily, I was able to reference my early VR experience with a DK2 and original Vive, as well as my experience playing <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d21d65a5-4b5d-4746-8132-7a248cc992b2" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/deadpool-vr-pushes-vr-automotion-while-creating-fun-and-frantic-experience" rel="nofollow"><em>Deadpool VR</em></a> just the day earlier.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/reach-sgf-2025-opening-door.jpg?itok=BoRCMC4V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/reach-sgf-2025-opening-door.jpg?itok=5Om32LCC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>From the getgo of the demo, I was impressed, after receiving options to play standing or sitting down I appeared at a terminal with a wide variety of visual and locomotion options. Did you want a quick pivot when turning, or a smooth glide? Would you like added effects over your view to help with motion sickness? Etc</p>

<p>Incredible care had gone into making sure no matter how new or old you were to VR there was a way to make the experience most comfortable to you, something we discussed further after the demo.</p>

<p>Once I was through the settings screen and into the game, I hit the ground with a running start. Starting in a warehouse, <em>Reach </em>began by teaching me the basics of movement, navigating between boxes, and climbing, at first with ladders before progressing to boxes and rivets, before I graduated to bricks jutting out of walls.</p>

<p>Something that was incredible during my experience was just how intuitive everything was. At first I was noticing the obvious 'climb up this' style objects, but it wasn't long that I was clambering all over the place for fun, then on a whim I tried to fling myself up with both hands… and it worked.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/reach-sgf-2025-climbing.jpg?itok=qKjRMlXR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/reach-sgf-2025-climbing.jpg?itok=jptPcbwY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The mobility is Reach is going to make it very interesting to watch (or attempt) speedruns</figcaption></figure><h2>VR That Makes You Want To Push Yourself</h2>

<p>Every time I thought to myself 'this is probably possible', I would attempt it and it would work. Whether it was the movement, interacting with random world objects, or creeping around corners to get the drop on guards everything was as I might expect from a gamified version of the real world. Honestly, the only thing holding me back from going full Star Wars kid in there was the fear of punching the TV I was positioned next to, or a nearby developer.</p>

<p>After locomotion was locked down I got to experience combat. The first item you obtain is a magical bow that crackles with energy as you draw back the string. Doing some experimentation, I found out arrows embed themselves in certain rock walls (that I assume you encounter more of in the full game), trying to pull the arrows out I instead learned that I could climb on them.</p>

<p>Firearms are also present in <em>Reach</em>, but nDreams developers liken it more to the firearms of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="101b22f0-d591-4997-8ea7-836f16709d24" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mirrors-edge-catalyst-review-conflicting-ideas" rel="nofollow">Mirror's Edge</a>, they're a bit of a power up but very limited in their use so don't get too used to them.</p>

<p>The demo ended with a long chase sequence that had me dodging falling buildings amid explosions, flinging myself around obstacles, and leaping across massive gaps before sliding into a large blue crash pad.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/reach-sgf-2025-bow.jpg?itok=Lxxv7lTI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/reach-sgf-2025-bow.jpg?itok=geIMg38w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Reach </em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Coming out of <em>Reach</em>, I had a blast playing, could immediately see the potential in the movement and combat, and watching the trailer for the full game and what it incorporated, I just wanted to hop right back in.</p>

<p>An Action-Adventure in PC/PS5 powered VR was fun, smooth, and functioned just as I'd expect a video game world to perform.</p>

<p>This is definitely going to be a reason for me to borrow, if not purchase a VR headset to be able to get the full experience.</p>

<h2>Yoshida Has Watched <em>Reach </em>From The Start</h2>

<p>Having completed my demo, standing around and talking with the developers at nDream and Shuhei Yoshida, I was interested to learn how he'd come on as an ambassador for the project.</p>

<p>Yoshida began by explaining that Synapse, nDream's 2023 VR title, was one of his favorite VR games. When the team began working on <em>Reach </em>three years ago, he had already seen samples of it while working as the Head of PlayStation Indies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"If [Yoshida] is excited then we know we're onto something"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When he retired, nDreams reached out to him to see if they'd be interested in continuing to work together and he agreed.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/reach-sgf-2025-parkour.jpg?itok=UZW59m17 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/reach-sgf-2025-parkour.jpg?itok=7I7rZd0n 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>From there I was interested to know what it was that Yoshida saw in <em>Reach </em>that made him so confident in it. He explained to me that he knew when trying out the movement that it was going to be something that people enjoyed. "It was clear they're trying to do what no one has done before, I really want them to be successful."</p>

<p>With a history of working with a variety of indie developers, and with the indie scene becoming more and more competitive as the number of games that release on digital platforms like Steam continue to ballon year after year I asked what indie developers could do to increase discoverability in a competitive scene.</p>

<p>Keeping the conversation close to <em>Reach </em>Yoshida highlighted that "for VR, unides are a huge part of the scene. nDreams started working on<em> The Assembly</em> on Oculus Rift and that for people who really want to make VR games, it's a passion."</p>

<p>Referencing popular VR titles and developers like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3eee44f9-cebd-4ac0-9341-842a86cd69d4" href="https://techraptor.net/games/superhot-vr" rel="nofollow"><em>Super Hot</em></a> and Owlchemy Labs, Yoshida highlighted that "each of these games generated so much noise and experience." He also pointed out that as VR headsets increase in power and fidelity that "in the indie space, if you're passionate about VR there's less competition."</p>

<p>At that time nDreams developers lent their voice to the discussion explaining how "when a great game comes out it helps everyone out." explaining how things like locomotion controls improving over the years from the simple teleport to full action is a direct response to VR developers trying out other game's movements and taking what works to uplift them all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"In VR it's fun to watch good players play" - Shuhei Yoshida</p>

<p>Another developing aspect of VR is just how much work is going into the hardware side of assisting players who have various comfortability in VR.</p>

<p>Returning to watching the <em>Reach </em>trailer at the booth, I asked how long a player might expect the experience to take. I was told that it would be a "double-digit campaign," referencing how there's a linear story, but for those who want to challenge themselves with advanced platforming or combat, there will be all kinds of alternate paths.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Will be a double digit hour campaign [...] completionists could be several more hours"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the story segment I played I got a light tease of the story, learning that after establishing yourself as a well known stunt actress there would be an event that would cause multiple realities to merge. From there you get the strange mix of ancient and modern day architecture that you can see in the trailer.</p>

<p>Not much else was spoiled about the story, but they would be focusing on revealing more about it this Summer ahead of it's launch later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/alters-review-narrative-driven-survival<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ac4be3c6-fcbb-4f7e-b561-de64225371b0" href="https://techraptor.net/games/alters" rel="nofollow"><em>The Alters</em></a>&nbsp;is a story driven, survival game where the main character, Jan Dolski, is stranded on an unhospitable planet alone during Project Dolly. Looking for a way to survive, he ends up using the ship's quantum computer to produce alternate versions of himself. These Alters are clones, yet not quite. They made a different decision that led them down a completely new life path from Jan, gaining the skills he needs in the harsh environment.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>The Alters</em>&nbsp;Review | Surviving in Space</h2>

<p>Taking a look at the survival aspect of&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>, you have to mine resources from the planet either by hand or using a mining station. These mining stations, the main resource collectors, are connected by pylons to your moving base and unlock fast travel points around the map. The other resources are grown, crafted, or refined in the base itself. Once you have Alters, you'll assign them to specific rooms, referred to as modules, and give them tasks to complete. When finished, they'll ask to jump to another location that has something queued.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-mobile-base-management.jpg?itok=G1vhTwae 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-mobile-base-management.jpg?itok=p1NMyTCn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>The Alters</em> is much closer to a colony or resource management game than a full-blown survival title. You can mine resources, refine ores, and grow food, but that's about it. There are items to craft, but most of them just improve your ability to explore the different areas the base stops at, as well as the efficiency of your resources. You can automate most of these processes and be completely hands-off on resource gathering by the endgame and even the midgame, depending on how you unlock research.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These are fairly basic mechanics when it comes to surviving. There are three different mining stations, only five resources to mine, and one resource to grow. You'll get reminders when levels of certain things, like storage or food, are low, but you can typically restock your reserves quickly. Throughout my initial playthrough, I never felt like I was in danger of losing due to a lack of resources. The typical pressure of a survival game just wasn't present for me as I played.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-mining-organics-outpost.jpg?itok=2-mWZWLt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-mining-organics-outpost.jpg?itok=G_W7FGK6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>On top of the basic mechanics, you only have a certain number of days in each location. Changing locations isn't voluntary, but forced. If you stay until Sunrise, everyone is charred to a crisp, and the game ends.&nbsp;The moving base can be continuously changed, expanded multiple times, and have new modules added, but you cannot make any exterior location your permanent home.</p>

<p>Additionally, there is a definitive end to the title.&nbsp;This is quite different than the majority of games in the survival genre. While the story will have an ending, you're able to keep exploring, building your base, and crafting new items. That isn't the case in&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>. When the story ends, so does the game.</p>

<p>You can go back an infinite number of times to replay days, change your dialogue choices, or use different Alters, but the game will always end. Being able to redo days increases the replayability. It's also necessary to do at least a second playthrough to select different Alters to create or pick a different major decision. This will reveal new endings, new lessons, and new cutscenes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even with the replayability aspect, there's only a certain number of times you can adventure with Jan and his Alters before exhausting all new content. A definitive end, combined with limited time in each region, cuts down on the investment I have in the game. If there were more areas where you could farm without having to move locations, that would vastly increase my interest in&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>&nbsp;as a survival title. At this moment, I view it as a well-written complex narrative adventure that merely uses the basics of survival to move the story along when there's no dialogue to delve into.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Morality and Ethics in&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em></h2>

<p>Where&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>&nbsp;really shines is in the way it presents morality in life-threatening survival situations. The narrative journey you experience is well written, emotionally evocative, and showcases the consequences of difficult choices, especially when both options are less than ideal. I wasn't ready for all the thinking I ended up doing. It compelled me to think over the different aspects of surviving, how those decisions could effect the crew, and what I was willing to do as the leader to ensure survival for as many people as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-technician-birth-womb.jpg?itok=UHZKjSHd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-technician-birth-womb.jpg?itok=7EOBysxA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The story is incredibly profound, but it's not laid on you all at once. It's crafted in a way that you build up to the moral dilemmas. The story has joy and fun woven with the larger complexities, so it doesn't end up bogged down by the choices you face. The complexity of the situation and the drama that accompany it are balanced with breaks to play beer pong or watch movies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Morality is an angle not often explored in the survival genre. In games that I've played, you kill anyone who stands in your way, take resources no matter what, and do whatever it takes to stay alive. Having a character take the time to cognizantly mull over the potential consequences of his actions is a really unique take on the genre.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This struggle over the morality of key decisions to ensure survival is what sets&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>&nbsp;apart from other titles. The narrative is the best part of the game, hands down. It is what you'll recall when thinking about the title and what will draw you back to playing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While most of the game works extremely well, there are some aspects that detract from the experience. Being unable to skip certain cutscenes or dialogues is one of the design choices I don't personally agree with. Even though the scene in question is a key one, it doesn't dramatically change when going through a second playthrough or replaying the day. Having to sit through it can be frustrating, especially if you're rewatching it multiple times back to back.</p>

<p>Acts 1 and 2 were relatively bug-free, with the major issue involving Jan getting stuck on terrain elements. The frequency of this increased in Act 3, along with issues seeing Interal Veins. The veins were missing or the core was missing in multiple instances of the mechanic. This also affected the Interal animations added to other locations outside of the veins. I ended up wandering around and almost blacking out from Radiation due to not being able to find the core.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-glitched-alx.jpg?itok=jdFlGPnb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-glitched-alx.jpg?itok=a9wYQVto 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Another issue was ALX getting stuck in places, such as the sky, that made collecting them impossible. Sometimes they rolled into the environment, or became stuck between items that made them inaccessible.&nbsp;Though these were relatively small in number of occurrences, they still negatively impacted gameplay.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>The Alters&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>The Alters</em>&nbsp;is a solid narrative entry wrapped in basic survival mechanics. The focus of the game, and the highlighting feature, is the storyline. It has some replayability, but comes with a definitive ending and some restrictive base building that brings it closer to a colony management title than a true survival game. A single playthrough can take anywhere between 12-30 hours, depending on how often you redo days. If you're like me and played until the end without going back in time, you can finish the game in a single weekend.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With few bugs to get in the way of your experience,&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>&nbsp;is a well executed meshing of survival and story. Though the forced base movement and definitive ending make it less of a survival game, the narrative makes up for those shortcomings.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sag-aftra-video-game-strike-suspended<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Media union SAG-AFTRA has announced that it's suspending its video game-focused strike after almost a year thanks to a "tentative agreement" being reached with signatories of the union's Interactive Media Agreement (IMA).</p>

<p>Suspension of the strike comes just a few days after SAG-AFTRA <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-and-video-game-employers-reach-tentative-agreement-interactive-media-contract-national" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> said "tentative agreement". In a new <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-video-game-strike-suspended-noon-pt-today" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, SAG-AFTRA says its members should "return to work on productions under the IMA, including work promoting or publicizing projects produced under the IMA".</p>

<p>It's worth noting that the "tentative agreement" reached today hasn't been finalized yet. The union says it intends to "meet in special session" later today in order to consider the agreement, so it hasn't yet been approved.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sag-aftra-gaming-strike-suspended-picket-line.jpg?itok=sANpqXj9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sag-aftra-gaming-strike-suspended-picket-line.jpg?itok=lJYZDLtk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The SAG-AFTRA strike began last year when negotiations over the Interactive Media Agreement broke down.</figcaption></figure><p>SAG-AFTRA members <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sag-aftra-members-who-work-on-video-games-to-begin-strike-at-midnight" rel="nofollow">elected to strike in July last year</a>, after over eighteen months of negotiation between the union and the companies who signed the Interactive Media Agreement failed to produce a satisfactory deal.</p>

<p>Companies included in the agreement include Activision, Insomniac Games, and EA, and SAG-AFTRA's original statement on the commencement of the strike claims that these employers refused to "plainly affirm, in clear and enforceable language" that actors would be protected from AI-related abuse of their work or image.</p>

<p>We don't yet know what the new "tentative agreement" contains, but I think it's safe to assume the companies have given at least some ground when it comes to AI, since this was referred to as the "sticking point" by SAG-AFTRA last July.</p>

<p>The union will release details of the agreement on its approval, and at that time, the agreement will also be "sent out for ratification by the union's membership in accordance with established policy".</p>

<p>Companies like&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Krafton</a>, as well as industry giants&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-partners-with-generative-ai-company-to-enable-dynamically-generated-stories-quests" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>&nbsp;and the aforementioned <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-hopes-to-use-generative-ai-to-drive-more-monetization-and-make-development-30-more" rel="nofollow">EA</a>, have expressed enthusiasm about generative AI, despite lingering issues regarding <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/11/disney-universal-ai-lawsuit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">copyright infringement</a> and <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">environmental impact</a>.</p>

<p>In particular, though, SAG-AFTRA's concerns appear to revolve around the use of actors' likenesses, whether that be appearance or voice, to "hire" them without actually paying them, as well as other potential AI abuses of their work.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see whether the new agreement contains satisfactory protections for union members. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

			<p>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt may get a new story DLC early next year from the studio that's working on the remake of the first entry in the series.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1l9gnje/new_witcher_3_dlc_may_be_coming_in_2026_before/">PC Gaming subreddit,</a>&nbsp;well-known Polish game industry commentator Borys Nieśpielak revealed during a recent podcast hosted by Remigiusz Maciaszek that the third entry in the series by CD Projekt Red may get an additional story DLC that is being developed by Fool's Theory, the studio that is working on the remake of the first entry in the series, early next year. According to the commentator, this could be the unspecified project from the studio that was mentioned during one of CDPR's earnings calls. Unfortunately, no other information is currently available on this potential story DLC, so it could be a single additional questline, similar to that released for free to celebrate the launch of the horrendous, in my humble opinion, Netflix show, or a longer, paid expansion.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wiedźmin 3 dostanie nowe DLC" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j5G22X8V9IA?start=3092&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Even if The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt won't get any more content from CDPR, some amazing modding projects in the works will allow players to return to the Continent to experience more stories, or to play through some of the most important events in the life of Geralt of Rivia, before the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">The Witcher IV</a>. Among these projects is The Last Wish project, which aims to recreate the book written by Andrzej Sapkowski that includes some fantastic stories, such as the titular The Last Wish. The project's alpha is now available for <a href="https://www.thelastwishproject.com/">download</a>, allowing players to experience the first video game adaptation of The Lesser Evil story and learn why Geralt is called The Butcher of Blaviken. You can check out the alpha before downloading in the video put together by xLetalis.</p>

<p>The Witcher 3 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <p>Mob Entertainment has announced that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/poppy-playtime">Poppy Playtime</a> Chapter 4 will be making its unsettling way onto consoles later this month.</p>
<p>The latest chapter in the series is set for release on Nintendo Switch, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10012036">PlayStation</a> and Xbox on 25th June. It will retail for $19.99, the PR has said. I have asked for clarification on its UK pricing, though the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/poppy-playtime-chapter-4/9n31k5cww4k8">Microsoft Store here in Blighty</a> has it listed for £16.74, so assume this will be the same on other platforms.</p>
<p>"Brace yourself for the darkest chapter yet in the epic Poppy Playtime saga," reads the official blurb, adding that players will be "pushed deeper into the undiscovered depths of the Playtime Co. factory, far below anything the world knew". You can check out a trailer for Poppy Playtime Chapter 4 below.</p>

<p>The latest chapter in the Poppy Playtime series promises players "terrifying" new threats, along with "shocking" revelations.</p>
<p>"Can you outwit the unnatural new creations lurking in the shadows? Can you survive here long enough to eventually unravel the mysteries behind the experiments? Every step will test your courage, every puzzle will challenge your mind, and every corner may be your last," the studio teases.</p>
<p>Poppy Playtime Chapter 4 previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-chapter-4-release-announced-for-pc">arrived on PC back in January of this year</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in May of last year, the studio announced a Poppy Playtime film adaptation was in the works with Legendary Entertainment and Angry Films.</p>
<p>"When we first started this journey, we followed our passion and created a series of games and brands with the purpose of inspiring and entertaining. We've always dreamed big and are thrilled to have created something that has captured the hearts of tens of millions around the world," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-the-cult-horror-game-is-getting-a-film-adaptation">Mob Entertainment co-founders Zach Belanger and Seth Belanger said at the time</a>.</p>
<p>"This movie deal is a great logical next step in the growth of our transmedia entertainment company."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> has received an update that offers visual improvements when played on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a>, a nice bonus for fans who want to pick up and play the RPG on the new console.</p>
<p>These improvements include graphic enhancements such as new shadow and reflection efforts, as well as an extension to the distance objects are rendered at. For example, you can now see a forest off into the distance clearly, whereas before it may have looked like a low-poly blur of green shrubbery.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/patchnote/ver_1_3_0/">In the official update blog post uploaded to the games' official website</a>, we see that exact example in a side-by-side comparison, as well as a pair of screenshots showing water effects on the Switch vs the Switch 2. Water now has lovely reflections of light on it. A little thing for some, but a little boost for those willing to make the leap to a new console, cosy RPG in hand.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a> has been updated to version 10.0.0, bringing with it a whole bunch of new content, but also improving the game's visuals and performance for those playing on Switch 2.</p>
<p>But how has it been improved, exactly? Well, the above video should clear things up quite nicely for you. We're mainly looking at bumps in resolution and frame rate, and this is perhaps most obvious within the Splatsville hub area, which notably at a stable, albeit sluggish 30fps on the Switch.</p>

<p>We also see gameplay from the standard Turf War battle along with the Salmon Run mode, so there's plenty to dive into here to see exactly how the game has been improved from Switch 1.</p>
<p>In other news, it's also been confirmed that a Splatoon spin-off game, titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a>, will be making its way to the Switch 2. Very little is known about the project so far, but it looks to be a single-player story-focused experience in which you take on the role of a mechanic investigating a mysterious island alongside Deep Cut.</p>

As yet another <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>-style roguelite hybrid emerges raging from the volcanic portals of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest">Steam Next Fest</a>, as the smaller-scale gamedev scene at large threatens to melt into a soup of RNG and deckbuilding, I want you to picture me leaning over you like Samwise Gamgee leaning over Frodo, trying through his tears to remind the Ring-bearer of life back in the Shire, before the horror of Mordor.

"Do you remember the taste of strawberries?" Sam whispers. I do not want you to remember the taste of strawberries. I want you to remember how good it felt to sneak a ball behind the blocks in Breakout. It is the only thing that will save you now.

Ball X Pit isn't just a roguelite hybrid, but a Vampire Survive 'em up to boot. The setup is that a meteor has wiped out the city of Ballbylon (*smiles wanly at camera*) and left a massive hole full of monsters and treasure. You are a treasure-hunter, and the way you gather treasure is to proceed down a slowly scrolling shaft against a wall of block-shaped undead, shooting cannonballs that ricochet from foe and terrain alike.</p>
<p>After breaking enough monsterblocs, you get to choose from power-ups that include weirder, more powerful kinds of ball and a few shmuppy supporting acts, such as little gun-toting NPC statues. There are bosses too, some of which take things in almost a bullet hell direction, with arrows all but filling the screen.
</p>
<p>
I played the now-available Steam demo at a Devolver joint in London the week before last, in a desperate bid to claw back some precious naptime from my SGF schedule. I was dismayed by the rogueliting at first - in case I haven't sufficiently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-train-2-review">spelled it out by now</a>, I am really ready for this trend to be over. It's not that Ball X Pit in itself is badly made, it's that everytime I read the word "roguelite" in a press release, I can feel the very substance of my soul dribbling through my fingers. I'm naked in the dark, with nothing, no veil between me and the gameloop of fire.
</p>
<p>
But then I successfully snuck a ball behind the tide of four-cornered fiends, and was Samwisely suffused by recollections of shareware Breakout clones on Apple Macintosh in the 90s. Watching the ball bounce repeatedly between the blocks and backwall, racking up a high score without you having to lift a finger, is the nearest many of us will ever get to nirvana. It may not be enough for me to play/recommend the full thing, but it's enough for me to suggest that you <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3651790/BALL_x_PIT_Demo/">try the Ball X Pit demo yourself on Steam</a>.
