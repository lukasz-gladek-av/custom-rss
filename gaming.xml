While each of their abilities are somewhat limited, you’ll maintain control of two characters with completely different roles, so balancing them will be key to excelling.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Dagger is a straightforward healer, with abilities to heal up single targets and groups alike. Her defensive Ultimate helps your team and hurts your enemies at the same time with only one real weakness, and her healing primary attack has limited aim assist. She’s a great healer to get started with. Cloak, on the other hand, is somewhat similar to Scarlet Witch, who is a Duelist. He has a mid-range attack that deals steady damage, but he can also debuff enemies, reducing their visibility, dealing damage, and causing them to take more damage for a time. He also has an ability that grants invincibility for a few seconds. </p><p>Since you can instantly switch between them, fans of both healing and damaging will find a lot to love about this pair.</p><h2 id="h113132"><a id="play"></a>How should you play Cloak &amp; Dagger?</h2><p>Dagger is a very approachable healer since you don’t need to have great aim to heal well with her Lightforce Daggers bounce and bend towards allies and enemies.</p><figure id="" data-id="d1e120d8278e468628dde992eef37beb" data-recommend-id="image://d1e120d8278e468628dde992eef37beb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dagger attacks enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dagger attacks enemies." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Brian Barnett / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d1e120d8278e468628dde992eef37beb" data-recommend-id="image://d1e120d8278e468628dde992eef37beb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dagger attacks enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In spite of this, there is still skill required to play her and her comrade to their maximum potential—and much of that involves how much time you spend playing as Cloak. A great Cloak &amp; Dagger player will use Light Explosion and Dagger Storm to keep allies topped off, using downtime to switch to Cloak and deal damage, hitting enemies with Terror Cape to amplify team damage against vulnerable targets, and using Dark Teleportation to negate enemy Ultimate abilities before switching back to Dagger to heal allies again.</p><figure id="" data-id="deec124247b8f736ca676f68bf263b30" data-recommend-id="image://deec124247b8f736ca676f68bf263b30" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cloak attacks enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cloak attacks enemies." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Brian Barnett / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="deec124247b8f736ca676f68bf263b30" data-recommend-id="image://deec124247b8f736ca676f68bf263b30" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cloak attacks enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While Eternal Bond is one of the fastest charging Ultimate abilities in the game, be aware that enemies like Magneto can easily kill you in-between dashes (if they know what they are doing), so try to have a teammate like Punisher or Star Lord use their Ultimates to bait it out before you use yours, or use it when Magneto has been knocked out or does not have an ultimate charge ready yet.</p><h2 id="h113133"><a id="dagger"></a>What are Dagger’s Abilities?</h2><figure id="" data-id="089e38adf58a0ac7e31a026b77f6e42c" data-recommend-id="image://089e38adf58a0ac7e31a026b77f6e42c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Dagger's various abilities." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows Dagger's various abilities." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Brian Barnett / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="089e38adf58a0ac7e31a026b77f6e42c" data-recommend-id="image://089e38adf58a0ac7e31a026b77f6e42c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Dagger's various abilities." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Lightforce Dagger:</strong> Your primary attack. Bounces towards enemies and allies, damaging enemies and healing allies. A very easy attack to use, and one you should be constantly holding down. It needs a reload, but you can quickly switch to Cloak and back again to reload faster.</li><li><strong>Eternal Bond (Ultimate): </strong>Same as Dagger’s.</li><li><strong>Shadow’s Embrace: </strong>Switches to Cloak. Switching to Cloak and back again will reload Lightforce Dagger slightly faster than the standard reload animation.</li><li><strong>Light Explosion:</strong> Throw a large rectangle of light towards your target, healing them a slight amount and boosting subsequent healing they receive. Use this on enemies who are getting hurt a lot before using Lightforce Dagger or Dagger Storm on them.</li><li><strong>Dagger Storm:</strong> Throw a ball of light that expands into a dome, healing all allies within it over time. The primary way Dagger can heal herself, so throw it at your feet if you are getting hurt and the other Strategist is far away. You can also switch to Cloak after creating Dagger Storm to fight back against approaching Dualists like Spider-Man, and more.</li><li><strong>From Shadow To Light (Team-Up: Passive):</strong> Teaming up with Moon Knight will give him the ability to create a sphere of invisibility for himself.</li></ul><h2 id="h113134"><a id="cloak"></a>What are Cloak’s Abilities?</h2><figure id="" data-id="5ede5e33df925e5af7c102b42f6a2923" data-recommend-id="image://5ede5e33df925e5af7c102b42f6a2923" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Cloak's abilities." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows Cloak's abilities." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Brian Barnett / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5ede5e33df925e5af7c102b42f6a2923" data-recommend-id="image://5ede5e33df925e5af7c102b42f6a2923" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Cloak's abilities." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Darkforce Cloak: </strong>Your primary attack. Like Scarlet Witch, this ability deals constant damage to enemies who are in the close and mid-range. So long as you hold the button down, and aim near the enemy, they’ll keep taking damage. A great way to strike back at enemies trying to take Dagger out.</li><li><strong>Eternal Bond (Ultimate):</strong> Same as Dagger’s. Four dashes, each aimable, lay down a Light/Dark power on the ground, damaging all enemies and healing all allies standing on it. A very powerful Ultimate ability, and one which charges very quickly. Be aware that enemies like Magneto can kill you in-between dashes, so try to have a teammate like Punisher or Star Lord bait it out before you use this, or have a Loki on your team to have two Eternal Bonds.</li><li><strong>Light’s Embrace:</strong> Switches to Dagger.</li><li><strong>Terror Cape: </strong>Throws a rectangle of dark energy in the direction you are aiming, significantly reducing visibility for enemies struck with it. Also deals damage and makes them Vulnerable, making them take more damage from all sources for a time. Use this every 12 seconds, when it comes off cooldown, against the most vulnerable targets on the enemy team.</li><li><strong>Dark Teleportation: </strong>Causes yourself, and nearby allies, to become invisible, untargetable, and quicker movement speed. A well-timed Dark Teleportation can completely negate certain enemy Ultimate abilities. Iron Man shooting his ultimate at your team? Switch to Cloak and use this ability, and you’ll take no damage. It only lasts a moment, so your timing will need to be precise.</li><li><strong>From Shadow To Light (Team-Up: Passive): </strong>Teaming up with Moon Knight will give him the ability to create a sphere of invisibility for himself.</li></ul><hr><p>With all these tips in hand, you are prepared to become a true master of both light and dark. Good luck!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nine of those homers happened in one game. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/yankees-hit-historic-9-home-runs-including-3-from-aaron-judge-and-3-off-games-first-3-pitches-to-crush-brewers-174733967.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/yankees-hit-historic-9-home-runs-including-3-from-aaron-judge-and-3-off-games-first-3-pitches-to-crush-brewers-174733967.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Three of them happened off the first three pitches of Saturday’s game</a></span> against the Milwaukee Brewers. But nobody seems to be talking about how great the Yankees performed over the weekend; instead the conversation is entirely focused on the weird “Torpedo” bats used by some Yankee players like shortstop Anthony Volpe, who hit two home runs over the weekend. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/did-yankees-physicist-designed-torpedo-bats-play-role-in-9-hr-power-surge-vs-brewers-224436396.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/did-yankees-physicist-designed-torpedo-bats-play-role-in-9-hr-power-surge-vs-brewers-224436396.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Torpedo bats</a></span> look very strange when compared to the standard tube-like design of most professional baseball bats.

This tumor-like spot looks odd, but it has more mass and, the theory is, that leads to harder hits and more home runs. And so far, the bat seems to be legal based on the MLB’s rules. </p><p>“The concept makes so much sense,” said  Volpe before Sunday’s game. “I know I’m bought in. The bigger you can have the barrel where you hit the ball, it makes sense to me.”</p><p>Three other Yankee players as well as two other MLB pro players used the strange bat over the weekend, too. Yet not all of them hit multiple home runs. Meanwhile, Yankee player Aaron Judge was able to hit six homers over opening weekend without using the new bats. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/whats-the-deal-with-the-yankees-torpedo-bats-and-are-they-really-a-competitive-advantage-000747259.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/whats-the-deal-with-the-yankees-torpedo-bats-and-are-they-really-a-competitive-advantage-000747259.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by <em>Yahoo Sports</em></a></span>, when asked about the new bats, Judge said: “What I did the past couple of seasons speaks for itself. Why try to change something if you have something that’s working?”</p><h2 id="h50378"><a id=""></a>Reactions to the new Torpedo bats</h2><p>Still, the Yankees hitting so many home runs while using strange new bats has ruffled some feathers, in a sport that is filled with tradition and is slow to change. At least one player for the Brewers, Trevor Megill, wasn’t happy about the opposing team using Torpedo bats over the weekend. </p><p>“I think it’s terrible,’’ <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://nypost.com/2025/03/30/sports/brewers-closer-fumes-over-yankees-new-bowling-pin-bats/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/30/sports/brewers-closer-fumes-over-yankees-new-bowling-pin-bats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Megill told the <em>New York Post</em></a></span>. “We’ll see what the data says. I’ve never seen anything like it before. I feel like it’s something used in slow-pitch softball. It’s genius: Put the mass all in one spot. It might be bush [league]. It might not be. But it’s the Yankees, so they’ll let it slide.” </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/mlb-reactions-to-yankees-torpedo-bats-range-from-its-terrible-to-they-should-send-a-few-over-here-044054221.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/mlb-reactions-to-yankees-torpedo-bats-range-from-its-terrible-to-they-should-send-a-few-over-here-044054221.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Other players were more open to the new bat design</a></span> or suggested it might not work for everyone. </p><p>It should be noted that other teams besides the Yankees used the new bats over the weekend, and there’s some evidence that they’ve been around since last season. What makes things confusing is that the Torpedo bat isn’t a singular design, but more a new way to build bats where you place more mass in a specific spot. There’s also some debate as to how helpful they are and if they really provide a massive advantage. It still takes a lot of skill to swing a bat fast and accurately enough to hit a home run against MLB’s skilled pitchers.</p><p> Still, in a sport where even a slim advantage can be very important, that hasn’t stopped teams from taking notice. <em>Yahoo Sports</em> reports that after opening weekend, 29 other teams are now looking to optimize their own equipment to create their own Torpedo bats. </p><p> . </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Building on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-arcane-more-league-shows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the success of the Arcane series on Netflix</a>, Riot Games is reportedly considering a live-action project for its next series. The developers of League of Legends are also reportedly close to finalizing a shoot locations that will bring one of the game’s iconic regions to life.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-the-pirate-haven-of-bilgewater-be-brought-to-life-in-vietnam">Will the Pirate Haven of Bilgewater Be Brought to Life in Vietnam?</h2>



<p>According to a post from an official Vietnamese government Facebook account, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thongtinchinhphu/posts/pfbid027nU7FnBtEjTDbTviX5q83PDB2i1ojhCNd6otx6uf4bLoYmoM7cD9YyKbsR21LawTl?rdid=LoxCDuRbRi6vVDxk&amp;checkpoint_src=any#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riot is planning to film</a> a nine episode television series based on League of Legends later this year. Riot is reportedly very interested in the Cát Bà Archipelago in northern Vietnam as a filming location, and could start shooting by the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Among the Riot representatives that met with Vietnam’s Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism was Rose Lam, a long-time executive producer for shows like The Last of Us and Altered Carbon. According to Lam, Riot Studios surveyed many other countries in Asia including Japan, Korea, and Thailand, but found Vietnam to be the most suitable.</p>



<p>Earlier today, esports and gaming news outlet Sheep Esports <a href="https://www.sheepesports.com/en/articles/lol-rumors-of-a-live-action-series-set-to-begin-filming-in-2025/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speculated</a> that the “rugged cliffs, deep blue waters, and maritime atmosphere of Cát Bà” point toward a series that could be set in the <a href="https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/region/bilgewater/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">region of Bilgewater</a>. In League of Legends’ lore, Bilgewater is a port city and pirate haven, home to several nautical or sea-faring in-game champions like Gangplank, Tahm Kench, and Miss Fortune, among others. The first two seasons of Arcane took place in the glittering, progressive city of Piltover and the dark, industrial undercity of Zaun.</p>



<p>The success of both Arcane and other live-action video game series has evidently Riot to motivation to pursue a live-action show of its own. Arcane received massive critical acclaim, especially in its first season, leading to numerous awards in the field of animation. In the past two years, two different live action shows based on games, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-best-adaptation-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout</a> and The Last of Us, have been met with critical acclaim and commercial success.</p>



<p>When do you think a live-action League of Legends would actually come out? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1794/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

Title Update 2 is then planned for this summer, with a new additional monster and seosonal event. Tokuda confirms more free updates are arriving beyond that.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">A greater challenge awaits</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of the Mosnter Hunter Wilds' director's letter dug into the question of challenging monster content. Already, fights like Tempered Arkveld, the aforementioned Arch-tempered Rey Dau, and a refight with Zoh Shia are confirmed. Tokuda also confirmed Mizutsune, arriving with Title Update 1, will have an 8-star Tempered Mizutsune fight, available at HR 41 or higher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The end-of-May update will add even more 8-star Tempered monsters to the Wilds. Tempered versions of Gore Magala, Rey Dau, Uth Duna, Nu Udra, and Jin Dahaad will make their way to the game in this update.</p><div id="monster-hunter-wilds-weapons-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3><h3>Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"Each of these monsters have had various behind-the-scenes adjustments to make them more resilient, such as increased health, resistance to wounding, and tweaks to multiplayer scaling," Tokuda said. "Challenging monsters will also appear in future updates, so keep an eye out for further information about them."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Balancing it all out</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically addressing feedback from launch, Tokuda said that Capcom is planning to make "various adjustments," including weapon balance changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"These will be implemented gradually with each upcoming title update in order to make the game more enjoyable for everyone for a longer period of time," Tokuda said. "Depending on the content, these changes may take some time to prepare."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The director noted the Hammer as one weapon being considered for "upward adjustments," which sounds like good news for Hammer mains. Some "unintentionally overpowered" things will be adjusted down — the Corrupted Mantle is one example — but Capcom said it plans on adjusting other parts upward, making for a "generally balanced" update. The team is currently aiming to implement the overall weapon balance adjustments in either the end-of-May update or in Title Update 2 this summer.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Performance adjustments</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, Capcom is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-director-commits-to-addressing-stability-issues-with-pc-improvements-coming-in-title-update-1">targeting stability and performance for Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, specifically noting the PC version. Title Update 1 is planned to bring a reduction in VRAM usage and an upgrade to the DirectStorage version of the Steam version, which should result in an "overall improvement" of stability for PC players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More improvements are planned, to bolster the overall technical experience for players on all platforms. Additionally, the in-game economy, balance, and other areas are planned for improvement too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Quality-of-life is also a major target for the Monster Hunter Wilds team moving forward. The Grand Hub, arriving in Title Update 1, is part of this, condensing various functions into one end-game area. The team has also reduced waiting times for facility functions at each location.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team is continuing to work on UI/UX improvements and other quality-of-life updates too. A few items on the docket include restocking items, checking skill information, engaging in multiplayer quests, using the Seikret, and camera behavior during hunts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rollout stars with Title Update 1 this Friday, April 4, and on into the summer as we approach Title Update 2. Though it's still fresh, Monster Hunter Wilds is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-breezes-past-10-million-sold-capcom-explains-why-its-done-so-incredibly-well">already one of the year's most popular games</a>, and it doesn't look like Capcom is planning to slow down its roadmap for it anytime soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/runescape-dragonwilds-announced-as-jagexs-new-take-on-the-open-world-survival-genre<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, Jagex has announced that it's bringing the world of RuneScape into a new genre: survival. The developer revealed RuneScape: Dragonwilds, a cooperative open world survival game coming to early access this spring.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragonwilds takes place in Ashenfall, a new continent within the RuneScape universe, where one to four players can work together to learn new skills, build camps, grow stronger, and survive against powerful enemies, including lots and lots of dragons. Ashenfall has two regions, with five unique biomes, and the potential for more to be added later post-launch. Though Ashenfall is not the same continent most of RuneScape proper takes place on, RuneScape fans will find a lot of familiarity in the world, including some locations that may resemble familiar places from RuneScape itself, like a wizard's tower, or a certain castle...</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">RuneScape: Dragonwilds First Look Screenshots and Art</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Monsters may also look familiar, but come with a twist. While you'll still see rats, dragons, trolls, cows, and other creatures you'll recall from RuneScape, Ashenfall's wild magic has warped these creatures into strange, nature-fied versions of themselves with new appearances and fusions with plants, thorns, and other wild bits.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Core to survival in Dragonwilds is development of skills, and yes, they include classic RuneScape activities like cooking and woodcutting. These skills allow you to interact with the world in various ways - when I saw a few clips of the game at the Game Developers' Conference earlier this month, I was shown clips of a player using wind runes to gain the ability to glide through the air across distances. Even more nostalgic was a woodcutting skill that allows players to line up a row of trees and throw a spectral axe to chop them all down at once. It's a move I was told was referred to as "ax-tral projection." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">RuneScape: Dragonwilds is entering early access on PC sometime this spring, with hopes for a wider launch (including console) sometime in 2026. Jagex will host a deep-dive reveal of the game on Twitch on April 15 at 9:00 AM PT.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/developers-say-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-dont-have-4k-output/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/developers-say-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-don%E2%80%99t-have-4k-output.1150071/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/developers-say-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-dont-have-4k-output/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is set to get its full reveal on April 2, and there are plenty of rumors and speculation about what the latest console from Nintendo will feature. One such rumor is that the Nintendo Switch 2 will support 4K resolution in some fashion. </p>



<p>Past rumors suggest that the Switch 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-backwards-compatible-and-support-4k-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will support 4K when docked</a>. When in handheld, however, it will have a 1080p resolution.</p>



<p>Despite the claims of 4K support, however, there is some question as to whether that’s accurate based on what was said during the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco earlier this month.</p>



<p>“I heard this from one developer at GDC and also heard it separately in an email but the dev kits, or some of the dev kits, don’t have a 4K output,” Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson said during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLUrxzSPZhU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the latest episode of Insider Gaming Weekly</a>.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Ubisoft And Tencent Have A Deal, GTA 6 Release Questions, and An Exclusive Game Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cLUrxzSPZhU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It should be emphasized that the lack of 4K output on a dev kit doesn’t automatically mean that the system won’t support it. Console development kits don’t often fully match the specs of the final system. For example, some dev kits could offer more memory to allow for better debugging and leave out features that don’t impact testing too much like, in this instance, a 4K output.</p>



<p>Sticking on the topic of dev kits, to follow up on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prior Insider Gaming report</a> on developers expecting them in June, it was clarified that it’s likely that some of the major third-party developers have them already. It’s the smaller studios that are still waiting on them to come in.</p>



<p>Do you think the Nintendo Switch 2 will support 4K in some manner? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1794/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>Jagex has officially revealed its new game in the RuneScape franchise called RuneScape: Dragonwilds. The game, set in the same universe as the traditional RuneScape titles is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1374490/RuneScape_Dragonwilds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">set to release</a> in early access this spring.</p>



<p>RuneScape: Dragonwilds takes place on the continent of Ashenfall where up to four players work together to build camps, improve skills, and work to survive a land where “dragons have awoken”.</p>



<p>“Journey through the vast, vibrant regions of Ashenfall and unveil the ruins of forgotten civilisations to discover why&nbsp;wild, transformative magic&nbsp;spills from its fractured lands,” the game’s description reads. “Explode ore veins with a snap of your fingers. Conjure a spectral axe to chop down a line of trees in an instant. The Anima-rich landscape of Ashenfall offers you a power unlike any other.”</p>



<p>There will also be various quests to complete while level up your skills and even wield the runes the series is known for.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>The continent itself will be made up of two regions with give biomes. Players of the franchise will be able to recognize various creatures from the series, however they will look a bit different due to the magic of Ashenfall. Some will be fused with thorns or other plant elements. </p>



<p>Ahead of the game’s early access release later this spring, Jagex will be holding a deep-dive for players on April 15 at Noon ET/9am PT. Though not confirmed, it’s expected that an early access release date will be announced at, our around, the deep dive event.</p>

The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-2025-release/1100-6518649/" data-ref-id="1100-6518649">first trailer for the game</a> revealed even more realistic visuals than previous GTA games, but it's just another step forward. According to Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of GTA's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, animation that is indistinguishable from live-action footage may be arriving sooner than anyone expects.</p><p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M53-LKlECk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Zelnick noted that games have not reached the 'technological asymptote" of movies and TV shows, but he believes the industry is heading towards a future where games can truly replicate the appearance of reality.</p><p>"Our game, NBA 2K, if you squint, looks like real basketball," said Zelnick. "But you still have to squint a little bit. It's still animation. It's terrific animation. But we don't really have interactive entertainment yet that really looks like live-action. Technology will get us there, but probably [in] a shorter period of time than maybe even I expect. That doesn't mean that every game is going to look like live-action. That wouldn't make any sense creatively, but that will be another tool in our toolkit that's generated by technology."</p><p>Zelnick made similar remarks about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/graphics-will-become-indistinguishable-from-realit/1100-6469068/" data-ref-id="1100-6469068">games with realistic graphics</a> back in 2019, before PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S were released. There have been significant graphical improvements during this console generation, but not yet to the level that Zelnick describes.</p><p>During another recent interview. Zelnick suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trumps-tariffs-may-impact-console-sales-says-ceo-of-gta-parent-company/1100-6529312/" data-ref-id="1100-6529312">President Trump's tariffs may significantly impact console sales</a>, potentially including Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-some-believe-the-switch-2-may-not-launch-until-june/1100-6528854/" data-ref-id="1100-6528854">upcoming Switch 2 launch</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/runescape-dragonwilds-is-a-co-op-open-world-survival-crafting-game-due-soon-in-early-access/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Jagex has unveiled RuneScape: Dragonwilds, a new game set in the beloved fantasy setting made popular by the 24-year-old MMORPG. It's an&nbsp;<span>open-world survival crafting game with cooperative multiplayer support for up to four players, and it will debut this Spring&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1374490/RuneScape_Dragonwilds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam Early Access</a>. This is the studio's first proper spin-off to be released after they </span>canceled the <a href="https://wccftech.com/unannounced-runescape-action-rpg-jagex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous action RPG project</a>.</p>
<p>Jon Bellamy, CEO of the Cambridge-based developer, stated:</p>
<p><em>We’re so excited to finally give players a glimpse at the next entry in the RuneScape franchise today with RuneScape: Dragonwilds. This is an entirely new RuneScape experience set within the iconic world of Gielinor and is a game which is worthy of wearing the RuneScape name. From the very beginning, community feedback has been at the heart of RuneScape: Dragonwilds. We’ve already conducted closed alpha tests with some of our closest community members, and we’ll be listening to player feedback when building the game throughout Early Access. We’ve built an entirely new team filled with industry veterans who are focussed on making sure that RuneScape: Dragonwilds sits naturally within the RuneScape franchise, and a game that is loved by both our biggest RuneScape fans and entirely new players alike.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing RuneScape: Dragonwilds | Q&amp;A With Mod Dutch" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/30mkN1Hw83Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The backdrop is that, as suggested by the title, dragons have awoken on RuneScape's forgotten continent of Ashenfall. Players will have to master survival while uncovering ancient secrets to try and slay the Dragon Queen, who appears to be positioned to be the final boss.</p>
<p>They'll get to use what Jagex described as 'wild, transformative magic' to gather resources, such as exploding ore veins with a finger snap or conjuring a spectral axe to chop down a line of trees in a single hit. RuneScape: Dragonwilds also reportedly features a unique progression system that players will use to unlock new spells and craft recipes and abilities.</p>
<p>Jagex estimates that early access should be completed in early 2026, though that may vary depending on player feedback. RuneScape: Dragonwilds is powered by Unreal Engine 5, but the system requirements listed on the store page are quite low.</p>

The HBO live-action adaptation will be based on <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, and anyone who’s played it knows it builds heavily off the first game’s ending. As such, showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann are doing promotional interviews for the new season and were naturally asked by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-hbo-creators-answer-whether-or-not-joel-was-right-to-save-ellie&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-hbo-creators-answer-whether-or-not-joel-was-right-to-save-ellie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span> about the moral conundrum presented at the end of the first game. And y’all, I think it’s bizarre that someone who led two of my favorite games of all time manages to make them less interesting every time he weighs in on their characters’ actions.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At the end of the first <em>Last of Us</em>, blue-collar dad turned post-apocalyptic smuggler Joel goes on a rampage through a hospital, killing high-ranking members of the resistance group known as the Fireflies. He does this to save Ellie, his cargo-turned-surrogate-daughter, who was nearly killed in order to salvage the mutated cordyceps fungus in her brain that could help to make a vaccine. It’s a difficult situation, the morality of which fans have debated for over a decade. Was Joel right to save someone he cared about from certain death and, in so doing, doom humanity? Did he have any right to make that decision without Ellie’s consent? Did the doctors who were ready to kill her without asking what she wanted have the responsibility to do what they thought was right for the greater good? All of these are good questions. <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> explores them through shifting perspectives, and the sequel manages to end on a note that acknowledges all of them with equal weight.</p><p>Meanwhile, Druckmann and Mazin have expressed to <em>IGN</em> that they see Joel as in the right, even if Mazin is unsure if he could follow through on such a plan.</p><p>“I believe Joel was right,” Druckmann said to <em>IGN</em>. “If I were in Joel’s position, I hope I would be able to do what he did to save my daughter.”</p><p>“That’s so interesting, because I think that if I were in Joel’s position, I probably would have done what he did,” Mazin said. “But I’d like to think that I wouldn’t. That’s the interesting push and pull of the morality of it. And that’s why the ending of the first game is so provocative and so wonderful. It just doesn’t let you off the hook as a player.”</p><p>I could drag Druckmann and Mazin for trying to definitively weigh in on the foundational debate that has been the lifeblood of <em>The Last of Us</em> for a decade, but I will at least couch this all as them being asked about their personal belief, rather than arguing that the text is explicitly making one case or the other. (I would argue, however, that the TV show tries <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-tlou-hbo-show-finale-joel-lies-ellie-part-ii-1850209559&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-tlou-hbo-show-finale-joel-lies-ellie-part-ii-1850209559">real hard to shift us away</a></span> from condemning his actions entirely.) However, after following this series for so long, I always leave Druckmann interviews feeling like what I find profound about these games is just a series of happy accidents. <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>can’t just be a meditation on grief that uses violence as a language when Druckmann is talking about it as if the game is meant to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/video-games/news/the-last-of-us-part-2-ellie-evolution/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/video-games/news/the-last-of-us-part-2-ellie-evolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scold the player for taking violent actions they have no say in</a></span>, or when he’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-not-so-hidden-israeli-politics-of-the-last-of-us-part-ii/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-not-so-hidden-israeli-politics-of-the-last-of-us-part-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">citing the Israel and Palestine conflict as an inspiration</a></span> for the game’s cycle of violence in a comparison that has only gotten more fraught since the game launched in 2020.

But we live in a world where marketing multi-million dollar projects requires interviews, and some audiences need to be told how they’re supposed to feel about something by the person who made it.</p><p>That’s not a <em>Last of Us</em>-specific problem. The modern Wikipediafication of art means everyone’s looking for definitive facts to point to and regurgitate in order to justify everything they feel with cold hard evidence. Sometimes, it feels like modern pop culture discourse is uncomfortable with questions that can’t be easily moralized. We’re seeing it right now with the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-finale-gemma-mark-helly-choice-ship-1851771965&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-finale-gemma-mark-helly-choice-ship-1851771965">ending of <em>Severance</em>’s second season</a></span>. I’m curious to see how a much larger audience reacts to the complexities of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>’s story when season two premieres on April 13.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It follows Raidou Kuzonoha--who fans may recognize from his appearances in other MegaTen games like Shin Megami Tensei III and Soul Hackers--an apprentice occult investigator and Devil Summoner who allies with demons to solve various mysteries in 1930s Tokyo and the mysterious Dark Realm.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike other games in the MegaTen series, Raidou Remastered is an action RPG featuring real-time combat where players combo attacks as Raidou and leverage the powers of over 120 recruitable demons. Strangely, the remaster retools the game to use the combat system of the original game's sequel, Devil Summoner 2: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. King Abaddon--though the sequel is not included in this remaster. Along with the new combat system, the remaster will feature revamped visuals, new voice acting, an all-new interface, expanded environments, and numerous quality-of-life changes.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-sci-fi-and-fantasy-spring-book-sale-save-big-on-popular-box-sets/1100-6527091/">Amazon Sci-Fi And Fantasy Spring Book Sale - Save Big On Popular Box Sets</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-sean-connery-4k-steelbook-collection-is-up-for-preorder/1100-6530389/">James Bond Sean Connery 4K Steelbook Collection Is Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-skywalker-saga-4k-box-set-featured-in-amazons-spring-sale/1100-6530379/">Star Wars Skywalker Saga 4K Box Set Featured In Amazon's Spring Sale</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-ultimate-2-controller-gets-nice-discount-a-month-after-its-release/1100-6529695/">8BitDo Ultimate 2 Controller Gets Nice Discount A Month After Its Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-4k-blu-rays-box-sets-in-amazons-b2g1-free-big-spring-sale/1100-6530318/">Best 4K Blu-Rays &amp; Box Sets In Amazon's B2G1 Free Big Spring Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lenovo-legion-go-steamos-handheld-preorders-are-live-at-best-buy/1100-6528675/">Lenovo Legion Go SteamOS Handheld Preorders Are Live At Best Buy</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-twilight-princess-11-book-manga-box-set-is-nearly-50-off-at-amazon/1100-6520959/">Zelda: Twilight Princess 11-Book Manga Box Set Is Nearly 50% Off At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-transformers-optimus-prime-is-finally-back-in-stock-with-a-big-discount/1100-6509331/">Lego Transformers Optimus Prime Is Finally Back In Stock With A Big Discount</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<p>This comes from the ever-reliable Billbil-kun, although they admit they aren't sure which game in the series it could be. "Could it be for Part 1, Part 2, or something entirely new?" they <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1906684709146366140">mused</a>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/une-mysterieuse-edition-physique-dun-jeu-de-naughty-dog-est-en-cours-de-preparation-60078">Dealabs' report</a>, this mysterious special edition is set for a physical release on PlayStation 5. As for pricing, Billbil-kun stated it will retail for €119.99 EUR or $109.99.</p>
<p>"Everything seems to indicate that the officialisation of this edition, as well as the opening of pre-orders, would take place very soon, in a time window that we estimate within two months," Billbil-kun wrote (via Google Translate).</p>
<p>Eurogamer has reached out to PlayStation for further comment.</p>

Jagex have announced RuneScape: Dragonwilds, a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> co-operative survival game set in the same fantasy realm as their ancient MMO. It runs on Unreal Engine 5, looks a bit like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valheim">Valheim</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/enshrouded">Enshrouded</a>, and will launch into early access this spring. Dragonwilds takes place on the continent of Ashenfall, a wilderness abundant in winged lizards, and your overall goal is to "slay the Dragon Queen". 
</p>
<p>
I'm going to make the obvious prediction here: you will spend much more time in Ashenfall chopping down trees and composing their delicious, grainy innards into barn doors than chopping down any dragons, regal or otherwise. It's a survival game, after all. The ratio of dragons to logging and carpentry in the first screenshots is a nail-biting 1:1 - if it weren't for that subtitle, I might have assumed this to be a game about woodlands management with optional Smaug-bashing QTEs.</p><p>Rather than dragon-felling cantrips, the announcement release gives prominent mention to a spell for summoning spectral axes to chop trees down for you, which feels a bit like a car salesman leading with the option to just buy a train ticket instead. Still, let's not be <em>entirely</em> miserable before we've even played the game. Here's the announcement trailer.

The game is said to blend "high fantasy with light RPG elements and iconic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape">RuneScape</a> lore." You will "reshape your experience" by means of a magical power called Anima. "Summon spectral axes to fell trees in an instant or channel nature's energy to repair broken armour," the press release explains. Got you: automatable tasks and an equipment degradation system.</p>
<p>There's a progression system with new spells, crafting recipes and abilities to obtain. You'll be able to gad about in groups of four, fighting creatures you might recognise from regular ole RuneScape. And also, massacring the vegetation. Have at you, timber!

<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1374490/RuneScape_Dragonwilds/">Read more on Steam</a>. I've never played the original RuneScape or its more recent free-to-play version, which yet graces our list of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">best MMOs and MMORPGs</a>. As such, I'm not really equipped to comment on whether Dragonwilds is a blasphemy unto RuneScaping or a promising fresh start fuelled by a finely calibrated mix of nostalgia and approachability. But I do know that it takes a lot to get me enthusiastic about a fantasy survival game right now. Still, I like the colourfulness of this, and I strongly relate to the expression of unholy joy on the face of the character in the picture there, as she unleashes the full force of the occult upon an unsuspecting sycamore.

One year removed from the infamous in-game liberation of Malevelon Creek, Helldivers 2 is sending its players back to the planet to hold it against surging Automaton forces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a recent Major Order failure, players were worried about a return to the Creek, as reports indicated the Automatons — pushing forward with their fiery new Incineration Corps — were targeting the Severin Sector. The sector, and Malevelon Creek in particular, was the center of one of Helldivers 2's earliest and most notable collective moments in the game. Helldivers converged on the planet to try and keep the Creek under Super Earth control.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The combination of jungle terrain and extremely dangerous foes led to Malevelon Creek being dubbed things like "Robot Vietnam." After the fight concluded and the Creek was securely under Helldiver control, Arrowhead released a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-gives-all-players-a-special-commemorative-cape-for-malevelon-creek-memorial-day">special cape to commemorate the fight</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, over the weekend, a new Major Order confirmed Helldivers <em>will</em> be heading back to Malevelon Creek. The offensive, led by the Incineration Corps, is on its way, with Malevelon Creek as the target. Already, invasions and skirmishes are underway across the sector, with lines pushing towards the Creek.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Through the in-game briefing, Super Earth is urging its Helldivers to protect the resting place of many "Creekers" who fell in the push to free the planet. This is all to prevent the "greatest net desecration" of the upcoming Malevelon Creek Memorial Day.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Helldivers Alerts (@HelldiversAlert) <a href="https://twitter.com/HelldiversAlert/status/1906316365507748312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 30, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 2 players are, predictably, amped for this Major Order.

Those who experienced the Creek back then, with its swarms of bots and lasers filling the air, are geared up for round two.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New players who joined after the original fight for the Creek <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1jnguoi/wake_the_f_up_helldiver_we_got_a_creek_to_liberate/mkn0lse/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">also seem eager</a> to jump in and experience this particularly memorable locale. There's a lot to be said for these communal efforts, where Helldivers start logging on and building towards big moments together. When it ties into the long-running story and a feeling of a shared experience in a universe, it can be really incredible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, concerns are already rising that Arrowhead hasn't fully tipped its hand yet. <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1jnz8re/this_mo_is_going_well_too_well/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One post notes</a> that while the defensive efforts are going well and Malevelon Creek is currently safe, there are still five days left on the Major Order.

It's fascinating to see it unfold in real-time, and will no doubt make this week an exciting one for Helldivers players as the war for the Creek picks up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/doom-is-having-its-halo-moment-with-the-dark-ages.1149975/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-is-having-its-halo-moment-with-the-dark-ages<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The last thing I expected Doom: The Dark Ages to remind me of was Halo 3. And yet, half way through a recent hands-on demo with id Software’s gothic prequel, I was mounted on the back of a cyborg dragon and unleashing a salvo of machinegun fire across the side of a demonic battle barge. With the vessel’s defensive turrets destroyed, I landed my beast atop the ship and proceeded to charge through its lower decks, turning the entire crew into a few gallons of red slop. Seconds later, the warmachine was toast and I burst through its hull, leaping onto my dragon to continue my crusade against the machines of Hell. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those familiar with Bungie’s landmark Xbox 360 shooter will instantly recognise the shape of Master Chief’s assault on the Covenant’s scarab tanks. The helicopter-like Hornet may have been swapped for a holographic-winged dragon and the giant laser-firing mech for an occult flying boat, but the core of the experience is all here: an aerial assault that transitions into a devastating boarding action. Surprisingly, this wasn’t the only moment in the demo that reminded me of Halo. While the combat core of The Dark Ages is unmistakably and singularly Doom, the campaign’s design seems to have a very “late-2000s shooter” spin thanks to its love of elaborate cutscenes and a greater push for gameplay novelty.    </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/28/doom-the-dark-ages-dragon-1743152759607.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A dragon assault on Hell's battle barge. | Image credit: id Software / Bethesda</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Across two and a half hours I played four levels of Doom: The Dark Ages. Only the first of them, the campaign’s opener, resembled the tightly paced, immaculately mapped design of Doom (2016) and its sequel. The others saw me piloting a colossal mech, flying the aforementioned dragon, and exploring a wide-open battlefield dotted with secrets and powerful minibosses. It’s a big departure from Doom’s usual pursuit of mechanical purity, instead feeling akin to the likes of Halo, Call of Duty, and – weirdly – old James Bond games like Nightfire, all of which thrive on scripted setpieces and novelty mechanics that guest star for a mission or two. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a fascinating direction for Doom to head in, because once upon a time the series made something of a U-turn away from this. The cancelled Doom 4 was set to resemble Call of Duty, not only due to its modern military aesthetic but also thanks to an increased emphasis on characters, cinematic storytelling, and scripted events. After years of work id Software concluded that such ideas simply weren’t a good fit for the series, scrapping them in favour of the much more focused Doom (2016). And yet, in 2025, here they are in The Dark Ages. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The campaign’s rapid pace is punctuated with new gameplay ideas that are reminiscent of Call of Duty’s biggest novelties.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">My demo opened on a long and elaborate cutscene, (re)introducing the realm of Argent D'Nur, the opulent Maykrs, and the Night Sentinels – the knightly brothers-in-arms of the Doom Slayer. The big guy himself is depicted as a terrifying legend; a nuclear-level threat on two legs. While all of this lore will be familiar to Doom obsessives who poured over the prior games’ codex entries, the deeply cinematic approach with which it’s now presented feels very new. Very different. Very Halo. That continues into the levels themselves, with NPC Night Sentinels scattered about the environment akin to UNSC Marines. While they don’t fight alongside you (at least not in the levels I demoed) there’s certainly a greater sense that you’re part of an army – like Master Chief, you’re the invincible spearhead of a large force. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a lot of character work in the introductory cutscene and it remains to be seen if this is something Doom really needs. I’m a big fan of the prior games’ slight approach to story, and part of me would rather The Dark Ages continued to tell the Slayer’s tale through environment design and codex entries, reserving cinematics only for the big reveals à la Eternal. But while I have my reservations, the cutscenes thankfully know their place: they tee up a mission and are never seen again, refusing to interrupt Doom’s signature intense flow. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are interruptions in other forms, though. After that opening mission, which starts with pure shotgun slaughter and ends with you parrying Hell Knights using the Slayer’s incredible new shield, I was thrown into the cockpit of a Pacific Rim-like Atlan mech and asked to wrestle demonic kaiju. After that, I was soaring through the skies on that cybernetic dragon, taking down battle barges and picking off gun emplacements. These tightly scripted levels create a significant gear shift, punctuating the campaign’s rapid pace with new gameplay ideas that are reminiscent of Call of Duty’s biggest novelties, such as Modern Warfare’s AC-130 gunship sequence or Infinite Warfare’s dogfighting missions. The Atlan is slow and heavy, and the skyscraper-high perspective makes Hell’s armies look like Warhammer miniatures. The dragon, meanwhile, is fast and agile, and the shift to a wide-angle third-person camera results in a very different experience that feels a dimension away from classic Doom. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/28/doom-the-dark-ages-mech-1743152796190.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The mech battles are Pacific Rim-scale punch ups. | Image credit: id Software / Bethesda</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of the best FPS campaigns thrive on this kind of variety. Half-Life 2 and Titanfall 2 are the gold standard for it. Halo has endured so long partly because its mix of vehicular and on-foot sequences provides it with a rich texture. But I’m unsure if this will work for Doom. As with Eternal, The Dark Ages is once again a wonderfully complex shooter to play – every second demands your complete attention as you weave together shots, shield tosses, parries, and brutal melee combos. In comparison, the mech and dragon sequences feel anemic, stripped back, and practically on-rails – their combat engagements so tightly controlled they almost resemble QTEs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Call of Duty the switch to driving a tank or firing from a circling gunship works because the mechanical complexity of such scripted sequences isn’t that far removed from the on-foot missions. But in The Dark Ages there’s a clear gulf between gameplay styles, so much so it’s akin to a middle school guitar student playing alongside Eddie Van Halen. And while I know Doom’s core combat will always be the star, when I’m beating the snot out of a giant demon with a rocket-powered mech punch I shouldn’t be wishing I was back on the ground using a “mere” double-barrelled shotgun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My final hour of play saw The Dark Ages shift into another unusual guise, but one built on what feels like a much sturdier foundation. “Siege” is a level that returns its focus to id’s best-in-class gunplay, but it opens up Doom’s typically claustrophobic level design into a huge open battlefield, its geography shifting between narrow and wide to provide a myriad of pathways and combat arenas. The goal, to destroy five Gore Portals, has the same energy as Call of Duty’s multi-objective, complete-in-any-order missions, but I was reminded once more of Halo – the grand scale of this map versus the tighter routes of the opening level evokes the contrast between Halo’s interior and exterior environments. And, like Halo, the novelty here is that the excellent core shooter systems are given new context in much larger spaces. You must rethink the effective range of every single weapon in your arsenal. Your charge attack is employed to close football field-length distances. And the shield is used to deflect artillery fired from oversized tank cannons. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Were these ideas always a bad idea for Doom, or were they just a bad idea when they looked too much like Call of Duty?</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The downside of expanding Doom’s playspace is that things can become a little unfocused – I found myself backtracking and looping through empty pathways, which really does kill the pace. It’s here I’d like to have seen The Dark Ages veer even closer to Halo by throwing the dragon into the mix and using it like a Banshee; being able to fly across this battlefield, raining down fire before divebombing into a miniboss battle, would have helped maintain the pace and make the dragon feel more integral to the experience. If such a level exists beyond what I’ve seen, I’ll be very happy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless of the overall shape of the full campaign, though, I am fascinated that so much of what I’ve seen feels like a resurrection and reinterpretation of ideas that were once considered an ill-fit for the series. Very little of the cancelled Doom 4 was released for the public to see, but a <a href="https://kotaku.com/five-years-and-nothing-to-show-how-doom-4-got-off-trac-468097062" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kotaku report</a> from 2013 paints a distinct picture. “There were a lot of scripted set pieces,” a source told the publication, among them allegedly an “obligatory vehicle scene.” And that’s exactly what we’ve got in the Atlan and dragon sections – mechanically simple scripted sequences that hark back to the novelty vehicle levels of Xbox 360-era shooters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://youtu.be/PS6SBnccxMA?t=812" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Talking to Noclip</a> in 2016, id Software’s Marty Stratton confirmed that Doom 4 “was much closer to something like [Call of Duty]. A lot more cinematic, a lot more story to it. A lot more characters around you that you are with throughout the course of the gameplay.” All that was scrapped, and so it’s genuinely fascinating to see so much of it return in The Dark Ages. This is a campaign set to feature big boarding action setpieces, lusciously rendered cinematics, a much wider cast of characters, and huge lore reveals. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is: were those ideas always a bad idea for Doom, or were they just a bad idea when they looked too much like Call of Duty? Part of me is just as skeptical as the fans who once decried “Call of Doom”, but I’m also excited at the idea of id Software finally making that approach work by grafting it on to the now-proven modern Doom formula.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The beating, gory heart of The Dark Ages unquestionably remains its on-foot, gun-in-hand combat. Nothing in this demo suggested that it will not be centre stage, and everything I played affirms it's another fantastic reinvention of Doom’s core. I think that alone is strong enough to support an entire campaign, but id Software obviously has other designs. I’m surprised that a couple of the studio’s new ideas feel so mechanically slim, and I am concerned that they will feel more like contaminants than fresh air. But there’s still a lot more to see, and only in time will these fractured demo missions be contextualised. And so I eagerly await May 15th, not just to return to id’s unrivaled gunplay, but to satisfy my curiosity. Is Doom: The Dark Ages a good late-2000s FPS campaign or a messy one? </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's going to go in and out of stock for a while, so make sure to check back on it in the mornings and lunch time. I’m still after N’s Zoroark ex, and the Lillie’s Clefairy ex might be one of the most charming chase cards I’ve seen in a long time.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">My Favorite Journey Together Chase Cards</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Iono’s Bellibolt, Hop’s Zacian, N’s alt-art — this box is pure fan service in the best possible way.
