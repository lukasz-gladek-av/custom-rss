			<p>At long last, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-vermintide-2-adds-dlss-3-and-fsr-2-2-more-dlc-coming-after-siennas-necromancer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer: Vermintide 2</a> has been updated with a proper 4v4 player versus mode where players can choose from the Five Heroes and the Pactsworn to go against each other in fierce battles.</p>
<h2>Warhammer: Vermintide 2 Versus Mode is live with new challenges and rewards</h2>
<p><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-vermintide-2-adds-dlss-3-and-fsr-2-2-more-dlc-coming-after-siennas-necromancer/">Warhammer: Vermintide 2</a>,&nbsp;</em><span>released in 2018, has today received the<em>&nbsp;Versus Mode,&nbsp;</em>which will provide players with a new way to enjoy the game. The developer and publisher Fatshark has released the Versus mode with&nbsp;<strong>a </strong></span><strong>4v4 </strong>player mode along with several new features.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Versus is a </em><strong><em>free new Game mode</em></strong><em> for Warhammer: Vermintide 2! It’s an asymmetrical PvP+E experience pitting up to 4 Heroes against our AI enemies and up to 4 Special players, what we call Pactsworn. A match will take place over several rounds, with each team swapping places between playing the Heroes and the Pactsworn each round. To simplify, each round consists of the Hero team playing a regular game akin to Adventure mode, while the Pactsworn players, controlling the Specials, have to stop them.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The co-op title usually allows players to join a team and go against the enemies, but with the 4v4 Versus mode, players can enjoy even more challenging gameplay. Players can choose from the <em>Ubersreik Five Heroes</em> and for the first time, the&nbsp;<em>Pactsworn&nbsp;</em>characters are also available to play with, allowing players to use unique abilities.</p>
<p>The Pactsworn is comprised of&nbsp;<em>Skaven&nbsp;</em>and <em>Rotblood Tribe, </em>which are the in-game enemies introduced after the conclusion of Vermintide 1. Each team can choose the characters from either Five Heroes or Pactsworn to go on a rampage against each other and unlock new challenges and rewards.</p>
<p>The maps from the PvE have been reimagined for PvP. Each character from the Five Heroes will have three careers to master, and throughout the course, they will offer players new progression systems containing new challenges and rewards, which are exclusive to the Versus mode.</p>

<p>The developer has promised to offer another free update. This will be the&nbsp;<em>Verminous Dreams&nbsp;</em>DLC, which will contain three levels. The first level will be released on December 9, followed by the other two in early 2025. The DLC will be available across all platforms, including PC, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series S, and Xbox Series X.</p>

It’s a perfect example of Apple TV’s narrow, lowkey success with original programming that is very good and almost nobody is watching. People can start remedying that in the meantime by catching up on seasons 1-3. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<section><p>Creature-collector games have never looked like this before, but I hope it's a blueprint for the future.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">The creature-collector genre is a space first and foremost dominated by Pokemon, then filled out with many games inspired by it. Lots of kids who grew up on the massively popular IP via the card game, anime, and its many video games are today developers looking to add their own spin on the format--some of them to modest or better acclaim, like TemTem, Cassette Beasts, and Palworld. I enjoy such games, but most of them tend to be uninterested in achieving a vision of a game I've had in my head for years--to no fault of their own, of course. It's <em>my</em> vision, not necessarily theirs. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/beastieball/" data-ref-id="5000-590692">Beastieball</a>, a new creature collector from Wishes Unlimited--the team behind heartfelt indie darlings Chicory: A Colorful Tale and Wandersong--seems serendipitously built from the ground up as though its studio read my mind. Finally, there's a Pokemon-style game that consciously washes its hands of some of the genre's more uncomfortable implications of animals.</p><p dir="ltr">I've written about the intersection of animal rights and gaming before, and many readers who previously overloaded my articles with negative comments were, from one perspective, right on the money. Where one may be concerned with animal rights, they need not extend their concern to virtual animals, since these are not living beings. To that, I both previously offered and once more render a resounding <em>duh.</em> But it's never been my point to argue for the liberation of Pokemon, Pals, or, in this case, Beasties.</p><p dir="ltr">Rather, my focus remains on <em>portrayals </em>of animals in games. How we present ideas through our media often affects how we view similar subjects in the real world, even if we can't always sense the changes taking shape. If I watch a lot of movies, read a lot of books, or listen to a lot of podcasts, all espousing a particular point of view, how long will it be until I start to believe it's true in real life? One needs only to look at how YouTube algorithms or the "manosphere" have, in many cases, Roganized a generation of (usually) white guys. My concern with how we gamify animal exploitation is not centered on freeing virtual animals from their imaginary shackles; it's about hoping to promote portrayals that reject the tropes we so often see in games--where animals are little more than crafting resources, transportation vessels, and supply chains. If we reconsider how animals are portrayed in games, it would have a knock-on effect in real life for some number of players. That's how progress happens, and Beastieball is a sure sign of it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4399782-screenshot2024-11-12175309.png" data-ref-id="1300-4399782" data-ratio="0.56063618290258" data-width="1006" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4399782-screenshot2024-11-12175309.png" data-ref-id="1300-4399782"></a><figcaption>The simple change from dogfighting to volleyball erases a lot of the genre's typical, more awkward implications.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4399782-screenshot2024-11-12175309.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">So as to not bury the lede here, I'd enjoy Beastieball for much of what it does, even if it did those things the way Pokemon or any other major creature collector game does them. But by making a concerted effort to harmonize its story universe and its gameplay mechanics, it's revealed an exciting new, animal-friendly path ahead for games like it. None of this means you should feel bad for liking Pokemon. At the same time, it feels really good to like Beastieball.</p><p dir="ltr">Pokemon's central mechanic is its turn-based combat system, which has been around for so long that it can be easy to overlook that it's essentially in-universe dogfighting, a practice few would endorse in real life. There's long been debate about whether or not the creatures actually like fighting each other the way they're made to when captured by human trainers. Some say they enjoy it, and only resist capture so that the trainers can prove their worth. This doesn't seem to be in the text, but even if we accept it as true for the sake of discussion, the fact that a mistreated creature can't choose to leave their trainer suggests these creatures are closer to indentured servants than companions.</p><p dir="ltr">Pokemon does gift some of its prominent creatures with personalities--Ash’s Pikachu most of all, of course. But for the most part, the series' lovable monsters are defined only by their breed. The story is naturally focused on Ash and his entourage of Pokemon trainers. It's a story of human triumph in which the creatures are tools to achieve a goal. Beastieball goes to great lengths to ditch all of these notions and more.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4399780-screenshot2024-11-12174625.png" data-ref-id="1300-4399780" data-ratio="0.56107249255214" data-width="1007" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4399780-screenshot2024-11-12174625.png" data-ref-id="1300-4399780"></a><figcaption>Beasties form bonds and unlock additional moves during their volleyball matches.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4399780-screenshot2024-11-12174625.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">For one, its turn-based combat system is recontextualized as volleyball. It's said that the Beasties adore the sport, and they'll actively seek out trainers with whom they can tag along to meet other Beasties and play volleyball--called beastieball in-universe. There's no hint of Beasties causing harm to one another. Such a simple reimagining of the genre's key mechanic can help players of all ages, but especially younger, often more impressionable players, experience a creature collector that doesn't require the cognitive dissonance of believing you both love your creatures and eagerly send them into street fights.</p><p dir="ltr">Given how Pikachu is both Ash's companion animal and fiercest soldier, this depiction breaks down quickly. Pokemon asks us to accept that this is just how its world behaves. Fair enough, I suppose--the series has never been too concerned with self-reflection--but even better is <em>not</em> asking that of players, which is what Beastieball does.</p><p dir="ltr">Beastieball goes beyond just that, though. The entire world of the game exists in harmony with this example; it's clear that slight alterations in the genre's tropes were consciously made to get away from them. Beasties who play together a lot can become close friends and teach each other moves, and this process is depicted with the pair gleefully meeting for an epic celebration that expresses love and appreciation. Rather than force a Beastie into a Poke Ball-like object, they can be recruited via you discovering their unique recruitment conditions, like winning a game in a certain way or performing specific moves. And the Beasties you recruit trail behind and beside you, freely joining in on your adventure, like dogs on a walk rather than pets locked in a crate.</p><p dir="ltr">As you fill out your Pokedex-like Beastiepedia, details are filled in that often have nothing to do with gameplay mechanics. These short biographies feel heartfelt, as though their writers mean to celebrate the animals for their traits and personalities the way a museum would. It's not all there to help you dominate your competition and beat the game. A lot of it is pure enrichment via lore that sees its starring critters as unique beings.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4399781-screenshot2024-11-12174638.png" data-ref-id="1300-4399781" data-ratio="0.5609514370664" data-width="1009" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4399781-screenshot2024-11-12174638.png" data-ref-id="1300-4399781"></a><figcaption>Townsfolk view their Beasties as companions, not belongings.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4399781-screenshot2024-11-12174638.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Even people around the open world will remark on their Beasties in such a sweet way. A woman I met early in my travels went on about how she feels her bird-like Beastie is unique from others in their family, and explained how that is. Beasties aren't merely tools or even breeds. They're individuals, each of them spoken of not as "it," like a chair or a doorknob, but "he," "she," or "they," like beings with their own wants and needs.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite such similar story structure and gameplay mechanics to Pokemon, Wishes Unlimited's game disposes of the parts that require mental gymnastics. Though you still want to be the very best (like no one ever was), to catch them is not your real quest. Its story is actually about saving a Beastie habitat from closure, and the adventure you go on is all in service of returning to your town with the resources to save a space that means so much to the local people and Beasties. This is not a tale of conquest; it's a story about community.</p><p dir="ltr">This has long been a genre where we often, consciously or not, ignore the uncomfortable implications of a story's universe. But Beastieball proves you can have it both ways. In the broader sense--the one that will ultimately determine the game's staying power--it's an awesome creature collector that will surely scratch the Pokemon itch so many never quite satisfy. But by bringing the studio's now-trademark air of emotional sincerity and attentive kindness to a genre where it's often lacking, Beastieball is the creature collector I always wanted but wasn't sure I'd ever get.</p>

You can create gamerpics (i.e. your Xbox profile pic) from achievement art or your screenshots.

And in the new trailer, we see a lot of <em>HL2 RTX</em> in action and it looks phenomenal. </p><p>The team’s goal isn’t to change how <em>Half-Life 2</em> plays, but instead to add a new coat of paint to the old shooter to make it look better than ever. This means remaking many props and assets to be higher quality, replacing textures with new ones that react properly to lights, and much, much more. It’s honestly one of the best looking remasters I’ve ever seen. </p><p>Nvidia says <em>Half-Life 2 RTX </em>is still in early development, so no idea when we’ll get a chance to play this mod. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477290/HalfLife_2_RTX/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477290/HalfLife_2_RTX/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can now find a new Steam page</a></span> for the mod on Valve’s storefront, which shows that while Valve isn’t officially involved, they are cool with the project.

<p>A new datamine leak of the Assassin’s Creed Animus Hub, which will launch alongside Assassin’s Creed Shadows has revealed Season Pass content and more.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-infinty-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">initially reported by Insider Gaming</a>, the Assassin”s Creed Infinity Hub, called the Animus will launch alongside Assassin’s Creed Shadows and be the launcher for Assassin’s Creed games moving forward. In the Animus, it will contain things like a Season Pass, and cosmetics and tell the ‘modern-day story’ of the Assassin’s Creed games moving forward.</p>



<p>Datamined and leaked by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Thorites/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit user /u/Thorites</a>, the first Battle Pass will be called “Eye in the Dark,” containing 20 different cosmetic tiers. Insider Gaming had also heard of three other Battle Passes previously named “The Hidden Network,” “@The Last Ronin,” and “In The Shadows,” all of which had 20 different tiers, too, but it’s unclear when or if, they’ll release.</p>



<p>The data mine leak also reveals that the Animus Hub will have an in-game store where players can buy cosmetic items for their characters, environments, and even pets. You can look at all the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1grbg48/information_and_assets_of_the_upcoming_animus_hub/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leaked images here</a>.</p>



<p>In September 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft announced that it would delay Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> from its scheduled November release date to February 2025 to improve the game’s polish. </p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is scheduled to release on February 14, 2024.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-ritas-rewind-%E2%80%93-the-final-preview.1036209/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-ritas-rewind-the-final-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">At a glance, it’s pretty easy to get an idea of what Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind is: a co-op arcade style beat-em-up with gorgeous sprite art, bearing some very clear similarities to 2022’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge, all the way down to the title. However, after kicking, punching and morphin through the first two episodes, I’m happy to report that it’s more than just a palette swap, and developer Digital Eclipse clearly understood the assignment, but also wasn’t afraid to get creative in the margins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For starters, the premise is a fun fan-fictional remix: in the far off year of 2024, Robo-Rita Repulsa (who apparently has the same plastic surgeon as Frieza) is facing defeat by Angel Grove’s teenage protectors. Assuming these are the same Rangers from the original series, they’re at least in their late forties at this point. In any case, that’s a non-issue, because Robo-Rita decides to travel back in time and join forces with her younger, less-cybernetically augmented self to put an end to her enemies back when they were still in high school.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind Gameplay Trailer Screenshots - Summer Game Fest 2024</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no shortage of easter eggs and fanservice, but Robo-Rita isn’t going back in time just to make the same mistakes again, so Rita’s Rewind is really more of a Remix. Anyone who knows the original series inside and out is in for some surprises. For instance, a boss fight against Chunky Chicken, an early monster of the week villain from the first season has a second phase where a second poultry-themed enemy appears, Turkey Jerk. It’s a cute joke at face value, but the deep-cut reference here is that in the original series, Chunky Chicken’s costume was repainted and retooled to make Turkey Jerk’s - basically, the analog kaiju suit equivalent of a palette-swap. Like I said, the team Digital Eclipse did their homework.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve ever played a sidescrolling beat-em up, you’re already familiar with the core gameplay. Up to five players team up, locally or online, and gradually move their favorite Power Ranger toward stage left. Our heroes have to stop about every twenty feet to beat the crap out of a small army of Rita Repulsa’s goons, like Putty Patrollers and Tenga Warriors, as well as any trash can, crate or mailbox that looks like it might have health-restoring junk food inside. Combat is one basic attack that can be combined with directional inputs to string together rudimentary combos, plus one ultimate attack that can be activated when a meter is full. The ultimate attacks are appropriately over the top, and triggering one for the first time put a huge grin on my face. If I was seven, I would have been jumping up and down on the couch.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Periodically, a Putty Patroller will show up holding an enormous cylinder with a green crystal in it, and if the Rangers don’t destroy it in time, it’ll trigger an explosive time-warp effect that deals damage, but also rewinds the game to moments earlier, a la Braid. The game’s visuals generally do a really good job creating the illusion this is a retro game, all the way down to a CRT filter. The time warp effect breaks this illusion in a really cool way, making it seem for moment like you’re playing on an arcade cabinet that’s about to short circuit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where Rita’s Rewind really sets itself apart from Shredder’s Revenge is its super-scaler levels, which shake up the 2D side-scroller formula with fast-paced pseudo-3D sequences reminiscent of classic SEGA arcade games like Outrun or Afterburner or the Super Nintendo’s Mode 7 technology. As much fun as beat-em-ups are, these act as palette-cleansers between levels, and they’re really cleverly utilized in the context of Power Rangers.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind - November 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The original television show regularly followed a familiar format: a monster-of-the-week would appear, and after the Rangers seemingly defeated said monster in hand-to-hand combat, Rita Repulsa would utter those infamously suggestive words “make my monster grow!” At which point the fight would continue on a much larger scale, with the Rangers first making use of their individual Dinozord mechs before inevitably joining them together to form the Dino Megazord and save the day. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rita’s Rewind is broken up into “Episodes.” The first one featured two stages of inner city beat-em up gameplay culminating in a boss fight against Goldar on a rooftop. After he was sufficiently pummeled by lycra-clad teens, Robo-Rita super-sized him and he flew off. A brief cutscene showed the Rangers hopping into Zords and the next sequence was a 3D shoot-em-up, which was immediately reminiscent of the original Star Fox on Super NES. This is fitting, since that released the same year Rita’s Rewind takes place, when Power Rangers was at peak popularity, and serves up a nice double-dose of nostalgia. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>How do multiple people cooperatively pilot a single humanoid mech? In the case of the video game, it takes a cue from a different type of couch co-op: passing a controller back and forth when someone dies or beats a level.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">After using the Zords to blow up a generator in some suspicious mining operation while dodging lasers, the moment had arrived: it was time to form the Dino Megazord. But wait, the same lingering question that I had after so many Power Rangers episodes also applies to Rita’s Rewind… How do multiple people cooperatively pilot a single humanoid mech? Not sure what the canonical explanation is, but in the case of the video game, it takes a cue from a different type of couch co-op: passing a controller back and forth when someone dies or beats a level.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a satisfyingly low-poly transformation sequence, the perspective shifted to the Dino Megazord’s cockpit, squared up to duke it out with Goldar, Punch-Out! style. Rather than Goldar having a conventional health bar that’s depleted, the Dino Megazord’s Power Sword is instead displayed at the top of the screen with several small sections running along the blade. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Landing enough punches against Goldar will gradually fill one of these sections up, at which point, it’s the next Ranger’s turn. Conversely, a player’s turn will also end abruptly if Goldar lands an attack. Completely filling the meter will activate the Power Sword, which is then used to finish off the bad guy with a quicktime event where everyone cooperatively button mashes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nobody actually has to pass the controller, it just switches between players, but the idea is the same. It’s entirely possible a similar solution for cooperative Zord-piloting has been implemented in one of the many Power Rangers games released in the last 30 years, but I still thought it was a clever solution. Waiting your turn might not be quite as fun as getting to drive the Megazord yourself the whole time, but if you’re playing with friends, you’ll likely find yourself cheering each other on – or groaning when they get hit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In between episodes, the Rangers change into their civvies and regroup at the Angel Grove Youth Center. While knocking back a few cold ones at Ernie’s juice bar, they can listen to Bulk and Skull take credit for defeating the previous episodes’ villains. In case Rita’s Rewind wasn’t arcadey enough already, playable arcade cabinets can also be unlocked. We got to see “Drive Bomber,” a made-up racing-shmup in which a car can launch bombs into its own path, and will promptly explode if it drives into them, which is hilariously difficult, but also entirely optional.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>In case Rita’s Rewind wasn’t arcadey enough already, playable arcade cabinets can also be unlocked.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Controls-wise, the basic beat-em-up combat is very satisfying, though at times it can be hard to tell what’s going on when the screen is flooded with enemies. It was chaotic with three of us playing, I imagine the full five-person team is borderline comical. The driving sequences are appropriately hectic while the Megazord boxing match is a bit clunky, but so is the source material. Serious gamers with a trained eye for hitboxes and frame data may find something to nitpick, but ultimately, that’s missing the point. Rita’s Rewind is a game for people chasing that high of renting the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Super Nintendo game and staying up too late trying to beat it at a sleepover. Or for people who grew up wishing there was a Power Rangers arcade cabinet at their local pizzeria wedged between The Uncanny X-Men and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite Power Rangers’ rise to popularity in the heyday of arcade beat-em-ups, it somehow never got a proper one. From what I’ve seen of Rita’s Rewind, Digital Eclipse is making a valiant and long-overdue effort to remedy that, and best of all, you don’t have to ask your mom for quarters every time you die.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sam-lake-receives-andrew-yoon-legend-award-new-york-game-awards-alan-wake-control-remedy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The New York Game Awards announced today that Remedy Entertainment Creative Director Sam Lake is the latest recipient of the Andrew Yoon Legend Award, joining the ranks of Hideo Kojima, Jerry Lawson, and other industry luminaries.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of the announcement, IGN sat down with Lake to talk about wrapping up Alan Wake II while looking ahead to Control 2, Remedy's live action shows, and getting him together with David Lynch for a coffee. He also confirmed the recent Lake House DLC's ties to Control 2 and talked about how one particular scene came about. You can read the complete interview below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The New York Game Awards take place Tuesday, January 21 at the SVA Theatre in Manhattan. You can read our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-ii-review">review of Alan Wake II</a> right here.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I'm talking to Sam on the occasion of the New York Game Awards, where he has been nominated to win the New York Game Awards' Andrew Yoon Legend Award. Sam, how does it feel to win?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sam Lake: Pretty incredible. I mean, a huge honor. I feel really, really happy and blessed about it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You've been making video games for so long now. What continues to inspire you after 30 years in the industry?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sam Lake, Creative Director, Remedy Entertainment:</strong> Yeah, it's been close to 30 years now. Video games as a form of expression and art... I feel the exciting thing is there is no set form and no kind of strict set of rules. We are still a very young medium that keeps on finding new ways and keeps on evolving. And we are so tightly connected to the technology, which keeps on going forward at great speed. It kind of feels like every new project is a new opportunity to innovate and come up with something that nobody has done before. And we always start by prototyping ideas that would not have been possible with the previous game. That keeps it very fresh and exciting. Yeah. I mean, we are in a place where we can invent new things all the time, and there hasn't been a day when it's felt boring, and I don't think that that day will ever come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It's been a busy year for Remedy. Can you talk a little bit about what's been happening behind the scenes?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sam Lake:</strong> Yeah. I mean, Alan Wake II, like I guess all the game projects, are big, big efforts, and there is a lot of work that goes into it. Obviously, the main game came out a bit over a year ago now, but then there was DLC work — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-ii-night-springs-dlc-review">Night Springs coming at the beginning of the summer</a>, and now very recently, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-ii-the-lake-house-dlc-review">The Lake House</a>. So now, finally, we are at the stage where we can say that Alan Wake II as a project is complete and done. So that was a big part of it. But these days, Remedy has grown in size and we are a multi-project organization, so there are other game projects happening, obviously. Multiple teams working on multiple projects. Firebreak, our first co-op game; <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/control-2-in-production-readiness-stage-at-remedy-max-payne-remakes-in-full-production">Control 2 in the works</a>, and then Max Payne 1 and 2 being remade as remakes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Spoiler warning for Alan Wake II's Lake House DLC</strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You mentioned The Lake House DLC and Alan Wake II, and there was a particular scene in there that a lot of people took as kind of a </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-2-dlc-has-what-looks-like-a-pretty-big-teaser-for-control-2">teaser trailer for Control 2</a><strong>, which is currently underway. Was it intended to be a teaser trailer, and can you tell me a little bit about making that scene?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sam Lake: </strong>We now have established firmly the concept of Remedy Connected Universe, meaning that Control and Alan Wake exist in the same world. And obviously, this happened when we were working on Control. Playing through Control, players were finding things that tied it to Alan Wake. And then we had two DLCs with Control, and the last DLC, called AWE, was very much a crossover between Control and Alan Wake, setting up Alan Wake II. And that worked really well. We were happy with that. The plan was, right from the get-go, that we'd mirror it with Alan Wake II and the second DLC. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lake House, obviously, is themed around Federal Bureau of Control. The whole location you are investigating and everything in it is firmly a crossover between Control and Alan Wake. And yes, there were glimpses to Control's world in other ways as well. Control II is being worked on with the Control team and creating the content for that was very much a collaboration. Well, everything at Remedy is very much a collaboration between the teams, but this more than many other things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Spoiler end</strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You talk a lot about the shared universe between Control and Alan Wake. Do you have an endgame-like finale kind of in your head?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sam Lake: </strong>I feel we are just getting started, so it's too early to start talking about an endgame. I love tying these things together. I love making it deeper and expanding on the lore. It really feels like this kind of opportunity to take these strands that we have put there, expand, entertain different ideas. It feels really exciting. And the way we are looking at it, every game needs to be enjoyable on its own and stand on its own feet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But for our fans, for people who have been playing other Remedy games, we want to put in a lot of content for them to discover. We also feel hopeful that now that there is a universe and a catalog of games that will be expanding as we go; for somebody playing their first Remedy game, they can continue in the universe and check out the other games as well and dive deeper into that rabbit hole.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Do you have an update on the film and television versions of Control and Alan Wake?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sam Lake:</strong> We now have a deal with Annapurna Pictures. We are very excited about it, but it's also very, very early days. What's exciting is we have been exploring this and we feel it's worth exploring for a long time. Now, with Annapurna, we have a perfect partner and it feels like a genuine collaboration. Obviously, they bring in their prestige expertise and we bring in our universe and our games, and together we are exploring ideas. But yes, early days, but I am very excited.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I would love to have a conversation [with David Lynch] about just creating things, stories, and anything</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Are you going to bring in David Lynch as a collaborator on this since you take so much inspiration from him?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sam Lake:</strong> Yeah. Wouldn't that be cool? Yeah, no. I mean, as I said, early, early days, and where we are with everything is that we are just exploring the potential in our universe for different projects and ideas. We'll see where it goes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Just out of curiosity, have you ever actually had an opportunity to meet David Lynch over the course of your long career? And if you haven't, is there something that you would really love to talk to him about?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sam Lake:</strong> I would love to meet him. I have never met him, unfortunately. I would love to have a conversation about just creating things, stories, and anything.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>We need to get Sam Lake and David Lynch together and get them maybe in a coffee shop in Twin Peaks.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sam Lake: </strong>Yeah, maybe over a cup of coffee. I would be already so happy about that, just sharing a... Drinking a cup of coffee with him. That would be wonderful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Moving on really quickly to the Max Payne remakes. What's it been like to revisit that series and what's been kind of the most difficult element to translate to 2024?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sam Lake: </strong>I feel that it's still too early to really start opening up what we've been doing there and how we are thinking about it. Obviously, very aware of many people love Max Payne and take it very seriously. There will be plenty of more opportunities later on to talk about it at length.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Looking across the games industry as a whole, you know better than most what a boom and bust industry games can be. Do you think 2025 will be the start of something better? Maybe the start of another boom?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sam Lake:</strong> We all hope that, of course. I mean, these things tend to be this kind of a pendulum swing, so hopefully we are through the worst of the rough times and headed to better times, obviously. Obviously, a lot of really, really talented people have lost their jobs, and yeah, hopefully we are headed to better times.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Talking maybe a little more optimistically, you were talking about what continued to inspire you about games and how it's almost there are always horizons and the medium is always changing, and what innovations in games are sort of the most exciting to you right now?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sam Lake: </strong>I'm really proud about what we achieved with Alan Wake II, and personally, to me, games as a storytelling medium, and from that perspective, an art form. It's been a long journey. I can look back and see logical steps through it all, but more and more I'm looking at it from the perspective of all of these different forms of expression, all of these different mediums and art forms, how games as a very modern medium can hold all of that in them, and how in this interactive form we can use everything that really has come before and give it kind of a new meaning and context. Create, really use all of that to create these layered worlds that the player can then go and experience and explore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I feel that we made kind of a very decisive leap forward when it comes to that, but in no way do I feel that we would have reached the end. Already in the process of creating this latest game, there were a lot of new exciting ideas that came about, but were not possible to explore in the context of Alan Wake II. But, yeah. So yeah, I am excited about that, for sure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I really loved how Alan Wake II incorporated not only live action segments, but musical numbers. And if there was one takeaway that I had from that game, it's that there needs to be more games with musical numbers, and I hope Alan Wake II can pave the way.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sam Lake:</strong> Yeah, I hope so too. That, too, was this kind of a dream that was building up for a long time, for many, many years. I even tried to get a musical sequence into Control. Unfortunately, that was scoped out along the way. But now finally we got to do it. It's a complicated thing, and we iterated on this concept quite a lot through production. It did kind of morph and changed its form a few times until we found the version that's in the final game. But yeah, I mean, overall there is nothing better than if anything we do ends up inspiring in any way somebody else to create something of their own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

What they didn’t expect (and developer Treyarch kept this one quiet!) was the addition of an Easter egg for the hugely popular Nuketown map.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First, some background if you’re unfamiliar with Nuketown. This long-running Multiplayer map is set in a Nevada nuclear test town. Call of Duty games over the years have added new twists to the map, but the layout and flow remains largely the same: perfectly balanced cover that makes for rinse and repeat close quarters six versus six combat. Nuketown has also been home to mannequin-based Easter eggs for years, and Black Ops 6 players were surprised to find the map launched without one in this year's game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On to Black Ops 6 and this newly discovered Easter egg. Players have found that if they shoot all the heads off the mannequins in the map, the screen switches to a Fallout-style ‘signal lost, stand by’ message. The feed then cycles through a few TV channels in the 90s style (Black Ops 6 is set during the events of the Gulf War) before returning the player to the game, complete with retro filter and audio jingle. This Easter egg, then, puts players ‘into’ the TV, as if they’re now on a show in front of a live audience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That live audience is made up of mannequins, who watch from outside the map (shoot them and they’ll flash bang you). Zombie mannequins then start crawling out of the ground to attack the player.

According to Remedy boss Sam Lake, it's still very early days for both.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sam-lake-receives-andrew-yoon-legend-award-new-york-game-awards-alan-wake-control-remedy?utm_source=twitter" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Speaking to IGN</a>, Lake said the team is "very excited," but noted that it's "very, very early days."</p><p>In Hollywood, adaptations of popular brands get <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/video-game-movies-in-the-works/2900-5059/" data-ref-id="2900-5059">announced frequently but not every project makes it to market</a>. Time will tell how the Alan Wake and Control adaptations fare, but Lake said bringing Remedy's games to film and TV has been something the team has been looking into "for a long time."</p><p>"Now, with Annapurna, we have a perfect partner and it feels like a genuine collaboration. Obviously, they bring in their prestige expertise and we bring in our universe and our games, and together we are exploring ideas.

Lake said. "Yeah, no. I mean, as I said, early, early days, and where we are with everything is that we are just exploring the potential in our universe for different projects and ideas. We'll see where it goes."</p><p>Lake also confirmed that he's never met Lynch, but is hopeful he can one day sit down with him over a cup of coffee and discuss art.</p><p>Remedy also has a deal with Annapurna Pictures for Control 2, and that is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/annapurna-interactives-entire-staff-resigns-from-the-company-report/1100-6526463/" data-ref-id="1100-6526463">unaffected by the mass resignations at Annapurna Interactive.</a></p>

And even though all of its many currencies and systems can make for a confusing impression, it didn’t take long for players to figure out metas. And now we can share that information with you! From the three available booster packs from the launch period of the new expansion, we’ve put together a ranking of the top eleven cards.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-guide-how-to-get-cards-1851689908&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-guide-how-to-get-cards-1851689908"><em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> Can Be Deeply Confusing At First, So Here Are The Basics</a></span></p><p>This list will be based specifically on cards from the initial expansion. We won’t be including any limited-time promo cards, although we will give a special shout-out to the Lapras ex card. If you’re interested in what to look out for from <em>Genetic Apex</em>, these are the best cards you can pull.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ca227c54539c92844afe0e9015d583a0" data-recommend-id="image://ca227c54539c92844afe0e9015d583a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Alakazam card, showing the Pokémon focusing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Alakazam card, showing the Pokémon focusing." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ca227c54539c92844afe0e9015d583a0" data-recommend-id="image://ca227c54539c92844afe0e9015d583a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Alakazam card, showing the Pokémon focusing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Under the right circumstances, Alakazam will hit like a truck. His Psychic attack does 60 base damage plus an additional 30 damage for each energy attached to your opponent’s active Pokémon. Considering that most ex Pokémon require three or four energy to use a strong attack, Alakazam can easily dish out 150 or 180 damage.</p><p>The biggest detriment is that he will require quite a bit of work. You’ll need to evolve an Abra and then evolve a Kadabra before you can get this guy on the field. It’s a great idea to set up Alakazam on your bench while using other Pokémon in the active spot. On the other hand, it’s a bad start if you have to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-battles-first-turn-rules-energy-1851693195&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-battles-first-turn-rules-energy-1851693195">go first</a></span> and put an Abra in the active spot.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="34998c0e96def2b970de9d3f27a4d9d2" data-recommend-id="image://34998c0e96def2b970de9d3f27a4d9d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gengar smiles deviously in the Gengar ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gengar smiles deviously in the Gengar ex card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="34998c0e96def2b970de9d3f27a4d9d2" data-recommend-id="image://34998c0e96def2b970de9d3f27a4d9d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gengar smiles deviously in the Gengar ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>One of the more unique utility Pokémon to use is Gengar ex. The 170 HP and 100 damage attack certainly help it stand out, but its best contribution will be the Shadowy Spellbind ability. It’s only active when Gengar ex is in the active spot, but it stops your opponent from using Supporter cards. This is a great way to stop an enemy from powering up their Pokémon or from messing with yours.</p><p>Just like Alakazam, an issue here is that Gengar ex is a stage two Pokémon. You will need to evolve two times to bring it out. There is also an inherent risk as an ex card, since it could cost you two points if it’s knocked out. Charizard ex or even Gyarados can spell trouble against this troublemaker ghost.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="866665fe55e9cae83326e6f7bb65ea2e" data-recommend-id="image://866665fe55e9cae83326e6f7bb65ea2e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Pidgeot card shows the bird grabbing hold of a Magikarp." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Pidgeot card shows the bird grabbing hold of a Magikarp." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="866665fe55e9cae83326e6f7bb65ea2e" data-recommend-id="image://866665fe55e9cae83326e6f7bb65ea2e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Pidgeot card shows the bird grabbing hold of a Magikarp." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Next is another fantastic utility Pokémon. Pidgeot can use its Drive Off ability once per turn to switch out your opponent’s active Pokémon to the bench. It’s like a Sabrina card you can use every turn! Best of all, it can do all this from the bench.</p><p>You might notice the pattern, but Pidgeot can take a while to come out since you’ll need to evolve a Pidgey and Pidgeotto. The only other concern is that its Wing Attack dealing 70 damage is kind of just okay. Thankfully, that is balanced out by a lax two-energy requirement.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3dee6dc1c29c483347240755e2267296" data-recommend-id="image://3dee6dc1c29c483347240755e2267296" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Misty Supporter card shows the eponymous Water trainer confidently posing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Misty Supporter card shows the eponymous Water trainer confidently posing." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3dee6dc1c29c483347240755e2267296" data-recommend-id="image://3dee6dc1c29c483347240755e2267296" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Misty Supporter card shows the eponymous Water trainer confidently posing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>That brings us to the first Supporter card on the list, and naturally, it’s Misty. This must-have for Water-type decks relies entirely on luck. You select one Water Pokémon and then keep flipping coins until you flip tails. The Pokémon will gain one energy for each time the coin flips heads.</p><p>A match’s momentum can easily switch when this card is used. Being able to fully load up a strong Water Pokémon that didn’t have any energy before is a huge game-changer. Conversely, immediately flipping tails will make this the biggest waste of a Supporter card. The sheer impact it can have cements it a spot on this list.</p><p>It also has an unproven, but certainly real bug where every time I use it I’ll only flip one head, but my opponents will get at least three when they use it. They really need to fix that.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0b44846aba4dd77cc0ec25f3d9b87e68" data-recommend-id="image://0b44846aba4dd77cc0ec25f3d9b87e68" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A large blue bird flies out of the borders of the Articuno ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A large blue bird flies out of the borders of the Articuno ex card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0b44846aba4dd77cc0ec25f3d9b87e68" data-recommend-id="image://0b44846aba4dd77cc0ec25f3d9b87e68" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A large blue bird flies out of the borders of the Articuno ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Speaking of strong Water-types, you can’t mention the best without including Articuno ex. A basic ex Pokémon has plenty of potential and this Legendary easily proves that. Its Blizzard attack deals 80 damage but also has the benefit of inflicting 10 damage to your opponent’s benched Pokémon. </p><p>Aside from the risk of your opponent gaining two points if it’s knocked out, the only other problem is that it takes three energy to use Blizzard. Articuno ex can make up for that with a 40-damage Ice Wing attack that only requires two energy.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="19661a6ed0e69238211d497857c1f460" data-recommend-id="image://19661a6ed0e69238211d497857c1f460" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The yellow electric mouse jumps out of the Pikachu ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The yellow electric mouse jumps out of the Pikachu ex card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="19661a6ed0e69238211d497857c1f460" data-recommend-id="image://19661a6ed0e69238211d497857c1f460" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The yellow electric mouse jumps out of the Pikachu ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The face of the brand earns a spot here as well. Pikachu ex has access to the powerful Circle Circuit attack, which does 30 damage for every Lightning-type Pokémon on your bench. A full bench can output 90 damage as long as they’re all the correct type.</p><p>There isn’t much too much to complain about here. Circle Circuit can deal a lot of damage for just two energy. What prevents this from landing higher is that it’s entirely dependent on your bench, and 120 HP isn’t great for an ex card that can’t promise consistent damage.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="86808c5c23a97d5bcbf6ba64d037202a" data-recommend-id="image://86808c5c23a97d5bcbf6ba64d037202a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Professor Oak waves in the Professor’s Research card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Professor Oak waves in the Professor’s Research card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="86808c5c23a97d5bcbf6ba64d037202a" data-recommend-id="image://86808c5c23a97d5bcbf6ba64d037202a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Professor Oak waves in the Professor’s Research card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Professor’s Research might be on the most basic cards, but it’s invaluable no matter the deck. Playing it allows you to draw two cards to add to your hand. These 20-card decks aren’t big by any means, but there are still times when you’re not drawing what you need. This has a great chance of giving you the right card(s) or at least milling out the deck to get them sooner.</p><p>I can’t imagine putting together any deck without including this in there. Whether you play it at the beginning of a match to give yourself an advantage or use it in the climactic final turns, the card is great. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6503029f5ba1db3b15a0f4a1f8a648c3" data-recommend-id="image://6503029f5ba1db3b15a0f4a1f8a648c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Charizard ex card shows the Pokémon posing with their wings outstretched." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Charizard ex card shows the Pokémon posing with their wings outstretched." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6503029f5ba1db3b15a0f4a1f8a648c3" data-recommend-id="image://6503029f5ba1db3b15a0f4a1f8a648c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Charizard ex card shows the Pokémon posing with their wings outstretched." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Everyone’s favorite dragon-but-not-a-dragon-type creates a big presence when played on the field. Charizard ex has a tanky 180 HP and both a three-energy Slash attack and a four-energy Crimson Storm. The former deals a modest 60 damage while the latter inflicts a painful 200 that can beat anything.</p><p>This Fire-type isn’t without its setbacks. Crimson Storm’s four energy requirement is a lot to build up to and it additionally discards two Fire energy to use it. The giant pool of HP and massive damage make this a card still worth playing.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bb19415700b667f15d085f4c41645680" data-recommend-id="image://bb19415700b667f15d085f4c41645680" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sabrina poses with her arm outstretched in her Supporter card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sabrina poses with her arm outstretched in her Supporter card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bb19415700b667f15d085f4c41645680" data-recommend-id="image://bb19415700b667f15d085f4c41645680" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sabrina poses with her arm outstretched in her Supporter card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Sabrina is undoubtedly the best Supporter card. Playing this will switch out your Opponent’s active Pokémon with one of their choosing from their bench. This is a great way to force them to bench a tough ex card or to bring out a weak Pokémon you know you can beat in one turn.</p><p>Some might argue that Pidgeot can be a more consistent way to use such an effect, but Sabrina requires no setup in return. Unless your opponent has a stacked bench, using this is a great way to disrupt their strategy.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="38c78ff80799a62cf47dfe5d5519858b" data-recommend-id="image://38c78ff80799a62cf47dfe5d5519858b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The legendary Pokémon leans out in the Mewtwo ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The legendary Pokémon leans out in the Mewtwo ex card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="38c78ff80799a62cf47dfe5d5519858b" data-recommend-id="image://38c78ff80799a62cf47dfe5d5519858b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The legendary Pokémon leans out in the Mewtwo ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Mewtwo is most people’s favorite legendary from the Kanto region, and for good reason. It looks cool and has an awesome movie that can make anyone cry and leave them with deep pondering thoughts. Mewtwo ex is just as beloved here thanks to it being a basic card that can inflict 150 damage with its Psydrive attack. For just two energy, it can also inflict 50 damage using a Psychic Sphere attack.</p><p>Similar to Charizard ex, Mewtwo ex’s strongest attack has the detrimental effect of discarding two Psychic energy to use. That can make Psydrive a less consistent attack to pull off. Still, the 150 damage is great for a Basic Pokémon. As you’ve probably seen, pairing him with a Gardevoir can do wonders thanks to its ability to attach one Psychic energy to the Active Spot card each turn.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6e3f5a3fa7f6043f7d0d8441e1c16298" data-recommend-id="image://6e3f5a3fa7f6043f7d0d8441e1c16298" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A large ten-pointed star Pokémon spins in the Starmie ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A large ten-pointed star Pokémon spins in the Starmie ex card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6e3f5a3fa7f6043f7d0d8441e1c16298" data-recommend-id="image://6e3f5a3fa7f6043f7d0d8441e1c16298" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A large ten-pointed star Pokémon spins in the Starmie ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Sitting at the top of this list isn’t a Legendary or something that requires a ton of energy. Starmie ex is a low-risk card that can deal big damage fast, making it a great inclusion for a Water-based deck. Its Hydro Splash attack only needs two energy to deal 90 damage. Another fantastic benefit it has is a zero retreat cost, meaning you can easily swap it out if you’re worried it might get knocked out soon.</p><p>The only barrier with Starmie ex is that you need to evolve a Staryu for it. That isn’t that big of an issue in the grand scheme of things. Hydro Splash is sure to knock out if not take a big chunk from most Pokémon you pit it against. At the same time, 130 HP will help it survive against most attacks thrown at it. Every Water-based deck will be elevated by including or basing itself around a Starmie ex card.</p><hr><p>There is no telling how the metas might change, but for now, these are the best cards by far.

This time around, work-for-hire spriggan Van Arkride is tasked with investigating murders  at the hands of a mysterious red monster in the City of Edith. Despite its familiarity, the setup nevertheless sets the stage for some notable change-ups in combat, returning character cameos, and a narrative time-loop mechanic.</p><p>Let’s take them in order, starting with combat. Players will still largely be working with the same structure and toolset they’re accustomed to, but <em>Daybreak II</em>’s real-time, action-oriented field combat has more options this time around, with party members able to wield Quick Arts outside of  conventional turn-based combat. Once things do switch into turn-based encounters, a new Recast timer prohibits players from spamming S-Crafts back-to-back, a strategy that dominated in the first game.</p><p>  <em>Daybreak II </em>also features a larger cast. There are more playable characters and lots of cameos. The former assassin duo from <em>Trails Into Reverie</em>, Swin and Nadia, will play big roles in the game. Others, like the martial artist Zin Vathek who appeared as far back in the series as <em>Trails in the Sky, </em>will also make appearances, fighting alongside your party for a time when the story deems it appropriate. The callbacks will be a boon for longtime <em>Trails</em> fans but will also potentially make <em>Daybreak II</em> harder to parse than the first game, which in many ways served as the most ideal jumping-on point for newcomers the series has had in years. </p><p>Perhaps most unique to <em>Daybreak II</em> is a time-loop system in which a magic artifact revives the team when they die and lets them pursue an alternate course of action to progress their journey instead. It sounds like this mechanic, which includes a menu screen showing branching story paths, will be purely a narrative device rather than one that impacts gameplay. You’ll still be pursuing every avenue in a somewhat linear fashion, and while time technically resets, your earned XP and treasure chest rewards remain intact between loops. </p><p>But much of the bread and butter of a <em>Trails </em>game is everything you’re doing in-between new dungeons and major story beats. <em>Daybreak II</em>’s European-inspired urban backdrop includes food carts you can buy stuff from and consume to get temporary party buffs, as well as to increase your gourmet rank to unlock new and better foodie benefits. Fishing, cards, cyberhacking, and other minigames <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/trails-through-daybreak-ii-brings-improved-combat-more-perspectives-and-fishing&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/trails-through-daybreak-ii-brings-improved-combat-more-perspectives-and-fishing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have also been confirmed</a></span>. And outside of main quests and character side stories, there’s  an optional endless dungeon to grind to your heart’s content. </p><p>Even if <em>Daybreak II </em>seems like mid-arc filler, NIS America rep Alan Costa said its events will be important for later games, including a direct sequel that’s already out in Japan called <em>The Legend of Heroes: Kai no Kiseki</em>. NIS also localizes Nihon Falcom’s other big RPG franchise, <em>Ys</em>, the tenth entry of which just arrived in the West back in September. Costa <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/nis-america-says-trails-and-ys-rpg-fans-wont-have-to-wait-so-long-for-future-english-releases-we-want-to-bring-that-timeline-down/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/nis-america-says-trails-and-ys-rpg-fans-wont-have-to-wait-so-long-for-future-english-releases-we-want-to-bring-that-timeline-down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has said</a></span> NIS America is trying to cut down on the time it takes to bring the games overseas without cutting corners or hurting the quality of the translations.</p><p>That doesn’t necessarily mean using AI, however. While Nihon Falcom President Kondo Toshihiro <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20241009051/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20241009051/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">appeared bullish</a></span> on the prospects of using improving AI translation capabilities to speed up development and close the gap in global release times for <em>Trails</em> and <em>Ys</em> games, NIS America, which localizes the games for English, isn’t using any AI translation in its pipeline at the moment. </p><p>“We don’t use AI for any forward-facing translations inside of our games,” Costa told <em>Kotaku</em> during the recent preview event. “Anything that Falcom decides to do on their end, obviously we have no insight or oversight or say into that. I don’t believe they used any AI  in the creation of their script for this game, but we didn’t in our use in localizing the title. So all of this is warts and all—hopefully we don’t have too many—this is all done by people.”</p><p>Though <em>Trails Through Daybreak III</em> doesn’t yet have a release date in the U.S., the second game isn’t the only <em>Trials</em> release next year. A remake of the first game in the series, <em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky the 1st</em>, is also due out in 2025 on Switch. In addition to updating the 2006 game, it will also finally provide a clear starting point for new players on modern platforms. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Whoever comes next will have a tough act to follow, as Shadow’s tease at the end of <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2 </em>was a huge moment for the live-action movies that had fans popping off in the theater. Who do we think is most likely to be burdened with this heavy responsibility? Will it be the next villain, or could it be a new ally for Sonic and his friends? I rounded up characters I think have an actual shot—even a very small one— at showing up at some point in <em>Sonic 3</em>, and am ranking them based on how likely I think they are to be the featured reveal in the big post-credits stinger.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="42be7cd9db584c899e8371e3f2392313" data-recommend-id="image://42be7cd9db584c899e8371e3f2392313" data-format="jpg" data-width="757" data-height="657" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Big waving." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A render of Big waving." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="42be7cd9db584c899e8371e3f2392313" data-recommend-id="image://42be7cd9db584c899e8371e3f2392313" data-format="jpg" data-width="757" data-height="657" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Big waving." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Look, it would be a good bit. Big the Cat, the lovable oaf who debuted in <em>Sonic Adventure</em>, is beloved by fans despite mostly being a joke character in recent years. While he’s not often a playable fixture in the series, Big has been surprisingly present in several big games, to the point where I feel like he will probably show up somewhere down the line if the <em>Sonic </em>live-action universe continues to draw in ticket sales. I can already envision a scene in which Big is running around, chasing his slippery sidekick Froggy through the wreckage of whatever destruction Shadow creates in <em>Sonic 3</em>. Will it actually happen? No chance. That’s why Big is kicking off this list as the least likely hero to show up in <em>Sonic 3</em>.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="988dc5e5b9de95ffcef3f7f5c75c21ab" data-recommend-id="image://988dc5e5b9de95ffcef3f7f5c75c21ab" data-format="jpg" data-width="528" data-height="516" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Renders of Espio, Charmy, and Vector." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Renders of Espio, Charmy, and Vector." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="988dc5e5b9de95ffcef3f7f5c75c21ab" data-recommend-id="image://988dc5e5b9de95ffcef3f7f5c75c21ab" data-format="jpg" data-width="528" data-height="516" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Renders of Espio, Charmy, and Vector." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Did you know the detective agency trio of Vector the Crocodile, Espio the Chameleon, and Charmy Bee already exists in the live-action <em>Sonic </em>universe?

Even so, since we know these three sleuths are in this continuity, it seems likely they’ll make an appearance somewhere down the line. However, with so many big names in the <em>Sonic </em>franchise still unaccounted for, I have a hard time seeing them setting up the next film.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="50d4d34966ad6b2408eb7e5f6a9ded86" data-recommend-id="image://50d4d34966ad6b2408eb7e5f6a9ded86" data-format="jpg" data-width="2615" data-height="1470" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Chaos" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A render of Chaos" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="50d4d34966ad6b2408eb7e5f6a9ded86" data-recommend-id="image://50d4d34966ad6b2408eb7e5f6a9ded86" data-format="jpg" data-width="2615" data-height="1470" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Chaos" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I think there’s a strong possibility that Chaos, the water-like mutant antagonist of the original <em>Sonic Adventure</em>, is the villain in a future <em>Sonic </em>movie. Whether that’s <em>Sonic 4</em> or another movie down the line, Chaos is the kind of world-ending threat that these movies seem to be leading toward as they escalate and raise the stakes each time. However, I do think these movies need a marketable face to tease what’s next, and that’s why Tails and Shadow’s appearances at the end of the first two movies made sense. They were both well-known characters that you could see facilitating merchandise like figures and plushies. Chaos is exciting to long-time <em>Sonic </em>fans and I would love to see him flood a city and Sonic make some joke about how the team is “gonna need a bigger boat,” but as a post-credits stinger? There are probably more likely candidates.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d4f91fab398c13cb3735182f722011fe" data-recommend-id="image://d4f91fab398c13cb3735182f722011fe" data-format="jpg" data-width="1195" data-height="669" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Omega" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A render of Omega" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d4f91fab398c13cb3735182f722011fe" data-recommend-id="image://d4f91fab398c13cb3735182f722011fe" data-format="jpg" data-width="1195" data-height="669" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Omega" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Okay, hear me out. E-123 Omega is a popular character as the third member of Shadow’s Team Dark, but he certainly wouldn’t make for a big, crowd-pleasing post-credits scene on his own.

If you’ve played <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, you know how that story ends for Shadow: he falls to Earth from space, is presumed dead, and then is found by Eggman for his own experiments. If Shadow meets a similar fate at the end of <em>Sonic 3</em>, a robot is going to probably have to find him, right? Who better than his future teammate?</p><p>Come on, Paramount. Give me this.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ef50c42c029dc51679a5cbb7ab41e3dd" data-recommend-id="image://ef50c42c029dc51679a5cbb7ab41e3dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="602" data-height="338" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Silver" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A render of Silver" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ef50c42c029dc51679a5cbb7ab41e3dd" data-recommend-id="image://ef50c42c029dc51679a5cbb7ab41e3dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="602" data-height="338" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Silver" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p> Now we’re moving away from wishful thinking and into “actually possible” territory. Silver the Hedgehog, the time-traveling telekinetic hero from the future, seems like a shoo-in for a future <em>Sonic</em> live-action movie. If he does show up, I can’t imagine him not being accompanied by Blaze the Cat, his companion from the future in his debut in <em>Sonic ‘06 </em>(though we’ll ignore the way Sega retconned her origins and decided she’s from another dimension, because we don’t need to make <em>Sonic</em> a multiverse story this early into the cinematic universe). </p><figure id="" data-id="f2a45d21bcd2c3ce46df620d37a14a05" data-recommend-id="image://f2a45d21bcd2c3ce46df620d37a14a05" data-format="jpg" data-width="548" data-height="306" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Blaze" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A render of Blaze" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f2a45d21bcd2c3ce46df620d37a14a05" data-recommend-id="image://f2a45d21bcd2c3ce46df620d37a14a05" data-format="jpg" data-width="548" data-height="306" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Blaze" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I expect this pair to show up in the near future because some of the groundwork has already been laid. One of the more baffling parts of the <em>Knuckles </em>series <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/knuckles-paramount-sonic-06-iblis-flames-of-disaster-1851427520&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/knuckles-paramount-sonic-06-iblis-flames-of-disaster-1851427520">featured a reference to Iblis</a></span>, a major villain in <em>Sonic ‘06</em> and a central figure in the two’s story. The show made some embellishments to Iblis’ nature, so the next movie probably won’t be a 1:1 recreation of <em>Sonic ‘06</em>, but with both Iblis and Shadow joining the live-action universe this year, Paramount has a lot of the pieces in place to make the next movie a retelling of one of the more controversial games in <em>Sonic</em>’s portfolio. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5cfe400e4114b361c9f5ca05dcdd2380" data-recommend-id="image://5cfe400e4114b361c9f5ca05dcdd2380" data-format="jpg" data-width="842" data-height="473" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Rouge." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A render of Rouge." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5cfe400e4114b361c9f5ca05dcdd2380" data-recommend-id="image://5cfe400e4114b361c9f5ca05dcdd2380" data-format="jpg" data-width="842" data-height="473" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Rouge." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I can’t believe we haven’t seen Rouge the Bat in the live-action <em>Sonic </em>universe yet. Unless Paramount is deliberately hiding her in all the trailers and promotional materials, it doesn’t seem like she’ll be making an appearance in <em>Sonic 3 </em>proper despite it being a loose adaptation of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, which featured the debut of the treasure-hunting spy. I was hopeful she would show up in the <em>Knuckles </em>show since she’s considered the titular Echidna’s rival, but again, that show barely had time for one CG character, much less two. So here we are, with no sign of the leader of Team Dark even after a show and a movie that would have been easy entry points. </p><p>If Rouge isn’t secretly in <em>Sonic 3</em>, I could see her debut in the live-action universe being much like the beginning of Team Dark’s story in <em>Sonic Heroes</em>. She could happen upon Shadow in stasis while looking for treasure in Eggman’s base, then one thing leads to another and the team is formed. Typing that out, I realize it seems like a stronger basis for the opening of the reported Shadow spin-off, but I do think Rouge joining the cinematic universe is a matter of when, not if. In recent games and shows like <em>Sonic Dream Team </em>and <em>Sonic Prime</em>, Rouge has been treated as a friend of Sonic, rather than being more closely tied to Shadow as she has been in most other appearances, so there’s a chance the <em>Sonic </em>movies go that route. That would be incredibly disappointing to me as a Team Dark stan, though, especially after Sega brought the band back together this year in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-levels-powers-1851676560&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-levels-powers-1851676560"><em>Shadow Generations</em></a></span>.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="48ab438853dcf84060303a1c895b08db" data-recommend-id="image://48ab438853dcf84060303a1c895b08db" data-format="jpg" data-width="713" data-height="398" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Amy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A render of Amy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="48ab438853dcf84060303a1c895b08db" data-recommend-id="image://48ab438853dcf84060303a1c895b08db" data-format="jpg" data-width="713" data-height="398" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Amy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Unlike Tails and Shadow, I don’t see Amy Rose as the kind of character who can kickstart the narrative of a sequel on her own. She’d probably need to be paired with some other character or force in a post-credit scene, but the <em>Sonic </em>movies desperately need her after being a boy’s club for three movies. Amy is often treated as secondary to the main trio of Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, but she’s ultimately a core part of the heroes’ dynamic and it’s about time she showed up. Paramount has omitted her for so long that I’m not sure how she’ll fit into this storyline, but someone over there needs to figure it out, and sooner rather than later. </p><figure id="" data-id="51cefc75231483be9e6daa86d36d4088" data-recommend-id="image://51cefc75231483be9e6daa86d36d4088" data-format="jpg" data-width="964" data-height="544" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Cream" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A render of Cream" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="51cefc75231483be9e6daa86d36d4088" data-recommend-id="image://51cefc75231483be9e6daa86d36d4088" data-format="jpg" data-width="964" data-height="544" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Cream" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If they wanted to get real bold, I could see Cream the Rabbit showing up alongside Amy, making the whole cast of anthropomorphic characters more well-rounded. Either way, I don’t see a version of events in which she shows up without Amy also being there, given the two are considered a pair not unlike Sonic and Tails. It wouldn’t be my ideal choice, but I can also see Paramount trying to package Amy, Cream, and Rouge as a girl-centric group in a call-back to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/mizuhano/status/989669646730067968&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/mizuhano/status/989669646730067968" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scrapped <em>Sonic Heroes</em> team</a></span> that would have featured the three of them working together. I’d rather Paramount find a way to keep Rouge affiliated with Shadow, though. In any case, the <em>Sonic </em>movies need to add in Amy and I’m surprised they haven’t already.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0f020bafa74708c392582569469f8965" data-recommend-id="image://0f020bafa74708c392582569469f8965" data-format="jpg" data-width="520" data-height="290" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0f020bafa74708c392582569469f8965" data-recommend-id="image://0f020bafa74708c392582569469f8965" data-format="jpg" data-width="520" data-height="290" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> Fans have been speculating that Metal Sonic, the robotic recreation of the blue blur, will be the villain of the fourth installment, or maybe even a surprise antagonist in the third <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-3-trailer-robotnik-metal-quill-theory-ending-1851634404&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-3-trailer-robotnik-metal-quill-theory-ending-1851634404">based on a scene in the movie’s first trailer</a></span>. I do worry that setting up Metal Sonic as the next movie’s big bad could feel a little samey after Sonic facing an “evil” mirror image of himself in Shadow throughout <em>Sonic 3</em>, but it’s certainly an easier concept to explain in a family film than something like Iblis or Chaos. I hope Paramount swings for the fences and introduces something different in the next movie, but given that there’s already reason to believe Doctor Robotnik might be piecing Metal Sonic together, I fully expect the robot to make his debut in <em>Sonic 3</em>, whether that’s as an eleventh-hour villain or in a post-credits scene. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While the two games feature different starter Pokemon--either Pikachu or Eevee--and a handful of exclusive catchable critters, they're otherwise identical experiences, so if one sells out, the other will make a fine replacement.</p><p>Rounding out the Early Black Friday deals is a big price cut on <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPokemon-Shining-Pearl-Nintendo-Switch%2F567646392%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsave-on-nintendo-switch-pokemon-games-with-these-early-black-friday-deals%2F1100-6527761%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pokemon Shining Pearl</a>, which is down to $38 (was $60) at Walmart. This is another remake, this time of the Nintendo DS game Pokemon Pearl. Unlike the Let's Go remakes, Shining Pearl sticks much closer to the gameplay of the original version, instead simply updating the visuals and making small tweaks to the experience, rather than shaking things up with new content or game mechanics.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/m4-mac-mini-upgrade-memory-storage-nand-flash<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the smartest moves Apple ever pulled, up there with the iPhone itself, was investing in Apple silicon. Starting with 2020’s M1 onward, Apple’s SoC’s (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">System on Chip</a>) have been the best designed out there. The MacBook Air absolutely screams and has a battery that doesn’t quit. The latest M4 Mac mini redesign is a staggering performance jump and thus a fantastic deal.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>It is, indeed, a very small computer as YouTuber Marques Brownlee was quick to point out in his walkthrough of the M4 Mac mini. Credit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mkbhd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marques Brownlee</a></figcaption></figure><p>Or rather, it would be, if not for one perennial issue – the storage in the majority of Apple’s products is not user upgradable and (mostly) soldered directly on the board, although the M4 Mac mini differs slightly. You’re stuck with whatever internal hard drive space you start off with. The pricing is also borderline criminal. But that has not and will not stop people from upgrading the SSDs on MacBook Airs and Mac minis by painfully desoldering the NAND chips and installing new ones themselves, as YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dosdude1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DosDude1</a> has shown.</p><p><strong>It’s iPhones All The Way Down</strong></p><p>Apple, as a general rule, has rarely been open with its hardware or software. On some level, doing things this way makes sense. When your biggest success is unquestionably the iPhone, you eventually just have to design everything that way.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="M1 Mac Mini Soldered SSD Upgrade" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X7C_hdJsY4Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>The first major upgrade video by dosdude1</figcaption></figure></div><p>“Historically, ALL Apple SoCs since the original iPhone (which is from a time before Apple even designed their own SoCs) have been designed in this way,” Collin Mistr, who goes by dosdude1, told me when I asked about how Apple designs their products, “where the RAM is soldered to the package via a ‘POP’ (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_on_a_package" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">package-on-package</a>) design, and using their own implementation for storage with a raw connection from the SoC to the NAND.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="UPGRADING an M1 Mac mini SSD from 256gb to 2TB!!" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/apEKAY11NQs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>dosdude1's first Mac upgrade got a bump in part because his video was in collaboration with YouTuber Luke Miani.</figcaption></figure></div><p>In Apple’s computers, the flash memory controller is integrated into the SoC, as opposed to a standard NVMe drive you’d buy from a MicroCenter where the controller is on the drive itself. “Such a design choice (soldered storage) is considered normal for mobile devices, though not as much so for computers,” Collin told me. “So to me it is simply implemented this way because, well, that’s literally just how it’s always been done with this system design.”</p><p>If you have ever soldered or desoldered anything, watching Collin’s upgrade videos can be nerve wracking, deeply comforting or somehow both. Like some of the best YouTubers, he exists mainly as a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/so-your-kid-wants-to-be-a-twitch-streamer-three-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">soothing voice and a pair of hands</a>. Though he works on all sorts of devices such as older Mac hardware, the Steam Deck and the Lenovo Go, his videos blew up a year ago with one where he upgraded the storage on an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7C_hdJsY4Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">M1 Mac mini</a>.</p><figure><figcaption>Ahhhhhhhh. Credit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=shared&amp;v=Xrg7nPG6_UU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dosdude1</a></figcaption></figure><p>Collin’s upgrade videos have a surgical quality to them. He first removes the existing NAND from the board using a hot air gun to loosen the solder. Any underfill there is potentially scraped away using a specialty tool. After heating and gentle prying, the chip pops up. He then goes through the process of manually removing and cleaning the board. Fresh solder is reapplied to the PCB using flux, a common chemical that improves the flow of solder. In the case of his M1 MacBook Air video specifically, only one of potentially two NANDs is populated while the other is barren. To upgrade this he applies fresh solder to the pads, takes tiny 0201 resistors from a donor PCB and individually populates them over on the other board. I have done this with much larger resistors fairly recently and can tell you that it is a huge pain in the ass that sucks to do.</p><figure><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=shared&amp;v=Xrg7nPG6_UU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><figcaption>Solder paste and a stencil in the exact shape of the NAND is used to "reball" it. Credit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=shared&amp;v=Xrg7nPG6_UU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dosdude1</a></figcaption></figure><p>From there, Collin moves on to the “reballing” of the fresh, high capacity, totally blank NAND flash. Each NAND is connected via a series of tiny soldered connections in a grid pattern. Solder paste (as opposed to solder wire) is applied to the back of the chip using a stencil attached with kapton tape, and then hot air and slight pressure are applied to melt the balls evenly. Another round of flux and hot air is applied to the NAND modules to make sure the balls are uniform. From there, more flux is applied to the PCB, the freshly balled chips are aligned to that grid as accurately as possible, and hot air is applied to melt the solder exactly where it should be. The freshly upgraded Mac is then put into <a href="https://theapplewiki.com/wiki/DFU_Mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DFU mode</a> and connected to a host PC which will (hopefully) reinstall MacOS. See? Easy.</p><p>Collin says he got his start the way many tinkerers do: getting inexpensive hardware with faulty boards from eBay to learn various diagnostic techniques and build up his toolset. By tinkering, he got good at reverse engineering Mac repair hacks and modifications.&nbsp;</p><p>“I think the earliest mod I attempted was upgrading PowerPC Mac CPUs, doing things like upgrading PowerPC G3-based systems to G4 CPUs,” he says. In addition to his popular Mac upgrade videos, he’s also upgraded the soldered RAM modules of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmobr6YEhWE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Deck</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHkgwhG_eEU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lenovo Legion Go</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>One of the best Macs ever</strong></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="UPGRADING a Brand NEW M4 Mac mini" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cJPXLE9uPr8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Collin's latest video: upgrading the M4 Mac mini. </figcaption></figure></div><p>This brings us back to the M4 Mac mini. It quickly caught the attention of journalists and YouTubers alike for two ultimately meaningless and novel choices: shrinking down the device to be in line with every other mini PC that comes out of China and putting the power button on the bottom in a way that is both annoying and very much Apple. But the really important thing is that it’s a fantastic computer. Ars Technica called it “<a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/11/review-m4-and-m4-pro-mac-minis-are-probably-apples-best-mac-minis-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple’s best Mac mini’s ever.”</a>&nbsp; This is to say nothing of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1gltzey/quick_look_at_apples_m4_pro_and_m4_max_compute/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">M4 Pro and M4 Max, </a>which are wiping the floor with the competition in benchmarks. It is one of the most power-efficient computers ever made, and at idle it consumes 3-4 watts of power, <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/m4-mac-minis-efficiency-incredible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roughly about the same as a Raspberry Pi</a>, according to homelab expert <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JeffGeerling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeff Geerling</a>. The Mac mini has gone from being the unassuming workhorse in Apple’s lineup to possibly one of the best computers it makes.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Mac mini M4 vs M4 Pro - Unboxing, Comparison, Benchmarks &amp; Review!" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0_hNqgSEsQo?start=561&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>A breakdown of the M4 Mac mini and M4 Pro. </figcaption></figure></div><p>The base model M4 Mac mini comes with 16 GB of RAM for $599, but the base model SSD remains borderline unusable 256 GB. That is not a functional amount of storage in 2024. Want to upgrade to 512 GB or 1 TB? Unless you plan on living off of external drives, those are $200 and $400 dollar price hikes respectively. In an age where you can pick up a 1 TB M.2 drive for $60 ($100 if you want it to go real fast) those prices are borderline criminal.&nbsp;</p><p>The M4 Mac mini differs from the previous Mac mini in that the NAND flash is physically removable without desoldering. Like the Mac Studio before it, the NAND flash is stored on a proprietary module that is removable. This does not, however, mean you can just throw any SSD in. In order to upgrade the chip you still need to go through the same painful steps as before.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Mac Studio Storage Upgrade - Made EASY with Custom Parts" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HDFCurB3-0Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Collin working on a Mac Studio, which has a dedicated PCB for the NAND flash like the M4 Mac mini. </figcaption></figure></div><p>“The only difference is Apple physically moved the NANDs onto a removable module instead of soldering them directly to the board,” Collin told me. When performing upgrades “it must be treated as though it is soldered storage.”&nbsp;</p><p>Despite this, the new Mac mini design has much more potential for upgradability. In his previous video about the similar Mac Studio, Collin used a custom, reverse engineered PCB made by his friend Giles at <a href="https://www.polysoft.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polysoft Services</a> (that module is still in the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/polysoftservices/studio-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kickstarter phase</a> as of me writing this) “It is now feasible to sell those with NANDs installed to users, allowing them to perform their own upgrades.”</p><p><strong>The Future Is User-Serviceable</strong></p><p>One of the richest companies in the world probably isn’t soliciting feedback on how to run a business, although I am going to provide it anyway. With Apple Silicon, the MacBook Air and mini became so good that even I had to begrudgingly admit their utility, and the M4 Mac mini’s NAND being semi-removable is a step in the right direction. But this storage racket has to stop. What’s more, with various <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/94127/apples-parts-pairing-rollback-doesnt-go-far-enough" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Right to Repair laws passing</a>, Apple is finally caving <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/97100/apple-finally-promises-to-enable-third-party-parts-mostly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a little bit on the issue of parts pairing</a> for iPhones and iPads, although its implementation has been <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/100266/the-end-of-parts-pairing-almost" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">buggy at best</a>.&nbsp; “[Parts pairing] is completely unnecessary, has no benefit, and serves only to prevent users from easily swapping parts,” Collin told me.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless of what Apple offers in the future, willingly or via legislation, the door has already been opened. You can’t expect people not to tinker and repair their technology and to show others how to do it, like Collin has. The future is user-serviceable whether Apple likes it or not.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As one of the first tasks of your adventure, you’ll need to make your way over to Patty’s Party Planning Place to recruit three companions. Whether you choose to take along the premade characters or create your own allies, you’ll see that each character can assume one of eight classes. With no frame of reference for how each class performs, how on earth are you supposed to choose?</p><p>Fortunately, you should know that your choices here aren’t necessarily permanent. <strong><em>Dragon Quest III</em> will eventually let you change each of your companions’ classes later on in your adventure, so your goal here is to pick the classes that will help you early on the most</strong>. In some cases, this may mean taking classes that start strong out the gate. In other cases, you may want to prioritize classes that learn valuable utility skills that the character’s second class can inherit down the line. Either way, you have some flexibility with your picks here.</p><p>To help you decide which classes will serve you best in <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em>, we’ve assembled a tier list that ranks their early game benefits from best to worst. Note that <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em> does feature new mechanics and class changes that change how jobs perform relative to previous versions of the game, so longtime fans can’t necessarily rely on their preexisting knowledge of the game. Also, <strong>please note that this is strictly a tier list of which classes to start with, not each class’s overall performance throughout the game</strong>. Some picks function much better when used as mid-game class changes, and one of the best classes in the game isn’t even available at the start!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bb5611116313570c9f74bd03440271eb" data-recommend-id="image://bb5611116313570c9f74bd03440271eb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.

It can inflict decent physical damage, especially since it can equip strong whips that damage entire groups of enemies. Additionally, Monster Tamer learns healing abilities in the form of <strong>Emergency Groom</strong> and <strong>Soothing Song</strong>, which offer single-target and party-wide healing respectively. Not only is this the only source of party-wide healing in the early game of <em>Dragon Quest III</em>, these also work in instances where magic is blocked since they are classified as Abilities. Monster Wrangler doesn’t scale as a healer into the later game, but it fills a powerful niche early on.</p><p>That said, <strong>it’s the new collectible monsters that elevates Monster Wrangler from good to great.</strong> As you explore the world, you’ll find friendly monsters that you can typically recruit by either using the correct item or skill to get them to talk to you. Not only do Monster Wranglers let you automatically catch monsters without fulfilling these prerequisites, collecting a large roster will grant Monster Wranglers new skills as well. This critically includes <strong>Monster Pile-On</strong>, a powerful attack that scales with the total number of monsters you’ve collected. As long as you explore and use the Monster Wrangler’s <strong>Animal Instinct</strong> Ability to track down recruitable monsters, you can easily learn this skill by the time you can change class.</p><p>If you plan to speedrun the game and don’t want to track down monsters, then Monster Wrangler admittedly won’t impress as much. Otherwise, this class covers so many early-game niches and learns such strong Abilities that it will find use in any party you stick it in.</p><h3 id="h594"><a id=""></a><strong>Mage</strong></h3><figure id="" data-id="efa6256e3359251a0234039102710656" data-recommend-id="image://efa6256e3359251a0234039102710656" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.

A menu displays the Mage character class, which is seen wearing a green robe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Mages have always been good in <em>Dragon Quest III</em> thanks to their access to powerful magic attacks. However, <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D</em> gives all magic users an inadvertent buff, since all level-ups will fully restore that character’s HP and MP. This means Mages can use their most powerful magic with only the slightest restraint in dungeons, since they’ll usually receive full restoration before their MP runs dry. In other words, Mage is easily a top DPS pick and one of the best damage dealers to start out with in <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D</em></p><p>Even without this boon, Mage would still be a good starting class. It excels at damaging groups of enemies, which you’ll be dealing with way more than single targets. It’s also a great candidate to turn into the mighty Sage class thanks to its naturally high Wisdom and MP stats (see the Gadabout description later on). Mages aren’t quite as useful if you change them to any class that isn’t a magic user, but overall this is an obvious class to pick.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="45ee390148f929f56bf7ab1878ffb3df" data-recommend-id="image://45ee390148f929f56bf7ab1878ffb3df" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.

You can technically cover your healing bases by using your main character and either healing items or the Monster Tamer until you eventually get a Sage in your party. Regardless, if you’re wondering who your third party member should be, I’d suggest “have a little Priest.”</p><p>Starting with a Priest has two huge perks. First, a dedicated healer frees up the rest of your party from healing duty, including your incredibly powerful protagonist. Second, a Priest learns so many helpful support skills in the early game that it’ll make virtually any class it later changes to better. Even a Fighter can function like a <em>Final Fantasy</em>-style Paladin when it can remove a slew of status resistances and provide some backup healing when the chips are down.</p><p>Oh, and Priests can learn some basic attack magic in the form of <strong>Woosh</strong> and <strong>Swoosh</strong>, which it can easily use thanks to the aforementioned full heals on leveling up.</p><p>Do keep in mind that if you insist on using both a Mage and a Priest, you may struggle in instances where magic is sealed or you need to use physical attacks. Still, if you’d like to prioritize survival, definitely pick a Priest starting out.</p><h3 id="h596"><a id=""></a><strong>Martial Artist</strong></h3><figure id="" data-id="a381683b5db76a7044ee989a5dc60c3e" data-recommend-id="image://a381683b5db76a7044ee989a5dc60c3e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.

A menu displays the Martial Artist character class, which is seen wearing a green Gi." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Martial Artist’s weaknesses are actually strengths when it comes to the early game of <em>Dragon Quest III</em>. On one hand, they’re extremely picky with equipment, and they’re literally better off fighting bare-handed in the early game until you can find claws for them to use. On the other hand, this means you don’t need to invest a lot of gold into dressing them and you can focus on the rest of your party without grinding. Additionally, the Martial Artist only learns situationally useful skills in the early game. But despite that, skills like <strong>Flying Knee</strong> and <strong>Hawkeye Claw</strong> will come quite in handy, especially in the dungeons you’ll need to clear before you can unlock class changing.</p><p>There’s honestly not a lot to say about the Martial Artist, as its main function is to just <em>punch</em> nine times out of ten. Still, if you want a dedicated physical attacker on your team, the Martial Artist is a good starting point.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9e79133572fc009f3d33177e5b57ed51" data-recommend-id="image://9e79133572fc009f3d33177e5b57ed51" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.

It can equip a richer variety of weapons and armor compared to the Martial Artist, but that can put more of a strain on your gold reserves unless you want to forgo loading out your other party members. Its early game skills also aren’t especially impressive, as it takes quite a few levels for it to learn strong physical attacks. The Warrior does technically fulfill a tank role for your party, but frankly the Hero already does an admiral job of filling this void throughout the early game.</p><p>Should you eventually switch one of your classes into a Warrior later on? Sure, it’s a good class! Additionally, if you’re the type of player who always likes to level grind until you get all the best equipment before heading into a dungeon, then the Warrior will likely come out ahead of the Martial Artist. Otherwise, you may want to consider one of the higher-tier options above before picking a Warrior.</p><p>DQ3-Class-Thief.jpg]</p><p>Caption: A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.

Its skills <strong>Nose for Treasure</strong> and <strong>Scoop</strong> are <em>invaluable</em> for finding hidden treasure, including the collectible Mini Medals scattered all throughout the game. <em>Several</em> hidden items have literally no visual clue for where they are unless you’re standing on top of them, so the Thief’s skills are essential for completionists. Additionally, <strong>Padfoot</strong> lowers the rate of random battles, which makes several dungeons in the game much more palatable.</p><p>So why not pick a Thief right off the bat? Long story short, it takes them a few levels to get these essential skills, and they are much stronger in battle if you let them inherit skills from another class. If you don’t mind using a weaker class in the early game of <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D</em> and just want those key skills right away, then you should definitely start with a Thief. But for the smoothest play experience, just make Thief one of your first class changes instead.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a4f310c69b8158f253d5544de5ec5891" data-recommend-id="image://a4f310c69b8158f253d5544de5ec5891" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.

It <em>is</em> usable, as it can inflict respectable damage and equip some strong weapons. The Merchant also can find extra gold after battles, which can be helpful early on while money is relatively scarce. You can even use the “Show” command with a Merchant in the party, which gives you a full and fun description of every item in the game. It’s a really neat touch!</p><p>The Merchant’s problem is that it offers almost no long-term benefits to your party. Sure, the Show command can let you know if an item is cursed, but that’s usually specified in an item’s description already. The skill <strong>Service Call</strong> technically lets you use Inns on-demand, but it doesn’t work in the dungeons where you’d need it the most. It does learn the powerful attack <strong>Call to Arms</strong>, but this is a later-game move and is functionally identical to the Monster Tamer’s <strong>Monster Pile-On</strong>, which is overall cheaper to use.</p><p>Merchants aren’t bad, and they are fun to use. But of all the classes in <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D</em>, this is the easiest to skip.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ca02f664667e4aabadde07cfdeea5b1a" data-recommend-id="image://ca02f664667e4aabadde07cfdeea5b1a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.

Don’t bother with this until later.</p><h3 id="h600"><a id=""></a><strong>Gadabout</strong></h3><p>Please don’t start with this literal clown emoji of a class. It’s bad enough that Gadabouts learn nothing useful in the early game and contribute less damage than the classes listed above. What’s worse is that Gadabouts will literally waste turns disobeying your commands to instead pull pranks on the battlefield, all of which can stun or weaken your party members. Yes, you read that right: You will encounter instances in which having a Gadabout in your party is actually worse than not having a third party member at all.</p><p>Why does such an awful class exist in <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D</em> to begin with? Well, if you can pull off leveling a Gadabout high enough, it can learn some useful (albeit often niche) abilities that no other classes can. Additionally, the Gadabout is the only class that can change into the Sage class without consuming the rare Words of Wisdom item. In either case, <strong>the goal with the Gadabout is to have it in your party for the least amount of time possible</strong>. Since EXP scales up sharply as you progress in your adventure, you won’t have to endure using a Gadabout for nearly as long if you save this for a class change later on.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Thunderful has announced its second restructuring in less than a year’s time. This time, it could see up to 100 people lose their jobs within the company.</p>



<p>The announcement came on Thursday via the <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2024-11-14-thunderful-group-implements-strategic-restructuring-program-doubling-down-on-third-party-game-publishing-and-scaling-back-internal-development-resulting-in-write-downs-of-220-240-msek" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company’s website</a>.</p>



<p>“This newly announced program follows the cost-saving measures introduced earlier this year, as well as the divestment of the Group’s distribution business to manage previously incurred net debt,” Thunderful said. “Whilst significant reductions in cost levels were achieved this year, revenue targets have not been met and the Group is still struggling with negative cash flow.”</p>



<p>This restructuring will see the company move focus to external publishing with third-party games. Thunderful says it will “reduce the Group´s fixed costs and allow for greater flexibility, enabling faster, diverse game releases by leveraging external talent and resources in a balanced manner, while still retaining some internal development capacity.”</p>



<p>“It is regrettable to announce a second restructuring of Thunderful in less than a year, but we unfortunately see no other alternatives in order to ensure the Group’s long-term sustainability and resilience,” Thunderful CEO Martin Walfisz said.</p>



<p>As part of the moves, somewhere between 80-100 people in and outside of Sweden will lose their jobs. Those in management and administration will also be impacted by the layoffs.</p>



<p>Thunderful expects to have one-time costs of $22.8M – $27.4M as part of separation costs after negotiating with unions. In total, however, they anticipate the job  cuts to improve the overall cash flow by $73M – $82.2M.</p>



<p>In 2024, there have been nearly 14,000 known jobs lost due to layoffs across more than 160 companies.</p>



<p>What do you think of the restructuring and layoffs at Thunderful? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

<p>Trading has been part of the Pokémon fabric and DNA since day one. It’s no surprise Trading is a huge topic of discussion in Pocket, and I’ve gathered the latest news and announcements to tell you everything we know about Pokémon TCG Pocket’s Trading mechanic.</p>



<p>Once you’ve opened many Pokémon TCG Pocket <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-pack-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-to-open-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">packs</a> and reeled off <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wonder-pick-exploit-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Picks</a>, your collection should look very full; but you’re also bound to have tons of duplicates. Getting extras of the same card is crucial when it comes to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-flair-in-pokemon-pocket-tcg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flair</a> in Pokémon TCG Pocket, but it can become an annoyance too. There are so many Pokémon I love when I first pull but become irritated by when I see them for the 10th time—or twice in one pack!</p>



<p>You can swap duplicates in real life—one area where the physical edition of the Pokémon TCG differs from the virtual format. We know Trading is in Pokémon TCG Pocket, but questions are being asked about it daily, and I’ll answer them now.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-trade-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Can you Trade in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Let me Trade, please! Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You cannot Trade in Pokémon TCG Pocket at present</strong> as the feature is currently locked behind a notice saying “<strong>Coming soon.</strong>” I think this part of the equation is quite self-explanatory. You can’t Trade, but The Pokémon Company has addressed the future of the mechanic.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-trading-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket">When is Trading Coming to Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<p>As announced by the <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP_JP/status/1856864629009363249" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon TCG Pocket X social media page</a>, “<strong>January 2025</strong>” is the official start period for Trading.</p>



<p>The post has been <a href="https://x.com/PokemonDealsTCG/status/1856820750529040857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">translated</a>, and says, “We are aiming to add a feature that allows certain cards to be Traded started in January 2025. We are gradually planning to expand the selection of cards that are able to be Traded.”</p>



<p>So, <strong>not all cards can be Traded on day one</strong>. Using my best judgment, I’d say all cards ranging between <strong>one and three diamonds</strong> are going to be eligible to Trade. It does mean EX cards and other mega-rare pulls—such as Full Arts—need to wait a bit longer. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, like many players, I find myself in the situation where I have completed most of the main Genetic Apex set, and I’m mainly missing the odd EX card, as well as Full Arts. The Pokémon Company likely doesn’t want so many people having every card already, and it encourages players to spend more money and open more packs in a bid to pull the rarest cards.</p>



<p>Also, don’t be surprised if <strong>Gold Crown cards are never made Tradeable in Pokémon TCG Pocket.</strong> We’ll update this as we learn more about the card criteria for Trading.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-trade-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">How to Trade in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<p>The actual Trading process hasn’t been outlined yet, but we wager a similar system to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/pokemon-go/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon GO</a> is likely to be employed: Direct, one-to-one Trading between connected players, and you need to have a certain amount of currency to do so.</p>



<p>Pokémon GO requires Stardust to Trade—with certain cards made untradable altogether—and I expect you probably need a certain amount of Shinedust to Trade in Pokémon Pocket. The amount likely depends on the rarity of the creature, and Trading may be limited to a certain amount per day. This is all conjecture for now, but I can’t imagine the system will drastically deviate from this theory.</p>
