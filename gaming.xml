		<p>Nintendo has announced Super Mario Party Jamboree for Nintendo Switch, stuffed with minigames and big new modes. The game is coming out on 17th October 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Super Mario Party Jamboree – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKp9cD4e8ac?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Super Mario Party Jamboree will feature five new maps – including the Toad shopping mall Rainbow Galleria, Roll ’em Raceway with a turbo dice, and the tidal pathways of Goomba Lagoon, Mega Wiggler’s Tree Party and King Bowser’s Keep –&nbsp;as well as two more remastered maps taken from the first two games in the series – Mario’s Rainbow Castle and Western Land.</p>
<p>There’s 110 minigames in Super Mario Party Jamboree, some of which will be simply controlled with buttons and use your wits to succeed, while others will lean on motion controls.</p>
<p>There’s also new online modes, including Koopathlon, which allows up to 20 players to compete in a leaderboard race to complete minigames as best as possible.</p>

<p>Here’s hoping the bulk of this game follows in the tried and true footsteps of earlier titles. Mario Party Superstars was a return to form when it came out a few years ago, and I said, “After a decade of games that sought to reinvent and renew the series, Mario Party Superstars rewinds time for a reminder of what made Mario Party popular in the first place. Five gorgeously recreated boards, 100 cherry-picked minigames, and countless opportunities to plan and scheme your way to victory… so long as the dice roll in your favour.”</p>

		<p>Square Enix has announced that the long-awaited Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake is coming out on 14th November, with the fresh announcement that Dragon Quest I and II will be given the HD-2D remake treatment in 2025! The revamped RPG classic will be coming to Nintendo Switch, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake – Release Date Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1ltsk99E-RY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Dragon Quest 3 is actually a prequel to the first two games, set years before the original game, telling the tale of an earlier part of the heroic lineage of Erdrick and depicting the first battle with the fiend Baramos. While it’s Erdrick’s descendants who featured in the first two games, this is generally known as the Erdrick Trilogy. It’s for this reason that Square has started off with the third game in the series, to re-release them in chronological order.</p>
<h3>Further Reading: <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/05/14/dragon-quest-35-anniversary/">Dragon Quest at 35 – the history of a JRPG icon</a></h3>
<p>Dragon Quest 3 was originally released for the Famicom in 1988, selling over one million copies on its first day of release in Japan. Over the years it has been remade and ported to a number of later consoles, first with the 1996 Super Famicom remake in Japan, a Game Boy Color adaptation of that &nbsp;for Western audiences, and then more modern ports to smartphone in 2009 which spawn the ports to Wii, 3DS, PS4, and Switch.</p>
<p>This HD-2D remake is a whole other kettle of fish, though. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/05/27/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-octopath-traveler/">First announced back in 2021</a> for the franchise’s 35th anniversary, the reveal trailer showed the transformation to the art style popularised by Octopath Traveller, it’s taken the team at AMATA K.K. and Team Asano around three years to approach a full release. We’ve really seen the HD-2D style come along fantastically well since Octopath Traveller, and Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake looks absolutely lovely. We’re keen to see how else the team has tweaked and adapted the game, though I’m sure they’ve been very faithful to the original intent of the game.</p>

		<p>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD will see the Nintendo Wii platformer remastered for Nintendo Switch on 16th January 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Country Returns HD – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qdjam3yHC-4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It’s classic side-scrolling Donkey Kong action by Metroid Prime creators Retro Studios – they then followed it up with Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze.&nbsp;There’s 80 levels included in the game, including the ones that were added for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2010/12/05/review-donkey-kong-country-returns/">the Nintendo 3DS port in 2013</a>.</p>
<p>This was one of our earliest 10/10 games on the site, with Dan saying of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2010/12/05/review-donkey-kong-country-returns/">Donkey Kong Country Returns</a>, “Without a doubt DKCR has surpassed my wildest expectations. What we have here is a 2D platform game that has been taken to the next level. As hard as it is for me to accept, I can’t actually find a single fault with the game and if you have a Wii then this should be on the top of your list. An absolute classic that has raised the bar for all that follows.”</p>

<p>The Wii classic will feature 80 levels on its Switch debut, including the additional ones from the game's 3DS version. Donkey Kong Country Returns HD will be able to be played in two player local co-op, so guess what I will be doing with my kids when this comes out.</p>
<p>As for when that will be, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is set to arrive next year, on 16th January. You can check out its announcement trailer below.</p>

            <p>
Kicking its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-todays-nintendo-direct-right-here-with-us">latest Direct</a> off with a bang, Nintendo has unveiled Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership, which is heading to Switch on 7th November this year.
</p>
<p>
Brothership marks the Switch debut of Nintendo's long-running action-RPG series, and the first brand-new entry since Mario &amp; Luigi: Paper Jam appeared on 3DS in 2015.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's Brothership reveal didn't offer much in the way of specifics, but it's described as a "sea-faring adventure that unfolds across mysterious islands", and there's promise of "evolved moves" for the Mario brothers when it arrives.
</p>

</p><p>
Beyond that, it largely looks to be business as usual, aside from the cell-shaded visuals, which marks the first time the Mario &amp; Luigi series has been in full 3D. There's exploration, platforming, mini-games, and more of the series' rhythmic turn-based combat - oh and plenty of familiar faces too.
</p>
<p>
Expect Nintendo to share further details in the run up to Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership's launch this November.

            <p>
Fantasian, the RPG from Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, is heading to Switch this winter.
</p>
<p>
The game has been an Apple Arcade exclusive since it launched in 2021.
</p>
<p>
Now it's heading to Switch with the name Fantasian Neo Dimension, as revealed during today's Nintendo Direct.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="FANTASIAN Neo Dimension – Nintendo Direct 6.18.2024" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZeUv0HH1pNQ?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
It's a typical turn-based RPG, but features the Dimengeon system that allows players to bank random battles and then fight against multiple enemies at once to prevent grinding.
</p>
<p>
It's been suggested for a while Fantasian would be released elsewhere, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-creators-apple-arcade-rpg-fantasian-may-be-coming-to-steam">Steam release rumoured in August last year</a>.
</p>
<p>
Currently it's unknown if this new release will be on Switch only, or if a Steam release is also on the way.

With <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> about to launch this week, From Software president Hidetaka Miyazaki has been doing a round of interviews discussing next steps for the venerated action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> developer, or at least, hinting at them in the manner of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> NPC suggesting that you might want to have a poke around New Anor Londo. In one such chat, Miyazaki strays perilously close to airing the "themes or core elements" of whatever game or games FromSoftware are working on post-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>, commenting that he has been inspired, albeit perhaps in a "short-term way", by the experience of having a daughter.

<p>

"There are many elements that excite me when it comes to both video games and tabletop board games, and I think that there are many joys to be extracted from that," Miyazaki told <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hidetaka-miyazaki-on-bringing-elden-ring-to-a-close-and-the-future-of-from-software/1100-6524337/">Gamespot</a>, when asked about game mechanics that currently intrigue him. "But for me, personally, what brings the most excitement comes while I'm making a game. Whenever I have a good idea and I can create a hypothesis and then test that theory against, "Hey, is this fun? Is this a good idea or not?" Those moments to me bring the most excitement. So perhaps through my work, I am constantly chasing that feeling and that excitement as I'm making games.
</p>
<p>
"One other thing that really excites me right now is watching my daughter grow," he went on. "And this might be a very short-term thing, but it's fascinating and very interesting to see a small human being discover or see the world; see how a human is constructed or built in a way, how the personality is formed, how they start to identify and build their own identity. And this might just be being a father, but I think that there's certainly something there that excites me."
</p>
<p>
Asked by the Spot whether that parental fascination might find its way into an art-or-entertainment work of some kind, and in particular whether "that more naive and idealistic perspective kids have could change how you see the world and thus the worlds you depict in games", Miyakazi added:
</p>
<p>
"I don't think about that too much and I am not against the idea of change. In a lot of ways, I think having a daughter can expand the possibilities, and that expansion is a necessary element of continuing to make great games - a stimulant of [creativity] if you will. And I don't mean to talk about my daughter as an object or anything, but in the process of making games, I think it is a necessary and important stimulant because it helps you see the world through a different lens in a lot of ways. And if that is causing worry for my fans or the gamers, I don't think there's much to worry about.
</p>
<p>
"For me, it's again, finding and discovering that fleeting moment of beauty in a lot of these dark, cold, harsh, grotesque worlds that I think allows it to shine even more," he went on. "That philosophy applies to how I design and direct video games. So if I find a newer, even higher or more stimulating beauty, that will just help make the worlds even darker, more grotesque, and harsher so that it can shine even brighter. In terms of a fantasy world, the brighter something shines, the darker the shadow it casts, right?"
</p>
<p>
Gorsh. I have at least three thoughts about all this. The sillier one is that I can totes imagine an Elden Ring patch which explicitly specifies that they've bumped up the grotesqueness by 25%, to compensate for accidentally setting the beauty values too high in the previous update and making all the Undead rosy-cheeked.</p>
<p>Another is that this sounds like round two for the Sad Daddification of videogames, made famous by the 2018 God Of War reboot - a loose period of introspection in which various prominent male game designers attempted to humanise action games with recourse to their own experiences of fatherhood. I'm not aware that there has been a corresponding <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/when-will-video-games-give-me-their-sad-murder-mums">Mommification of videogames</a>, perhaps because the industry has not done a brilliant job historically of supporting and including game developers who become mothers. 
</p>
<p>
Thirdly, the notion of the face of the Souls genre being inspired by his daughter is a complicated one, given the absolutely tortuous, hyper-Aeschylean, utterly self-annihilating way the Souls games and their offshoots think about family. There are no healthy families in the Soulsverse, I think (Quelaag's sister in the header image there is probably one of the happier daughters, which is saying a lot given that she's part-spider). If you've got a parent or child in these games, odds are you're trying to usurp them or murder them or eat them or enslave them or use them as fuel for your own immortality.</p>
<p>The games often draw parallels between progeniture and the very concept of a sequel, extending their mucky dynastic parables outward to encompass the circumstances of their production. I'm interested to see how that knotty worldview might evolve, as Miyazaki grapples with the act of being a dad himself. But perhaps he's tired of these sordid enigmas, and glimpses in the thrill of parenting an opportunity to reinvent himself as the creator of, I don't know, sunny slice-of-life games. Let's circle back to this thread in a few years. In other news, our own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree review</a> has just gone live and, surprise surprise, it's a humdinger.

			<p>Fantasian: Neo Dimension is launching on PC and consoles later this year, Square Enix confirmed today.</p>
<p>With a new trailer shared during today's Nintendo Direct, the PC and console port of the JRPG originally released as an <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-fantasian-other-platforms/">Apple Arcade exclusive</a> marks the first collaboration in years between the creator of the Final Fantasy series and Square Enix. While a release date has yet to be confirmed, it has been revealed that the game will launch during Winter 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="FANTASIAN Neo Dimension - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a3Gx7Tp24iI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><em>The Father of FINAL FANTASY, Hironobu Sakaguchi, and renowned composer Nobuo Uematsu return to deliver an original RPG story. </em></p>
<p><em>Embark on an multi-dimensional journey to reclaim your lost memories and save the world from the mechteria infection. </em></p>
<p><em>FANTASIAN Neo Dimension launches on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Steam, and Xbox Series X|S this Winter 2024. </em></p>
<p>Judging from the trailer, Fantasian: Neo Dimension doesn't seem like it will change the original mobile version too much. It will feature a similar interface, excellent visuals, and a unique take on turn-based combat that allows players to change the trajectory of skills to hit multiple enemies.<a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/fantasian-neo-dimension" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> A new difficulty mode</a>, called Normal, will tone down the difficulty of the base game to make it more approachable.</p>
<p>Fantasian: Neo Dimension launches on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch during Winter 2024.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24180883/legend-of-zelda-echoes-wisdom-nintendo-switch-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="QymwXm">The next Legend of Zelda game will give Princess Zelda herself the starring role. Nintendo announced <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> during its latest <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24175496/nintendo-direct-june-date-time-switch">Nintendo Direct showcase</a>, confirming that the Zelda-led adventure will come to Switch later this year.</p>
<p id="Z7Pin7"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> looks a lot like 2019’s remake of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/9/19/20870437/zelda-links-awakening-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</em></a>, from a graphical perspective, but it will play very differently. Zelda series producer Eiji Aonuma said that <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> will feature “a new gameplay style that breaks conventions;” in other words, Zelda won’t just fight like Link. Instead, she’ll use a new magical rod and the power of wisdom to create and duplicate objects to help her overcome obstacles and enemies.</p>
<p id="Boy0KW">Out on Switch Sept. 26, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> is the first Nintendo-developed game to explicitly star Zelda as the main protagonist. Typically, hero duties are reserved for Link, and longtime Nintendo fans have hoped for decades that Zelda would get a heroic turn in the series that bears her name.</p>
<p id="ri3G6I">Princess Zelda has been playable in a handful of games from Nintendo and other developers over the past four decades. She’s a playable character in spinoffs like the Hyrule Warriors action games, the Super Smash Bros. series, and in rhythm game <em>Cadence of Hyrule</em>. In 2009’s <em>The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks</em>, players take control of a version of Zelda, in spirit form, during segments of the game.</p>
<p id="oGZ0sy">Two Zelda-starring games that Nintendo would likely prefer to forget are 1993’s <em>Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon</em> and 1996’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/zelda/23707938/worst-zelda-game-boy-version"><em>Zelda’s Adventure</em></a>, a pair of interactive adventures developed for the Philips CD-i multimedia player.</p>

  <p id="RqiwTG">A new Mario &amp; Luigi adventure — <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> — is coming to Switch this November, Nintendo announced Tuesday at its latest <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24175496/nintendo-direct-june-date-time-switch">Nintendo Direct</a>. It’s the first new Mario &amp; Luigi game in nine years; the last was 2015’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/1/22/10809774/mario-and-luigi-paper-jam-review-3ds"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Paper Jam</em></a> for Nintendo 3DS. </p>
<p id="QDPULQ">In the first trailer for <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>, we see Mario and Luigi facing an all-new electrical threat, and joined by electric plug-inspired allies Connie and Snoutlet, on their seafaring adventure. More familiar friends and foes — Princess Peach and Bowser and his minions — are also here. In Mario &amp; Luigi tradition, the plumber-adventurer duo team up to use evolved Bros. moves in combat and for platforming across a new island-based region of the Mushroom Kingdom. </p>
<p id="NjHBOa"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> launches Nov. 7 on Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>Elden Ring is the type of game that you either fall deeply in love with and play for countless hundreds of hours across multiple playthroughs, or you don’t. You bounce off of its challenging gameplay and open-world formula in search of something else entirely. But for those sticking with the experience, here’s how long it takes to beat Elden Ring!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-to-beat-elden-ring-s-main-story">How Long to Beat Elden Ring’s Main Story?</h2>



<p>If you focus primarily on the main story, defeating the core bosses to obtain the Great Runes, then you can beat Elden Ring in approximately <strong>60 hours</strong>. If you’re a diehard fan of the Soulslike genre, it might take you a little less.</p>



<p>However, for those of us who enjoy diving into every side story and point of interest on the map to uncover tidbits of lore and unique items, then it will take approximately <strong>135 hours </strong>to beat the entirety of the game.</p>



<p>And hey, that’s only a single playthrough. There are still new and exciting builds to try and New Game+!</p>



<h6 id="h-related-who-is-messmer-in-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/who-is-messmer-in-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Who is Messmer in Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree?</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-how-long-does-it-take-to-beat-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree">How Long Does it Take to Beat Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree?</h2>



<p>With the game’s first and only expansion, the story and lore behind Elden Ring expand exponentially. Still, it won’t take you too long to complete the new content. The approximate time to complete Shadow of the Erdtree is around <strong>30 hours.</strong> Some players will beat it in less, and others may take longer.</p>



<p>That’s the joy of Elden Ring, though! It doesn’t matter how fast or slow you play; it’s about the overall experience and overcoming distinct challenges to improve as a player!</p>

<p>During the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX3BkD5PVUM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Direct showcase</a>, Nintendo announced new titles that are coming to Nintendo Switch Online and an Expansion Pack.</p>



<p>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords and Metroid Zero Mission are both coming to Nintendo Switch Online. </p>



<p>Further, Perfect Dark and Turok Dinosaur Hunter are coming to the new Nintendo 64 Mature 17+ games collection.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Perfect Dark has built a lot of renewed hype following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/perfect-dark-reboot-first-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the impressive trailer</a> revealed last week for the highly anticipated reboot. The trailer revealed both polished cinematics and first-person gameplay, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-perfect-dark-game-in-rough-shape-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">despite earlier claims</a> that development was in rough shape.</p>

<p>The gaming industry has consistently favoured multiplayer co-op games, as having more people to share an experience with is always better. However, FromSoftware has always prioritised solo experiences with limited multiplayer features, which has unfortunately left players unable to fully immerse themselves in the game with their friends. Interestingly, this circumstance may only be temporary.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fromsoftwares-says-elden-rings-seamless-co-op-mod-is-definitely-not-something-we-actively-oppose-and-may-even-consider-ideas-like-that-with-our-future-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, FromSoftware boss Hidetaka Miyazaki hinted at the potential for a seamless co-op experience in future games. Miyazaki expressed that a seamless co-op experience is ‘definitely not something we actively oppose or want to downplay, wanting to go through the whole game together’. This openness to new ideas is a promising sign for the future of FromSoftware games.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Miyazaki added, “That’s not to say we won’t consider other ways, like you and your friend played, from beginning to end, total co-op—that’s not to say we won’t consider ideas like that with our future games.” This statement surely stirred up major excitement among the FromSoftware fans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elden Ring or any other FromSoftware game series could be transformed by a complete co-op experience. Imagine the thrill of having a friend at your side as you face off against the most intimidating and menacing bosses. The potential for increased challenge and camaraderie is truly exciting, and we can’t wait to see how FromSoftware might incorporate this feature in their future games.&nbsp;</p>

Let us know what FromSoftware series you would want to play through a seamless co-op mode in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Nintendo announced the next wave of games for its Nintendo Switch Online subscription service during the June 2024 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-june-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5478/" data-ref-id="2900-5478">Nintendo Direct</a>. A handful of classic games are coming to the service starting today, including online play for a Zelda classic.</p><p dir="ltr">The Zelda game is Four Swords, a cooperative four-player Game Boy Advance game that will now feature online play to conquer its dungeons and challenges. The GBA selection is also adding Metroid: Zero Mission, the GBA retelling of the very first Metroid game that is considered a classic in its own right. Meanwhile, the N64 is getting two new entries as well: Turok Dinosaur Hunter, and the very first Perfect Dark. All of these will be available today.</p><p dir="ltr">The Nintendo Switch Online service--and its Expansion Pass, which includes access to DLC and more systems' games--has grown considerably since Nintendo introduced it in 2018. Games from the NES, SNES, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo 64, and Sega Genesis are all available with save states, and it is the only way outside of the hard-to-find SNES Classic that players can play Star Fox 2, though there might be a good reason for that.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-june-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5478/" data-ref-id="2900-5478">all the biggest Nintendo Direct announcements</a>.</p>

The game stars both Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong as they track down the Tiki Tak Tribe, who has stolen all of their bananas. Donkey Kong Country Returns HD also features two player co-op across all 80 levels.</p><p dir="ltr">The Donkey Kong Country series is known for its smooth movement mechanics and sometimes-punishing difficulty. The series originated on the Super NES but went mostly dormant until Donkey Kong Country Returns. The most-recent game in the series, Tropical Freeze, was released on Wii U and ported to the Switch.</p>

Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is headed for release on January 16, 2025.</p>

<p>The new version looked great in its reveal trailer today, which showed off DK and his little buddy, Diddy Kong, making their way through a slew of jungle-themed environments, collecting bananas, popping barrels, and even riding Rambi the Rhinoceros.</p>

<p>The new remaster is set to include 80 levels, which means it will also have all the extra levels that appeared in the 2013 3DS port. The trailer also reveals plans for two-player local cooperative play.</p>

<p>Check our the new trailer for yourself below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2024/06/18/final-fantasy-creators-apple-arcade-exclusive-fantasian-arrives-on<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>During today's Nintendo Direct, developer Mistwalker announced that its popular RPG Fantasian would be making the leap to Switch later this year in an enhanced version called Fantasian Neo Dimension. The title arrived as an Apple Arcade exclusive in 2021 and currently holds an 80 out of 100 on reviews aggregate site Metacritic. It also won the award for Mobile game of the Year at the 25th Annual DICE Awards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mistwalker was founded in 2004 by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, who produced Fantasian. The studio frequently collaborates with longtime Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu, who also worked on Fantasian as the composer. To date, Mistwalker has released multiple critically acclaimed games, including Blue Dragon, Lost Odyssey, and The Last Story.</p>

<p>Fantasian uses similar turn-based design conventions as were found in many of the most classic Final Fantasy games. The title also implements several quality-of-life modernizations, such as the ability to skip random encounters with enemy types you've already defeated until they choose to fight them all at once. Despite being a mobile title, Fantasian's ties to Apple Arcade means it does not include any microtransactions or paid DLC.</p>

<p>Fantasian Neo Dimension arrives on Nintendo Switch this holiday season.</p>

<p data-characters="296" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The 2024 Nintendo Direct revealed the latest installment to the <em>Mario Party</em> series, <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>. Fortunately, you won’t have to wait too long to jump into the friendship-making (and destroying) actions with your friends, as it’s releasing this year on October 17, 2024.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Super Mario Party Jamboree – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKp9cD4e8ac?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="515" data-current-count="815" data-injectable="true"><em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em> is the biggest game to launch in the series yet, with over 110 minigames, seven game boards, and up to 20-player support in an exclusive Koopathlon mode. You’ll jump onto an island resort and, much like previous games in the series, travel around the board to sabotage your friends and claim the most stars to win the match. It also features mostly new game boards, with two from the first two Mario Party games, Mario’s Rainbow Castle and Western Land, making a grand return.</p>
 <p data-characters="95" data-current-count="95" data-injectable="false"><em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em> will be released as a Nintendo Switch exclusive on October 17, 2024.</p>

<p data-characters="264" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There was a lot of exciting news for retro gamers in the Nintendo Direct. One that got me good <a href="https://youtu.be/pFCmD21OqKU?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was the reveal</a> of the <em>Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection</em>. This collection brings together such out-of-reach licensed classics as <em>The Punisher</em> and <em>Marvel vs. Capcom 2</em>.</p> <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="27" data-injectable="false">Okay, here’s the trailer:</p> <figure data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics - Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pFCmD21OqKU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="71" data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false">And here’s the list of games. Capitalization is all Capcom marketing:</p> <ul data-found-items="7" data-current-count="678" data-injectable="true"> <li>X-MEN CHILDREN OF THE ATOM</li> <li>MARVEL SUPER HEROES</li> <li>X-MEN VS. STREET FIGHTER</li> <li>MARVEL SUPER HEROES vs. STREET FIGHTER</li> <li>MARVEL vs. CAPCOM CLASH OF SUPER HEROES</li> <li>MARVEL vs. CAPCOM 2 New Age of Heroes</li> <li>THE PUNISHER</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="482" data-current-count="482" data-injectable="true">This is extremely exciting to me. I’m always thrilled when old licensed games get re-released because I know it’s often a lot of hoops for the publisher to jump through. <em>Marvel Vs. Capcom 2</em> is probably the top of the heap, but that doesn’t mean that the others included aren’t great on their own. <em>The Punisher</em> is a beat-’em-up where you play as the eponymous anti-hero and Nick Fury. It’s no <em>Alien vs. Predator</em> (hopefully, one day), but it’s an excellent arcade title.</p>
 <p data-characters="88" data-current-count="88" data-injectable="false">Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics will be released later this year.</p>

<p data-characters="133" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As part of the Nintendo Direct, <a href="https://youtu.be/1ltsk99E-RY?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we got a new look</a> at the <em>Dragon Quest 3 2D-HD </em>remake. We also have a release date: November 14, 2024.</p> <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="243" data-injectable="false">Were you betting on the original trilogy of <em>Dragon Quest </em>games getting a remake? Good news! The other two games are also getting remade, but they aren’t part of the same collection. <em>Dragon Quest 1&amp;2 2D-HD </em>will be coming sometime in 2025.</p> <figure data-current-count="543" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake – Release Date Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1ltsk99E-RY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="186" data-current-count="186" data-injectable="false">I’m not sure there’s much else to say. It’s a remake of the third <em>Dragon Quest </em>game in Square’s 2D-HD style. It’s a foundational JRPG, so maybe play it if you haven’t before.</p> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="454" data-injectable="true">Honestly, <em>Dragon Quest 3</em> was probably my least favorite of the four NES titles. I think it just felt really long and kind of drab. It’s still good, and I’ll definitely be getting the HD-2D remake. I’m just happy that the first two are also getting the treatment.</p>
 <p data-characters="118" data-current-count="118" data-injectable="false"><em>Dragon Quest 3: 2D-HD </em>is coming to Switch on November 14, 2024. <em>Dragon Quest 1&amp; 2 2D-HD</em> will arrive after in 2025.</p>

<p data-characters="167" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Among Us</em><span> </span>fans on Nintendo Switch, rejoice! Three new roles, two for Crewmates and one for Impostors, are being added to the game as part of a free update on June 18. </p> <p data-characters="213" data-current-count="213" data-injectable="false">Announced during the jam-packed Nintendo Direct, Crewmates can now end up with the Noisemaker or Tracker roles, while the new Phantom role for Impostors will make it even harder for your opponents to sus you out. </p> <p data-characters="304" data-current-count="517" data-injectable="true">Noisemakers will be able to send out a signal to everyone in the game that they’ve been killed, so there’s no way they can be silently eliminated by the bad guys. Elsewhere, the Tracker will be able to plant a tracking device on other players and watch their movements using the in-game map. </p>
 <p data-characters="201" data-current-count="201" data-injectable="false">For those who end up as Impostor, the Phantom role will allow you to turn invisible, which will be very handy for evading Crewmates after a kill, or sneaking into position for your next assassination. </p> <figure data-current-count="501" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Let your teammates know you’ve been slain. Image via Innersloth</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="286" data-injectable="false">These three roles were first teased back on April Fool’s Day, appearing briefly in the lobby during the video. The roles aren’t actually live on PC or console just yet, which means that if you want to play them, you’ll need to break out your Switch to give them a go. </p> <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="616" data-injectable="true">The Phantom definitely seems like the most powerful of the lot, with the ability to turn invisible definitely going to lead to some awesome plays. The Tracker could also be useful if there’s a player you don’t trust, although giving away information that contradicts them could make you a prime target for their knife.</p>
 <p data-characters="196" data-current-count="196" data-injectable="false">The new <em>Among Us</em> roles are just one of many big announcements at June 18’s Nintendo Direct, including the new <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mario-luigi-brothership-is-carrying-on-alphadreams-legacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a></em> and an HD version of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/donkey-kong-country-returns-again-for-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Country Returns</a></em>.</p>

<p data-characters="180" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Remember when Nintendo brought <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/review-donkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</a></em> to the Switch? Well, now its predecessor, <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns</em>, is making the leap as well in early 2025.</p> <p data-characters="301" data-current-count="301" data-injectable="false">Originally released in 2010, this marks the second time <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns</em> has seen a port, since Nintendo put it on the Nintendo 3DS as well in 2013. This Switch version seems to be a simple HD port of the original Wii game, but it will include the extra levels from the 3DS version as well.</p> <figure data-current-count="601" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Donkey Kong Country Returns HD – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qdjam3yHC-4?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="279" data-injectable="false">Aside from that, it doesn’t appear to boast any wholly new features or content. Couch co-op is obviously still included, letting two players control DK and Diddy as they embark on a quest to get their bananas back from the Tiki Tak Tribe. No mention of online co-op though.</p> <p data-characters="74" data-current-count="353" data-injectable="false"><em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em> is scheduled to launch on January 16, 2025.</p>

Officially titled <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em> for the console version, the port is an enhanced version of the original with brand new features including English and Japanese voiceovers and a new difficulty option, and is scheduled to release in winter this year.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="FANTASIAN Neo Dimension – Nintendo Direct 6.18.2024" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZeUv0HH1pNQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="611" data-injectable="true">In <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em>, players take on the role of Leo as he tries to recover his memories and solve the mystery of a strange mechanical infection that is destroying is homeworld. <em>Fantasian</em> features a modernized take on turn-based combat and a handful of unique mechanics that shake up the classic formula.</p>

		<p>Nintendo Switch Sports is getting a free update with a whole new sport: basketball! Announced during today’s Nintendo Direct, the ball-bouncing, hoop-shooting action will be added to the game this Summer.</p>

<p>Basketball will allow you to play by dribbling, passing and shooting in a handful of different modes. There’s team ups in 2v2 matches, there’s group free throws, and more, with both local and online multiplayer.</p>
<p>Switch Sports came out in 2022, with Jason saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/04/nintendo-switch-sports-review-wii-sports/">our review</a>, “Nintendo Switch Sports is a fun reminder of the Wii Sports craze, bringing back some classic sports and adding some new ones that make use of the Joy-Con and motion controls in more advanced ways. It’s all just a bit shallow, though, and difficult to wholeheartedly recommend unless you expect to play online a lot or constantly break it out for local head-to-head battles.”</p>
