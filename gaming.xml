            <p>In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only more bloody downloadable content for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>. Developers Saber Interactive are supposed to be working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-revealed-with-titus-back-as-lead">Space Marine 3</a>, but you wouldn't know that from all the Stuff they've jammed into the previous game's year 2 content schedule. There's a major Anniversary patch due on 4th September, just in time for Silksong. Five more patches are coming over 2025 and 2026, plus nine DLC packs via season pass. The manufactorums are overflowing! Here's a video to lay it all out.</p><!--more-->

<p>The standout upcoming option is probably the new playable Techmarine class, who don't get any screentime here. What is a Techmarine? A Space Marine with a lot of spanners where parts of their anatomy should be. They're good at fixing stuff, though one suspects that, like most Sparse Maureens in Spice Margerine 2, they'll spend the bulk of their time murdering things.
</p>
<p>Techmarines aside, the free updates will add new enemies, bosses, weapons, progression mechanics, PvE stratagems, Eternal War arenas, and operations. Also, the chance to play a Chaos Helbrute, which looks like a berserking tractor with a comically small humanoid head. It's like Bruce Banner got 90% of the way through Hulking out and ran out of rage. Still, let's see if you're still laughing when it stands on your toes in the forthcoming Helbrute Onslaught PvP mode.

<p>As for those paid DLCs, there will be the usual shower of cosmetics. The new battle pass kicks off with the Black Templars Champion Pack, which includes a Champion skin for the Bulkwark class and a Power Sword skin. Then there's the Imperial Fists Cosmetic Pack, which comprises 40 new cosmetics. Future packs will include cosmetics for the Raptors, Iron Hands and Carcharodons. I'm pretty sure they made some of those Space Marine chapters up. Iron Hands, lol, as if.
</p><p>The only thing missing from Space Marine 2's roadmap, to my mind, is a mutual crossover with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> universe - a prospect <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-boss-would-love-to-do-a-take-on-star-wars-predator-and-warhammer-40000">once dangled by Arrowhead's CEO</a>, many moons ago. Let us make the commodified fascists fight! Let us see whose space-bigotry is burlier! Arrowhead have already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-first-licensed-crossover-is-also-killzones-official-debut-on-pc-sort-of">partnered with the goose-stepping Helghast from Killzone</a>. Add Warhammer 40,000's Space Marines to the mix and you're basically playing an unofficial <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/planetside">PlanetSide</a> 3. Seriously, there's like, at least six battle passes worth of content here.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Welcome back, gamers. I can call you that, right? Cool. Anyway, this is Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news and other stuff you might care about. Today, we have more layoffs, Unreal Engine 5 optimization information, details on how <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> runs on Xbox, and someone claiming Capcom has tried to remake <em>Dino Crisis</em> a few times, but keeps failing. Oh, and congrats, internet, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce835lry896o">you bullied Cracker Barrel hard enough</a> that it’s not changing its logo after all.</p> <h2>Capcom leaker claims the publisher has been trying and failing to remake <em>Dino Crisis</em></h2> <p>Fans have been begging Capcom for a new <em>Dino Crisis</em> for many, <em>many</em> years, and it just hasn’t happened. Even when Capcom publishes <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/swikajakiin.bsky.social/post/3lxhsf5m5ss2x">a game with dinosaurs</a>, it’s not actually the one fans really want. But it sounds like the lack of <em>Dino Crisis</em> isn’t because Capcom has given up on the series. According to reliable Capcom leaker Dusk Golem, Capcom has actually tried twice before to revive the dinosaur-themed horror franchise.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1960763450801709199">The leaker claims</a> that Capcom Vancouver, the studio that developed all of the<em> Dead Rising</em> sequels, was working on a remake of <em>Dino Crisis</em> before the studio was closed. Another version was apparently being worked on by an unnamed studio at a later date, but was canned because it “wasn’t turning out so good.” So Capcom is reportedly trying, but struggling, to make more <em>Dino Crisis. </em>Hopefully, in the same way Capcom got <em>Resident Evil</em> back on track with RE7, the publisher can get <em>Dino Crisis</em> going again.</p>

 <h2><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>‘s Xbox port is very different than the PS5 version</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Black Myth: Wukong Xbox Series X|S - DF Review - A Bizarre Port vs PlayStation 5" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0-10490qd8s?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Here’s something odd: <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> on Xbox Series X and Series S looks quite different from the PS5 version. According to a new analysis video from Digital Foundry, <em>Wukong</em> on Xbox can look extremely different due to the fact that the game doesn’t use frame-gen tech like the PS5 does in some modes.</p> <p>This can create a cleaner image. But it also lacks some of the fancier lighting techniques seen in the PS5 port, which can result in a drastically different image as well. The Xbox version also has other quirks that, in some modes, lead to a softer image. Yet the much weaker Series S appears to have rock-solid performance numbers. It’s an odd situation in 2025. These days, most games run and look about the same across the PS5 and Xbox. Not so with <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>.</p>

 <h2>Crystal Dynamics announces another round of layoffs</h2> <p>On August 27, Crystal Dynamics, the studio currently working on the next <em>Tomb Raider</em> game for Amazon, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366524687985594369/">announced another round of layoffs.</a> The news came via a post on the company’s LinkedIn page, which didn’t specify how many people lost their jobs during this round of cuts. The studio says that “the future of <em>Tomb Raider</em>” is “unaffected by this decision.” This is the second round of layoffs to happen at Crystal Dynamics this year, coming after some employees were previously let go in March.</p> <p>“Today we made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions. This decision was not made lightly. It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market,” the studio posted.</p>

 <h2><strong>Epic boss says devs need more Unreal Engine 5 education to avoid optimization issues</strong></h2> <p>There has been a lot of criticism aimed at video game development engine Unreal 5 over the last year or so, as some believe it isn’t optimized properly. Epic boss Tim Sweeney pushed back on these claims during an interview that happened <a href="https://clawsomegamer.com/tim-sweeney-on-unreal-engine-5-optimization-issues-the-main-cause-is-order-of-development/">at the recent Unreal Fest in South Korea</a>. The boss blamed “order of development” for games running poorly on consoles and PC.</p> <p>“Many studios build for top-tier hardware first and leave optimization and low-spec testing for the end,” said Sweeney. “Ideally, optimization should begin early—before full content build-out. We’re doing two things: strengthening engine support with more automated optimization across devices, and expanding developer education so ‘optimize early’ becomes standard practice. If needed, our engineers can step in.”</p>

 <h2><strong>Laid-off <em>Black Panther</em> game devs join Wizards of the Coast</strong></h2> <p>Wizards of the Coast president John Hight revealed, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/part-of-the-team-behind-eas-cancelled-black-panther-game-joins-wizards-of-the-coast">in an interview with <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em></a>, that a team of developers who were previously working on EA’s <em>Black Panther</em> game, which was canned earlier this year, have joined the company to work on a new project. The team of former Cliffhanger devs is led by creative director Michael de Plater, a veteran dev whose resume includes<em> Shadow of Mordor</em> and <em>Rome: Total War.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>“We were actually able to bring [de Plater] and 14 key people that he’s worked with there – and many of them at Monolith – to incubate a new game for us,” Hight told the outlet. “He’ll be starting concept development on something very cool and new – and that part I can’t tell you yet.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-creator-still-not-sure-when-his-next-game-is-coming-out-2000620743"><em>Bioshock’s</em> creator still doesn’t have a release date for <em>Judas</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/hitman-world-of-assassination-out-now-on-iphone-for-70-or-3-a-level-2000620693"><em>Hitman</em> is out now on phones, but it will cost you $70</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-18-patch-cassidy-wrecking-ball-bug-2000620763"><em>Overwatch 2′</em>s latest update broke its famous cowboy character</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p>If you have an hour or so to kill, watch this shockingly deep dive into M&amp;M lore.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="How Many Unique M&amp;M's Characters Exist?" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-yzYtUue5Y4?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

                <p>September 4 is quite the scary date for indie devs this year. You probably already know why, but here's the reason anyway: After a long wait, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-finally-revealed-after-years-of-waiting/1100-6534159/">finally arriving on that exact date</a>. It's easily going to be one of the biggest indie releases of the year, and because of that fact, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-release-date-has-already-prompted-two-game-delays/1100-6534203/">number of indie games</a> have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-prompts-yet-another-game-delay-as-the-great-looking-demonschool-gets-pushed-back/1100-6534245/">opted for a delay</a> to avoid being drowned out by the Silksong-mania. One exception is a co-op racing party game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fling-to-the-finish/" data-ref-id="5000-494249">Fling to the Finish</a>, as the companies responsible have decided to release its console ports on the same day as Silksong.</p><p dir="ltr">Publisher Daedalic Entertainment and developer Splitside Games confirmed the game will be releasing on console September 4 in a press release, referencing Silksong in a tongue-in-cheek manner: "Arriving same day as THAT metroidvania." To be fair, as you can see in a trailer below, there's no real reason to think that Fling to the Finish is in any direct competition with Silksong.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVmKO10jaT0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cVmKO10jaT0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Fling to the Finish is more in the vein of games like Human: Fall Flat, as it sees you playing as perfectly spherical, cartoonish characters that are tied together two at a time. You then have to maneuver through various obstacle courses as you try not to drag your friend down with you, all while racing other players. Apart from both games featuring platforming, their target audiences couldn't be more different, so there's no reason to think Silksong should affect Fling to the Finish's release on console.</p><p dir="ltr">You can also play Fling to the Finish in solo, online multiplayer, local split-screen, and both local and online co-op, and there's cross-play between platforms too. If you really want to start an argument with your friends, there's even a "share a controller" local co-op mode.</p><p dir="ltr">Fling to the Finish launches on September 4, and you'll be able to play it on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch. It's already available to play on PC.</p>

Horror is a good fit for the genre because it adds an inherent pressure that ends up being slapstick comedy. There's a performance element to it, too, Drew said. "Horror is an easy pressure to put on those kinds of challenges, because it's just easy to get people flustered and freaking out and making a mistake that's funny," he said. "In the case of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Content Warning</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, that's a great mechanic, because filming is a good incentive to even, like, perform the funny."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/what-makes-ambrosia-sky-so-unique-game-developer-podcast-ep-52" target="_self" data-discover="true">What Makes Ambrosia Sky So Unique? - Game Developer Podcast Ep. 52</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the collaboration between the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Content Warning</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Another Crab's Treasure</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> makers, the developers wanted to capture a similar feeling but about surviving with friends. There's no horror element to up the ante; instead, the antagonist is the climb—not any sort of looming monster.

You still have to place the piton, and it takes time, and you could fall while you're doing it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum’s</a> latest update is out now, bringing a bunch of free new content as part of The Digiverse. Collect arcade cabinets, pixel art video game memorabilia, and the murky depths of a new Dredge collaboration with a new expedition map to explore.</p>
<p><iframe title="Two Point Museum: Update 5.0 | OUT NOW!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MRBCcrB_4zk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Digiverse sees multiple rifts opening that you can send your curators through to explore, bringing back items to display that are all themed around Meat Wizard – I can’t tell if this is meant to be a lewd euphemism or not, but it feels like it might be – and indie hit Dredge. The former is all video game-y, while the latter adds new remote islands to reach and brings more variety to your maritime museums.</p>
<p>Here’s the gist of the two sides of this update. For Meat Wizard you can expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore a nostalgic trip into the County’s video game history<wbr></li>
<li>Adventure in Meat Wizard 1 &amp; 2, and perhaps discover the franchise’s darkest secret…<wbr></li>
<li>Discover seven new Exhibits across four new Points of Interest<wbr></li>
<li>Build two new Interactive Displays: Meat Wizard Arcade Machines<wbr></li>
<li>Find and unlock Power Ups, a new boon-giving project for the workshop</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, for Dredge:</p>

<ul>
<li>Explore three remote points of interest across the archipelago &amp; unlock new decor<wbr></li>
<li>Dredge the depths to discover ten fresh catches. We’d advise you don’t set sail at night…<wbr></li>
<li>Fight the Unfathomable. Are your experts’ minds strong enough to gain knowledge of the depths?</li>
</ul>
<p>But it also just so happens to be the seventh anniversary of Two Point Hospital, where this studio’s life started. To mark the occasion, they’re bringing back the Blob Fish, which was added to the universe in the Exhibition pack for Two Point Hospital, and is now back to blob things up in Two Point Museum. Just head to the new&nbsp;<wbr>Temple of the Blobs, found southwest on the Bone Belt underneath Hermit Hills.<wbr></p>

<p>Further enhancements include:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Added new perks for the Security Camera Booth, Bandage Box and Aquarium Filter:<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Security Signal Boost: </b>Increases the range of connectivity with Security Cameras<wbr></li>
<li><b>Bandage Bogs: </b>Allows Bandage Box to increase staff Toilet Comfort<wbr></li>
<li><b>Bandage Brew:</b> Allows Bandage Box to offer coffee for staff<wbr></li>
<li><b>Extra Expert-Seas: </b>Experts gain additional XP during aquarium restoration<wbr></li>
<li><b>Focused Fish Food:</b> Reduces food dispenser Messiness (-5)<wbr></li>
<li><b>Self-Cleaning Water: </b>Increases Filter Power (+10)<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Expert subclasses are now viewable in expedition setup &amp; training<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added ‘Call security’ button to the Goblin Statue<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some qualifications now add Fantasy Stats when a Fantasy expert trains in them:<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Aerodynamics</b>: +3 Dexterity per level<wbr></li>
<li><b>Analysis</b>: +3 Intelligence per level<wbr></li>
<li><b>Happy Thoughts</b>: +3 Luck per level<wbr></li>
<li><b>Survival Skills</b>: +3 Strength per level<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>…and much more:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Made a significant number of improvements to the gamepad UI<wbr></li>
<li>Added additional language support for LATAM Spanish, Russian and Thai<wbr></li>
<li>Improved Bean-Brained, Junk Foodie and Lard Lad/Lass traits so that they provide a long-lasting status effect instead of an instant increase to their respective stats<wbr></li>
<li>Space decorations will now give a decoration bonus to their respective subcategories<wbr></li>
<li>Improved the Security Room coffee machine and doughnut table so that they both fulfil their respective Food and Drink stats to 100% (Previously, they only added +15%)<wbr></li>
<li>Reduced the number of guests required to complete showcase exhibit objectives</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Head here for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2185060/view/545618256387375629">the full Two Point Museum Update 5.0 changelog</a>.</p>
<p>The update arrives not long after the first major expansion for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/08/two-point-museum-fantasy-finds-review/">Two Point Museum: Fantasy Finds</a>. Laura had a grand time with this, saying, “Although Two Point Museum: Fantasy Finds doesn’t come with an accompanying fantasy museum, the new Scorched Earth expedition map, exciting newfangled exhibits, intriguing fantasy Expert subclasses and great array of extra features and unlockables makes it a fantastic excuse to re-visit your favourite Two Point game. As if you needed an excuse…”</p>

<p>Art Attack</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Last month, Nintendo brought <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> to the SNES Nintendo Switch Online Library, finally unlocking the Mouse Mode experience we had all been dreaming of. It was a neat addition, no doubt, but there was something missing in diving back in on our shiny new Switch 2s, something that could only be achieved by playing a second-hand copy of the game on its original hardware: save files.</p>
<p>By playing on NSO, our games were all squeaky clean, with no sign of any pre-existing blast-from-the-past artwork. We're not claiming that we used to be '<em>artists</em>' on the SNES back in the day, but there's something sweet about looking back over old drawings, right? It gives us a peek into a different time, where abilities and priorities couldn't get in the way of putting virtual pen to virtual paper. Ah, to reminisce...</p>
<p>The lovely Zion over on our video team obviously felt the same way and took on the behemoth task of collecting a whopping 100 copies of Mario Paint on the SNES, just to search for any hidden gems on the cartridges. It was a serious undertaking (like, $500 and <em>a lot</em> of time 'serious'), but the results were... well, you'll just have to watch the video to find out!</p>
<p>Above, you'll find Zion's journey to reaching the big 100, and get a look at what he uncovered along the way. It's a long one, so grab yourself a brew and settle in for some cosy nostalgia.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>RGG Studio and SEGA have <a href="https://sega.prezly.com/sega-and-rgg-studio-announce-rgg-summit-2025-air-date-tune-in?utm_source=prezly.com&amp;utm_medium=campaign&amp;utm_campaign=SEGA%20and%20RGG%20Studio%20Announce%20RGG%20Summit%202025%20Air%20Date%20%E2%80%93%20TUNE%20IN&amp;utm_id=30fec83b-0cfc-4d7c-8c3e-f1a1e5d758a3&amp;utm_content=story%20header">announced</a> the RGG Summit 2025, and an RGG Direct is coming next month on September 23, at 8pm PT / 11pm ET / September 24 at 4am BST. While there are no specific projects mentioned, there are a few titles we could be hearing about, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/stranger-than-heaven-is-the-official-name-of-rgg-studios-project-century/">Stranger Than Heaven,</a> and the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-project-century-announced-by-like-a-dragon-series-developer-ryu-ga-gotoku-studio/">Virtua Fighter Project</a>.</p>



<p>The summit will be where we'll hear all the announcements RGG Studio and SEGA have, with the RGG Direct following being where we'll hear more details about what was announced during the summit.</p>



<p>"<em>Providing fans with the latest updates from the studio, <strong>RGG Summit 2025</strong> will take place on <strong>Wednesday, September 24 at 04:00 BST (</strong>Tuesday 23 September 20:00 PT). Following the conclusion of RGG Summit 2025, a <strong>new RGG Direct</strong> will also air, giving viewers a deeper dive into the newly announced information</em>," the company announced in a press release.</p>



<figure><figcaption>The RGG Direct will follow immediately after the RGG Summit. Image credit: RGG Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>It might be a long shot to hope for, but earlier this year we had some indication from SEGA that Stranger Than Heaven <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-reveals-persona-4-revival-and-stranger-than-heaven-might-not-be-out-until-2027/">won't be out until 2027</a>. Even if we don't get a proper release date, it would be good to have a release window that doesn't point to players having to wait the whole of next year before Stranger Than Heaven hits store shelves.</p>



<p>We also <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-project-gets-fresh-trailer/">recently got a look at</a> RGG Studio's Virtua Fighter Project, with proper gameplay being showcased for the first time earlier this month, but we've yet to have a more detailed deep dive into what RGG Studio is building in this game. Hopefully, we start to get those answers next month.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation has been confirmed for a series of upcoming PC games. One of them is Battlefield 6, though the recent beta already included the support, making this old news for those who already played the game. We do have a new trailer, anyway, which confirms DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Multi Frame Generation, DLAA, and Reflex to be available when the game launches on October 10.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Battlefield 6 Official PC Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ihepSn-In6c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Tomorrow, Friday, August 29, Ultizero Games will release the long-awaited action game Lost Soul Aside. Developed initially by lone creator Yang Ming, Lost Soul Aside has evolved over time and is now finally ready to launch. On PC, the game will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, as well as Frame Generation, Super Resolution, Reflex, and ray-traced shadows and reflections. According to NVIDIA, GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards will run the game up to five times faster when turning on all DLSS technologies. By the way, publisher Sony Interactive Entertainment has not provided any pre-launch codes to press, so expect reviews to come in at a later time.</p>



<p>On the same day, NetEase's free-to-play MMORPG Sword of Justice (formerly known as Justice Online) will add NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Reflex, and DLSS Ray Reconstruction. The latter will help greatly with the game's path tracing implementation. Sword of Justice is currently available in China, but a global release has already been confirmed to be on the way soon. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Sword of Justice | Path-Traced RTX On Showcase" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UVtmNIKYuF0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Today, the free-to-play action RPG game Wuthering Waves is adding NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation. The game already supported DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Reflex, and ray traced reflections, but with Multi Frame Generation, GeForce RTX 50 Series owners can look forward to a 4.3x performance boost with ray tracing enabled and all graphics settings maxed out. As you can see in the performance chart below, the RTX 5090 gets almost 290 FPS, while the 5080 is at 225 FPS and the 5070 Ti at 205.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Another game adding Multi Frame Generation is the cooperative first-person shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/starship-troopers-extermination-has-officially-released-on-pc-playstation-5-and-xbox-series-xs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starship Troopers: Extermination</a>. Again, the game already had DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation, but now those equipped with Blackwell GPUs will enjoy even faster frame rates.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, CCP Games added all main upscaling technologies (NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, Intel XeSS, and MetalFX) to EVE Online. When it comes to DLSS, Super Resolution and Frame Generation are implemented, and Multi Frame Generation (as well as DLAA) can be toggled with the override in the NVIDIA app. EVE Online also looks better now, thanks to the newly introduced ray-traced shadows.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Lastly, NVIDIA has also released a new GeForce Game Ready driver (version 581.15) optimized for the Wuthering Waves update and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-the-order-of-giants-dlc-qa-people-just-wanted-more-everything-is-freshly-built/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: The Order of Giants DLC</a>, adding RTX Hair to the game.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with <i>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</i>(or, to give it its full title,&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em>), it's a sequel to the cult 2011 classic&nbsp;<em>Space Marine</em>. Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>is a third-person shooter, but it has more of a focus on live-service-style updates and content than the first game did.</p>

<p>The campaign picks up the story of Ultramarine Captain Demetrian Titus, who must battle through hordes of Tyranids in order to prove his loyalty to his chapter after the events of the first game.</p>




<p>A third&nbsp;<em>Space Marine&nbsp;</em>game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-revealed" rel="nofollow">is officially in development</a> following the success of the second installment, and not only that, but the devs behind&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>are currently working on a game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-devs-hasbro-tentpole-ip" rel="nofollow">based on a "tentpole" Hasbro IP</a>, although we don't know which one just yet.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>right now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, and if you want to know what I thought of the game, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review" rel="nofollow">read my review right here</a>.</p>

This machine has a lot to offer aside from a solid graphics chip for gaming. It includes a 15.6-inch QHD screen with a 165Hz refresh rate, an Intel Core i7-14650HX processor, 16GB of DDR5 RAM (upgradeable, in case you want to add more later on), and a 1TB SSD.</p><p>Most gaming laptops at this price include Nvidia’s less capable RTX 5060, along with an inferior processor. The RTX 5070 (with 8GB of video memory) should let you play most games at the screen’s native QHD resolution with ray tracing settings enabled. But, if games that you’re playing aren’t running as well as you’d like them to, many titles feature the option to turn on DLSS, Nvidia’s AI-powered feature that can greatly boost performance by upscaling lower-res graphics. That, or knock the game resolution down to 1080p instead of 1440p.</p><p>Lastly, as part of Intel’s Game Days, you’ll get a free copy of <em>Battlefield 6</em> with purchase of this laptop. Instructions for redeeming the game (which launches October 10th) are shown in the image gallery on Walmart’s product page.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/google-pixel-tablet-falls-to-all-time-low-likely-clearing-stock-right-after-pixel-10-series-release-2000620735</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/google-pixel-tablet-falls-to-all-time-low-likely-clearing-stock-right-after-pixel-10-series-release.1283061/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’ve heard of different colored models of the same exact car costing less than others, but Android tablets? That’s a new one on us. Nonetheless, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3770/">that’s what’s going on right now at Amazon with the Google Pixel Tablet, where you can save $150 on the white — sorry,&nbsp;<em>porcelain</em> — 128GB model</a> as opposed to the black model.</p>
<p>The white Google Pixel Tablet is just $249, 38% less than the exact same tablet in black. Why? No clue — under the hood they are identical: same 128GB capacity, same 11-inch screen size, same 2560 x 1600 pixel resolution, same Google AI capabilities. Same&nbsp;<em>everything</em>, <span>and once you put a cover on it, who could tell the difference even if they did care?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3770/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Don’t Overthink It</h2>
<p>There’s no reason to stare this gift horse in the mouth. Pocket the extra $150 and help yourself to one of the better Android tablets on the market. The 1st Gen Pixel Tablet is the best and most seamless way to utilize Google’s vast suite of apps in tablet form, including Gmail, Docs, and Photos — all optimized for the Pixel Tablet’s screen.</p>
<p>Not the least of these Google features that work brilliantly on the Pixel Tablet are Google AI and Gemini. Now when you’re using a tablet for creative endeavors, to craft an email, or to get a summary of your unread Gmail, Gemini can do that for you with amazing speed. Google AI can also search within photos, text, and videos just by circling it on the touchscreen.</p>



<h2>Great for Work and Play</h2>
<p>Another great creative use of the Pixel Tablet is for video calls with Google Meet. The HD video camera automatically follows you so you can stay in the center of the frame without having to sit in one place, and also adjusts the lighting to suit your surroundings. The people on the other end of your call come through bright and clear too on the 11-inch HD screen, which is also ideal for streaming video content via Google TV or Chromecast.</p>
<p>The 1st Gen Google Pixel Tablet is also the perfect device for managing your smart home devices, especially if they’re from the vast Google family. All told, the regular $399 price for the Pixel Tablet is certainly competitive, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3770/">but when Amazon suddenly decides that the white model is worth $150 less than that — just $249 during this limited-time deal</a> — it’s best to just agree with them and smash that Buy Now button before they change their mind.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Gamescom’s Opening Night Live is, by its very nature, a show that thrives on big surprises, but few would have tuned in expecting to see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4</a>. After all, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition">a remaster of the original game</a> had only just arrived days prior, and developer Relic Entertainment – now independent after a decade-plus of being owned by Sega – didn’t seem ready to deliver a massive new Warhammer RTS anytime soon. Not that it needed to be ready, of course. This was a double-hit surprise: not only is Dawn of War 4 real, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-4-is-finally-a-reality-but-its-developer-may-surprise-you">it is being developed by a completely different studio</a> from the rest of the series, King Art Games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">How did this happen? And why, in the lavish new CGI trailer, is there no sign of Gabriel Angelos, the Space Marine poster child of the Dawn of War series? Oh, and where are all the Chaos Marines? And why are the Blood Ravens back on Kronus? These are all the questions I had for Jan Theysen, the co-founder of King Art Games and Dawn of War 4’s creative director, when I met with him on the Gamescom show floor. It all started, he explained, when Games Workshop took an interest in his studio’s previous, Relic-inspired strategy game…  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How did you become involved with the project? Was it pitched to you? Or did you pitch it to Games Workshop?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen: </strong>So a couple of years ago we developed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/iron-harvest">Iron Harvest</a>, which was a Kickstarter RTS. And we were very open about the production, so we basically shared a lot of our technology and what we can do and so on. Someone at Games Workshop saw that and they basically came to us and said, ‘Let's say if we were to do Dawn of War 4, what would you guys do with it?’ And so we made a concept and we presented it, and we assumed that they probably asked a bunch of [other] people, so we were not really expecting anything to come out of it. But then Iron Harvest was released and was successful, and so [Games Workshop] came back and basically said, ‘Okay, do you want to talk some more?’ And we asked our Iron Harvest publisher, Deep Silver, if they were interested, and of course they were. And so miraculously the three of us came together and now we’re a Dawn of War developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So what was that pitch?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Theysen: </strong>It's basically what we're doing now. While we were working on Iron Harvest, we did a lot of surveys and we were very close to the community and talked to a lot of people. And what basically came out is that a lot of people felt it would be great if there would be more emphasis on campaigns and single player and maybe co-op, and not that much on competitive. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so we said, ‘Okay, we have a narrative background. We like to do campaigns and we like to do single player stuff. So actually let's do that.’ And we pitched this game where we said, ‘Okay, let's have four factions, but let's have a big campaign for each of the factions instead of a Space Marine campaign where maybe every now and then someone joins in or something.’ That was one of the building blocks. And we also pitched in general this idea of ‘Let's go back to Dawn of War 1’, because we asked a lot of people what they like, and many people asked ‘Couldn't there be more base building and research and upgrades and all of that stuff?’ Big armies and all of that felt very much [like] Dawn of War 1. And so we said, ‘Okay, what we want to do is sort of a new interpretation or an evolution of Dawn of War 1, with a big fat campaign.’ </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Who decides what those factions are? Did Games Workshop suggest you might want to use some factions? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Theysen: </strong>Well, it's a conversation, but it's also, there's so many great factions. So it's more like, ‘Okay, what <em>can't</em> we do?’ And what are the factions that for some reason we feel strongly about? And basically, if you do a Dawn of War, you want the Blood Ravens. That's basically a must have. If you want to do a sort of spiritual successor of the first Dawn of War, you need the Orks, really. Then the Necrons. Necrons were kind of promised or teased for the third game and never came out. So we felt that's maybe a nice thing to do, to basically say, ‘Okay, eventually, here they are, you can play the Necrons now.’ </p><p data-cy="paragraph">[This] basically left us with just one empty slot. And we said, ‘Okay, is there a faction that was never part of Dawn of War before? Something really new for everyone?’ And there are not that many factions, actually, but one that really jumped out is Adeptus Mechanicus. It's a big faction in the lore, everybody knows about them, but they have never been part of Dawn of War. So we said, ‘Okay, AdMec it is.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: And historically, at the time when those Dawn of War games were coming out, AdMec as a faction didn't have as many miniatures. They were more lore rather than a tabletop faction.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Theysen: </strong>Absolutely. But that changed, obviously, because we're now 20 years later and a lot of things change. I mean, even the Necrons from the first Dawn of War, from Dark Crusade, are very different Necrons from the Necrons of today.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: In terms of the scales of your units, obviously Warhammer goes from tiny Imperial Guardsmen to massive Titan mechs. What is the extent of your scale?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Theysen: </strong>It's from Scarabs up to Imperial Knights, or to Monoliths, or whatever there is in there. One of the big things is that buildings and RTS camps are always a little bit weird, right? Because they're way too small, obviously. And ours, it's still not a realistic size, but our buildings are a lot bigger than normal in RTS games, because we felt like it just helps with the epicness and all. Everything should be big in Warhammer, I think. But yeah, we have from 40 centimeters to 40 meters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Obviously this series started with Relic. Have you had any conversations with Relic to learn what the important aspects of the character of Dawn of War was so that you could carry that legacy on?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Theysen: </strong>Well, we didn't call them or talk to them directly. Basically what we did is we went back to all the games, but then specifically Dawn of War 1. We tried to figure out what makes this game tick. The first question was, are we going with Dawn of War 1 or 2? Because both of them are great games, but very different. And we said, ‘Okay, Dawn of War 1 it is.’ And then the question is, ‘Okay, what makes Dawn of War 1, Dawn of War 1?’ It's actually even more complicated because you can't just go back to that game, take a feature, and put it in your game and expect that it still works or that it evokes the same feelings and emotions, because it's 20 years old and stuff changes. And so basically what we really try to do is figure out how you felt 20 years ago when you played the game, and how can we make sure that it feels like that again. And so yeah, we did that a lot and figured out, what is our version of something that they did 20 years ago?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Generally when Relic launched its games, it told a short story in the CGI trailer, whereas yours is a montage of all of these many things. Is it because you wanted a montage, or is that a montage of cinematics from the game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Theysen: </strong>It's a little bit of both. We have four CGI [cinematics], so one CGI for each of the campaigns and each of the characters. And then inside the campaigns we have something like 40 minutes of 3D cutscenes. Basically what the trailer is showing is shots from the different CGI intros with this little bit of the framework story, the outline.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Games Workshop is quite protective of its IP. Have you had any conversations where they were like, “Oh, that animation you've done doesn't quite work?”</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Theysen: </strong>I think first of all, we are totally aligned with them, that we say the game should feel like Warhammer, right? So the look and feel is very important, and it's Warhammer but it’s also Dawn of War, right? So we basically said, ‘Okay, we definitely want to make sure that it feels right.’ </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then of course the whole IP is so complex, and there's so much stuff in there that even if you're a big fan, you don't know everything. And so what happens a lot is basically we ask them about this weapon: ‘Lore wise it says this, but in this game it looks like this. What colour is the beam supposed to be?’ Or whatever it is. And with that stuff they're great, because then they basically run into the archive and then send the references. And of course in the end they look over everything, they look over all the assets and so on, and make sure that they actually look on form and meet their expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: In the press release, it says Dawn of War 4 is set many years after the events of Dark Crusade. Are the narratives of Dawn of War 2 and 3 being acknowledged, or are you doing a soft reboot?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Theysen: </strong>I think our approach was more that we wanted these campaigns to be kind of nonlinear, so that you sometimes can pick between different missions and so on. And for that we needed a planet. So we said, ‘Okay, we want a world map where you can basically select different missions and so on, and also where there can be world map dialogues from Dawn of War 2.’ And so we basically thought about what we could do. And that was actually something that Games Workshop suggested: ‘Why not go back to [the Dark Crusade setting of] Kronus? Wouldn't that be an interesting thing?’ Well, yeah, that would be cool, because Kronus is basically on the wrong side of the Great Rift. That also feels great for our story because the Blood Ravens are now scattered in the Nhilus Sector, and it's basically they go back to this planet that is kind of connected to them in the hope of maybe finding recruits, or finding brothers that made their way back to the planet as well. But then it’s 40k, and of course everything goes totally wrong, but we felt it's a nice idea to go back there. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And in terms of connections to the previous games, we assume that the Space Marines won the Dark Crusade, so that is now our canon. And the other stuff [from Dawn of War 2 and 3] happened, but it's not really a big part of the story we tell, because now we tell four different stories from four different perspectives. They all have this overarching narrative, but it's not all about the Blood Ravens. And so it's more about what happens now on this planet, and why is everybody on the planet, and all that stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I think everybody's going to be asking where the hell is Gabriel Angelos? Where is he?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Theysen: </strong>That was actually one of the decisions we made relatively early. We don't want Gabriel Angelos in the game. Because for us, he felt a little bit overpowered, and it's a little bit weird to have either this slightly overpowered character from the beginning of the game, which is a little bit off, or you have to do, ‘Oh, well, he lost his memory and he lost all his power,’ which is also a weird trope. And so we basically said we want more “normal” heroes. So we have Cyrus and we have Jonah coming back, but they're all more like, power level-wise, more similar to normal units.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: The other thing people may be surprised about is that there’s no Chaos.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Theysen: </strong>That was actually one of the things of course we discussed, but there are basically… ‘story reasons,’ let's say… why maybe Chaos would be a better fit later in this whole thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-dawn-of-war-4-interview-how-a-new-developer-took-on-warhammer-40000s-flagship-rts-why-it-returns-to-kronus-and-why-chaos-isnt-here-yet]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Disgraced Hollywood actor Kevin Spacey was "a little weird" on the set of Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, game director Glen Schofield said, adding that the controversy surrounding the Oscar-winner does not "taint the game" overall.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/kevin-spacey-got-a-little-weird-on-the-set-of-call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-we-all-had-to-fake-laugh/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, Schofield said he wanted Spacey to play the villain, Jonathan Irons, even though he understood that Spacey was not well-versed in gaming. Despite that, Schofield applauded Spacey's acting chops, saying he gave an "unbelievable" performance in Advanced Warfare.</p><p>"He just is a great actor," Schofield said. "Then when we said cut, you could tell the video games weren't his thing. We had to get him a trailer. So he had a trailer outside that he would go in and he was a little bit more difficult, I would say. There's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdu-cxCUYw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a speech where he talks about democracy</a>, and that's just a really amazing speech."</p><p>Schofield went on to say that Spacey "got a little weird once in a while on the set," adding that the actor would say things "that just weren't proper."</p><p>"We all had to fake laugh. There was some stuff," Schofield said, without elaborating.</p><p>Advanced Warfare was released in November 2014. At the time, Spacey was a top talent in Hollywood, riding the success of Netflix's House of Cards. In 2017, actor Anthony Rapp accused Spacey of sexual misconduct, with others coming forward after him. Spacey denied the charges and was acquitted of sexual assault charges and was found not liable in the Rapp case.</p><p>Schofield said it was possible Spacey could have come back for a potential Advanced Warfare 2 despite his character's death, but he was happy with how things turned out ultimately. "We were going to go there," Schofield said. "I'm glad we didn't, because it was like two months before we would have shipped when the scandal broke."</p><p>The next Call of Duty game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Black Ops 7</a>, and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/meet-call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-star-studded-cast/2900-6893/" data-ref-id="2900-6893">features a lot of celebrities</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware have announced a new difficulty mode for&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, and this one aims to test the mettle of even the most hardened Nightfarer.</p>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-high-difficulty-expedition-mode-deep-of-night-has-appeared" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a news post</a> on the game's official website,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s Deep of Night difficulty update will arrive on September 11th (that's two weeks from now at time of writing). It's a "high-difficulty challenge mode" designed for those who have seen everything&nbsp;<em>Nightreign </em>currently has to offer.</p>

<p>Naturally, in Deep of Night, you'll face stronger enemies than you normally would. Not only that, but you won't be able to choose which Nightlord you're facing, so you won't know which of&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s bosses you'll need to prepare for.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-of-night-difficulty-castle.jpg?itok=KPefjiWm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-of-night-difficulty-castle.jpg?itok=SCQaUUQW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is getting a brand new difficulty mode in two weeks' time.</figcaption></figure><p>Terrain changes in your base&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>campaign (i.e. the appearance of certain extra land features) won't be reflected in Deep of Night, so you won't be able to use the mode to pursue some of your characters' objectives, it seems.</p>

<p>If you decide to play on the new difficulty setting, you'll be able to gain special Depths Relics exclusive to the mode, as well as weapons that come with "multiple additional, but also detrimental effects".</p>

<p>What's more, difficulty increases with each "descent"; FromSoftware and Bandai Namco say that wins and losses will affect your Deep of Night rating. Presumably, the more wins you accrue, the higher the difficulty will become.</p>

<p>The real endpoint for Deep of Night is depth level 3; after that, depths 4 and 5 offer "an endless battle for those seeking even greater thrills", so they're essentially true roguelike modes for those who like to test their resolve.</p>

The game sees players teaming up to beat bosses known as Nightlords by exploring a randomized map over the course of a three-day cycle.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>may be a hit, but&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is no slouch in and of itself; according to Bandai Namco's latest numbers, the game has managed to accrue <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-nightreign-sales" rel="nofollow">over five million sales</a>.</p>

            <p>You know what, I'm going to bare all: I've still yet to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> beyond the hour or so I played at a preview event, during which I approximately deemed it "a pretty tidy slice of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> with some cheeky QTEs on the side", but certainly not the diamond-plated GOTY candidate <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">described by Nic in his review</a>. As is my rotten nature, my desire to see what all the fuss is about is proportionately lower for knowing that they're going to make a sequel - or at least, some rather substantial-sounding DLC. Ugh, I have even more to catch up on now. Why do the gods mock me.</p><!--more-->
<p>That's according to creative director Guillaume Broche, following on from lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sandfall-have-no-plans-for-more-clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-yet-but-chances-are-good-anyway">remarks in May</a> that "chances are good" that Expedition 33 will have some kind of successor.</p>
<p>"Clair Obscur is the franchise name," said Broche to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZEP5kjw-w4">Youtuber MrMattyPlays</a> this week, as detected by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-teases-potential-sequel-dlc/">The Gamer</a>. "Expedition 33 is one of the stories that we want to tell in this franchise. Exactly what it will look like and what the concept will be is still too soon to announce, but what is sure is that this is not the end of the Clair Obscur franchise."</p>
<p>For context, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 takes place in a society that is being gradually obliterated by an all-powerful Paintress. Every year, she paints a number on her canvas, and everybody that age or older is wiped from existence. The titular expedition 33 are the latest in a series of increasingly junior warriors who set forth each year to slay the mad artiste. I don't know any of the story's endings, but I imagine there's scope, at least, for some melancholy prequel stories involving expeditions 34-75. </p><p>I know far more about the kerfuffle surrounding Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's development team size than I do the plot of the game. It's been repeatedly enshrined as evidence that smaller outfits are the magical panacea for an industry currently prone to laying thousands of people off. As Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-clair-obscur-expedition-33-wasnt-made-by-30-people">wrote last year</a>, the much-quoted figure of 30 or so core developers is rather disingenuous - it ignores an external animation team, many of the musicians who worked on the killer soundtrack, and dozens of localisation, QA and voice production staff.</p>
<p>Geez fine, I'll play it already. It's not that long, right? Brisk little 30 hour campaign, yes? Nothing I need to take time off for?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>What the heck is going on with file sizes? With each passing year, we’ve seen them ballooning larger and larger to some real unreasonable levels. <em>Oblivion: Remastered</em> which released earlier this year comes in at over 120GB. No one will be shocked when <em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>doubles that. And while these game sizes keep going up, the Xbox Series X remains at a measly 1TB. So if you want to play more than just a small handful of titles without constantly deleting and redownloading your games, you’re going to need expansion storage.&nbsp; <strong>Seagate has an external drive specifically made for the Xbox Series X and Series S. </strong>Right now, it’s on sale for 19% off. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3767/">It’s usually priced at $160, so after the $30 savings, you only need to pay $130 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><strong>You can double your Xbox Series X storage capacity with the help of this Seagate expansion drive, adding another 1TB of useable space</strong>. Now you’re working with two full terabytes, baby. It’s super easy to setup. Unlike the PlayStation 5 expansion cards, this one doesn’t require opening up the casing to get all up inside the inner bits. It’s simple plug and play. Just stick the Seagate drive into the slot on the backend of your Xbox and you’ll be able to start downloading games right to it or moving them from your internal drive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3767/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Play Games Seamlessly</h2>
<p>Seagate developed this external drive in partnership with Xbox and Microsoft, officially licensing the Xbox Velocity Architecture. That technology is used in Xbox Series X allows players to utilize Quick Resume, a feature enabling Xbox games to be running simultaneously.</p>
<p>On the Xbox Series X, you can hop between different games on the fly. So if you’re mid-race in <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, you can pause to go drop in with your pals for a quick Fortnite session. then continue the race when you’re done. You’ll never see a title screen again.</p>



<p>So because this architecture has been licensed from Microsoft, you can take advantage of Quick Resume and all the other benefits of Xbox’s enhanced memory and storage when playing games off of the Seagate expansion card. You’ll find no changes in performance when playing games off the expansion card versus off the Xbox’s internal drive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3767/">For a limited time, you can pick up the Seagate expansion drive for Xbox, increasing your storage by 1TB for a discounted rate</a>. It’s down from $160 to just $130.</p>

<h2 id="h-space-marine-2-year-2-roadmap-details">Space Marine 2 – Year 2 Roadmap Details</h2>



<p>As mentioned, <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/255-take-a-look-at-the-year-2-roadmap-and-the-anniversary-update-s-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the new updates</a> will come starting on September 4 with Patch 10, the game’s largest update to date.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hell-is-us-game-pass/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-hell-is-us-coming-to-xbox-game-pass.1282995/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The month of September is stacked full of huge releases, with Hell Is Us among them, and in such a busy month, it pays to know which games are included in a Game Pass subscription to save you money.</p>



<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hell-is-us-release-date-explained-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 4</a>, Hell Is Us is landing in a hectic period of releases, alongside the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a>, and the flurry of top-class games landing mere days apart will stretch anyone’s wallet.</p>



<p>In these situations, a Game Pass subscription can come in handy by reducing your gaming shopping list, and we’ve got all the details on whether Hell Is Us is joining the service.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-hell-is-us-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Hell Is Us on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No luck. Credit to Nacon</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Hell Is Us will not be available to play through an Xbox Game Pass subscription when it launches on September 4th.</strong></p>



<p>Hell Is Us is not a first-party Xbox title, which would mean automatic inclusion in the service, and there hasn’t been any announcement of the game being added to the service.</p>



<p>While the full wave of <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Pass</a> releases for September has not been announced by Microsoft, major launches like Hell Is Us are usually given a significant fanfare if they are coming to the service well in advance of release. As we’ve not seen any such news, don’t expect to see the game in the catalog.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-hell-is-us-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Hell Is Us Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>There is no news on whether Hell Is Us will come to the Xbox Game Pass service in the future, though it cannot be ruled out.</strong></p>



<p>Developer Rogue Factor does not have previous history of release titles, like Necromunda: Underhive Wars and Mordheim: City of the Damned, onto the Game Pass service. Therefore, it’s difficult to predict what any future approach with Hell Is Us will be.</p>



<p>Game Pass does open up titles to a wider audience, however, so the appeal for inclusion is clear, despite the heavy criticism the service as faced from some in the industry.</p>



<p>One likely thing, however, is that Hell Is Us will have a long wait before any Game Pass inclusion is considered, as big launches like this often have a significant delay before they join services like Game Pass.</p>



<p>Have you marked Hell Is Us on your calendar for September? What are you most excited for? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

We learned about <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/21/mega-victreebel-is-coming-to-pokemon-legends-z-a">Mega Victreebel</a> last week and now, Mega Hawlucha joins the roster.&nbsp;</p><p>"Hawlucha, an entertainer flexing the strength of its pumped-up muscles, is ready to prove there's even more to its showboating style through Mega Evolution," a press release reads. "Bulked by Mega Evolution, it uses its muscles to take hit after hit from opponents' moves and flex its own strength. After luring its opponent into attacking, it retaliates to make them flinch before diving at them using its signature move, Flying Press, to aim for victory."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check out Mega Hawlucha in the new video below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xt4ccSMw870"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xt4ccSMw870" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>To celebrate Mega Hawlucha and the upcoming launch of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, The Pokémon Company International has partnered with Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) to host a special event at Arena México in Mexico City on September 25 at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET. The showcase will feature four exhibition matches with top lucha libre wrestlers, including Místico, and tickets will be available soon. If you can't attend the event in person, it will be streamed live on the official Pokémon and CMLL channels.&nbsp;</p><p>Mega Hawlucha will appear in Pokémon Legends: Z-A when it launches on Switch and Switch 2 on October 16.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, read our hands-on preview with the game to learn why <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/20/pokemon-legends-z-a-could-be-the-best-pokemon-game-in-years">it might be the best Pokémon game in years</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lately, every time I boot up my PC to play a game I end up playing <a href="https://www.buffalobuffalo.ca/games/freshtracks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fresh Tracks</em></a>, a fantasy skiing rhythm roguelike where you dodge obstacles, slash through bad guys, and take on bosses. The music rules. It’s stuffed with story and characters. The menus are full of lovely details and satisfying button presses. It has snow. I’m astonishingly bad at it, largely because I am wretched at rhythm games, but I’m loving it anyway.</p><p>You play as Skaii, who travels through the game’s snowy world to enlist various gods, called Mythics, to help them on their quest to defeat Mar, the god of terror, who has sucked the life out of the people of fantasy world Norwyn. The Mythics you enlist provide not just different abilities and new music tracks, but different narration that tells you more about Norwyn and its connection to music and adventure. It can be a lot to take in when you’re also focused on the rhythm game of it all, but repeated runs through levels gave me additional chances to pick up on what I missed, and there’s more lore to discover in the game’s menus.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Fresh Tracks - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FBs3r7FgJI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Fresh Tracks</em> is structured like a roguelike: you pick from a selection of songs as you go through a run, with their different difficulty levels charmingly stylized as the green circle, blue square, and black diamond of a ski slope. Each level will give you a randomized boon, like an extra jump or a damage buffer that stays with you through your run. You pick up currency called Whyspers as you travel, which can be spent on more buffs at merchant levels, as well as a permanent currency called Ekkos that you spend on practice tracks and new permanent equipment like skis. When you die, you start again without your temporary buffs and Whyspers, but you keep your Ekkos.</p><p>I only just beat the first boss last night, giving me access to a new Mythic who introduces new songs and a new, tougher version of their boss level. While you’ll hear the same songs multiple times, I found the difference between a medium and hard version of its level to feel like more than enough variety, especially when the songs cover so many different genres. I thought my favorites were the chill dance-pop numbers of my earlier runs (some of which, delightfully, feature lyrics that correspond to the moves you have to make on screen), but once I unlocked my first Mythic I started getting blazing death metal tracks that <em>now</em> I think are my favorites. There are 28 original songs, and I often find myself singing them when I’m not at my computer.&nbsp;</p><p>In the levels themselves, you dodge, duck, and jump over obstacles; lean through narrow gaps, and attack bad guys and deflect arrows with your sword. The early version of that sword, once its ability is fully filled through powerups and perfect timing, refills your health, but the new sword I earned for beating the first boss uses its ability to unleash a wave of fire. Levels can get busy; in harder levels, I found myself jumping and slashing together, or fending off enemies while frantically dodging obstacles, and on occasion I felt like I had to do way too many things at once. But this also makes each level feel like a real adventure and gives a sense of accomplishment when you overcome it, especially the much longer boss levels. Some levels throw weather into the mix; I keep returning to the practice area to play through song “The Blizzard” on repeat, the level of which features fog, water, and death metal.&nbsp;</p><p>The amount of story and special lingo–Whyspers, Ekkos, Mythics, and the like–can sometimes make things a little confusing. The game’s menu, for instance, is called the “Memory Palace;” when I was reading through the tutorials for where some more specialized difficulty options were, this lingo made me a little confused as to where to actually <em>find</em> the thing I was looking for. But not being taken out of the game’s world when I wanted to fiddle with v-sync or practice a song is a nice touch, even if it added an extra moment of “what was that again?” to my time. This might be very me praise, but the button prompts in the menus have a lovely weight to them that makes even the act of starting a run really satisfying.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Fresh Tracks - Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LNFtluWmfso?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>My biggest complaint about <em>Fresh Tracks</em> is how wildly bad at it I am, something that has kept me from writing up the game even though I’ve had it for a while. There is something about my brain that just cannot comprehend rhythm games, despite the fact that I’m a lifelong musician who can passably play five instruments and wants to learn a bunch more. I never quite understand what I’m <em>doing</em> in them, how my button presses correspond to <em>playing</em> the song; I’m not playing the melody, or the percussion, and I frequently don’t understand how my actions relate to the beat I can hear and, via <em>Fresh Tracks</em>’ visual indicator, see. This is 100% a me problem, and something I bring up here despite my fear of being laughed off the gaming internet in hopes that one of you is a musician and/or rhythm game designer who will write a trenchant comment that will resolve my long-standing mental block slash existential crisis of “but what <em>is</em> a rhythm game?” so that I can enjoy this genre that I really should not find so baffling.</p><p>So maybe it’s high praise for <em>Fresh Tracks</em> that I’m playing it so much despite the fact that I sometimes pause it to go noodle on my mandolin to remind myself that, no, I do know what <em>music</em> is. It’s an absolutely charming game from top to bottom, packed with attention and detail, stuffed with story and clever touches. It’s Canadian studio <a href="https://www.buffalobuffalo.ca/games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Buffalo Buffalo’</a>s first game, and I’m excited to see what else they do. <em>Fresh Tracks</em> is out now on Steam and PS5.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ai-suffering-chatgpt"><h3>AI Can’t Suffer, But It Should Suffer For This</h3></a><p>It's the sentience of AI's creators that really matters</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grimwild-backerkit-ttrpg-rpg-designer-missing"><h3>RPG Designer Goes Missing After Crowdfunding Award-Winning Game</h3></a><p>'Fulfilment of the project appears to be on hold indefinitely until Maxwell can be located'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/fresh-tracks-impressions]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f6e57b3256915/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The latest boxed charts from Japan are now available thanks to <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202508/50866">Famitsu</a>, and as expected, Nintendo's first-party line-up for Switch 2 is doing particularly well.</p>
<p>Specifically, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> remain unchanged at the top, selling a further 30,202 and 8,424 copies respectively. We'd like to see those lifetime sales for Bananza climb a little higher, but it's a solid performance, at least.</p>
<p>The only newcomer this week is <strong>Tetsudou Nippon! RealPro Tokyo-Kanagawa! Tokyu Dentetsu Hen</strong> at number ten, selling a total of 2,497 units on Switch. In fact, there are no games from either PlayStation or Xbox in the top ten; it's a Nintendo clean sheet!</p>
<p>Here's a closer look at this week's top 10:</p>

<hr>
<p>Figures are down from last time with hardware; mostly because we're looking at one week's worth of sales data instead of two. Regardless, both the Switch and the Switch 2 are absolutely dominating, with the latter sitting pretty at the top with 35,359 units sold.</p>
<p>Combining all three SKUs, Switch sold a total of 17,945 units this week, while the PS5 managed to shift a total of 6,428, which means the Switch wasn't too far off shifting <em>three times</em> as many consoles.</p>
<p>Xbox, meanwhile..? Well, look, they're trying. We can give them that.</p>
<p><em>(It goes without saying that healthy sales across the board is good for everybody; our jibes toward PlayStation and Xbox is all in good fun.)</em></p>
