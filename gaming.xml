            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-series-sales-100-million-anniversary<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced a major sales milestone for the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series as a whole, which feels like a fitting birthday present for the franchise's 20th anniversary.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240514.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a>, Capcom reveals that&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>has crossed 100 million sales across the entire franchise, a figure to which entries like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-world-celebrates-13-million-sales-with-big-bonus-for-players">World</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-rise-13-million-sales">Rise</a></em>, as well as their respective expansions,&nbsp;have significantly contributed.</p>
<p>In fact, a quick glance at Capcom's <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">"Platinum Titles" list</a>, which celebrates Capcom games that have sold more than a million units, shows that&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter World&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise&nbsp;</em>are the two best-selling games in the studio's history.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-world-series-sales.jpg?itok=jUHFD0XN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-world-series-sales.jpg?itok=WJdnFtsf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>has crossed the 100 million sales mark.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Capcom,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter World&nbsp;</em>has sold over a million copies each year since the game was released, and sales for the game now stand at more than 25 million units (if the&nbsp;<em>Iceborn Master Edition&nbsp;</em>version is also counted).</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>, meanwhile, which was released back in 2021, has sold "over approximately 2 million units annually" since its launch, and its expansion&nbsp;<em>Sunbreak</em>, which was released the following year,&nbsp;has done the same.</p>
<p>Capcom says that together with the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>announcement <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/capcom-teases-monster-hunter-wilds-at-game-awards-2023">made last year</a>, these figures have helped drive the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>franchise to its 100-million-sale milestone. More&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>info is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-summer-capcom">coming in summer</a>, too, so perhaps interest in the series will be renewed once again then.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-series-sales.jpg?itok=91ntslzU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-series-sales.jpg?itok=PM8nsYIi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>game is rumbling into town soon.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series began all the way back in 2004 with the original&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>, and many sequels and spinoffs followed, spanning four console generations.</p>
<p>As well as the regular action-RPG series,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>has also dabbled in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-stories-2-announced-for-ps4-monster-hunter-stories-release-date-revealed">turn-based RPGs</a> and&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go</em>-style <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-now-is-niantics-new-real-world-game-partnership-with-capcom">augmented reality mobile games</a>, among other genres. It's also made the jump to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-movie-arrives-on-blu-ray-march-2021">live-action feature films</a> and anime, as well as crossing over with franchises like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-x-zoids-collaboration-revealed-with-actual-zoids-inspired-by-rathalos">nostalgia-riffic&nbsp;<em>Zoids</em></a>.</p>
<p>We'll learn more about the future of the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>franchise in the coming months. For now, though, if you're a&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>fan, you can rest easy in the knowledge that you're far from alone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-alpha-3-23-update-is-live-adding-nvidia-dlss-amd-fsr/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Star Citizen has received one of its most extensive updates yet, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-team-introduces-fps-combat-improvements-coming-in-alpha-3-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alpha 3.23</a>, featuring many additions such as NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and a custom implementation of TSR (Temporal Super Resolution).</p>
<p>The Alpha 3.23 update also brings in a new selection of "first native wildlife" and several improvements and enhancements to the overall game mechanics.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alpha 3.23: Adventure Beckons" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FMgmo8Dfslk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Meet the Wildlife, Marok and Kopian:&nbsp;</strong>Life finds a way.&nbsp;<strong>Star Citizen’s&nbsp;</strong>first native animals have been added to the game, complete with bespoke behaviors fitting their evolutionary paths. Players will begin seeing the small marok bird soaring through the skies, using its proportionally enormous wingspan to travel vast distances with ease as it follows migratory fish. With the addition of humans to their habitat, they’ve been observed feeding on refuse and leftovers as well. While they present no threat to humans, the same can’t be said for the hound-like kopian. This pest creature is more than a nuisance, and brave citizens will be charged with dealing with wild packs of these hounds, just be sure to bring plenty of ammo.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Mirai’s Pulse and Pulse LX Hoverbikes Brings Portable Thrills:&nbsp;</strong>It’s about the journey, the thrill. Mirai adds its signature fusion of advanced technology and functional elegance with a pair of hoverbikes that offer an unparalleled connection between rider and machine. The Mirai Pulse pushes the boundaries for what an ‘all round’ hoverbike can be, combining integrated light weapons for defense with an ultra-light frame and extreme performance capable of outrunning almost anything it can’t outgun. Shedding its weapons to improve speed and handling, the Pulse LX is a visual spectacle that brings racing prowess and sophisticated styling. Both hoverbikes are extremely portable, fitting in almost any ship’s cargo bay for terrestrial exploration almost anywhere.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Master Modes Makes its Galactic Debut:</strong>&nbsp;Flying in the ‘verse will never be the same again. Originally tested in patch 3.20, Master Modes is designed to add further intensity and strategy to ship-to-ship combat and foster exciting dogfighting scenarios. All ships now function in either Navigation Mode (NAV) maintaining a spooled quantum drive for both manual quantum travel and quick-travel to specific locations while disabling most offensive and defensive capabilities, and Standard Control Mode (SCM), with full access to weapons, shields, and devices at the cost of considerable speed. Transitioning between modes takes the flip of a switch and a few seconds for systems to power down and up respectively. All ships have been re-tuned for this significant change to space flight.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Welcome to the Distribution Center:</strong>&nbsp;Adventure Beckons&nbsp;introduces the first iteration of distribution centers throughout the Stanton system. These massive structures can be accessed from the planetary surface, with underground levels to open in later updates, and serve as mission hubs for law abiding players. Personal ground transportation is recommended for traversing these immense establishments, especially as they expand with additional underground levels.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Fly, Shoot, and Problem Solve in Arena Commander:&nbsp;</strong>New maps and gameplay opportunities have arrived in&nbsp;<strong>Star Citizen’s</strong>&nbsp;‘game within a game’. Miner’s Lament is a close-quarters dogfighter's dream come true, or worst nightmare, as pilots fight through the asteroid-laden ring around Yela where the rocks are as deadly as other pilots. Going inside, a temporary Experimental Engineering Mode is available for citizens eager to test out the first iteration of engineering gameplay shown off at CitizenCon 2953, and their feedback will help shape the ongoing development of the system.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Plot a Course with the Star Map:&nbsp;</strong>The Star Map has reached its 1.0 update, rolling out a full 3D view of the system to all pilots. Locations can now be searched by name, with additional functionality to automatically plot a course from the present location. The update marks the introduction of a brand-new FPS map for boots on the ground, aiding players to navigate sprawling landing zones or even the interior layout of their ship. With the Star Map, a citizen is never truly lost.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>FPS Combat Upgrades Deliver More Immersion:&nbsp;</strong>Outside of the safety of a cockpit the ‘verse can be a dangerous place, and&nbsp;Adventure Beckons&nbsp;ensures that fighting and surviving is as engaging and enjoyable on foot as it is from ship to ship. FPS combat has never looked or felt more authentic thanks to a range of visual improvements including improved sprinting animations and a new dynamic crosshair option for a more realistic look of exactly where the muzzle of a weapon is aimed at. The feel of combat has been enhanced for additional immersion, with the inclusion of ‘backpack reloading’ for slower access to additional stored magazines, and procedural recoil for all weapons, ensuring every engagement is a truly unique experience.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>New Cloud Tech and Visual Options:&nbsp;</strong>The volumetric cloud technology in&nbsp;<strong>Star Citizen</strong>&nbsp;has been updated to improve both performance and visual quality, adding ground fog and volumetric shadows as visual options. Additional performance improvements come with support for image upscaling solutions including DLSS, FSR, and an in-house developed TSR solution. Following the addition of over 20 new hairstyles in Alpha 3.22, the character customization system has been overhauled with a new user interface and many new additional customization options.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Welcoming New Players to all Landing Zones:&nbsp;</strong>The improved New Player Experience, originally released for Area18 in Alpha 3.19, has been expanded and is now supported on all starting locations. While the same core skills are taught at each location, new players can now choose to begin high in the cloud city of Orison, in the mining town of Lorville owned and operated by Hurston Dynamics, on New Babbage which is both a bustling major trading hub and home to high-end electronic companies, or back at Area18’s urban downtown where bright lights attract commerce and entertainment.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>With the Alpha 3.23 dropping in, one can expect a revamped experience, and the addition of exciting in-game content is undoubtedly a delight to witness.</p>

			<p>Microsoft has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/14/xbox-game-pass-may-2024-wave-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the new Xbox Game Pass games coming to the service in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-and-sniper-ghost-warrior-contracts-2-confirmed-to-be-coming-to-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knew that Lords of the Fallen would be added</a> to Microsoft's subscription service at some point, but as now confirmed, the 2023 title from Hexworks will be added to Game Pass by the end of the month on May 30. In addition, another interesting title that might do well on Game Pass is Ascendant Studios' magic shooter Immortals of Aveum - the game was already added to PlayStation Plus last month, and last year, the<a href="https://wccftech.com/immortals-of-aveum-xbox-game-pass-ps-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> studio's CEO already suggested that the title would be coming to Game Pass as well</a>. "Yes, we are talking to them about getting the game onto both of those services", the CEO said last year. "We don't have a date yet, I'm pretty sure it's gonna happen, though". Immortals of Aveum is being added to the service on May 16.</p>
<p>Other games that will be coming to Game Pass in the coming weeks include Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons (today), Chants of Sennaar (tomorrow), NHL 24 on May 16th, Senua's Saga: Hellblade II (day one on May 21), Galacticare and Hauntii on May 23, Moving Out 2 on May 28, Humanity on May 30, and both Firework and Rolling Hills on June 4.</p>
<p>Games that will be leaving Microsoft's service on May 31 are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Chicory: A Colorful Tale&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li><em>Farworld Pioneers&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li><em>JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li><em>Pac-man Museum Plus</em>&nbsp;(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li><em>Little Witch in the Woods&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li><em>Railway Empire II&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Are you interested in the new titles joining the Game Pass library? Will you be checking out Lords of the Fallen and Immortals of Aveum? And what about the highly-anticipated sequel to 2017's Hellblade - <a href="https://wccftech.com/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-comparison-visuals-improved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hellblade II</a>?

<p id="DDATjj"><em>Chants of Sennaar</em>, the award-winning language puzzle game, lands May 16 but is far from the only major game coming to the service that day.

<p id="RSN2li">Later in the month, expect a day-one release of Ninja Theory’s <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2, </em>but you won’t want to miss <em>Immortals of Aveum</em> or <em>Chants of Sennaar </em>either. As for <em>NHL 24</em>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24131925/xbox-game-pass-april-lineup-ea-sports-nhl-24-manor-lords">console gamers got access in April</a>, but it’ll be available via cloud gaming now, too.</p>

Every time I so much as see a clip of <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, I’m reminded that Capcom’s hallmark fighting series is so back, and I wish I had the time to stay on that ride for the long run. But I recently got a chance to play Akuma, the classic antagonist who mirrors series mainstays Ryu and Ken’s Shoto archetype, and he made me appreciate how well this entry managed to fill out old characters’ arsenals to create one of the most robust fighting games in the space.<br></p><div data-video-id="191017" data-monetizable="false" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Hopefully Street Fighter 6's New Open-World Won't Mean Capcom Skimps On The Fighting" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="104" data-playlist="191017,192531,194842" data-current="191017"><div><p>Hopefully Street Fighter 6's New Open-World Won't Mean Capcom Skimps On The Fighting</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191017/191017_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191017/191017_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191017/191017_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191017/191017_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/17131.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>As a Shoto character, Akuma has a lot of staple <em>Street Fighter </em>abilities like the Hadoken fireball and Tatsumaki spinning kick (albeit with a handy, anti-air variation) that is the bread and butter of the archetype. But as a Ryu main, playing a different Shoto always feels like getting behind the wheel of a car I’m not used to driving. The fundamentals are the same, but it’s just different enough to throw me off. Akuma’s whole deal is that he gets more options at the expense of health. He’s a glass cannon, but in exchange he gets even more versatility in an already flexible fighting style.</p><p>While playing Akuma, I initially fell into the muscle memory of my hundreds of hours playing Ryu, but those slight variations would send my mind racing to new strategies. His air-based fireball and upward Tatsumaki kept me going high where I would normally have gone low, though I was swiftly punished for this in the right matchups. Facing Cammy was a particular pain point, as she could easily counter my air-based plays.</p><p>Watching <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIPTOVx6pls&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIPTOVx6pls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capcom’s character breakdown</a></span> for Akuma demonstrates all the little nuances of his moveset I couldn’t pick up in just an hour of play, and that’s the kind of sicko shit that makes fighting games, and <em>Street Fighter 6</em> especially, so rewarding to dive into. Button-mashing through a character you’ve never played can be fun, but mastering a character makes the game so gratifying. <em>SF6</em>’s strength was in how it filled out its roster’s movesets and gave them universal tools like the Drive abilities that handled basic utilities like parrying. This freed up development space for each character’s unique abilities and gimmicks to shine through. Akuma is thriving under that design philosophy, and even if I don’t end up dropping my main for him, I want to learn his every move to best him online.</p><p>How many times can I tell myself “it’s time to go back to <em>Street Fighter 6</em>” before I finally do it? Maybe not too many more, as Akuma is launching as DLC on May 22. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to an interview <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ex-xcom-creative-director-founds-life-sim-maker-midsummer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with GamesIndustry.biz</a>, former XCOM developer Jake Solomon and other industry veterans launched Midsummer Studios to make a life sim.</p>



<p>Soloman is CEO and creative director of Midsummer Studios. They’re also working with Will Miller, another developer who worked at Firaxis. Nelsie Birch will lend their expertise and serve as COO and CFO. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/sbergel/status/1790374766945194130" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter, Transcend’s Shanti Bergel announced their “lead investment in the oversubscribed $6M Seed round for Midsummer Studios.”</p>



<p>Reports from multiple outlets include further details about Midsummer Studio’s goals and life sim game. Solomon told GamesIndustry.biz that “what we’re really focusing on is the story aspect.” </p>



<p>The CEO showed a lot of interest in letting players make meaningful choices, with rewards and consequences. They mentioned the “drama of modern life and the conflict of modern life.”</p>



<p>Solomon also noted that “I think the danger would be if I was competing with The Sims feature-for-feature.” They say that “we have to do what we do really well; we just have to do it in a new space.” </p>



<p>In a report <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/firaxis-veterans-announce-new-studio-midsummer-studio-to-reinvent-the-life-sim-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by VGC</a>, Solomon reiterated the modern life approach with meaningful stories, but added that players could “share those stories with the world.” </p>



<p>It will also reportedly be a next-gen title, according to a statement made <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-xcom-director-jake-solomon-making-a-next-gen-life-sim" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via IGN</a>. At this early stage, Midsummer Studios has not confirmed a title or release window for the life sim game.</p>

In doing so, Sony sold more than any fiscal year since the console's launch in November 2020. However, despite that achievement, Sony still fell short of its original PS5 sales target for this year, missing it by more than 4 million units.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Originally targeting 25 million units for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, Sony sold 20.8 million, bringing the grand total up to 59 million, despite the 4 million units miss. As noted by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ps5-hits-59m-as-helldivers-2-breaks-playstations-launch-sales-record/"><em>VideoGamesChronicle</em></a>, however, Sony revised that 25 million unit target in February to just 21 million; it still didn't hit that target, though, just narrowly missing the mark.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xq4XNbH6mtk" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>At 59 million units, the PS5 is just behind the PlayStation 4's 60 million units at the same point in its life cycle. However, Tokyo-based video game analyst Serkan Toto told&nbsp;<em>VGC&nbsp;</em>that 20.8 million units sold is likely going to remain the peak for the PS5, and that this number would have been much lower if not for the release of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> in February, which is <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/14/helldivers-2-is-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever-crossing-12-million-copies">PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever after selling 12 million copies in 12 weeks</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the earnings call, Sony told investors to expect gaming sales to decrease in the fiscal year that just began (and ends March of next year) due to an expected decrease in console sales. There are also no major games from existing franchises releasing between now and then, according to the company. However, Sony says it still plans to release Concord, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/introducing-concord-a-new-pvp-multiplayer-fps-from-firewalk-studios-coming-to-ps5-and-pc/">the new multiplayer online shooter IP from Firewalk Studios coming to PS5 and PC</a>, this year.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/14/former-marvels-midnight-suns-xcom-designer-jake-solomon-announces-new-startup-midsummer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Jake Solomon, former long-time Firaxis designer and director who spearheaded Marvel’s Midnight Suns and was a lead designer on XCOM: Enemy Unknown, has announced he’s formed a new company following his <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/02/17/firaxis-jake-solomon-announces-departure-from-studio">departure from Firaxis last February</a>. Midsummer Studios is a team consisting of veteran Firaxis and Maxis designers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Midsummer was founded by Solomon, who serves as CEO and creative director, game director Will Miller (also formerly of Firaxis), and COO/CFO Nelsie Birch, a newcomer to games with a 25-year career in financial and operations management. They’re joined by executive producer Grant Rodiek, an 18-year veteran of Maxis Studios and former producer/director on several entries of The Sims.&nbsp;In addition to them, the small team currently consists of six other designers.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A5M5i_ygnPo" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>The company’s debut game will be a next-gen life sim that, according to the press release, “emphasizes player-driven narratives, allowing communities to share memorable moments that grow out of the creativity of players themselves.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The best stories in games are written by the players,” said Solomon in the press release. “At Midsummer we’re making a life sim focused on the drama of modern life, where our players will write meaningful stories just by playing, and then share those stories with the world.”</p>

<p>Midsummer has secured a $6 million investment with several partners and is focused on growing a sustainable studio that values the health and happiness of its employees.</p>

<p data-characters="317" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Fallout</em> has been all over the place, lately. While the Amazon Prime TV show has been a triumph (a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fallout-fans-can-relax-as-amazon-confirms-a-second-season-is-on-the-way/">second season</a> was confirmed not long ago), <em>Fallout 4</em> has not been doing so hot. Despite the long wait for the next-gen update, many felt it was severely lacking. But Bethesda seems to want to rectify some of the issues.</p> <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false">The most recent update for the game has now been sent out on all platforms, even previous gen. One of the changes that’s been added is the ability to “manage your control over the game’s graphic fidelity or performance.”</p> <figure data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="200" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false">On top of this, the message above states that Bethesda has also implemented “additional fixes and improvements to address some of the feedback you provided us with on the previous update.”</p> <h2 id="h-will-it-be-enough" data-injectable="false">Will it be enough?</h2> <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="453" data-injectable="true">To go into <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/377160/view/4219387168548816722?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more detail</a>, there appears to have been a focus on three areas when it comes to this version of <em>Fallout 4</em>: display settings, frame rate target, and visual and performance prioritization. For instance, you can choose between 30, 40, and 60fps.</p>
 <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false">As always with patches and updates, Bethesda has fixed more than a few bugs. Some examples include: an “issue with load order that would break DLC until a restart after downloading mods” (PS5, specifically) and an issue that could “cause the Creation Club menu to not appear” in the Microsoft store.</p> <p data-characters="276" data-current-count="599" data-injectable="false">Personally, based on what a lot of people have been saying about the next-gen update, I haven’t even bothered to install it on my Xbox copy. Maybe this latest patch will appease some of the bigger concerns, but many didn’t feel the upgrade was worth the long wait.</p>

Introduced on Tuesday, the new Arctis Nova 5 headset is supported by a dedicated companion app that features over 100 game-specific audio presets for Xbox and PlayStation 5 titles like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Apex Legends</em>, and <em>Minecraft</em>, which SteelSeries says have been “custom-tailored to each game by audio engineers.”</p><p>Available starting today for $129.99, SteelSeries describes the Arctis Nova 5 as an “affordable luxury.” It’s a smidge pricier than the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/16/23725308/steelseries-arctis-nova-4-wireless-headset-price-date">$119.99 Arctis Nova 4 wireless headset</a> launched last year, but for that, you get the ability to change audio presets in real time without leaving a gaming session, as well as cross-platform support for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, PC, Meta Quest, and phones or tablets that support the included USB-C dongle.</p><div><figcaption><em>Users will need to connect their mobile device to the headset via Bluetooth to utilize the companion app’s audio presets.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: SteelSeries</cite></p></div><p>The Nova 5 companion app requires the headset to be connected to a mobile device via Bluetooth, but that shouldn’t interfere with the ability to receive calls mid-game. The “Quick Switch Wireless” feature swaps audio output between 2.4GHz and Bluetooth 5.3 by tapping a button located on one of the earcups, allowing users to take a call via Bluetooth while their in-game audio retains a passive 2.4GHz connection.</p><div><div><figcaption><em>The design isn’t far removed from that of previous Arctis headsets. Note how the microphone slots into the earcup when fully retracted.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: SteelSeries</cite></p></div><div><figcaption><em>And here’s a better look at the Quick Switch Wireless button, seen here on the right earcup.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: SteelSeries</cite></p></div></div><p>SteelSeries says the Arctis Nova 5 can last up to 60 hours per charge and that the headset’s USB-C fast charging can provide six hours of play on a 15-minute charge. It’s powered by neodymium magnetic drivers (which are fairly common in modern headsets), while a new high-bandwidth microphone chipset provides support for 32kHz / 16-bit audio to help keep in-game communications clear.&nbsp;</p><p>The microphone itself retracts into the headset when not in use, blending pretty seamlessly into the earcup. The Nova 5 also supports the same AI noise cancellation feature seen on the Nova 4 to help further reduce background noise in loud environments. Considering the Nova 5 is only an additional $10, the extra perks it provides could sway SteelSeries customers to dig around their couches for loose change to fund the upgrade.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="nSQa6n">If Amazon Studios’ teaser trailer for the second season of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23329258/lord-rings-power-review-episode-release"><em>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</em></a> has one thing to say, it’s that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23342914/lord-rings-power-sauron-halbrand">Sauron is back</a> and it’s everybody’s problem. </p>
<p id="FdiZjC">The teaser checks in with most of our characters from season 1 — Elrond, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23327568/galadriel-the-rings-of-power-actor-lord-of-the-rings">Galadriel</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23330685/rings-of-power-dwarves-rock-lord-lotr-moria">Prince Durin</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23331596/lord-rings-power-arondir-bronwyn-elf-human-romance">Arondir</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23378700/lord-rings-power-adar-tolkien-galadriel-episode-6">Adar</a>, and even <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23403120/rings-power-who-is-stranger-wizard-actor-daniel-weyman">the Stranger</a>. In true “teaser” fashion, it’s light on specific plot details, but a cascade of gold rings — perhaps nine? — and a conspicuously bejeweled ring in the hands of King Durin give a hint at the season’s arc. </p>
<p id="wmDKEy"><em>Rings of Power</em>’s first had a lot of scene setting to do, as Sauron wormed his way into the confidence of elven leadership and put his mitts all over the forging of their three rings of power. Season 2 seems to continue with the two other sets of rings — the seven for the dwarves “in their halls of stone,” and “nine for mortal men doomed to die.” </p>
<p id="xzt3wx">Also: There’s a big eagle! He better talk like the ones in the books because I will not stand for another wave of “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings/22432394/eagles-lotr-plot-hole-mordor">Why didn’t they just ride eagles to Mordor?</a>” I’ve put in my time! </p>
<p id="zOiM43"><em>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</em> will return on Aug. 29, on Amazon Prime Video. </p>

<p>When you hear the word iRacing, you probably think of sim racing and hyper-realism. What doesn’t likely come to mind are words like space, arcade, and off-road. But did you know that iRacing and in-house studio Orontes are developing a racing game with those three words in mind?</p>



<p>Meet ExoCross, <a href="https://www.iracing.com/orontes-games/exocross-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an off-road racing game</a> set roughly 100 years into the future where all forms of fossils fuels and vehicles have been banned on earth. Now, racers are controlling vehicles on other planets in deep space from the comfort of their own home. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming recently sat down with ExoCross creative director Paul Coleman to talk about the game’s development over the years, what players can expect to experience, what will keep them coming back to the game, and so much more.</p>



<p>The written interview is below, but, if you prefer, you can watch or listen to the conversation as well. ExoCross is scheduled to launch this summer on PC, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4.</p>

<h2 id="h-exocross-interview-with-paul-coleman">ExoCross Interview With Paul Coleman</h2>



<h3 id="h-for-those-that-may-not-know-what-exactly-is-exocross">For those that may not know, what exactly is ExoCross?</h3>



<p><strong>Coleman: </strong>“Yeah, so ExoCross is an off-road racing game set in the future; about 100 years into the future.&nbsp;The premise is that the earth was getting too polluted.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cars, all forms of fossil fuels and transportation devices got banned. People stopped racing cars for real, but they turned to sim racing as a way of essentially scratching that itch and getting out and competing with one another.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So, sim racing lasted for a good 100 years, but people started to get bored of it because ultimately a new generation were coming through that hadn’t actually driven real cars.&nbsp;(2:04)&nbsp;They didn’t really know what they were simulating.</p>



<p>“So the premise with ExoCross is that to reinvigorate sim racing, we’ve explored deep space.&nbsp;&nbsp;We’ve looked for planets that are similar to earth in terms of gravity and flora and fauna.&nbsp;And we’ve looked for places to take our fossil fuels and essentially tear up other people’s planets instead. You’re racing remotely from earth, from your habitation pod in earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;You are one of the drivers in the ExoCross championships.&nbsp;&nbsp;And you’re racing these off-road vehicles via communication technology out into deep space.&nbsp;And you’re doing it from the comfort of your own home. </p>



<p>“It’s our kind of tongue-in-cheek take on where sim racing could go at some point in the future.&nbsp;But we’ve seen it as an opportunity to weave in a story around why people aren’t racing real cars anymore.&nbsp;But yeah, ExoCross at its core is a fun off-road racing game that’s set out in the distant future on planets that aren’t earth.”</p>



<h3 id="h-what-made-orontes-and-drag-outer-zones-appealing-to-the-iracing-team-as-something-that-should-be-worked-on-after-purchasing-the-studio">What made Orontes and Drag: Outer Zones appealing to the iRacing team as something that should be worked on after purchasing the studio?</h3>



<p><strong>Coleman: “</strong>I think the first thing that came across about Orontes as a studio was the fact that it was two brothers extremely passionate about the stuff that they do.&nbsp;Super, super talented, like an amazing engineer and a brilliant artist, and they were just working together to make this incredible game as a pair. And the way they made this incredible racing game&nbsp;was to build an awesome engine,&nbsp;and the Orentis engine is essentially built out of&nbsp;their hard work, their blood, sweat and tears,&nbsp;but they’ve built it in such an incredibly forward-thinking&nbsp;and future-proof way that I think the main thing&nbsp;that the guys at iRacing saw when they approached them&nbsp;was just the opportunity&nbsp;and the sheer kind of passion&nbsp;that had been poured into that engine.</p>



<p>“But also the fact that it was so well put together and it could run at an amazing frame rate, look great, it offers huge potential, and it’s not just purchasing drag as a title and that being the end of it, which is what happens so many times when studios are bought up.&nbsp;This is actually about investing in the technology and using that as a foundation to then build a whole series of games on that tech going forwards.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-how-was-blending-what-was-already-built-for-the-game-by-orontes-and-what-iracing-has-to-offer">How was blending what was already built for the game by Orontes and what iRacing has to offer?</h3>



<p><strong>Coleman:</strong>&nbsp;“I think it’s one of the biggest challenges when you kind of parachute into a project is to kind of have a sit-rep, understand where the strengths are, where the weaknesses are, what the scope of the project is and what the company actually wants to get from it.&nbsp;And then you start bringing together the needs of the business, obviously the desires of the community and the players and what already exists to try and bring that together into a coherent package that really still surprises and delights the audience that are going to play it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The beauty of the engine is that so much of it was working well already, so it already had that running for it. But there were areas that we definitely wanted to play with and improve.&nbsp;iRacing as a company, anything that comes with the iRacing logo on it has to stand for great on-track action, wherever that is, whether it’s Dirt Track Racing, whether it’s NASCAR, whether it’s the simulation that the core product represents or whether it’s ExoCross, which we’re making, it has to be an excellent on-track experience and it has to represent awesome vehicles driving around tracks.&nbsp;So that was the key thing that we wanted to maintain but actually improve upon.</p>



<p>“So there are key areas with ExoCross that we have played with and we’ve improved.&nbsp;The way the vehicles drive, the tyre model, all of these things are things where we’ve brought in experts from iRacing to help with that.&nbsp;As we move towards making it a console product, one of the key areas that we’ve added is AI-based racing. So AI are coming in and they’re giving you competition to race against without you having to head online to have wheel-to-wheel action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The AI system has basically, we’ve brought over from iRacing where we know that iRacing has one of the greatest AI systems in the whole racing genre.&nbsp;So why not bring it in and use it and build on that strength? But then there’s also stuff that we’re doing within ExoCross that will hopefully then feed back into iRacing as a bigger product and hopefully improving those areas.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-was-there-anything-with-drag-now-exocross-that-you-felt-needed-to-be-changed-removed-or-just-didn-t-fit-in-the-new-vision-for-the-game">Was there anything with Drag, now ExoCross, that you felt needed to be changed, removed, or just didn’t fit in the new vision for the game?</h3>



<p>Coleman: “I&nbsp;think the key thing was how it was packaged and whether that would work for a console audience.&nbsp;I think as an early access product, it showed the promise.&nbsp;It definitely gave enough challenge for players to keep coming back, keep racing. </p>



<p>“There was some good online there where players could group up and meet up and play together, but it didn’t feel like a coherent package.&nbsp;It felt like something that was still in development.&nbsp;And that is ultimately what early access is. You sign up for a product in the hope that it’s going to grow and it’s going to develop and it’s going to become more than it currently is at the point at which you buy into it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Their roadmap looked good, but iRacing, I think, was one of the key missing features that was the must-have that we put on the table and said, whatever happens, we’re going to improve AI or introduce and then improve AI.&nbsp;Obviously, there’s the content-based stuff as well, like looking at the two cars that they had, they were OK. But we wanted to add another vehicle in there so that we could almost get this easy, medium and hard flavor to the game and ensure that players had more sense of progression as they move through the tiers.&nbsp;And then beyond that, making sure that there was a more broader variety of racetracks to go race on, championships to progress through.&nbsp;So ways to just essentially keep the players playing and give lots of different types of players lots of different ways to play.”</p>

<h3 id="h-what-would-you-say-is-something-that-will-keep-players-coming-back-race-after-race">What would you say is something that will keep players coming back race after race?</h3>



<p><strong>Coleman:</strong> “I&nbsp;think for me, it’s a challenge.&nbsp;I think we’re not setting out to make a game that’s impossible to beat, but we do want a game that has a nice, gentle, early difficulty curve that then ramps up.&nbsp; So there’s quite a high skill ceiling. And I think that’s reflected in some of the leaderboard challenges and the ways that we’re encouraging players to play.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So really, the single player is an onboarding into the wider experience.&nbsp;And then going online to play with other players, going into challenges and special events to compete on the leaderboards. That’s where we see there being more longevity and more reasons to keep coming back.&nbsp;I think it’s one of the beauty of off-road racing is that it’s much harder to get a perfect lap because there’s so many more variables.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Loose surface driving; how you set the car up for a corner. There’s just so much more than just picking a perfect line and nailing your braking and your throttle points that makes it off-road that much more hard to master.&nbsp;So yeah, we are all about making a game that is going to feel fun to pick up and play early on, but it’s going to have that sort of real mastery level to it where you feel like every time you drive a stage, you can do that a little bit better.”</p>



<h3 id="h-how-is-the-studio-finding-the-balance-between-controller-and-wheel-drivers">How is the studio finding the balance between controller and wheel drivers?</h3>



<p><strong>Coleman:</strong> “I think probably the best way to answer that is to describe how we’ve developed it.&nbsp;So I think when you make a game that’s more focused on the realism and the simulation, you tend to do all of the gameplay balancing and refinement on a wheel and then you think about how it’s going to feel on the pads later.&nbsp;I think when you’re making a game that’s more console focused, you do a lot of the refinement and balancing with a controller in your hands and then you check the wheel later on and make sure that that’s also working well.</p>



<p>“So both ways work and both ways generally end up with the game feeling good in both scenarios.&nbsp;But by doing pad first, you are capturing what the majority of console players will be experiencing and then checking that against how the wheel feels and ensuring that the wheel does still feel fun.&nbsp;But, you know, the wheel, I would describe wheel play in this as more intensive in that you have to be more off road with your inputs, so really throw the car in. </p>



<p>“So where I think on a track racing game, you would be more gentle with your inputs.&nbsp;You’re trying to do minimal steering really with the wheel and let your feet do the steering with the rotation of the car.&nbsp;With off road, you want to kind of do similar, but you sometimes need to make that first input a bit more abrupt to just get the car to bite. And then it’s about catching the slide and maintaining the slide with delicate steering input.&nbsp;And I think we’ve got that with the wheel right now.&nbsp;So I think it’ll be fun on both. That’s that’s our goal.&nbsp;That’s what we’re setting out to do.&nbsp;But I want console players to know that it feels great on a pad and they don’t have to go out and buy a wheel to get the most out of this.”</p>

<h3 id="h-exocross-won-t-be-cross-platform-do-you-think-there-s-a-risk-of-potentially-alienating-players-or-limiting-that-player-base-to-play-online">ExoCross won’t be cross-platform. Do you think there’s a risk of potentially alienating players or limiting that player base to play online?</h3>



<p><strong>Coleman: </strong>“Yeah, I think there’s always that risk.&nbsp;And my hope is that we do get big enough communities on each platform for us not to have a community of players feeling isolated across these different platforms and not finding a way to play together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“My hope is that each platform stands strong and the players within those platforms can enjoy themselves. There are certain challenges with cross-platform play that require a fairly significant investment in development to ensure that they work well.&nbsp;And actually, the easy part is getting platforms playing together on a server.&nbsp;The more challenging aspect comes from dealing with some of the certification requirements and making sure that Microsoft and Sony are happy with the way that their platform is being represented on the other platforms and how their players are being protected across the other platforms. </p>



<p>That’s where a lot of the development work and challenge comes in.&nbsp;So, yeah, it’s something that I think, in terms of wish lists, I’m with you and I’m with the community.&nbsp;It’s something that we should absolutely be trying to do with every game we make. But I think for ExoCross, we’re going to try with cross-generation and see how we go with that and then potentially expand into cross-platform if the need arises further down the line.”</p>

Hi-Fi Rush received almost universal acclaim – it was wholly unique, polished, and tightly paced. It was also like nothing developer Tango Gameworks had ever made before, and <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/hi-fi-rush-surprise-release-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>seemingly made explicitly for Xbox Game Pass</u></a>. It followed closely in the footsteps of games like Psychonauts 2 and Pentiment, neither of which match the profile of the big, blockbuster AAAs that move millions upon millions of copies, and yet they were beloved anyway. Taken as a whole, they lent credibility and prestige to Xbox Game Pass as an accessible library of well-supported, beautifully crafted art.</p><p>Now, just over a year later, Xbox has decreed the award-winning studio behind Hi-Fi Rush no longer necessary to its business. Its work does not consist of “high-impact titles” that Xbox is prioritizing. It is not among “the opportunities best-positioned for success,” as Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty put it. Tango, along with Arkane Austin, Alpha Dog Studios, and hundreds of workers are being cast aside.</p><p>We’ve written about the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ive-never-seen-it-this-bad-game-developers-explain-the-huge-layoffs-hitting-riot-epic-and-more"><u>devastating impact such mass layoffs </u></a><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/game-developers-mass-layoffs-human-impact-sony-ea"><u>continue to have</u></a> on individuals within the games industry. We’ve also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-and-the-battle-for-xboxs-soul"><u>discussed some of the internal strife</u></a> over Xbox’s identity. Now, brand new questions have emerged following Xbox’s latest shutdowns, few of them more pressing than what the future holds for Xbox Game Pass after the demise of one of its star developers.</p><h2>Xbox Growth Pass</h2><p>Xbox Game Pass has always been intrinsically tied to Xbox CEO Phil Spencer. Upon taking over Xbox from his predecessor Don Mattrick, one of Spencer’s earliest moves was to bring the brand back to a pure gaming focus after an unpopular pivot to entertainment. But he didn’t stop there. After a 2014 acquisition of Minecraft developer Mojang saw wild success, Spencer saw a pathway to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsofts-videogame-boss-and-the-long-battle-to-reinvent-the-company-11643912561#selection-3903.9-3903.79" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>linking his gaming growth ambitions with that of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s broader plans for cloud technology</u></a>.</p><p>In 2017, the public <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/28/microsoft-announces-xbox-games-pass-subscription-service"><u>saw those plans begin to unfold</u></a> with the debut of Xbox Game Pass. At the time of its announcement, Game Pass was a huge deal: a monthly subscription service a la PS Now, but with direct game downloads rather than streaming and over 100 games at launch, including first-party games.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A gaming subscription service was always a risky business move. </p></div><p>But exciting as that was for consumers, a gaming subscription service was always a risky business move. Similar services have come and gone over years, with even the best (Nvidia GeForce Now) falling short of massive popular success and some (Google Stadia) <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stadias-shutdown-the-history-of-googles-doomed-project-from-those-inside-and-out"><u>becoming cautionary tales</u></a>. Netflix served as a proof of concept for such a service, but <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsofts-videogame-boss-and-the-long-battle-to-reinvent-the-company-11643912561#selection-3903.9-3903.79" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reports suggest</u></a> that a number of Microsoft leaders told Spencer the service was a bad idea when he pitched it. At the time, Spencer was floating Rare’s upcoming Sea of Thieves as the ideal Game Pass game. But <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/xbox-phil-spencer-todd-howard-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Rare boss Craig Duncan asked Spencer</u></a>, “If every single person plays Sea Of Thieves on Game Pass, and we don’t sell a single copy. Are you kind of cool with that?” Spencer was.</p><p>When Game Pass debuted in 2017, it was more than a launch of a subscription service – it was the launch of an entire, multi-year strategy. Xbox started firing on all cylinders. It bought Ninja Theory, Undead Labs, inXile, Obsidian Entertainment, and Double Fine Productions. It spun up The Initiative and World’s Edge. It made the biggest-ever acquisition in gaming history when it bought Zenimax, bringing with it Bethesda, id Software, Arkane, Tango Gameworks, Machine Games, and Zenimax Online. Then Xbox broke that record again by purchasing Activision Blizzard. </p><p>In the process, Game Pass expanded. In 2018, Xbox began releasing first-party games on day one on the service. It added PC Game Pass in 2019 and implemented cloud gaming on mobile in 2020. Rumors swirled of Xbox trying to get Game Pass on Nintendo Switch, among other platforms, and of future Smart TV integration as well. </p><p>Through it all, Spencer made it clear that Game Pass was the centerpiece of Xbox’s strategy. It tied all the pieces together: console, mobile, PC, the acquired studios, outreach into new markets, cloud gaming, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/06/phil-spencer-wants-xbox-game-pass-to-cross-over-with-project-xcloud"><u>Spencer’s dream of reaching 2 billion gamers</u></a> wherever they happened to play. So what the heck is happening now?</p><h2>The Horizon Three Bet</h2><p>For all the praise Game Pass receives from consumers, it’s become apparent in recent years that the service has struggled to meet its creators’ lofty expectations. On one hand, it’s been consistently praised as a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-is-having-its-best-stretch-ever"><u>great deal for consumers</u></a>, and plenty of developers have praised it as well. The service has been <a href="https://www.pcgamesinsider.biz/news/71723/heres-how-xbox-game-pass-developers-are-compensated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a boon for indies</u></a>, too, who have used its guaranteed funding to get their games over the finish line. At its best, Game Pass is great for Xbox’s internal creatives, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/obsidian-xbox-acquisition-strategy-staying-out-way"><u>many of whom have spoken glowingly</u></a> about Xbox and Game Pass serving as a home for the kind of creatively interesting yet less marketable games that other parent companies or investors wouldn’t otherwise back.</p><p>But glowing reviews from some partners and consumers don’t necessarily mean the idea makes business sense for everyone. Larger third-party developers, for instance, have complained that Game Pass cannibalizes retail sales -- concerns that Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-confirms-game-pass-cannibalizes-sales" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>admitted last year were founded</u></a>. Major third-party publishers including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-xbox-call-of-duty-xbox"><u>Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick</u></a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-not-value-destructive-like-playstation-claims-football-manager-boss-says"><u>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick</u></a> have publicly stated they think the business model is a bad idea and aren’t interested in participating (though an acquisition solved the former disagreement). For Xbox, every single Game Pass game is a gamble that only pays off if enough people subscribe as a result.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“Microsoft initially wrote a bunch of big checks, which inflated the valuation of smaller and medium-sized game makers,” Joost van Dreunen, NYU Stern professor and <a href="https://superjoost.net/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>independent analyst</u></a> told me. “But unlike a premium model, in which a studio gets a piece for every unit sold, selling your game to a subscription service means you only get paid once. The upsell to developers has been that their participation would provide greater visibility and the opportunity to sell digital items on the back-end. However, as Netflix and Spotify will tell you, it is the blockbuster hits that carry the subscription and account for the bulk of playtime. The dystopian point of view here is that content creators are reduced to a cost-plus line item in a subscription-model that only values them for the increase in subscriber count they provide.”</p><p>For a while, this was a problem Xbox could afford to ignore. Microsoft’s pockets were deep, it clearly didn’t mind pouring money into the ambitious <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/xbox-phil-spencer-todd-howard-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>“Horizon 3” bet that was Game Pass</u></a>, and Xbox’s expenditures were just a blip on Microsoft’s balance sheet anyway. But with the $69 billion acquisition of Activision-Blizzard – not to mention all the legal and government hullabaloo that came with it – we’ve started to see signs that Microsoft’s critical eye is now focused on its gaming division. </p><p>This new scrutiny comes at an awkward time for Xbox. Game Pass, the prize strategy that was supposed to tie everything together, is almost certainly not meeting internal expectations. Earlier this year, we got a rare numbers update: 34 million paid subscribers, up from 25 million in 2022. But that number alone doesn’t tell the entire story. The previous subscription total was <em>just</em> for Xbox Game Pass, but the update comes after Game Pass was merged with Xbox Live Gold to form Xbox Game Pass Core. So yes, Game Pass membership shot up, but that boost required Xbox to mandate the service in order to play games online at all. It’s unlikely the service is seeing nine million user boosts on the regular, especially with Spencer admitting that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-xbox-game-pass-profitable-price-increases"><u>growth is slowing down</u></a>.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Game Pass was pitched as a game changer...but mounting evidence says it is far from completing its mission.</p></div><p>What’s more, Game Pass was pitched as a game changer – a way for Microsoft to lead gaming in a new direction. But mounting evidence says it is far from completing its mission. Circana senior analyst Mat Piscatella notes in his assessment (which is focused on the United States), “subscription is not showing signs that it is becoming 'the future of gaming.'” Premium games and free-to-play are still the dominant method of gaming, and subscription spending in the US has shown “flat to low single-digit growth since mid-2021.” Cloud gaming, pitched as the logical next frontier for such a service, has similarly failed to achieve widespread adoption. </p><p>George Jijiashvili, senior analyst at Omdia sees the struggles of Game Pass as symptoms of larger problems at Xbox, among them declining hardware sales during what should have been a growth phase for the console. While Xbox Series X and S hardware sales dropped 19% year-over-year in 2023 by Omdia’s estimate, PlayStation sales grew by 56%, and the seven-year-old Switch outsold Xbox by a factor of two. Meanwhile, Game Pass itself is set to fall short of reaching even half of its goal of 100 million Game Pass subscribers by 2023. For these reasons, Jijiashvili suspects “a drastic change in strategy” is required for Xbox to course correct, one which he suspects must include a focus on PC and mobile, especially cloud gaming.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p>This crossroads for Xbox comes at a difficult time for the games industry as a whole, too. As Piscatella explains to me, one of the biggest challenges for any video game company now is the impact of games like Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox, Grand Theft Auto, Call of Duty, and similar games that pull the vast majority of player time and spend all on their own. The pandemic saw video games shift “from a growth market to a mature market,” he says, with both engagement and spending effectively hitting caps. If companies want to see growth, they have to pull players away from those games – a tall order indeed.</p><p>“If we know the ceilings, and we know more about where, why and how people are playing (and really the ways they want to play, since we have all that data from 2020-21 when there were very few competitive activities to gaming), then it's tougher to make big bets on huge shifts in that behavior. I'm speculating a bit here,” Piscatella says.”But when I look at what's happening, I see a strategic shift not so much because one strategy failed, but because of a realization that chasing one particular strategy may not be optimal or deliver the desired results.”</p><h2>A brand at the X-roads</h2><p>Today, Xbox finds itself at an impasse. It has to start returning Microsoft’s investment, and soon. It can’t back out of its lofty promises for first-party games on Game Pass without risking consumer fury, especially amid hardware declines. That means relying on something other than Game Pass to rake in the cash. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-is-launching-its-mobile-game-store-rivaling-apple-and-google-in-july"><u>Sarah Bond mentioned an upcoming mobile storefront</u></a> that would capitalize on the power of recently acquired Candy Crush. Analysts I spoke to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-xbox-is-changing-the-nature-of-exclusivity"><u>have been predicting this would happen in 2024 for months now</u></a>, but it’s still unclear whether or not such a marketplace will need Game Pass attached to succeed or, if so, what that even looks like.</p><p>Mobile is powerful, but it’s not enough to transform Xbox’s business strategy, especially given its extreme lateness to the market. On top of the mobile storefront, Xbox’s new strategy will almost certainly include the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-coming-to-playstation-5-in-april-as-xbox-confirms-the-four-exclusives-headed-to-other-platforms"><u>reassessment of platform exclusivity</u></a> for even more games -- something Jijiashvili says is long overdue. Jijiashvili also expects Xbox to work on expanding its PC market via PC Game Pass, especially now that Activision Blizzard’s portfolio is in play. Van Dreunen suggests Xbox might add new tiers to Game Pass – perhaps one tailored for mobile, or an ad-based version.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The idea of shutting down such storied, acclaimed studios would have seemed absurd until recently.</p></div><p>But none of that necessitates a robust portfolio of creative, unique, smaller games - like Hi-Fi Rush - that previously seemed tailor-made for Spencer’s vision of Game Pass. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-exec-reportedly-told-staff-we-need-smaller-games-that-give-us-prestige-and-awards-a-day-after-shutting-down-hi-fi-rush-dev-tango-gameworks"><u>Even if Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty insists otherwise</u></a>. Xbox has promised, for now, that Hi-Fi Rush and Redfall will remain available, but for how long? Already, Redfall’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-abandons-redfall-and-cancels-dlc-after-shutting-developer-arkane-austin-down"><u>promised updates and planned DLC have been binned</u></a>, and in an age of digital ownership there are no guarantees that either game will remain available forever.</p><p>Even more importantly though: what happens to the studios that were making them? There’s been plenty of nervous speculation online already about the possibility of Xbox shutting down studios like Ninja Theory or Obsidian once their upcoming projects – Hellblade 2 and Avowed – are out the door. The idea of shutting down such storied, acclaimed studios would have seemed absurd until recently, but the games industry and Xbox in particular have reached a point where nothing seems off the table if an executive believes cuts will help a bottom line somewhere.</p><p>It’s not the only possibility, though. A more likely, if not exactly happy, possibility is that Xbox starts taking on a more hands-on role with its owned studios, similar to its competitors. Previously, Xbox has been praised for a hands-off approach that allowed studios like Obsidian to make games like Pentiment, though the flipside is that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xboxs-perfect-dark-reboot-is-still-years-away"><u>studios like The Initiative have apparently floundered without strong creative direction</u></a>. Xbox could start directing its studios to make games and IPs that it expects will be more than just critical darlings to sell Game Pass.</p><p>For years, Xbox bet that if it had enough incredible games in one place, it could fundamentally change the calculus of how players chose to play. It lost that bet, but it did create an excellent service in the process. Now Xbox appears to be doubling down on that bet, but not in the way we might like it to. It appears to be prepared to give up the incredible, risky, boutique projects that made Game Pass so wonderful in exchange for Call of Duty, Candy Crush, and a PC/mobile-first strategy. Great games, it seems, are no longer enough.</p><p>When I asked Simon Carless of <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/what-those-studio-closures-mean-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GameDiscover.co newsletter</a> about Game Pass’s impact on Xbox’s first-party games, he acknowledged it was a tricky question. It’s difficult, he says, to work out what “success metric” Xbox is using for “expensive to make” boutique titles – it might be player counts, user ratings, retention, in-game purchase spend, new Game Pass users, or something else entirely. But he does note that as Game Pass growth stalled, the latter two metrics are increasingly becoming Xbox’s focus.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“We can definitely argue about whether closing critically acclaimed studios like Tango Gameworks is the best way to deal with [Game Pass growth stalling out],” he says. “But I presume that, via Microsoft's new success lens -- 'did lots of people get retained in this game, and perhaps might pay for extra things in it?', or 'did new people signed up for Game Pass because of this game?', some beloved, high quality games don't fit the bill. For example, Hi-Fi Rush going to PlayStation is a high-profile move. But we're estimating it's sold way less than 100,000 units on that console so far. In a multi-billion dollar corporation like Microsoft, that's a rounding error.”</p><p>Van Dreunen, for his part, says Xbox is ultimately going to be fine. It has Microsoft, and thus time and money on its side, even if its parent company seems to be cracking down on the big spending. Microsoft won’t abandon gaming, and the big bets will likely continue, even if the shape of them seems likely to look less and less like Spencer’s Game Pass vision from a decade ago. “[Xbox] recently celebrated the 20-year anniversary of its Xbox console, which it introduced at great cost and amidst massive skepticism from analysts, gamers, and investors. Today, Microsoft is the third-largest game company in the world, generating $25 billion annually. As a trillion-dollar company it has the resources to outlast other companies for decades. I’d expect Xbox to use that to its advantage.”</p><p>And yet, the shuttering of Tango and Arkane was a massive shock to an industry already reeling from two straight years of relentless job and project cuts. The carnage across video games seems poised to continue for at least a few more financial quarters, and any rebuilding of the lost talent is likely to take far longer. Xbox is apt to sail the waves of the industry for years to come, whether or not Game Pass turns out to be the wind at its back or an anchor dragging it down. But Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin are gone, and there may not be many studios like them for the foreseeable future.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

Fans were quick to spot a strange code on the bottom of this hourglass, S89N-029S, thus starting the community's problem-solving effort.</p><p>This wasn't too complex to work out, as its numbers were simply positions in the English alphabet, meaning it was quickly deciphered as 'Shinobis.' But the strange codes didn't stop there, as scattered throughout Ubisoft websites, email, and social media lay other random assortments of letters and numbers.</p><p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1cr379m/theres_some_sort_of_code_in_an_official_image_for/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Busy-Jicama-3474</a> on Reddit, a background image on the Assassin's Creed Shadows page on Ubisoft's website contains a hidden code with 24 two-digit numbers. Another code found in an email advertisement had 11, 21, and 33 repeated over and over across several lines, all being 16 numbers long. And fans are going wild trying to figure them out.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Codename Red becomes Assassin's Creed Shadows.<br>Tune-in for the Official Cinematic World Premiere Trailer on May 15, 9 AM PT.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AssassinsCreedShadows?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#AssassinsCreedShadows</a> <a href="https://t.co/xc1Q10N4Vh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/xc1Q10N4Vh</a></p>— Assassin's Creed (@assassinscreed) <a href="https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1790049553745412369?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 13, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>"If we pair the first and second numbers, along with the third and forth, and so on, we get four lines of eight pairs of numbers," wrote Squidpsyco in response to the original post. "The only pairs that exist here are 33 and 11, and 11 and 21. This creates eight pairs with exactly two possibilities for each pair, which looks a lot like binary.</p><p>"If we treat the 33 11 pair as zero and the 11 21 pair as 1, we get four binary characters, which translate to the American Standard Code for Information Interchange numbers one, five, seven, and nine. This can’t be a coincidence because the four binary strands all give a numeral, and only a range of 10 characters of the 255 possible are numbers. So the chance that this is a coincidence is (10/255)4 or 16 in six million odds."</p><p>The internet sleuth then connected that 1579 number to an Assassin's Creed Shadows rumor that suggests a historical figure called Yasuke will be involved in the game. "1579 just so happens to be the year Yasuke arrived in Japan," they said. "This probably doesn’t help with the main cipher on the website, but it is likely confirmation of the date of the game and Yasuke’s involvement."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/14/screenshot-2024-05-14-124348-1715688836239.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Ubisoft's website hides a cryptic code and key.</figcaption></figure></output><p>This "main cipher" was found elsewhere on Ubisoft's website, where fans also found a code and key as one part of a series of rotating images. Several lines of numbers are presented next to the key, which contains Japanese Katakana characters.</p><p>The numbers were therefore converted to Katakana characters and translated to English by several fans online, revealing a cryptic poem. "Time is ephemeral, fragments are scattered across the network, the hourglass becomes the key to preservation, you should hurry," it reads, according to Reil_ on Reddit.</p><p>The hidden code in the background image can be translated using the same means, resulting in the phrase: "One by one, things come into existence. For the past, time stands still," according to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1crah8m/shadows_hourglass_puzzle_solved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Efigr</a>, who claims to have solved the riddles.</p><p>The page with the key also had a jumble of letters and numbers in a web address, which was easily converted to be "assassinscreed.com" through the same method used on the hourglass code, though its specific page is then edited out with nine question marks instead. But as the main paragraph mentions the hourglass being the key, Efigr deduced this as a likely answer.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Mainline Assassin's Creed Games in Chronological Order</h3></div></output><p>While the code on the hourglass would be the most obvious (through it being the least obvious) answer, especially as it used the same decipher method, visiting 'assassinscreed.com/shinobis' returns a 404, page not found error. But visiting 'assassinscreed.com/hourglass' redirects users back to the main Assassin's Creed Shadow page.</p><p>"This redirects you to Ubisoft's homepage, it doesn't return a 404, probably meaning it's a page waiting to go live," Efigr said. It therefore appears Ubisoft wasn't fully prepared for fans to solve the puzzles so quickly, or perhaps the community has just reached the wrong conclusion.</p><p>If a page <em>is</em> waiting to go live, it will likely do so alongside the full reveal of Assassin's Creed Shadows on May 15 at 9am Pacific / 12noon Eastern / 5pm UK.</p><p>Despite the secrecy, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-codename-red-gets-official-name-ahead-of-wednesday-trailer-drop">leaks have confirmed a November 15, 2024 release date</a> for the incoming game. Set in feudal Japan, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-infinity-announced-with-two-new-games">Assassin's Creed Shadows was revealed in September 2022</a> as the "next premium flagship title and the future of our open world role-playing games", suggesting it will be closer in style to Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Odyssey than 2023's Mirage.</p><p>A leak in October 2023 gave fans their first look at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-red-protagonist-seemingly-revealed-in-another-odd-ubisoft-leak">what's likely one of the game's protagonists</a>, a female assassin wielding a katana. Virtually nothing else is known about the game, however, but there's not long to wait until Ubisoft reveals a proper look tomorrow.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-financials-helldivers-2-sales<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has released its financials for the 2023-24 fiscal year, and the PlayStation division of the business has had a pretty strong twelve months, driving over a third of the company's overall sales.</p>
<p>According to Sony's <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/23q4_sonypre.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">results presentation</a>, the Game &amp; Network Services arm of the business, which is essentially PlayStation and its associated studios, generated 4.268 trillion yen in sales (around $27 billion).</p>
<p>Per the company's accompanying <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/23q4_sonyspeech.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">speech transcript</a>, that figure constitutes 20.8 million PlayStation 5 unit sales, as well as 12 million sales for&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>across twelve weeks, which puts the third-person shooter <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-ragnarok-sold-11-million-copies">ahead of&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-ragnarok-sold-11-million-copies">God of War Ragnarok</a>&nbsp;</em>for the same period.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-playstation-sony-financials.jpg?itok=w1MWvsFf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-playstation-sony-financials.jpg?itok=aXFnVsZf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>has helped PlayStation to enjoy a pretty successful year.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>has also apparently been Sony's "biggest PC hit title to date". Remember that the recent&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-account-link">controversy</a> surrounding the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack">need to have a PlayStation ID</a> to play on PC won't factor into this report given the timing.</p>
<p>Going forward, Sony says it expects PS5 unit sales to "gradually decline" given that the console is entering the second half of its life cycle. As such, Sony's expectation is that it will sell around 18 million PS5s this year.</p>
<p>Despite this predicted downturn in sales, Sony thinks it'll be able to "steadily increase sales and profits" from the PlayStation platform by building a stronger active user base and increasing user engagement.</p>
<p>As such, although gaming sales are predicted to drop to around 4.2 trillion yen next year, Sony expects profits in the sector to jump by around 20%.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sony-playstation-financials-god-of-war-ragnarok.jpg?itok=eD3mr4h5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sony-playstation-financials-god-of-war-ragnarok.jpg?itok=p4ZyJe47 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>has unseated&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok&nbsp;</em>to take PlayStation's fastest-selling crown.</figcaption></figure><p>Across the next three financial years, Sony's plan for its PlayStation division has been given the name "Console &amp; Beyond", likely because of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-tsushima-pc-system-requirements">increasing number</a> of PlayStation <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/returnal-gets-release-date-for-pc-system-requirements">releases</a> making their way to PC in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-forbidden-west-pc-release-date">recent months</a>.</p>
<p>The company says its plan for gaming is to drive profit by expanding its PlayStation install base, "providing richer gaming experiences", and focusing on PC releases, as well as "enhancing" its first-party software offerings.</p>
<p>These financial results come after Sony Interactive Entertainment <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs">laid off almost a thousand employees</a> around the world earlier this year, including staffers at studios like Insomniac, Naughty Dog, and Guerrilla.</p>
<p>Of course, that hasn't stopped Sony as a whole engaging in a share buyback scheme to massively boost its payout to shareholders this financial year, but then the PlayStation owner is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-layoffs-share-buyback">hardly unique in that endeavor</a>.</p>

			<p>Today, former XCOM and Marvel's Midnight Suns designer <a href="https://wccftech.com/firaxis-games-enters-new-era-with-jake-solomon-departure-new-studio-head-new-civilization-in-the-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jake Solomon</a> announced the foundation of <a href="http://www.midsummerstudios.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Midsummer Studios</a>, a small indie company established with the help of several industry veterans who worked on games like Civilization (Will Miller) and The Sims (Grant Rodiek). This startup has already raised $6 million from investors like Transcend Fund, Tirta Ventures, Betaworks Ventures, 1Up Ventures, F4 Ventures, Krafton, and Day Zero Productions.</p>
<p>Solomon and his colleagues won't be making an XCOM-like game. They are instead building a next-generation life simulation game focused on player-driven narrative. I had a chance to speak to Solomon about Midsummer, this new project (which will be released on PC early access at first), and the state of the industry as a whole.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Midsummer-Fire-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>What can you tell me about the founding of this new company? How did you choose the name and everything?</strong></p>
<p>My family is Norwegian and I have incredibly fond memories of my family’s Midsummer celebration, which we still celebrate today. Honestly, it’s a good party. It is also a little bit about<br>
rebirth, a look to the future, and gathering with those important to you. Creating a new company is a big step, and Midsummer was a good fit for what we’re trying to build.</p>
<p><strong>You said you have 10 people now, right? Are you working from an office or remotely?</strong></p>
<p>We have hired 11 people and work in an office together in Hunt Valley, MD, just a little north of<br>
Baltimore.</p>
<p><strong>In the future, when you need to scale up, would you be open to hiring remote workers?</strong></p>
<p>We are actively discussing how to accommodate remote and hybrid team members as we grow the studio. It’s incredibly important to us that folks feel like they belong to the studio and our culture regardless of where they work. It’s not easy to get right, so it’s something we’re trying to figure out.</p>
<p><strong>Your debut game will be in the life simulation genre, which is quite a departure from your previous games. Is that a genre you always wanted to touch upon, or was it a spur-of-the-moment situation?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve always thought using systems-driven design to explore relationships is an interesting challenge. I’ve always been interested in building systems that facilitate player-driven stories. Back in XCOM: War of the Chosen, we added soldier bonds, and we arguably created a bit of a dating simulator in Marvel’s Midnight Suns.</p>
<p>Systems-driven games allow you to explore any theme: golf, building a city, managing soldiers, or leading little lives. There is absolutely a lot we are figuring out, but we feel this is ultimately still<br>
within our strengths as developers.</p>
<p><strong>One of the big differences compared to your previous titles would be the lack of combat, so there has to be some other way to resolve conflicts. Will that happen through dialogues?</strong></p>
<p>Great stories require strong characters with competing desires. Our new game won’t feature combat, but conflict and tension will be at the forefront. Life Sims sit at the intersection of game systems and player agency. We’re trying to find that balance between managing relationships to<br>
“play well” (so to speak) and also tell the story you wish to see. It’s a little early to discuss specifics of dialogues, but rest assured there will be tension!</p>
<p><strong>Will there be daily tasks, like jobs, that players have to perform? Would those entail any mini-games?</strong></p>
<p>Characters will go to their jobs in a small town. They can argue (or fall in love) with co-workers,<br>
deal with certain customers. Jobs are a great way to expose the minute details of life and inject<br>
big, major events. We’re building our first playable now, which will inform a lot of the moment-to-moment holes we need to plug. We’re not sure mini-games are the best fit, but it’s still early days and we’d be foolish to close off any potential avenues.</p>
<p><strong>Is it possible for players to fail in their endeavors, and would the game account for that?</strong></p>
<p>Players will absolutely fail! But it’ll be fun. Maybe they lose their job, get dumped, or botch a first<br>
date. There are so many fun ways to fail in a good story. We think failure is a great opportunity to highlight growth and perseverance in our characters, which helps make a better story. Plus, the occasional failure makes success so much sweeter.</p>
<p>Our game will not feature a game over screen, nor are we terribly interested in failure putting up<br>
“walls” and closing things off. In the spirit of improv theater, we see success and failure as opportunities to use consequences to inform the next part of the story and mix up the simulation.</p>
<p><strong>Based on the press release, the game will focus on delivering meaningful player-driven stories. Can you talk about how you're going to achieve this?</strong></p>
<p>There is so much work to do here, and we are still very early in development. Our current focus<br>
is to create the basic game systems that create narrative goals, conflict and relationships, and interactions within limits to accomplish those goals. We are trying to build choice-rich scenes<br>
with all of the choices leading to telling a story.</p>
<p><strong>Will the game have an end goal or end to a main storyline, or will it be more of an endless type of narrative?</strong></p>
<p>The game won’t end. We want to create compelling, episodic stories you can complete or<br>
continue. But each of these is a tiny snippet of an unfolding narrative. One of the best things about life simulation games is that they imitate life, which is enormous. As we support the game and hopefully see a mod community form, we are confident a creative community will create new stories forever.</p>
<p><strong>You have mentioned people sharing user-generated content online, but what about proper co-op multiplayer? Is that a possibility if players ask for it?</strong></p>
<p>We are not building co-op or multiplayer. This game is a single-player experience. We also think we can foster an incredibly collaborative, welcoming community of creators, even if they are not playing together in real time.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think about generative AI-based NPCs, like those in the Inworld AI demos?</strong></p>
<p>These are definitely cool. They definitely force the larger question of what they improve. Are<br>
they nifty technology or do they make the game more fun for players?</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of tools, can you share which engine you've selected for the game?</strong></p>
<p>We are using Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p><strong>Will you leverage features like MetaHumans, Lumen, and/or Nanite?</strong></p>
<p>We are not using MetaHumans. We’ll use a lot of the incredible technology that Unreal Engine 5<br>
offers, but we are still prototyping our visuals and the technology we will use. One thing to note is that we want to build a small, sustainable studio. It’s important to figure out how to create a good-looking game with a style that does not require an enormous team.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk about the visual style you'll be going for?</strong></p>
<p>We intend to use a stylized look, but the question is how stylized? We’re still figuring this out and don’t really know at this time. The main thing driving our work is how important it is for our players to be emotionally connected to their characters on screen.</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to self-publish this game?</strong></p>
<p>We haven’t decided this yet. At this time, we have a variety of options, including self-publishing, or partnering with a publisher to help us bring the game to market.</p>
<p><strong>Are you targeting specific platforms?</strong></p>
<p>We have a lot of plans long-term, but right now, we are focused on bringing this game to the PC<br>
in Early Access.</p>
<p><strong>The life sim genre is suddenly getting a renaissance of sorts, with Paradox and KRAFTON making new games and, of course, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-next-gen-project-rene-revealed-customization-cross-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new The Sims</a> on the horizon. Do you feel like it's going to be too cramped?</strong></p>
<p>Even with all of these options, life simulation players are still underserved. There is so much still<br>
to be done. These are all serious competitors, all of whom seem poised to offer something great to players who love life simulations. But, if anything, all of us are just scratching the surface of what’s<br>
possible. The Sims created the genre 25 years ago with very few competitors. There are multiple<br>
successful FPS Battle Royales and nobody says the space is too cramped. We are confident<br>
we can create a delightful, distinct life sim worthy of its predecessors.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think about the state of the industry following all the layoffs? Is the doom and gloom warranted?</strong></p>
<p>Honestly, it’s terrible. Too many people have lost their jobs and it’s incredibly frustrating. It’s been nice to actually hire folks these last few months. The last few months have been terrible for a lot of folks, and hopefully, as Midsummer grows, we can provide a great studio home for some of them.<br>
It’s a tough market right now. There are these incredible, over-the-top AAAA games that are impossible to follow. You also see amazing AA niche games that are more focused and successful. AAA sits in this awkward middle ground where it’s very expensive but hard to cover costs.</p>
<p><strong>In many cases, we've seen budgets double or triple between one installment and the next one in a series. Should developers and publishers rein in budgets to avoid these mass layoffs?</strong></p>
<p>I’m wary of telling other folks how to run their business. But I can tell you what we’re doing at<br>
Midsummer. We want to make games in a small, collaborative atmosphere. We want to remain<br>
independent. All of those things require that we stay relatively small, act and spend our money<br>
in a sustainable manner, and make careful decisions on how we produce our games.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

			<p>The Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (<abbr title="Authority for Consumers &amp; Markets">ACM) has fined Fortnite maker Epic Games for pressuring youngsters.&nbsp;</abbr></p>
<p>As can be read in the <a href="https://www.acm.nl/en/publications/acm-imposes-fine-epic-unfair-commercial-practices-aimed-children-fortnite-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new publication</a> from the ACM, two fines have been imposed for a total of 1.125,000 euros. According to the ruling, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-year-in-review-2023-user-grow-fortnite-third-party-dwindles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fortnite make</a>r has exploited the vulnerabilities of those under 18 by using unfair practices, including the use of "illegal" aggressive ads, and misleading countdown timers. For both violations, Epic has been fined 562.500 euros. In addition to these two violations, the ACM mentions that Epic uses several design features that can be characterized as a "dark pattern". According to the authority, certain items were still available for purchase, even after the countdown timer ended. "The offer was complex, and was presented in a way that made it impossible to be able to comprehend the offer, let alone under the pressure of a countdown timer of 24 hours", the publication reads.</p>
<p>“Businesses that offer products to children have a responsibility to keep in mind that children are particularly sensitive to certain incentives", ACM's Cateautje Hijmans van den Berg said. "In the popular game Fortnite, children’s vulnerabilities were exploited and were thus pressured into making purchases. With this decision, we are sending a clear signal: children must be able to play online games without being put under undue pressure. These practices by Epic erode confidence in the digital economy.”</p>
<p>In a statement <a href="https://tweakers.net/nieuws/221872/acm-geeft-epic-games-boete-fortnite-spoorde-kinderen-aan-tot-kopen.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issued</a> to Dutch tech outlet Tweakers, Epic has said that it disagrees with the decision from the ACM and that it will appeal the decision. Epic has mentioned that accounts under 16 cannot make real-money purchases without permission and cannot use certain social features.</p>
<p>Until the appeal is settled, Epic has said that Dutch Fortnite players can no longer purchase items in the store that are available for less than 48 hours. In addition, the Fortnite maker has reaffirmed that countdown timers in the virtual store will disappear - something that the company already promised last month.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-is-playstation%E2%80%99s-fastest-selling-game-ever.870168/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24156221/helldivers-2-sales-record<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="2417dB">In its <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/23q4_sonyspeech.pdf">latest financial report</a>, Sony has revealed that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24071317/helldivers-2-starship-troopers-video-game-great"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a> — the scrappy co-op shooter turned online gaming sensation from Sweden’s Arrowhead Game Studios — is the fastest-selling game PlayStation has ever released.</p>
<p id="FwASr4">Sony said <em>Helldivers 2 </em>sold 12 million copies in its first 12 weeks on sale, “surpassing the record set by <em>God of War Ragnarök</em> in the same period after its release in 2022.” <em>Ragnarök </em><a href="https://twitter.com/SonySantaMonica/status/1620844673924227074">sold 11 million copies</a> in the same time frame. Sony said <em>Helldivers 2 </em>sales “far exceeded expectations.”</p>
<p id="hLAm2f"><em>Helldivers 2’</em>s release strategy was unusual for Sony. It released simultaneously on PS5 and PC, via Steam, and at $39.99 had a lower price than the majority of first-party releases from PlayStation Studios, the console-maker’s development and publishing arm. Sony usually prices its games at $59.99 and above, and waits for a year or more before releasing them on PC.</p>
<p id="4szZvQ">There’s no doubt that Steam contributed massively to <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s success. Sales analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/MatPiscatella/status/1770800506446733615">Mat Piscatella said that</a>, in the game’s launch month, nearly 60% of its sales came from Steam, and it only recently fell out of the top 10 most-played games on the platform. “The game has become our biggest PC hit title to date, and as a multi-platform title, it also contributed significantly to sales and profit last quarter,” Sony said. </p>
<p id="pdLsnW">No surprise, then, that Sony plans to release all live-service games simultaneously on PlayStation and Steam going forward. It’s yet to make the same decision for its first-party single-player action games in franchises like Marvel’s Spider-Man, The Last of Us, and God of War, which are regarded as system-sellers for PlayStation consoles and currently held back as platform exclusives. You can be certain there will be spirited debates about the pros and cons of this policy within Sony after <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s success.</p>
<div id="MaoCuz">
<blockquote>
<div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>As announced in the Sony earnings call, we have sold over 12M units!</p><p>It's crazy to think that there are more Helldivers than there are Swedes  </p><p>What a massive achievement from everyone involved in realizing <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Helldivers2</a>. A massive thank you to the community for your support,…</p></div>— Pilestedt (@Pilestedt) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pilestedt/status/1790300010401104124?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 14, 2024</a>
</blockquote>


</div>
<p id="okwJ36">But Sony’s push into multiplatform publishing with <em>Helldivers 2</em> hasn’t been an unqualified success. When Sony attempted to reinstate a dropped requirement for Steam players to link a PlayStation Network account, it was met with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24150510/helldivers-2-psn-account-sony-response-controversy-steam-review-bombing-refunds">a storm of dissent</a>, and ultimately had to drop the policy.</p>
<p id="OBlYPJ">Elsewhere in Sony’s financial report, the company revealed that PS5 console sales had reached 59 million, just behind the 60 million PS4s sold in the same period since its release. It expects PS5 sales to have peaked and to decline annually from here on out, though. Generally speaking, the financial picture for PlayStation is pretty rosy, with sales up 17% over the previous financial year — though it’s expecting a decline in the year ahead, with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24072730/no-new-ps5-games-exclusives-2024-release">no major exclusive games to drive sales</a>.</p>
<p id="ojVKmo">Sony also announced a new CEO for Sony Interactive Entertainment, which runs the PlayStation business — in fact, <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/press-releases/2024/new-leadership-structure-formed-at-sony-interactive-entertainment/">it announced two</a>. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23893391/playstation-ceo-jim-ryan-retirement">Jim Ryan’</a>s replacements will be Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino. Hulst, former boss of Guerrilla Games and current head of PlayStation Studios, will become CEO of the new Studio Business Group, with responsibility for game development and publishing as well as TV and film licensing. Nishino takes over as CEO of the Platform Business Group, running console hardware and services like PlayStation Network, sales and marketing, and third-party relations. Both men will report into the current interim CEO Hiroki Totoki in his role as board chairman.</p>
<p id="pjbFNj">It sounds like not much has changed here, with the hard-nosed Totoki (the probable architect of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24084509/playstation-layoff-900-workers-feb-2024">recent PlayStation layoffs</a>, even though Ryan signed them off) carving up the kingdom and still pulling the strings.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-possibly-leaked-by-ubisoft/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-release-date-possibly-leaked-by-ubisoft.870162/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-possibly-leaked-by-ubisoft/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>According to early views of Ubisoft’s own YouTube premiere trailer for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, the game’s release date is possibly November 15, 2024.</p>



<p>Ubisoft recently announced that Assassin’s Creed Shadows will get <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gets-first-trailer-on-may-15/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its first trailer</a> on May 15, unveiling at 9 AM pacific time. </p>



<p>The upcoming trailer is currently sitting in wait using YouTube’s premiere feature. In the premiere’s trailer description, it seemed that Ubisoft itself suggested the game will be available in November. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/wario64/status/1790079437662285907" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter, users @Wario64 and @Andreaalex2001 captured an image of this apparent slip-up.</p>



<p>However, the November release date is hardly concrete. It’s still possible that the date in the trailer description simply amounts to human error. It may have intended to refer to the trailer’s release on May 15 instead of November 15. </p>



<p>But Ubisoft did completely remove the text, implying the date is in fact legitimate. If so, the date could appear in the upcoming cinematic trailer.</p>



<p>Ubisoft has previously confirmed release dates in other game trailers. This included the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August release date</a> for Star Wars Outlaws.</p>



<p>Recent reports suggest that Assassin’s Creed Shadows <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-wont-be-on-last-gen-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t be available</a> on last-gen consoles. Further, a dataminer recently gave fans a glimpse at the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">season pass and DLC prices</a>.</p>



<p>At this time, Ubisoft has not officially confirmed a release date for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, previously known as “Red.” Ubisoft plans to reveal more about the game during its Ubisoft Forward in June.</p>

Today he and a number of former Firaxis and Maxis developers announced the formation of Midsummer Studios, a new Maryland-area game developer that is working on an unnamed "life sim" game in the vein of Electronic Arts' </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Sims</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The studio is launching with $6 million raised by Transcend Fund in partnership with Tirta Ventures, Betaworks Ventures, 1Up Ventures, F4 Fund, Krafton, and Day Zero Productions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Solomon is joined on the leadership team by game director Will Miller and chief operating officer Neslie Birch (who will also serve as chief financial officer). The trio and their colleagues have set up shop in Firaxis' old office in Hunt Valley, Maryland.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In an interview with Game Developer, Solomon explained that pitching a life sim game proved to be a potent strategy in a market where funding for new studios is hard to come by. "Life sims have been very underserved," he said, noting that every other game he's worked on like the XCOM and Civilization series spurred a number of still-thriving competitors, but </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Sims</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has stayed dominant thanks to its fervently loyal audience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There were people who said, flat out, 'we've been waiting for somebody who seems equipped to do this is give us this pitch,'" he said.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/life-by-you-creator-and-the-sims-vet-rod-humble-on-building-a-world-class-character-creator" target="_self">Building a "world class" character creator in The Sims rival Life by You</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Solomon's systems-driven background is the foundation for Midsummer's life sim">Solomon's systems-driven background is the foundation for Midsummer's life sim</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On the surface, a strategy game veteran like Solomon may not seem like a natural fit for the life sim genre. But he's apparently been thinking about making a game like this since the last months of making </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel's Midnight Suns </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">at Firaxis, and he explained his long history of making systems-driven games at the studio means the two genres are closer than you may think.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Twenty to thirty years ago, you could make a systems-driven game about anything and you'd still use the same design techniques," he said, alluding to his time working with Sid Meier on games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sid Meier's SimGolf</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sid Meier's Railroads! </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Though the themes of each game were different, Firaxis used many of the same processes to bring them to life.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You should still expect big changes from Midsummer's untitled life sim, if anything because it's exceptionally ambitious. Solomon said he's eager to make a game with "player-driven" stories. "What if I made a game where the whole point of the game...was [to make] a story," he remembered thinking, saying players would be able to write a meaningful story "just by playing the game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The unnamed game will be something of a soap opera generator set in a small town in "modern life," equally influenced by Stephen King's book Needful Things and the 1994 CBS drama Touched by an Angel.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Solomon said the team is exploring not just how to simulate characters and character interactions across a small town, but to make players feel excited to experiment with different character decisions that can make their stories swerve in surprising directions. He implied that the team wants to use a rewards system of some kind to encourage them to explore story choices outside their "core values."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With a relatively small funding pool and a lot of pressure on studios to deliver when taking venture capital funding, we pressed Solomon on how he hopes Midsummer can be sustainable while making such an ambitious project. His answer: stay small, be transparent, and lean into Early Access.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Employees at Midsummer have been briefed on how much runway they have before the initial funding runs out, and development has been planned out to produce a demo well before that moment comes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But even after that demo is completed, Solomon says the goal for a long time is to keep the team size small, and to make the unnamed life sim the best game it can through sales in an Early Access program. "We're not going to go anywhere without building a community," he said. "A persistent game like this needs community."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a shrewd move to counter what will be Midsummer's greatest challenge: though there is opportunity to make fresh games in the life sim space, the existing passionate audience is extremely well-guarded by EA and Maxis. "Most people who play </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Sims 4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, play on Origin," he said, making the classic observation that even though Sims players have hundreds of thousands of hours invested in the franchise, they don't consider themselves to be the classic "gamer" stereotype you find on Steam.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He also knows that even with an opening in the marketplace, fierce competition is already underway to fill that hole.

Its usual PC strategy sees PlayStation games launching on PC years after the game's console release – <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/03/06/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-rides-to-pc-in-may#:~:text=The%20game's%20Director's%20Cut%20is,co%2Dop%20multiplayer%20Legends%20mode.">Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut is only just now coming to PC this month</a>, for example. It seems launching on PC day-and-date with PS5 was the right call, though, as Helldivers 2 is now a bonafide hit for PlayStation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Arrowhead Game Studios CEO Johan Pilestedt celebrated the news, noting there are more Helldivers 2 players than Swedes (the studio is based in Stockholm, Sweden) while thanking players for helping the team and PlayStation reach this achievement.&nbsp;</p>

<div>
<blockquote>
<div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>As announced in the Sony earnings call, we have sold over 12M units!</p><p>

It's crazy to think that there are more Helldivers than there are Swedes 🤯</p><p>

What a massive achievement from everyone involved in realizing <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Helldivers2</a>. A massive thank you to the community for your support,…</p></div>
— Pilestedt (@Pilestedt) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pilestedt/status/1790300010401104124?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 14, 2024</a></blockquote>

</div>

<p>Notably, Arrowhead Game Studios is independent – PlayStation published Helldivers 2 as a PS5 console exclusive, in a way previously referred to as second-party. However, given acquisitions are happening more and more this generation, it wouldn't be surprising if PlayStation attempted to bring Arrowhead Game Studios under the first-party umbrella.&nbsp;</p>

  <p id="mpFq0m">The Sims is about to get even more competition. A new studio co-founded by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2013/1/31/3928710/making-of-xcoms-jake-solomon-firaxis-sid-meier">Jake Solomon</a>, the veteran game designer behind <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/1/24/3754534/xcom-enemy-unknown-review-blinded-by-science"><em>XCOM</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23484477/marvels-midnight-suns-review-release-date-characters-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x"><em>Marvel’s Midnight Suns</em></a>, will challenge Maxis’ enduring and dominant life simulation game series with a new, still-untitled game that focuses on “the drama of modern life.”</p>
<p id="rQz5Te">Joining Solomon at his new game company Midsummer Studios are co-founder Will Miller (also formerly of Firaxis) and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23580081/the-sims-project-rene-development-update-multiplayer-playtest">ex-The Sims producer-director Grant Rodiek</a> (aka “SimGuru Grant”). Rodiek was previously game director on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23404750/sims-5-project-rene-announcement"><em>Project Rene</em></a>, Maxis’ in-development follow-up to <em>The Sims 4</em>. At least a half dozen other former Firaxis game developers who worked on the XCOM games and <em>Marvel’s Midnight Suns</em> are also now at Midsummer Studios.</p>
<p id="EIDP9H">“The best stories in games are written by the players,” Solomon said in a news release. “At Midsummer we’re making a life sim focused on the drama of modern life, where our players will write meaningful stories just by playing, and then share those stories with the world.”</p>
<p id="dRZWpC"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23604027/xcom-midnight-suns-director-jake-solomon-firaxis">Solomon left Firaxis in 2023</a>, after more than two decades at the studio.

<p id="DW7xOM">Midsummer’s game is entering an increasingly crowded field that has been mostly dominated by Electronic Arts’ The Sims franchise. Promising competitors include <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23657952/life-by-you-paradox-sim-game-rod-humble"><em>Life By You</em></a>, an upcoming life sim from Paradox Interactive that’s being helmed by Rod Humble (<em>Second Life</em>, <em>The Sims 3</em>); <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23433566/sims-5-project-rene-paralives-life-sim"><em>Paralives</em></a>, the highly customizable indie “doll house” life sim; and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23814842/palia-singularity-six-cozy-mmorpg-impressions"><em>Palia</em></a>, a cozy life sim with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24115870/stardew-valley-8-years-later-concernedape"><em>Stardew Valley</em></a> vibes that’s currently in beta. </p>
<p id="puOY0W">EA and Maxis’ <em>Project Rene</em> (aka <em>The Sims 5</em>) does not have a release window, as developers behind the game say they plan to show off their progress and factor in community input for several years. <em>The Sims 4</em> launched in 2014 and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23352758/sims-4-free-to-play-release-date-future-content-support">went free to play in 2022</a>, reaching more than 70 million players over the past decade.</p>

  <p id="vkBIwD">Kim Kardashian was already more than a household name in 2013. The Kardashian name (hers, specifically) was equivalent with “celebrity” — or “notoriety,” depending on who was saying it. But there was one more step toward international fame that she wasn’t so sure about: whether she wanted to become a video game character.</p>
<p id="fEoajG">Niccolo de Masi, the CEO of Glu Mobile at the time, first approached Kardashian in early 2013 with the idea of starring in a video game. Kardashian took several months to think through the idea. In their second meeting, de Masi showed Kardashian the game’s art — and that was it.</p>
<p id="rWnV1g">“Nothing grabbed or hooked her as much as seeing what she would look like as a real-life video game” character, he said. The concept he pitched was a good fit, too. The game that would become <em>Kim Kardashian: Hollywood</em> was all about giving players a chance to literally mimic Kardashian’s ascent to mega-fame. And it probably didn’t hurt that her new husband seemed just as fascinated by the idea. “As Kanye used to say to me, ‘Niccolo, my wife is a real-life video game character,’” de Masi said. </p>

<p id="O0avLO">Given the Kardashian notoriety, <em>KKH</em> was immediately thrust into the spotlight when it was released in June 2014. Mere months before its debut, <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/519032/kim-kardashian-reaches-20-million-followers-on-twitter-uses-kanye-west-rap-lyric-to-express-her-excitement-obvs">Kardashian surpassed 20 million followers on Twitter</a>. Her tweets about <em>KKH</em> meant an instant rush of downloads, so much so that the game would suddenly go down for a few hours, according to Chris Akhavan, Glu Mobile’s chief revenue officer at the time. “It was the worst feeling, because you have this megahit and it literally just stops working,” he said. “The amount of stress that was created for the team was tremendous.”</p>
<p id="RWjIPt">That stress led to huge success. In its first two years, <em>KKH</em> generated $160 million in revenue for Glu Mobile. The game continued to receive updates over the years — all the way until April 8, 2024, when Glu Mobile took it offline for good. It’s now hidden away on some Electronic Arts server, unavailable to the public.</p>

<p id="8ANiMW">EA had acquired Glu Mobile in 2021 for $2.4 billion. Three years later, the publishing giant <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24086077/electronic-arts-ea-layoffs-february-2024">laid off hundreds of staff</a> and announced that it was shutting down several of its mobile titles, including <em>KKH</em>. (Neither Glu Mobile nor Electronic Arts responded to multiple requests for comment.) The early 2024 announcement allowed <em>KKH</em> players several months to prepare, and gave the team at Glu Mobile the same period to wind down a game that was 10 years in the making.</p>
<p id="V52OLy">Kardashian declined to be interviewed for this story, but a representative pointed Polygon <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/01/03/kim-kardashian-mobile-game-shutting-down-decade-hollywood-app/">toward a statement she made in January</a>. “I’m so grateful from the bottom of my heart to everyone who has loved and played <em>Kim Kardashian: Hollywood</em> in the past 10 years,” she wrote. “This journey has meant so much to me, but I’ve realized that it’s time to focus that energy into other passions. I want to thank the Glu team and the many people behind the scenes who have worked diligently on making it a success. I will be forever inspired by this community that we built together.”</p>
<h2 id="M6NzfV"><strong>From stardom to Hollywood</strong></h2>
<p id="kq4xjM">Before <em>KKH</em>, there was <em>Stardom: The A-List</em> and its sequel,<em> Stardom: Hollywood</em>. Released in 2011 and 2013, respectively, the two free-to-play games were modest successes, but Glu Mobile believed that it could push the idea further. <em>Stardom: Hollywood</em> is essentially the basis of what <em>KKH</em> was built upon; the developers pulled its art style, closet, and robust systems into the celebrity-backed project. Kardashian was an obvious pick for a star to lead the game: Not only was she mega-famous and continuing to rise, but her life revolved around media — on red carpets, social platforms, and her hit reality TV show, <em>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</em>.</p>
<p id="BjAqUi">“If you really want to talk about where the essence of <em>KKH</em> comes from, you have to look at the first Stardom game, when we were Blammo Games,” said Danny Zabbal, one of several Glu Mobile employees who saw things through from the beginning. (<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110802007126/en/Glu-Announces-Two-Strategic-Acquisitions-of-Game-Developers">Blammo Games was acquired by Glu Mobile</a> in 2011.) Zabbal was brought on to Blammo Games to help build what would become <em>Stardom: The A-List</em> by Laura Zajacz, who was art director at the time, and later the creative director of Glu Mobile. </p>

<p id="u3lyqp">The pitch for <em>Stardom: The A-List</em> was that it was a fashion game that didn’t take itself too seriously. More importantly, it had a customizable avatar with <em>tons</em> of clothing and accessory options.</p>
<p id="KDd61q">“I don’t want to toot my own horn, but in 2011 it was kind of a big deal to have a character that was totally customizable,” Zabbal said. “I think <em>Skyrim</em> had just come out, and we were blown away by the options. In those days, it was a really big deal to have this character that could sing and dance and check her nails and do all this stuff. She could wear a hoodie or a pillbox hat or stilettos.”</p>
<p id="VxnTBG">Zabbal blasted out a prototype in roughly a week, a version of the rig that would later be integrated into <em>KKH</em>. “By the time I left the studio, it was version 67 or something like that. It had been iterated and modified and added to and expanded throughout the entire life cycle of the studio. I’m pretty proud of that. That’s really where my contribution begins: I made the damn rig.”</p>
<p id="BqIHY9">In the early stages of <em>KKH</em>, it was Zajacz, again, who pulled Zabbal in alongside another artist, Stephen Headley. “She pulled us into the parking lot, and I was a smoker at the time, so I immediately lit up a cigarette,” Zabbal said. “We did some logistics there in the parking lot, and she was like, ‘Go team, go.’”</p>
<p id="kssnOh">That afternoon, Zabbal said, they worked on concept art. Headley drew Kardashian, and Zabbal illustrated a background, like Beverly Hills — “a postcard for the location,” which he described as not necessarily accurate, but a “lovely broad impression with a tight, cool palette.” </p>
<p id="Z4PLNT">This early art — Headley’s depiction of Kardashian — was what hooked Kardashian herself. “Kim said many times, ‘I saw that they really got me when I saw how they drew me,’” de Masi said.</p>

<p id="JPQSnC">Kardashian, of course, did not have her own desk at the Glu Mobile offices, but she did stop by the San Francisco location occasionally — one visit of which was featured in <em>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</em>’ 10th season. Several developers who worked on the game said the working relationship with the reality superstar was as smooth as it looked on the show. Kardashian understood, the developers said, that the people at Glu Mobile were the experts, and she let them work their magic, whether that was related to the sorts of shoes that in-game Kim wore or the systems in the game.</p>
<p id="Sv2YyS">Kardashian also recorded hours and hours of voice lines for the game. <em>KKH</em> sound designer Aaron Tsang said Kardashian didn’t actually go into a studio to do it; she recorded her lines in massive, hourslong takes using equipment sent from Glu Mobile. Tsang was responsible for cutting and labeling these lines so they could get added into the game. “It was an eye-watering amount of editing,” he said. The team just left the mic running; Kardashian recorded the prewritten lines, but also some improv, making sure she sounded enough like herself.</p>

<p id="F6Lslv">Di Dan, a senior systems designer on <em>KKH</em>, said Kardashian was <em>very</em> easy to work with compared to other creative partners he’d encountered. “I didn’t interact with her personally, but we’d send her builds, and she or her people would send feedback to us,” he said. Zabbal added that he encountered very little resistance on the art side, just “manageable” feedback.</p>
<p id="rLKj7G">The team working on <em>KKH</em> was small at the start, because the “blueprint” of the game — the Stardom series — was already there, Dan said. The team wasn’t necessarily invested in Kardashian’s show or life; many of them said that after starting on the project, they began watching a lot of <em>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</em> to learn about her world. Though not everyone expressed fondness for the development period in interviews with Polygon, lots of people did. Sure, the game was based on a person who could be polarizing, but it was a legitimately good game.</p>

<p id="SOdYKO">“I’m not going to say we were ridiculed in the studio, but a lot of people — mostly men — don’t necessarily sign up to be a game developer on the Kim Kardashian game,” Zabbal said. “There were jabs at our expense.”</p>
<p id="ppepMA">Dan added that he saw his own distance from the subject as actually being a good thing for development. He might not have been the expected audience, but he and the team respected the audience that the game <em>was</em> meant for. “That maybe actually made it easier,” Dan said. “Because when you’re working on something you absolutely love — like, if I was working on<em> World of Warcraft</em> back in the day, I would have had stronger personal opinions, which would make it harder for me to see the broader player perspective.”</p>
<h2 id="2VjmhB"><strong>Kardashian-as-a-service</strong></h2>
<p id="lnvvDu"><em>Kim Kardashian: Hollywood</em> was not the first game to operate under the games-as-a-service model, but it was nonetheless an early example — perhaps before the term had even been coined. Games like <em>World of Warcraft</em> had been providing meaningful content updates and live operations for some time, but mobile games of the era were focused on smaller updates and on microtransactions. </p>
<p id="0BTW8W">“Back then, there was a lot more to figure out, because it was much newer,” Dan said. Part of that was the pace of updates. Akhavan said he underestimated the speed at which players would blast through content. “We were like, <em>Oh my god, we’re going to have to figure out how to create content 100 times faster than we thought we would have to</em>,” Akhavan said. “From both the perspective of scalability and making sure the game was up and running and operational, and then from a live operations and content perspective, the game was totally transformative for us.”</p>

<p id="b3WGIO">Andrew den Hertog, a game server engineer at Glu Mobile, helped with <em>KKH</em>’s live operations and back-end services to keep the game up and running — a big task for his first video game industry gig, he said, where he had to regularly support 100,000 concurrent users. “[<em>KK:H</em>] shaped how LiveOps [were] deployed by other apps,” den Hertog said. “The ability to release content without releasing updates to the app store was quite powerful, and I believe<em> KK:H </em>was one of the first apps that really capitalized on this.”</p>
<p id="zM1QPy">The development team had already been supporting the Stardom games for a while, but <em>KKH</em>’s success meant the pace of updates had to increase. The game launched in 2014 with a considerable amount of content extended by time restrictions — if you weren’t spending money, <em>KKH</em> cost time. But the nature of the game meant that there wasn’t really an end. Sure, you could reach the A-list, but the game forced you to keep playing to maintain your status there. Glu Mobile added new content consistently; the general types of updates spanned storylines and quests, clothing options, and systems. It was often grueling for the team to keep up with the Kardashians. The Kardashian tie-in — the fact that <em>KKH</em> was a game based on a real person’s life — meant that Glu could take inspiration from the show or from Kardashian’s life for updates. You’d frequently see Kardashian wearing something in real life, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KardashianHollywood/comments/t1swwm/kims_wedding_dress_that_featured_in_the_game/">then see it added to the game</a>.</p>
<p id="zaG0fC">Donny Meloche is one of several artists on <em>KKH</em> who, when he first started at Glu Mobile, largely worked on the game’s clothing. “All the research started from Kim,” Meloche said. “When the game first started, the way she styled herself and dressed — even just pop culture in general — was very different. The game and our research reflected her own fashion evolution, in a sense.”</p>
<p id="HthuJx">Narrative designer Josh Labelle, who came onto the team ahead of <em>KKH</em>’s pandemic resurgence, told Polygon that the art, in all its locations and clothing, was a huge part of the game’s success. “We would have showcases to look at all of the new outfits that were added, and my eyes would be watery every time looking at the creativity that the team brought to it,” Labelle said. He pointed to the dress that the player’s in-game manager, the very serious Simon, wore when he debuted as a drag queen named Miss Managed. “When we first created that dress Simon wore, our lead artist [Meloche] spent, like, three days doing all the stoning on the dress.”</p>

<p id="F4Bx9f">The clothing options eventually expanded into branded collaborations with the likes of Karl Lagerfeld and Roberto Cavalli, not only with re-creations of their clothes and accessories, but by building their brands into the storyline, too. Alanna Anderson, Glu Mobile’s head of brand partnerships at the time, said that brands were excited to try something new with <em>KKH</em>. “[Roberto Cavalli] actually launched a Viper sneaker in Kim’s game first,” she said. “There were only 60 available worldwide, and we sold out of that in under three hours.”</p>
<p id="xSKIEv">“Even just pop culture references — I remember the day ‘The Dress,’ the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/26/8118825/white-gold-dress-blue-black-what-color">blue and gold dress</a>, went viral, and they immediately put it into the game,” said Lián Amaris, former Glu Mobile director of content and community, to Polygon. “A big part of the magic was that it felt like you were involved in something that was bigger than the game.”</p>

<p id="c7xad2">Some of these clothing options were available to players for free, by earning one of several different in-game currencies. Dan, who worked on the game’s economy, told Polygon that Glu Mobile was always eyeing what players wanted, trying to predict whether they’d be willing to pay for something. He pointed to one scenario in which the audience surprised him: “There are questions like, ‘We have an animated purse that has a chihuahua in it, and an animated purse that has a kitten in it. Which do players want more?’” he said. “I thought it was chihuahuas, because back in that time, Paris Hilton was more relevant, and she was walking around with chihuahuas all the time.” The answer, though, was that people wanted the cats.</p>
<p id="agp4N2">Even more remarkable is that the team had to work within a restrictive, outdated system that had been in place since the Stardom franchise. “[<em>KKH</em>] was so far beyond the point — we’re not going to put it in new software; we’ve just got to keep it as is,” Meloche said. “The whole team was really able to innovate using outdated technology and still make it look incredibly current and relevant and exciting for people, even though we were super limited with what we could change.”</p>
<p id="BzwiOq">Meloche and Glu Mobile user experience designer Ravi Aujla both brought up a lack of body diversity in <em>KKH</em>, something that was a pain point for the community at times. Even adding gloves or a more intricate hairstyle was difficult. “Anytime you had to do that, it could potentially break the game when adding layers into Flash,” Meloche said. Aujla said the Electronic Arts acquisition was helpful in figuring out certain problems, like how to add better, more diverse skin tones with makeup that worked correctly on different skin. <em>The Sims 4</em> improved its skin tone options, and Aujla said the <em>KKH</em> team could look to Maxis to figure it all out. That skill sharing happened in reverse, too, he said — that Maxis looked at <em>KKH</em>’s wardrobe for inspiration and ideation.</p>

<p id="YzqVPS">Narratively, Labelle said he looked at <em>KKH</em> as an evolution of the soap opera. Instead of doing huge drops with a bunch of content to blast through, Glu turned more to daily experiences meant to be played in small doses as <em>KKH</em> evolved. “We would bring a cliffhanger approach to it, where at the end of each day, there would be a ‘tune in tomorrow’ message,” said Labelle, speaking of the team’s pandemic-era strategy. “We were all in a similar situation to what everybody else in the world was, and there was really this feeling of, <em>Let’s bring people something exciting to look forward to every single day with a little piece of story</em>.”</p>
<h2 id="6NyA6g"><strong>The real star wasn’t Kim — it was the player</strong></h2>
<p id="f4yRuV">The free-to-play mobile game bore the name of a reality TV superstar and billionaire businesswoman, but <em>KKH</em> was actually more about the player: You started as an E-list nobody in Los Angeles, and you were befriended by Kardashian on your ascent to A-list stardom. To get there, you had to work — book modeling gigs and acting jobs, show your face at the clubs, and date around. You’d buy homes and businesses, adopt pets, get married, and even have kids, if you pleased. As in other mobile games, the gameplay mostly consisted of swiping and tapping: tap to talk to Kardashian, tap to fix your makeup, tap to pose for a photoshoot, tap to flirt with the bartender, and tap to collect money and points. It wasn’t necessarily groundbreaking for <em>KKH</em> to be designed around making the player feel like the real star. What did make the game unusual among other wildly popular games was who it presumed that player to be: a person who likes girly stuff.</p>

<p id="taD8PA">It may seem tempting to write off a game like <em>KKH</em>, one that’s seemingly centered on the frivolity of capitalistic celebrity culture. And at the time, a lot of mainstream media <em>did</em> write it off. Because of the Kardashian name, <em>KKH</em> was immediately thrust into the mainstream, something that was quite rare for a casual, free-to-play game, especially one targeted at the largely ignored female gaming market. </p>
<p id="VsGL75">“When it first came out, there was a weird mix of derision and obsession that seemed to be happening simultaneously,” Shira Chess, author and associate professor of entertainment and media studies at the University of Georgia, told Polygon. Stephen Colbert infamously parodied the app, its business model, and Kardashian (lots of <em>but what does she do?</em>s) with his own mock game called <em>Stephen Colbert: I’d Tap That!</em> Meanwhile, the mainstream business press <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2014/07/30/technology/kardashian-app-game/">balked at the $200 million</a> that <em>KKH</em> was expected to bring in during its first year — not necessarily questioning how a game could make that much money, but how <em>this</em> game could. </p>
<p id="jN0NJo">Yet plenty of people who actually played <em>KKH</em> found it to be “<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2014/07/why-the-kim-kardashian-game-is-legitimately-good.html">legitimately good</a>.” Not only did it have a fun gameplay loop and an impressive character customization menu, but it was largely self-aware; the developers created a game that was an intentional parody of celebrity culture. It was complex and genuinely engaging while also trying to extract something from the player, be it money or time. <em>KKH </em>both pushed away from and engaged with stereotypes of women, at once proving there was a market for “girl games” while also being stereotypically girly and pushing a beauty ideal. </p>
<p id="J3riqU">“At its core, the idea of games starting to be designed for audiences that weren’t white dudes in the 2010s was itself a move towards trying to think about games that could be other,” Chess said. “I wouldn’t say it’s exactly feminist design, but it certainly changed how people were thinking about games.”</p>

<p id="xkV8Is">Chess continued: “On the other hand, bodies were very limited to specific shapes and sizes. We were playing these games that centered materialism as the core purpose of being.” Chess said that games designed for women typically have one of a few things: some sort of emotional labor, time as labor, a consumerist pull, or a way to customize an avatar. <em>KKH</em> had all of them — and it worked.</p>
<p id="t3cxpV">It all worked because every decision felt like it made sense, both in terms of gameplay and within the <em>KKH</em> world. For a game about a social media superstar, <em>KKH</em>’s implementation of tapping the screen felt like an obvious gameplay mechanic because of Kardashian’s social media fame and because the game often had you doing simple tasks in order to raise your clout. The time-based restrictions also made sense — yes, they were a play for player retention, but they often created some tension for the game, too. Early on, you were often waiting for your manager to give you a call with news: Did you get the gig? <em>KKH</em> actually made you wait for that call.</p>
<p id="qBpafo">Amaris, in charge of social media and community, added that <em>KKH</em>’s social media integration was intrinsic to the spirit of the game and its fan base. “It was a built-in viral mechanism,” she said, and one of the ways in which <em>KKH</em> influenced the industry. It may not have been the first game to incorporate concepts like letting players assemble scenes in a photo booth, but its overall design had a major impact. “The rebranding of oneself in the style of a fandom is something that the game really pioneered digitally,” said Amaris. “The ease of that digital avatar being shared, and being this other version of yourself, was an incredible driver of the community and its success.”</p>

<p id="suYiOk">There was a lot of <em>KKH</em> that was clunky, or a little haphazard, Chess said. But there was a magic to the game and its little moments. “It’s a little burst of play that you get to fit into your life,” Chess said. You could look at the way it was designed as sexist — based on an assumption that women don’t have the interest or time to play games — but you can also see it as designed for a greater variety of people, such as parents, who don’t have much time for play. “It’s opening a space where people are like, <em>Oh, actually, I think I do like video games</em>,” Chess added.</p>
<p id="tnX16J"><em>KKH</em> made investors take a more serious look at casual video games, which are often marketed toward women, because the genre was suddenly seen as a huge moneymaker. <em>KKH</em> wasn’t the only game that influenced this, but it was a major player in that movement. Indeed, the success of <em>KKH</em> and other casual titles was key in the rapid expansion of the mobile game industry; <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/video-game-industry-revenues-by-platform/">according to data from Pelham Smithers</a>, a market research firm, mobile gaming has kept growing each year, leading to its revenue making up more than half the overall gaming industry’s total since 2019. The mobile game market, despite being underrepresented in media coverage, <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/video-game-industry-revenues-by-platform/">dominates when it comes to money made</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Z5NmuF"><strong>A lasting legacy</strong></h2>
<p id="NZJaL3">As soon as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24024266/kim-kardashian-mobile-game-shutting-down-glu-mobile">the game’s shutdown was announced</a> in early 2024, <em>Kim Kardashian: Hollywood</em> players began to prepare. By the time the last day arrived, they had finished scouring their closets for their finest black clothing — after all, there was a funeral to be held. On forums and social media, and in Facebook groups, players took to the runway one last time. “Leave looking snatched,” one forum user wrote, commenting on a bedazzled black gown that cuts right in at the waist. “Slaying at the funeral, but mad about it,” another wrote, alongside a screenshot of her tattooed doll dressed in a Victorian-era dress overlaid with black lace. If the girls were going out, they were doing it in style — a dramatic, flowing veil on their heads; a bouquet of dried black roses in their hands; and thigh-high platform boots on their feet.</p>

<p id="7hG8DI">Though several <em>KKH</em> players on the forums attempted to manifest the continuation of the servers, the game did indeed go offline on April 8, ending its nearly 10-year lifespan. The breadth of style on display during the game’s “funeral” is a testament to that legacy; there were thousands of pieces of clothing and accessories that players had spent just shy of a decade acquiring. </p>
<p id="teBmi9">Interest in the game had died down as the years went on, but <em>KKH</em> saw a resurgence during the pandemic, when people started to revisit their favorite game experiences. But now it’s gone, except for the YouTube Let’s Plays and photobooth Twitter posts. It’s not an experience unique to <em>KKH</em>, either, and the industry is still grappling with how to preserve online experiences like this.</p>

<p id="8rckQs">“When something like <em>Kim Kardashian: Hollywood</em> shuts down, it only ever can live on in memory, because it’s not something that, 20 years later, people will play again,” Chess said. “It speaks to how the industry thinks of AAA games versus casuals — that it doesn’t matter, because there’ll be another casual [game] in a few weeks that takes over everybody’s hearts and minds. But it did once take over people’s hearts and minds. And now it’s nowhere.”</p>
<p id="weov2V">The shutdown of <em>KKH</em> feels like when your favorite TV show goes off the air, but almost worse: You can still watch reruns of the show, but that’s not the case with a game like <em>KKH</em>. For the community, it’s been hard to find something to replace the experience. There are plenty of other fashion games, but nothing that checks all of <em>KKH</em>’s boxes. Some players refuse to delete the app, hoping for a miracle that one day it’ll come back online.</p>
<p id="IbIJAm">That’s unlikely, and so, in forums and Facebook groups, players are relegated to reliving their memories. And the game’s developers still have that, too.</p>
<p id="CHeWUC">“Now I have this weird thing in my life where, when I die, at my funeral, someone is going to give a eulogy and they’re going to mention Kim Kardashian,” Zabbal said. “That’s going to be so bizarre.” </p>

Of course, this could all change soon as we rapidly approach the summer showcase season where exciting new reveals will undoubtedly steal the headlines. Sony will, presumably, want something shiny to show alongside a potential unveiling of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-reportedly-tells-developers-to-prepare-game-for-ps5-pro-release">the heavily rumored PS5 Pro</a>. But how many of those fresh announcements will actually be playable within the next six months is another question, though. My guess is very few.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><p>Beyond this year’s upcoming Silent Hill 2 Remake, Death Stranding 2 in 2025, Bungie’s Marathon, and a couple of other first-party releases we’ll cover shortly, PlayStation’s cupboard is looking relatively bare, especially when it comes to games from those keystone PlayStation Studios. It begs the question of what each of these teams – those that helped build the PlayStation library into the strong place to play it is today – are up to now, and how long before we get to both see and play them. So let’s take a look at what each of those developers (not including support studios) are doing, and when we can realistically expect to see new games from them.</p><h2><u><strong>Naughty Dog</strong></u></h2><p>Arguably the jewel in the PlayStations Studios crown, Naughty Dog’s last full release was 2020’s The Last of Us Part 2. The Uncharted developer hasn’t been completely quiet since then, releasing both remastered versions of The Last of Us Part 1 (in collaboration with Iron Galaxy) and Part 2 as recently as this January. But Naughty Dog’s most notable recent announcement wasn’t a new launch, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-cancelled-will-focus-on-single-player-games-going-forward">the cancellation of a multiplayer entry in the series</a> that the studio had spent many years on before deciding to turn its attention back to where its proven skills lie: single-player adventures. </p><p>In March 2023, co-studio head Neil Druckmann stated <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-druckmann-says-naughty-dog-has-chosen-its-next-game-but-doesnt-confirm-the-last-of-us-part-3">the developer had chosen its next project</a> but didn’t confirm if it was The Last of Us Part 3 or something else. In the 14 months since we’ve heard very little, aside from a small tease in The Last of Us Part 2 making-of documentary where <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-druckmann-teases-concept-for-the-last-of-us-part-3-theres-probably-one-more-chapter-to-this-story">Druckmann stated he has a “concept” in mind</a> and that there's "probably one more chapter to this story."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Could we see a reveal of this new project soon? Whether it’s a continuation of Ellie’s story, a return to Nathan Drake’s adventures, or something completely new entirely, I wouldn’t be too surprised to see an announcement this year, even if playing it is still a way off. The relatively short two-to-three-year gaps between Uncharted and The Last of Us games are long gone, sadly, with four already having passed since Naughty Dog’s last.</p><h2><u><strong>Santa Monica Studio</strong></u></h2><p>Santa Monica Studio released God of War Ragnarok to huge success in late 2022 and followed up with the surprisingly lengthy free Valhalla DLC in December of last year. However, what’s next for the studio is a mystery, although we do know Cory Barlog – game director of 2018’s God of War – <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-new-director-cory-barlog-unannounced-projects">moved on to helm a new project in 2021</a> after leaving Eric Williams to fill Ragnarok’s director seat. Little to nothing is known about that new project, but given it’s been in development for a number of years already it wouldn’t be beyond belief to see it revealed this year.</p><p>As for a new God of War game, well, we likely can’t expect that as quickly. Despite the gap between Ragnarok and its predecessor being only four years, the end of Kratos’ Norse saga signals a new direction for the series which, naturally, means it’ll require a lot more work from the ground up. We can hope, of course, but don’t expect to see everyone’s favourite angry dad any time soon. That said, we wouldn’t say no to a remake of the original trilogy…</p><h2><u><strong>Insomniac Games</strong></u></h2><p>Insomniac is arguably Sony’s most prolific studio, releasing either a Spider-Man or Ratchet and Clank game every couple of years for almost a decade now, most recently last year with the hugely successful Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. But in a worrying sign of the fragile state of the games industry, even a game of that magnitude <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-significant-playstation-layoffs-affecting-900-staff-london-studio-to-close">couldn’t prevent layoffs</a> from occurring this year in what turned out to be a doubly damaging couple of months for the developer, following <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/insomniac-hackers-release-stolen-data-leak-wolverine-videos-future-projects-and-more">a huge data breach and subsequent theft</a>.</p><p>The data theft revealed that the highly anticipated Wolverine game is not expected until 2026 at the earliest, but also that a Venom game may arrive before it in 2025. Either way, it’s highly unlikely Insomniac will be springing any surprise games this year, and after all the studio has gone through recently I think it's fair to allow it as much of a break as anyone.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><u><strong>Sucker Punch Productions</strong></u></h2><p>Sucker Punch has been very quiet since 2020’s Ghost of Tsushima. Work is presumably underway on its next game but, truth be told, we have little idea what exactly that is. Common wisdom would suggest a direct sequel would be the most logical move due to the success of the first game, and a 2022 job listing might be a small clue towards this notion.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sucker-punch-job-listing-ghost-of-tsushima-2">A posting on the studio’s career page</a> looking for an Encounter Designer noted that responsibilities would include delivering “interesting and varied encounters in an open-world game, with a particular focus on melee combat and stealth”. This certainly suggests a return to Japan, but could easily also suggest (to an admittedly lesser extent) a new Infamous or Sly Cooper game, or something altogether different. The truth is we have no real idea, but let’s just hope that silence is broken soon.</p><h2><u><strong>Guerrilla Games</strong></u></h2><p>Guerrilla followed up 2022’s Horizon: Forbidden West with last year’s Burning Shores DLC as it continued to build out Aloy’s story. With the West Coast-set sequel ending on a cliffhanger, it’s not a stretch to expect the Amsterdam-based studio to be working on the third part of the trilogy next. We wouldn’t expect any news on that one soon however – the development time between Zero Dawn and Forbidden West was five years so we’re likely a little while away from seeing Aloy and her metal dinosaur friends again soon.</p><p>We do know that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-multiplayer-game-confirmed-by-guerrilla">a multiplayer Horizon game is currently in the works</a>, though, starring “a new cast of characters and a unique stylized look”. Perhaps this is something we can hope to see more of sooner rather than later, although this year may be a stretch.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><u><strong>Housemarque</strong></u></h2><p>Returnal brought Housemarque a level of mainstream appeal that had previously evaded the Finnish studio, so I wouldn’t be surprised if it returned to that world. However, that seemingly won’t be the developer’s next game as back in 2022 it confirmed it had started work on a new project that was in the “<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/housemarque-returnal-sequel">early days with us starting a new game, a new IP.</a>” It’s currently unclear how the departure of Returnal director Harry Krueger – who had been at Housemarque for 14 years – has affected the development though. For now, this new game remains a mystery but maybe we’ll hear something soon.</p><h2><u><strong>Firewalk Studios</strong></u></h2><p>Firewalk is the first studio listed here to actually have a game (albeit tentatively) listed for a 2024 release. Revealed last May, Concord is a PvP multiplayer shooter with a retro-futuristic sci-fi aesthetic that can be gleaned from its CGI announcement trailer. But, we’ve heard practically nothing since. We’re hoping to see some gameplay soon, otherwise that 2024 date might start to look a little shaky.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><u><strong>Haven Studios</strong></u></h2><p>Fairgame$ is set to be the first game from Jade Raymond’s Haven Studios and is a competitive heist game we’ve seen little of beyond a stylish CGI trailer. With no release window as yet, we’d be surprised to see it drop later this year – last November, Sony president Hiroki Totoki said it was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-commits-to-launch-just-six-of-playstations-12-live-service-games-by-march-2026">reducing the number of live service games</a> due for release before March 2026 from 12 to six. </p><p>With the continuing success of Helldivers 2, PSN/Steam hiccups aside, I’m sure PlayStation will look to learn the positive lessons from its development and apply them to future projects such as Fairgame$. The next step will be seeing a gameplay reveal, which is something we can realistically hope for this year. </p><h2><u><strong>Bend Studio</strong></u></h2><p>Bend has been pretty quiet since the release of Days Gone way back in 2019 but in 2022 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bend-studio-unannounced-project-logo-reveal">a few slithers of detail were revealed</a> about what the Oregon studio is currently working on. It shared that its new game will “build upon the open-world systems of Days Gone” but won’t be announced until “the time is right”. Apart from knowing it won’t be a continuation of Deacon St. John’s story, we really know nothing. Enough time has passed, though, that hopefully new info isn’t too far away.</p><h2><u><strong>Media Molecule</strong></u></h2><p>Media Molecule spent most of the past decade working on Dreams, the game creation and curation project that was released in 2020. But as a result of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dreams-developer-media-molecule-reportedly-suffers-round-of-layoffs">significant layoffs at the studio earlier in 2024</a>, live support for the game will soon end as MM aims to ensure “Dreams transitions into a self-sustaining platform”. There has since been no news on what the developer’s next project will be.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><u><strong>Team Asobi</strong></u></h2><p>Team Asobi has brought everyone’s favourite little robot, Astrobot, to both traditional and VR platformers for the entirety of its 12-year existence. Previously part of Japan Studio, in 2021 it became a standalone studio following the success of PS5 launch game, Astro’s Playroom. What’s next though is yet to be revealed, but in 2022 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astros-playroom-developer-is-working-on-its-biggest-ever-game">studio director Nicolas Doucet revealed</a> it would be Asobi’s “biggest to date."</p><p>This is one we could theoretically see soon as plenty of time has passed since the developer’s last release and we know development has been in the works for multiple years now. Hopefully, the long-rumored PS5 Pro would be a perfect place for Asobi to replicate the success of Astro’s Playroom as a technical showcase for a new console that was also incredibly fun. Fingers crossed we get a reveal this year at the very least.</p><h2><u><strong>Bluepoint Games</strong></u></h2><p>Following the success of both the Shadow of the Colossus and Demon’s Souls remakes, Sony acquired Bluepoint Games as a first-party studio in 2021. We don’t know what its first project since joining the PlayStation Studios family is, though, but we do know that the developer has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-acquires-bluepoint-next-game-playstation-exclusive">expressed its desire to create an original game</a>, rather than reimagining another classic. Perhaps we could see a reveal this year.</p><h2><u><strong>Polyphony Digital</strong></u></h2><p>Polyphony has been making Gran Turismo for 25 years now so it would certainly be a shock to see it veer from that path in the near future. Having only released GT7 less than two years ago, it’s unrealistic to expect anything new from the racing masters any time soon. Let’s come back to this when the PlayStation 6 arrives.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><u><strong>San Diego Studio</strong></u></h2><p>Similarly, San Diego is well established as the MLB The Show studio. This year’s entry only dropped in March, so we can expect to see another next Spring if history is anything to go by.</p><h2><u><strong>Firesprite</strong></u></h2><p>Having recently focussed on VR games, Firesprite most recently developed Horizon: Call of the Mountain for PSVR 2. What’s next is anyone’s guess, however. A new VR game would be the educated guess, but given Sony’s lack of commitment to creating games for its second headset, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see the UK studio pivot to something more traditional. </p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-owned-dev-firesprite-reportedly-suffered-from-a-toxic-culture-fresh-report-claims">With recent reports of layoffs and unrest</a> at the developer, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-reportedly-cancels-twisted-metal-live-service-game-as-part-of-mass-layoffs">a live-service Twisted Metal game was reportedly canceled</a>, with the studio supposedly working on a new PlayStation game called Project Heartbreak. Details are thin on what this is though, and when we can expect to see it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>That’s everything we know about upcoming first-party PlayStation games, and the truth is very few release dates look to be coming up quickly. Of course, this can and likely will change soon, and with GTA 6 looming on the horizon in 2025, it does make sense that many publishers are waiting for Rockstar to make the first move when picking a window. That said, that doesn’t prevent 2024 from still looking relatively empty when it comes to PS5 exclusives. Let’s hope that after a summer of reveals the outlook will look a lot brighter, not only for players waiting for new games to play, but for the developers who work so hard to deliver them to us.</p><p><em>Simon Cardy wouldn't love nothing more than another adventure with his little Astro Bot friend.

      </p></div><div><p>A team of veteran developers behind games such as <em>Sid Meier’s Civilization</em>, <em>XCOM</em>, and <em>The Sims</em> have announced the establishment of <a title="Companies > Midsummer Studios" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/midsummer-studios">Midsummer Studios</a>, as well as teased its in-development “next-generation entry” to the life simulation genre. <span id="more-882240"></span></p><p>Midsummer Studios was founded in Hunt Valley, Maryland by creative director Jake Solomon and game director Will Miller, both formerly of Firaxis, and chief operating officer / chief financial officer Nelsie Birch, who has 25 years of financial and operations <a title="Genres > Management [19 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a> experience.</p><p>The studio launched with $6 million raised from major investors. Transcend Fund led the round, and is joined by Tirta Ventures, Betaworks Ventures, 1Up Ventures, F4 Fund, <a title="Companies > KRAFTON [26 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/krafton">KRAFTON</a>, and Day Zero Productions.</p><p>The studio’s upcoming life <a title="Genres > Simulation [465 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">simulation game</a> promises to emphasize player-driven narratives, allowing communities to share memorable moments that grow out of the creativity of players.</p><p>“The best stories in games are written by the players,” said Midsummer Studios CEO and creative director Jake Solomon in a press release. “At Midsummer we’re making a life sim focused on the drama of modern life, where our players will write meaningful stories just by playing, and then share those stories with the world.”</p><p>Transcend founding partner Shanti Bergel added, “Leading the Seed for Midsummer was a natural fit for Transcend. As a producer on <em>The Sims</em> myself nearly twenty years ago, I am well acquainted with the power that meaningful player-driven stories can unlock. I also have an abiding respect for how hard it is to deliver the alchemy of community, systems design, gameplay, and user generated content necessary to do so. The Midsummer founders are industry veterans with the rare experience and design artistry required to deliver against this massive opportunity. I am delighted to join the board and support their journey to redefine the life sim category.”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The studio’s roster has already added acclaimed talent and executive producer Grant Rodiek, who previously worked at Maxis for 18 years as a producer and director on various installments and expansions of <em>The Sims</em>.</p><p>Visit the studio’s official website <a href="https://www.midsummerstudios.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The game developers of X {formerly Twitter) have been purposefully introducing glitches into their games this week, just to see what would happen--and the results are hilarious. Challenged with multiplying a random value from their game files by 1,000, multiple game devs have posted varied results including giant enemies, floods of spawned items, and super-powerful attacks.</p><p>The trend was started by developer Tyler Glaiel, who is currently working on Mewgenics. Glaiel shared a GIF that showed the game with massively increased gore splatter, and then <a href="https://twitter.com/TylerGlaiel/status/1788362032699555985" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">challenged other</a> developers to post similar results from their own games in development.</p><p>It's not uncommon for these kinds of bugs to happen unintentionally during game development, when a developer accidentally enters one too many or too few zeros in a data field, but making them happen on purpose can be just as fun.</p><p>We've gathered some of our favorite takes on the prompt, though the post's quotes are filled with many more examples of mostly indie developers' funniest intentional bugs. One popular approach was to increase the number of items spawning from a specific event, though not all the devs' machines appeared to keep up with the huge number of spawns.</p><p>Some devs increased the distance an ability could work from, while others went straight to giving characters super strength by multiplying the force of an attack.</p><p>Of course it's hard to go past making random characters and objects super big or super tiny, though my favorite take on the prompt has to be indie darling Cult of the Lamb's ultra-chaos mode.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/14/hermen-hulst-and-hideaki-nishino-named-dual-playstation-ceos-following-jim-ryans<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Sony has appointed Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino as dual CEOs of PlayStation, following Jim Ryan's departure from the company this spring; they will begin June 1.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/09/27/playstation-head-jim-ryan-leaving-sony-next-spring#:~:text=Why%20Is%20Jim%20Ryan%20Leaving,said%20in%20the%20press%20release.">Ryan announced he was leaving PlayStation last year</a>, with Sony Group Corporation COO and CFO Hiroki Totoki stepping in as interim CEO following his departure in March. After that brief stint, PlayStation is tackling the CEO position with two figures, each with different focuses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hulst has been appointed CEO of SIE's Studio Business Group while Nishino has been appointed CEO of SIE's Platform Business Group. Totoki, now through as interim CEO, will serve as a Chairman of SIE in addition to returning to his role as COO and CFO of Sony Group Corporation. Both Nishino and Hulst will report to Totoki.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bCQMHjDAJZU" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>"Sony Interactive Entertainment is a dynamic and growing business that delivers incredible entertainment experiences through the connection of content and technology," Totoki writes in a press release. "These two leaders will have clear responsibilities and will manage strategic direction to ensure the focus remains on deepening engagement with existing PlayStation users and expanding experiences to new audiences."</p>

<p>Nishino was the senior vice president of PlayStation's Platform Experience Group, "responsible for developing the experiences and technology with PlayStation products and services," including the PlayStation 5, PlayStation VR2, and PlayStation Network. Sony says in his new CEO position, he will continue to be responsible for technology, products, services, and platform experiences. He will also oversee third party publisher and developer relations and commercial operations, including sales and marketing of hardware, services, and peripherals, the press release reads.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We will continue to connect players through world-class products, services, and technology," Nishino writes. "We always strive to grow our community even bigger with innovation in every area at Sony Interactive Entertainment. I am honored to be appointed such an important role alongside Hermen. By working more closely together, we will be positioned to build incredible experiences for an ever-expanding audience now and in the future."&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xq4XNbH6mtk" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Hulst was the senior vice president and PlayStation Studios head, responsible for "developing content across many devices including PlayStation consoles and PCs, and bringing video game IP to new mediums such as film and television through PlayStation Productions." As CEO, Hulst will be responsible for the development, publishing, and business operations of first party content.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I am thrilled to lead the studio business group and continue to build on our success with PlayStation 5, while preparing for the future," he writes in the press release. "The video game industry is one of the largest entertainment industries in the world and has been built on the marriage of content and technology, and I look forward to continuing to push the boundaries of play and entertainment."</p>

<p>Totoki says in a separate <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/a-message-from-hiroki-totoki-a-new-era-at-sony-interactive-entertainment/">blog post</a> that later this month, players will "learn more about the long-term vision for Sony Group and the essential role SIE plays in that vision," hinting that the company might have some kind of event happening in May. He adds, "[Fiscal Year 2024] marks the start of the Mid-Range Plan period for Sony Group in which we will set the course for sustainable growth."&nbsp;</p>
