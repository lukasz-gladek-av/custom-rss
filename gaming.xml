<figure><a title="Bitsummit 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/034614476e800/bitsummit-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bitsummit</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has reconfirmed that it will be attending BitSummit 2025 to showcase select indie games on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>This year's event, dubbed <strong>BitSummit the 13th: Summer of Yokai</strong>, will take place at the the Miyako Messe in Kyoto City from <strong>Friday, 19th July to Sunday, 21st July</strong>. Tickets are on sale now for Japanese attendees via the <a href="https://t.pia.jp/en/pia/event/event.do?eventCd=2511585">Ticket Pia website</a>, while international attendees can use a dedicated <a href="https://ticket.pia.jp/piasp/inbound/bitsummit25eng.jsp">English-language page</a>.</p>

<p>Nintendo has stressed that it will not be showcasing any first-party games at the event, which is completely understandable given the nature of BitSummit. It's also confirmed that the Nintendo booth will be accessible via a lottery system, with the reservation page available at a later date.</p>
<p>Other confirmed publishers attending the event include PlayStation, PocketPair, Lost in Cult, Inti Creates, Spike Chunsoft, Devolver Digital, and more.</p>
<p>Nintendo will no doubt be seeking every available opportunity to advertise the Switch 2 now that it's out in the wild. Having launched earlier this month, it's gone on to become the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-switch-2-crushes-ps2-to-become-fastest-selling-console-ever">fastest-selling console of all time in Japan</a>, and the fastest-selling Nintendo platform in both the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-is-officially-the-fastest-selling-nintendo-hardware-ever-in-the-us">US</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-is-nintendos-biggest-uk-console-launch-of-all-time">UK</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-is-a-linear-game-that-won%E2%80%99t-place-too-much-focus-on-difficulty.1219299/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-is-a-linear-game-that-wont-place-too-much-focus-on-difficulty/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The revival of Onimusha, CAPCOM's action series that hasn't seen a new entry in nearly twenty years, certainly surprised fans. During the latest Summer Game Fest 2025, where Onimusha: Way of the Sword was shown to the press (<a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-hands-off-sgf-2025-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ourselves included</a>), Italian website Multiplayer had the chance to speak to the developers and learn more details about the upcoming game, such as its linear level design.</p>
<p><em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword will generally be structured around a series of sequential missions. There will be a series of levels and, as shown in the presentation, those individual levels will feature a relatively linear path with some secondary areas: once you reach the final boss, you defeat it and move on to the next mission. However, the content shown in the presentation was only representative of a small fraction of what is found in the Kiyomizu-dera level. Although the essence is linear, there is a lot of hidden content in each level.</em></p>
<p>One thing is for sure: CAPCOM did not choose to bring back the franchise as a reaction to games like Dark Souls. In fact, they said that the goal is not at all to create a particularly challenging game.</p>
<p><em>I can say without a doubt that we did not decide to bring Onimusha back to life because of the recent trend of particularly difficult video games. On the contrary, we want to ensure that as wide an audience as possible can immediately get into the game and enjoy it. The goal is not to create a difficult experience: we want to offer the right sense of satisfaction to both hardcore gamers and those who approach it from other perspectives, for example, to enjoy the story and setting.</em></p>
<p>It seems like Onimusha: Way of the Sword will focus more on the narrative than ever before, as the developers recognized it is a major way to open up the game to a broader audience.</p>
<p>So far, we only have a generic 2026 release window. However, with the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-onimusha-way-of-the-sword-playable-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to be playable at Gamescom 2025, a launch in the first half of next year is not to be ruled out.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade-pc-sales-apparently-topped-a-million-in-just-three-days.1219296/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-pc-sales-1m-three-days<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PC sales of the hack-and-slash actioner&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>apparently reached a major milestone within just three days of the game's release, according to a new report.</p>

<p>Per Korean news platform <a href="https://bbs.ruliweb.com/news/read/211821" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ruliweb</a>&nbsp;(via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-proves-theres-appetite-for-playstation-5-games-on-pc-as-it-blasts-past-one-million-sales-in-three-days" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>),&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>'s PC version, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-pc-release-june-leak" rel="nofollow">released last week</a>, racked up a million sales for itself on PC alone within the first three days of its release on the platform.</p>

<p>According to Ruliweb, that brings the game's total sales up to over three million around the world. That's on both PlayStation 5 and PC, of course, and it also includes both digital and physical shipments. Still, that's not a bad figure at all, and it means&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>has picked up an extra two million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-sales-one-million" rel="nofollow">since June last year</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stellar-blade-pc-sales-report-boss.jpg?itok=uA66X8Or 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stellar-blade-pc-sales-report-boss.jpg?itok=0eCGlPQk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stellar Blade</em>'s PC port has done solid numbers, according to a new report.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>, it's an action game developed by&nbsp;<em>Goddess of Victory: Nikke&nbsp;</em>studio Shift Up. Released last year, the game revolves around Eve, who must rid Earth of a hostile force known as the Naytiba.</p>

<p>Since launch,&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>has received a number of updates, including the addition of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-new-game-plus-mode" rel="nofollow">New Game Plus mode</a>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover" rel="nofollow">crossover with&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover" rel="nofollow">Nier: Automata</a>&nbsp;</em>(one of the game's biggest inspirations), and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/festive-stellar-blade-update" rel="nofollow">lots of new outfits</a> for several of the game's characters as well.</p>

<p>Supposedly, the game did so well that Shift Up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-shift-up-ps5-pro-bonus" rel="nofollow">gifted all of its employees PS5 Pro consoles</a> as a Christmas bonus last year, and since&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>boasts PS5 Pro improvements (along with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/full-ps5-pro-enhanced-list-launch" rel="nofollow">several other games</a>), I'm sure that came as a welcome surprise.</p>




<p>As for what's next for Shift Up, a <i>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</i>sequel has been confirmed to be in the works, although we don't know when it's due yet. Additionally, the studio is currently working on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-developer-shift-up-new-action-rpg" rel="nofollow">new next-gen action-RPG</a>&nbsp;with an urban sci-fi theme.</p>

I have yet to play Oxygen Not Included, but Klei seldom miss - their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mark-of-the-ninja">Mark Of The Ninja</a> remains one of my favouritest ninja shankfests - and Away Team already seems very appealing for putting a deeply inhumane emphasis on traitorous physics.

<p>In offering a world in which "every tile is simulated", Away Team is both daring comparisons with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/noita">Noita</a> and building on the volatile foundations of Oxygen Not Included, which Nate (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oxygen-not-included-review">called</a> "a machine for procedurally generating engineering problems, and due to the huge number of physical properties interacting in the simulation, they will never be the same twice".</p>
<p>In Away Team, you are a solitary Oxygen Not Included colonist, aka Duplicant, who has mistakenly pushed a big red button and rocketed off to a strange new world. Equipped with a vacuum gun, you must explore the depths and craft your own abode from all the materials you find. You will need food and oxygen. Also, a working understanding of conductivity. And a very careful aim.</p>
<p>This is a realm in which every piece of matter is subject to the laws of thermodynamics. Liquids flow and evaporate. Fires spread, given access to flammable materials. I don't remember things being so... temperamental in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek">Star Trek</a> away missions, but I would have happily watched a million episodes of a show in which Captain Picard spends 29 minutes gingerly carving out acid vats, then says "oh shit" just before the credits roll.</p>
<p>Away Team has yet no release date, but it does have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2168390/Away_Team/">a Steam page</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Death, taxes, and CD Projekt finding ways to make its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">massive RPGs</a> come with graphical options that'll have your computer kicking out enough heat to turn the arctic circle into the Arizona desert. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> sounds set to continue that trend, even if its devs have opted to go "more-console first" when putting it together.</p>
<p>Folks from the studio and Epic revealed this in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OplYN2MMI4Q&amp;t=253s">a chat</a> with the beloved boffins over at Digital Foundry. As you'd expect, it's a long discussion that delves into all things hardware-related when it comes to TW4's recent tech demo. You know, the one that included <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/witcher-fans-reckon-the-witcher-4-tech-demo-featured-familiar-voice-from-the-witcher-3-interesting-extra-wrinkle">familiar voices</a> and exposed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/could-the-witcher-4s-kelpie-be-the-best-video-game-horse-yet-we-asked-an-expert">horse muscles</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We always do PC and we push and then we try to scale down," Charles Tremblay, CD Projekt's VP of technology said when asked why the tech demo was on PS5. "But then we had so many problems in the past that we tried to see, ok, this time around we really want to be [doing] more console-first development, right? We worked with Unreal, with our partner, and then we saw the challenge. To realise the ambition, to make what we want at 60 fps on PS5 would be, you know, there would be work."</p>
<p>So, the studio's made The Witcher 4's console performance a big focus - something that's not surprising given <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s launch issues generally proved much more dire on those platforms than on PC. That's not to say we were spared totally, I remember some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-review">pretty wacky glitches</a> from the start of my first playthrough, but nothing so game-breaking it made me consider <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-removed-cyberpunk-2077-from-the-playstation-store">trying to get a refund</a>.</p>
<p>However, don't fret, CD Projekt still plan on letting you take full advantage of the bells and whistles the best PCs can pull off, even if it sounds like they're currently figuring out exactly what that'll entail.</p>
<p>"It's easier to scale up than down, because we know that both Lumen (UE5's global illumination and reflections system) and all those technologies are providing us pretty consistent representation across the scale up, we know that once we set up certain foundations both visually and technically, there's room to scale up," CD Projekt VP and global art director Jakub Knapik said in a bit of the chat about the game's graphical potential beyond what the PS5 can handle.</p>
<p>He added that CD Projekt aim to "expand all the raytracing features forwards" on PC, and in general ensure that people who spend the big bucks on their desktops are appropriately rewarded with the likes of uber-swankily rendered huts and suitably stunning vistas.</p>
<p>"In the past, something that's [been] super important for the group is that if people pay good money for the hardware, we want them to have what the game can provide for that [top hardware], not like a simplified experience," Tremblay added, "So this is something we'll definitely explore."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><iframe title="Survival Kids - Official Nintendo Switch 2 Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BhT0Rv8pFOs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is the very simple backstory holding down Survival Kids, a co-op survival game from Konami that’s received a surprise revival on Switch 2. The original was a Game Boy Color game of the same name, which was just rereleased on Nintendo Classics last month, and continued in the noughties by the Lost in Blue trilogy on Nintendo DS.</p>


<p>Survival Kids is a colourful romp across a series of fantastical and magical islands. Either solo or with up to 3 friends, you set about crafting and cooking your way to freedom. Or, at the very least clumsily crashing your boat into every possible island on the way home.</p>
<p>Despite the name, this is more Messing About on m Islands Kids than it is about actual survival. You are functionally immortal, you will never die of starvation and there’s none of the usual inventory or time management that comes with the survival genre. This is very much a survival-lite game, making this a decent co-op option for those new to gaming. It’s also entirely playable solo, but as in real life, it’s quicker to chop a tree down when four people are wildly swinging axes at it.</p>

<p>Near the start of each level you will find a Harmony Stone — the McGuffin that both acts as portable camp as you work your way to higher ground, and drives the limited plot forward. This is a relic from a bygone era; despite each island being a deserted one, it was once home to an ancient race with an impressive command of technology.</p>

<p>Once you set up camp, you begin your hunt for either the elevator to the next strata of the island, or the boat that will get you off the island and onto the next one. The elevator is, naturally, broken so you need to find the missing parts to repair it.</p>
<p>The rub is that as you traverse a given island, you will quickly find your way frequently blocked by gaping chasms or unclimbable walls. Since you are resourceful youngsters, and carry around a pickaxe and an axe, you can fashion functional bridges and climbing nets out of the stuff lying around the island.</p>
<p>The genius here is that since you have to manually carry everything — your pockets are full of pickaxe, remember? — and you can’t do complex tasks like climbing while your hands are full, each island is extremely navigable. That’s not to say they are linear — exploration is rewarded and you frequently have to think outside the box, throwing vines and the like into crafting boxes from across a gap, in order to create the bridge you need to cross. You’ll even come across glyphs that unlock extra outfits and Treasure Stones that increase your island’s star rating.</p>
<p>Escaping the island all hinges on solving the area’s puzzles, which invariably involves building bridges, crafting tools and eating food to get the stamina to rip stuff out of the ground.</p>
<p>These puzzles are usually pretty simple —&nbsp;chop down a tree and add wood to the blue box with the floating recipe above it — but get slightly more complicated as the game progresses. Mostly, they get more frustrating when you come across the ‘ancient’ gun turrets that shoot you into the water, making you lose the thing you’re carrying.</p>

<p>New tools are added along the way in the form of blueprints; find those and drag them back to base to discover the recipe for your tool. Collect the bits you need and you suddenly have a new glider to help traverse the peaks, or a fishing rod that will carry parts up cliffs.</p>
<p>Once you’ve repaired enough elevators and are high enough up the island, you’ll find your ship, minus a few key parts. So now, instead of looking for elevator parts, it’s the same thing but looking for rudders, sails and so on. Find the bits, repair the ship and bring the Harmony Stone aboard.</p>
<p>Island-specific recipes aside, this core gameplay loop doesn’t really change: fix the elevator, pick up your camp and up you go. It’s possibly a little simplistic for some, but ideal for playing with your partner or kids who don’t usually have a controller glued to their hands.</p>
<p>Ultimately, your mission is to get the Harmony Stone off of each island and take it back to an arcane lighthouse that staves off the storm surrounding the archipelago, permitting your eventual escape. If you complete the level fast enough, you’ll be awarded up to three stars, adding to those from looting all three Treasure Stones per island. Get enough stars and you can unlock the final island.</p>

<article id="article">
<header><section>
<p>It's a feature</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="rumble turned off message switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3877cedaa3806/rumble-turned-off-message-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It seems some eager players have been a little mystified as to the reasons behind a message that's been popping up on their <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> screens during play as of late.</p>
<p>Yep, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1lai1kb/rumble_turning_itself_off/">over on Reddit</a> (thanks <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/49752-switch-2-will-automatically-turn-off-rumble-after-prolonged-use">GoNintendo</a>) a handful of gamers have been rocking up to report that an alert related to the console's HD Rumble has been popping onto their lovely big LCD screens, as you can see in the post below this very paragraph. Of course, with it being a new console, folk have quickly become concerned that there's something up with their Joy-Con and/or Pro 2 Controllers.</p>

<p>Fear not, however, if you happen to see this very same message, which is something that could definitely happen (although this particular writer, through a whole bunch of reviews on the system thus far, has yet to see it), so stay frosty!</p>
<p>As it turns out, amongst the many new bells and whistles the Switch 2 brings with it, its snazzy new HD Rumble 2 — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-differences-how-do-the-new-controllers-compare">the reason your Joy-Con and Pro 2 Controller feel so great this time around</a> — has the ability to shut itself off should it overheat or become a burden on other functions, such as battery, we are guessing. Indeed, browsing through the comments from the same post, we've got gamers chiming in on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> both triggering this same function.</p>
<p>Could it become annoying, though? Or can we switch it off more to the point? (No, no we can't as there's no option in settings.)</p>

<p>There doesn't seem to be a huge amount of rhyme as to how and when the issue presents itself at the moment, but with the likes of Cyberpunk 2077 the rumble <em>can</em> become very intensive for entire scenes, and it appears as though a sustained rumble, for around a minute, is what's causing the issue. Perhaps the best bet, certainly with regards to CD Projekt Red's game, is to turn the rumble down in-game.</p>
<p>Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/switch-2-joy-con-hd-rumble-wont-be-as-loud-as-it-was-on-switch">already discussed the decreased the volume of rumble</a> on Switch 2, so it's obviously an aspect of the machine they've been spending a lot of time refining and keeping an eye on. We've reached out to Nintendo asking about the exact conditions and reasons for this warning to pop up - we'll keep you posted with any updates.</p>
<p><em>Have you had the HD Rumble message pop up on your Switch 2 during game yet? Let us know!</em></p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> has sold more than one million copies on PC within three days of its arrival to the platform, <a href="https://bbs.ruliweb.com/news/read/211821">according to Ruliweb</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> would also pass the three million sales milestone across all platforms following its PC release. As of writing, the game reached a peak concurrent player count on Steam of 192,078, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-pc-debut-welcomes-record-numbers-for-a-playstation-published-single-player-release">a substantial increase over the weekend from its initial peak of just under 100,000 in its first day</a>.</p>
<p>This performance marks an all-time record for South Korean single players games, a style of game that ShiftUp has been championing since releasing Stellar Blade in April of last year.</p>

<p>According to industry analyst <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1934432993210237238">Daniel Ahmad at Niko Partners</a>, a majority of these PC sales stem from China, a playerbase who'd benefit from a PC-only Chinese dub and appropriate regional pricing. This market has proven an exceptionally eager one, both with Stellar Blade and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-already-steams-most-played-single-player-game-of-all-time">Black Myth Wukong's own record breaking Steam release last year</a>.</p>
<p>This stunning PC release comes shortly after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-remaining-thoughtful-about-how-and-if-it-brings-games-to-additional-platforms">Sony execs spoke about bringing its games to different platforms in an annual fireside chat</a>. Sony Interactive Entertainment president Hideaki Nishino and Studio Business Group head Hermen Hulst when asked about how to "protect the value" of the PlayStation console noted that Sony's consoles would remain "the best place to play and publish", but that "the team is always looking for "new and innovative ways to broaden [its] reach".</p>
<p>ShiftUp announced back in May in an investor presentation that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-2-is-official-and-seemingly-not-too-far-away">a sequel to Stellar Blade was being developed</a>. The only tidbit of information aside from the confirmation present there was that the game was scheduled to be released before 2027.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>And so, when the actor who voices John Marston announces that there's gonna be some big Red Dead Redemption 2 news this week, well, listen here partner, we're gonna sit up straight on our nags and pay attention, y'hear? <strong>*spit*</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Rob Wiethoff, who's delivered some of the best lines in video game, let's face it (<em>"Some men are born rich enough and dumb enough to enjoy their lives. Ain't nothing fair,"</em> goes hard right now), was doing a little bit of streaming of the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/red_dead_redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a> when he dropped a few tidbits of very exciting — or potentially very exciting — news, especially if it happens to relate to a certain new console.</p><p><figure data-videoid="nO48QYAS9Kg" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nO48QYAS9Kg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nO48QYAS9Kg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nO48QYAS9Kg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed362f9fjyigun&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>822k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO48QYAS9Kg">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I've got such exciting news...I can't share it with you right now, and it's absolutely killing me. By the end of this week, hopefully sooner...definitely before Friday. Oh my goodness...the news that I have to share, and I won't be the only one sharing it. I cannot wait for you to know what's going on, and that's all I can say. That's the only thing I can think about right now, and you'll know soon enough. I can't wait for you to know."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He seems pretty excited. So, with those Switch 2/next-gen revamp rumours already swirling, are early Switch 2 owners about to get a big cowboy-shaped surprise over the next few days? Goddammit, we sure do hope so, Dutch.</p>
<p>Of course, the OG Red Dead Redemption is already out on Switch. This writer even reviewed it back at launch, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/Rockstar's%20Western%20epic%20holds%20up%20surprisingly%20well,%20its%20story%20is%20as%20powerful%20as%20ever,%20its%20knockabout%20action%20still%20feels%20great,%20and%20it%20looks%20and%20plays%20perfectly%20well%20on%20Nintendo's%20console.">giving it an 8/10</a> and calling it a barebones port (with no multiplayer) that nevertheless "still feels great, and looks and plays perfectly well on Nintendo's console."</p>

            <p>PlayStation have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-spider-man-2-and-more-playstation-titles-have-been-freed-from-their-region-lock-prison-on-pc">finally come to their senses</a> and rolled back a lot of the unpopular PC region locking that's been stopping folks in various parts of the world enjoying a bunch of games. It looks like one of those titles, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, could finally be getting a cape players have craved for a year or so as a result.</p>
<p>Yep, Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani has teased deploying the review bomb-themed cape that first emerged as a meme following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">the backlash</a> to PlayStation attempting to change the game's PSN account linking rules last year. We've known the cape was a real item the studio had made for a while now, but with the region locking still ongoing, Arrowhead have opted to keep it locked away for months on end.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Taking to <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1383206162622582866">Helldivers 2's Discord server</a> not long after a mass removal of countries from the restricted lists of several PlayStation-affiliated PC games was spotted on June 13th, Jorjani wrote: "It was all our good friends at PlayStation".</p>
<p>He went on to ask players to consider revisiting any negative reviews of the game left solely because of the region locking controversy, writing: "It would be nice if folks would change their review as a result of this. But it’s not a must if you don’t wanna. It’s a point of pride for the team to see their hard work recognized with a higher user review score." Glancing at Steam, it looks like a good number have done just that over the weekend.</p>

<p>Naturally, that got folks wondering whether they might soon be getting the review bomb cape, with Jorjani responding to a question about it: "I’ll talk to the team next week. But we always felt it was something to give away once regions returned. PS has been working hard on this so a cape to celebrate is in order."</p>
<p>So, a garment that features the section of Steam's reviews graph showing just how many folks were taking out their PSN account linking frustrations on Helldivers 2 last May sounds like it could finally be incoming. If you're wondering why this is a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1i7s3zc/what_ever_happened_to_the_review_bomb_cape_they/">thing people would want</a>, my best answer is that the Helldivers 2 community loves a good in-joke, so <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1787370710597312605">came up with designs</a> for the cape, then started properly campaigning for it become a real thing once Arrowhead acknowledged these sketches.</p>
<p>If you're curious as to what it'd look like, here's <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1789406952243577164">a teaser</a> Arrowhead CCO Johan Pilestedt tweeted out just over 13 months ago, later confirming that the studio was just waiting for the right time to release it - basically, once the region locking controversy was actually over. Assuming it does finally arrive, it'll definitely be a fitting way to commemorate a long overdue change.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<li>Needed: reader recommendations</li>
</ul></em></p><p>
(Actual announcement post follows.)
</p>
<p>
Hello all! You may have noticed that we’ve stopped doing the weekly Maw liveblogs. Instead, we’ve been doing a round-up of new PC game releases with subheadings and a standard-issue comments thread. 
</p>
<p>
The reasons for this are fairly simple and boring. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/introducing-the-maw-your-weekly-rps-news-liveblog">When I came up with the Maw liveblog concept</a>, I envisaged it as a big old melting pot of open-air news planning tool, forum thread, reader tips thread and scraps drawer. It was quite an open-ended concept, one that sort of needed a whole site built around it, and I’ve struggled to figure out aspects of the execution – for example, how it should work alongside our private Trello board, where we list embargoed stories. 
</p>
<p>
Really, though, the issue here is time and turnover. A lot of people have left RPS in the nearly two years since I joined, which naturally means there’s less scope for anything that isn’t bread-and-butter news, reviews and features. Our current liveblog tech isn’t really suited to my original goals for the Maw – it lacks full comments functionality, for example – and Gamer Network’s hardworking tech team aren’t in a position to make any upgrades anytime soon.
</p>
<p>
The Maw itself will always plague us. Its hunger is, after all, insatiable, and its reach is beyond measure. The world is the Maw and the Maw is the world. The liveblog may yet return, given a change of circumstances. In the meantime, it is my frail hope that our Monday rounds-up articles, newly bolstered by the latest in h2 tags and futuristic comments-threading, will be enough to blunt the creature’s appetite and buy our newswranglers a precious few hours in which to carve some headlines from the firmament. Once more with feeling, FEED THE MAW.

<figure><a title="Mario Kart World / Mario Kart 8 Deluxe" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f2019168b5632/mario-kart-world-mario-kart-8-deluxe.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The latest UK Charts are in and, as expected, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has retained its lofty spot at number 1 following the Switch 2's incredibly successful launch. But what ho, what luck, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> is also in the top ten at number 6! Nintendo must be proper chuffed at that.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, other Switch 2 games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> have all slipped down every so slightly, though hardly cause for alarm. Capcom's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6: Years 1-2 Fighters Edition</a>, however, has tumbled all the way down to number 21. Perhaps this is the backlash to Game-Key Cards actually coming into effect.</p>
<p>A couple of <strong>Resident Evil</strong> games have also snuck their way back into the top 40, but no, it's sadly not because Switch 2 versions have suddenly become available. We suspect it's a result of the recent announcement of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/resident_evil_requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. That said, we wouldn't say no to Switch 2 versions, eh Capcom. Eh? Eh? Go on.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/mindseye">MindsEye</a> made it to number 4?! People, people, people...</p>
<p>Here's a look at the full top 40 for this week, with platform breakdowns for all of the titles available on other consoles as well as the Switch and Switch 2:</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shogun-total-war">Shogun: Total War</a> is 25 years old this year, and Creative Assembly are holding <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war/blogs/73">a multi-month long celebration</a> kicking off in August with livestreams, interviews, sales, and multiplayer tournaments, all culminating with a showcase in early December. This will be the first showcase of its type they've done, and it's billed to feature announcements for "new games" in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> series. That's more than one, as the discerning pluralisation understanders among you have no doubt sagely clocked.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Whether you’re a fantasy or history fan, there will be plenty to enjoy," writes CA's Roger Collum. "Warhammer 40K and Medieval 3!" The crowds bay in frothing anticipation. "Star Wars and World War 1!", we scream like shrill goats perched on single planks of driftwood floating upon stone-gray oceans, kept from madness only by the knowledge that we can adequately explain what a hammer and anvil maneuver is, in lieu of having formed any meaningful human relationships in a decade.</p>
<p>"Lord Of The Rings and Empire 2!", reads the scrawled note sellotaped to the goat-rescuing submariner's periscope lens, resulting in the tragic water deaths of both the goat and then the entire crew somehow. This madness has gone too far. Please, control yourselves.</p>
<p>For what it's worth: yes, I think at least one of these games is going to be Warhammer 40,000. On to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/future-creative-assembly-games-may-require-blood-thematically-which-sure-sounds-like-a-total-war-warhammer-40000-teaser">hefty pile of circumstantial evidence</a>, you can add the seeming absence of Warhammer 3 game director Rich Aldridge from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-3-fans-reckon-theyve-already-guessed-which-faction-is-coming-next-in-tides-of-torment">latest Tides Of Torment showcase</a>. This said, it's also equally possible Aldridge is hard at work on the massive End Times expansion I'm sure is coming to Twarhammer sooner rather than later. "Tides of Torment DLC will reveal its final playable faction in July," writes Collum, "and some long-awaited content will be unveiled at the anniversary showcase". As long as I get Thanquol before the trilogy wraps up, I'm a happy little ratman. Well, Thanquol <a href="https://youtu.be/iUwsmt4DlUM">and Toddy</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Such has been the onslaught of livestreams, showcases, reveals, re-reveals, trailers and assorted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pondering-geoffs-orbs">Keighleybollocks</a> this month that we skipped the new game round-up last week. The Maw, thankfully, was too stuffed with Capcom previews to express much discontent, but it could have been disastrous. The last time we forgot to lay out a Monday feeding schedule, the creature ate a bunch of double-A publishers. What, you didn't seriously think THQ went under due to "strong headwinds", did you? But enough lamentation - there are new PC games to discuss.</p>

<ul>
<li>Are you old enough to remember GEX? My sympathies. There's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gex-trilogy">GEX trilogy</a> remaster out today. If you are not old enough to remember GEX, perhaps you will be more enraptured by cute co-op climbing game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a>. I also have my eye on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3310950/Nightmare_Frontier/">Nightmare Frontier</a>, a sort of weird western XCOM, with the caveat that AI generation tools were used to created some of its menu assets and translate the script.</li>

			<p>Following the latest Xbox announcements and rumors, fans have been worried that Microsoft's next-generation console might be a PC-like device that may not even run prior console games properly. This fear stemmed mainly from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmation </a>of the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally at the Xbox Games Showcase 2025 and the subsequent <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-made-xbox-handheld-reportedly-dead-oem-might-make-next-gen-xbox-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumor</a> from The Verge's Tom Warren that Microsoft might be allowing third-party OEMs like ASUS to create their own version of the next-generation console.</p>
<p>However, Windows Central's Jez Corden has taken it upon himself to reassure gamers that backward compatibility will be retained at a hardware level without even needing emulation. Corden said as much during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x6c-7VRVxw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest episode of the Xbox Two Podcast</a>. Here's the relevant quote:</p>
<p><em>I can pretty much confirm - I'm like maybe two or three sources off writing a report on this, but the next Xbox is like 100% or 99.999% recurring running your console games, because I've seen that fear out there a lot at the moment, where it's like, oh my god, the next Xbox won't run console games. It's only going to be a PC. It's going to be like the ROG Ally. It's going to be made by ASUS, because Tom put in his article something like, "I believe Microsoft will still make their own hardware." I mean, they've said they will. The thing is, Xbox has said a lot of things in the past. When Tom says, "I believe they're going to make it," that exposes an issue with Microsoft's messaging. People don't really trust what they say anymore because they've gone back on their word so many times.</em></p>
<p><em>But, you know, which is again why I've been told by a bunch of people the next Xbox has the silicon for running Xbox One and Series X and 360 games natively. At least what's in the backwards compatibility program. And then everything you own on XB1 and Series X and S, those will all be playable on the next Microsoft Xbox. But I would not be surprised if there is an Asus ROG gaming all-in-one that also is just a PC, like Tom said. And to be fair, Tom was one of the first people, I think, who officially reported on the idea of third-party Xbox hardware. I didn't believe it at the time, but the more I looked into it, I was like, "Oh [ __ ] yeah, he's right." So, shout out to Tom for that.</em></p>
<p>To be fair, there were never any major worries that Microsoft would abandon its Xbox backward compatibility focus. It has been one of the few initiatives that has earned it widespread acclaim throughout the industry and among gamers.</p>
<p>Currently, the next-generation Xbox is expected to be launched in a couple of years. Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> fans the 'largest technological leap' between generations yet, a lofty claim to be sure.</p>
