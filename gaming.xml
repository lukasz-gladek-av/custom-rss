<figure><a title="Super Mario 3D All-Stars" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/628c7da503aad/super-mario-3d-all-stars.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Since the arrival of the Switch 2 last month, Nintendo has been busy updating many of its first-party Switch titles. This even includes an update for its "limited-time" release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a>, and following an update for the Switch 2 today, another patch is now available.</p>
<p>Much like the Version 1.1.2 update, <strong>Version 1.1.3</strong> also addresses "several issues" to improve the overall gameplay experience on the hybrid system. Although there's not much revealed in the official patch notes, returning players on the new platform will hopefully have a better time with the game.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown (via Nintendo's support page):</p>
<h2>Super Mario 3D All-Stars: Ver. 1.1.3 (Released July 14, 2025)</h2>
<h6>The following updates have been made when playing the game on Nintendo Switch 2:</h6>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Several issues have been addressed to improve gameplay on Nintendo Switch 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: The software update is required to play on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<hr>
<p>This isn't the only Mario Switch release to receive some love on the Switch 2, with Nintendo also recently rolling out updates for games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> and even titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/new_super_mario_bros_u_deluxe">New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe</a>.</p>
<p>Once again, this update to Super Mario 3D All-Stars for the Switch 2 has rolled out alongside a new system firmware update. You can find out more about this in our previous post:</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/godot-version-control-statistics-cms</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-salute-to-the-13.1243659/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Godot is a game engine that is both free and open source, meaning it's a great option for budding, first-time developers. The kind of people who, thanks to their youth and/or inexperience, may not have learned things the hard way.</p><p>By that I mean look at this statistic:</p><p>I've seen a lot of developers respond to this with either some form of "oof" or some shade of "by <em>God</em>, what are you <em>doing</em>?", and I understand the sentiment. Not using<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> version control</a> is akin to writing up a Word doc without autosave turned on, only <em>worse, </em>because you risk losing so much more work<em>. </em>It opens these projects up to the possibility of absolute catastrophe.</p><p>And yet...I do not want to admonish these 19.1% of people. Particularly the 13% who know what version control means and refuse to engage in the practice anyway. Rather than view this 13% as reckless, I want to salute their bravery.</p><p>See, I've spent my entire career writing in the CMS (Content Management System), which is the media's equivalent. That means I open up the platform we publish stories on--in Aftermath's case as of July 2025, a modified version of Wordpress--and write all my stories straight into it. No Notes app, no Google Docs, no Word–I write drafts and outlines straight into the CMS, edit it from there then eventually hit publish.</p><p>Writers often gasp at this as audibly as game developers have at that 19.1% of respondents to that survey, because it's risky. CMS autosave functionality is questionable at best, there are no grammar checkups, it makes it harder to share and edit your work; when it comes to reasons not to do it, the list goes on forever.</p><p>But I don't care. The cowardly shall not see heaven. If this is the platform I publish my writing on then I want to be able to tailor it to that platform--its length, its appearance, everything--from the very beginning of my writing, and if that's dicey behaviour then so be it. Let me live a little.</p><p>Same goes for this 13%! Modern life is so full of handrails and automation and supervision and authority over our platforms and actions that who are we to look at their position and assume they're in line to learn a lesson. Maybe they know what they're doing is bad and <em>do it anyway</em>, because the danger of losing their work is a slow-burning thrill, one of the few avenues left where they can exercise any kind of control over their lives on the internet.</p><p>Or maybe they're just idiots. They can, like me, be both at the same time.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/horror-anime-crunchyroll-netflix-hikaru-takopi"><h3>Your Guide To Feel-Bad-Anime Summer</h3></a><p>The Summer Hikaru Died and Takopi’s Original Sin are a throwback to the disturbing, horrifying anime of yesteryear</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/high-wheel-bike-race-frederick"><h3>The Penny Farthing Is Alive And Well In 2025</h3></a><p>The National Clustered Spires High Wheel Race takes place every summer in Frederick, Maryland</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-disability-pride-last-of-us-forza"><h3>Why Disability Journalism In Games Needs To Evolve Beyond Marketing</h3></a><p>"We’ve conditioned ourselves to believe that we’re all one big happy family"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/godot-version-control-statistics-cms]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/45a8eb1719156/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has rolled out another firmware update for the Switch 2 and it also happens to be the first one for the month of July.</p>
<p>According to the official patch notes on the customer support page, it resolves some fixes tied to the Parental Controls and also includes general system stability improvements, which are sure to make your system super stable. Here's the official rundown:</p>
<h3>Switch 2 - Ver. 20.2.0 (Released July 14, 2025)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Fixed an issue where Parental Control settings were not transferred from Nintendo Switch to Nintendo Switch 2 in certain circumstances during a system transfer.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>It's worth mentioning how this same firmware update is now also available on the Nintendo Switch, bumping this system up to Version 20.2.0.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social/post/3ltxqqi5d4s2h">Dataminer 'OatmealDome'</a> has investigated this patch, noting how this update "fixes some problems with Switch 1 backwards compatibility" including being able to "personally confirm" <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/portal_companion_collection">Portal 2</a> "no longer crashes" after updating to the latest firmware.</p>
<p>The same source encourages Switch 2 owners to try out any games they were having issues with, to see if the experience has changed after this latest update.

<p>This latest update follows a few firmware patches in the Switch 2's launch month, which also included some "stability improvements".</p>

<p>"Announcements are coming"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/22299e6f9294c/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>As you've likely seen by now, there's a new rumour from the latest Nate the Hate podcast about a Nintendo Direct potentially taking place some time <em>after</em> the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>In the same episode, the YouTuber and podcaster has touched on the subject of future third-party support for the Switch 2, and how although it might not look like there's much on the way beyond the initial announcements, there are apparently multiple developers holding back reveals (<em>possibly for Nintendo's broadcast</em>).</p>
<p>Nintendo is also supposedly looking to reassure everyone that its new hybrid system is a "viable platform" for "big" third-party titles going forward. As for the announcements, they're expected to be coming from many of the major publishers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Announcements are coming... I also know studios like Capcom, Sega, Ubisoft, Bandai Namco and many others are just waiting. They have games they want to announce for the platform. They have a lot of support for this platform.</p>
<p>"...It's going to be a very important Direct for Nintendo, to say 'this is the third-party support we have, look at the games, they can stand up to those other systems' be it from a visual or performance standpoint, and 'we are a viable platform for you to select moving forward' to experience third-party releases."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also adds how Microsoft is still expected to be a "big supporter of the system", with Activision's title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> arriving on Switch 2 last week.</p>
<p>Of course, games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and Square Enix's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> are arriving later this year as well. FromSoftware's Switch 2 exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/duskbloods">The Duskbloods</a> is also scheduled for next year, and last week, 2K locked in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nba-2k26">NBA 2K26</a> for the new platform following its confirmation of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of my favorite pastimes on the playground growing up was having heated debates with my friends about which of our favorite TV or video game characters would win in a fight. While it’s been a few decades since those days on the swingset, pitting two individuals from different properties against one another in a deathmatch is no less relevant today – just look at games like Fortnite, Call of Duty, and Magic: The Gathering. One trading card game has been doing it far longer. It's called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/universus-collectible-card-game">UniVersus</a>, and the team at UVS Games has recently released the final set in their Attack on Titan line – Apocalypse – featuring cards and characters from the final arc of the manga and anime. At last, we can find out if Eren Yeager, in his final form, can take on Godzilla or the various members of Critical Role’s Vox Machina.</p><div catalogid="8a1b0961-2202-4b69-9ae2-b045db9308ec" id="225306"><div id="225306" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>UniVersus Attack on Titan: Apocalypse</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For those unfamiliar with UniVersus, previously known as “UFS - Universal Fighting System”, it's a card game akin to games like Magic: The Gathering or Yu-Gi-Oh, but whose identity is based around creating wild cross-over fights. Players construct decks, picking a Character to lead their deck, which also dictates how much life they start with and their maximum hand size. UniVersus’ mechanics are centered around checks that players make to play their various kinds of cards, from attacks to other resources. Each card has a challenge value on it that must be met or exceeded for the card to be successfully played, requiring the player to flip the card on top of their deck and compare its check value against the challenge value of the action to be played. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Successes allow the action to be taken, such as attacking your opponent, while a failure ends your turn. A player’s turn continues until either they pass or fail one of these checks, with each subsequent check increasing the challenge value. It’s an interesting system, and adds an extra element of tension with every check from the top of your deck. However, it can be a bit overwhelming at times, especially when you get to blocking attacks, which have their own set of similar checks to deal with. UniVersus as a whole, I feel, is one of the more complex card games out there on the market today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This latest set is focused around the final arc of the Attack of Titan series. It continues to build on the previous sets that UVS released – Battle for Humanity and Origins of Power. Much like those other sets, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q47mOX?object_uuid=cc73bee0-b622-4f94-aae0-aecac6c88b54&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Apocalypse</u></a> retains the unique manga-esque card art, with most of the artwork framed in manga panels, with brand new artwork done by series creator Hajime Isayama. While his art style may not be everyone’s cup of tea, I personally prefer the art of the anime more, but there is no denying that it is neat to have these unique prints included in the set. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">From a gameplay standpoint, not much sets Apocalypse apart from the other AoT sets UVS has released in the past year, but that isn’t really a bad thing, as I’ve enjoyed the previous sets quite a bit. I am especially fond of the double-sided Titan cards that allow characters to shift from their human form into their Titan form during the game, allowing for deeper strategies and tense moments in my games, and it feels just as good here in this final set as it did in the first. I have my fingers crossed that the team will find ways to incorporate this feature in future non-AoT sets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Coming in at over 180 cards, Apocalypse offers players roughly the same amount of new cards as the previous Origins of Power set did, so unfortunately, if you were hoping for another large set like the titanic (pun intended) Battle for Humanity and its 300+ list, you’re out of luck. It is a bit of a bummer that there aren’t more cards. One feeling, though that I couldn’t escape as I looked through this set, was how it felt more like a set aimed more at collectors than at players. Maybe it’s just my imagination, resulting from the marketing focus on the new Isayama artwork and special chrome cards, but I feel like with the set's release, and even before, I heard more about those parts of this release than specifics on new cards or abilities of the set. To Apocalypse’s credit, the cards are all very neat and the chrome cards are beautiful, but for prospective new players, I don’t know what they could really learn about the set from a quick google search about specifics outside of “look, new art” which leads into the biggest issue that continues to hound UniVersus as a whole – learning resources.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, this is a complicated game and on the spectrum of simple to complex card games, I would put UniVersus somewhere around 3 out of 4 mark. Even after dabbling in the game for the past year or two, there are still a number of areas – resource symbols for example – that seemingly make little sense to me. To the team’s credit, they realize the game has an <a href="https://uvsgames.com/all-news/designing-uvs-one" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>onboarding problem</u></a>. I’ve played Magic a long time, so the idea of color identity, the idea that a specific color is tied to a style of gameplay, is something that makes sense to me, and symbols are, in essence, the UniVersus version of this idea. But UniVersus has 12 symbols, with abstract things like “All”, “Good”, and “Chaos” as just a few examples. I haven’t progressed far past the idea of just using the same symbols as the character who is leading my deck, but I wish the learning resources available did far more to help explain the systems, or were presented better. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some resources are available, examples such as the <a href="https://44595267.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/44595267/2025%20Learn%20to%20Play%20Resources/2025%20Anatomy%20of%20a%20Turn.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>phase breakdown</u></a> and <a href="https://44595267.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/44595267/2025%20Learn%20to%20Play%20Resources/2025%20How%20to%20Play%20Step-by-Step.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>play-by-play of a turn</u></a> are walls of text without a single accompanying image to help. The <a href="https://uvsgames.com/all-news/universus-design-team-learning-about-the-symbols" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>symbols guide</u></a> features outdated card art and symbol designs, and the currently available basic “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcSojOdcJwI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>How to Play</u></a>” video that teaches the most basic concepts of the game doesn’t touch on half of the card types that the game uses or even mention those resource symbols. In fact, they are omitted completely even from the art on the cards used in the demonstration. Thankfully, various content creators have published resources that potential new players can watch to learn the game, but the bright side of things is that they know that this is an issue and are working to address it, slowly but surely. I enjoy my time when I play, but finding good information on how to play or build decks in this game is so hard to come by that it makes UniVersus a hard sell to my card-game-playing friends.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/z7Ol4E?object_uuid=cc73bee0-b622-4f94-aae0-aecac6c88b54&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See it at TCGPlayer</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QKgApY?object_uuid=cc73bee0-b622-4f94-aae0-aecac6c88b54&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See it at UVS Games</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 14, 2025 7:56 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Despite frustration around some of the rules, I do still enjoy the times I get to play UniVersus, and this Attack on Titan: Apocalypse set is fun to play. I still got a kick out of Eren taking Boimler and the crew of the U.S.S. Cerritos from Star Trek Lower Decks, or Armin busting out All Might’s Detroit Smash while having Vox Machina’s Trinket the bear helping him out. The outlandish situations and moments that UniVersus presents players is straight out of a schoolyard argument, and I love it. Attack on Titan: Apocalypse sends off the setting on a good note with a lot of new cards to play with and strategize around, adding to an already fun game, despite its shortcomings, teaching players its mechanics.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/attack-on-titan-apocalypse-card-set-review]]></content:encoded>

<section><p>Like gaming, Formula 1 replicates the feeling of perfecting a build to overcome an obstacle, and having to repeat the process again and again.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Formula 1, also known as F1, is a hot topic as of late and one of the world’s most popular sports. Whether it's topping the box office with a film starring Brad Pitt, or literally building a track smack in the middle of Las Vegas and hosting a race there, there’s a surging interest in the highly popular international motorsport. While on the surface, Formula 1 seems to be another Grand Prix sport in which drivers test their mettle on the track, diving deeper into the sport reveals a highly competitive battle of technical prowess on and off the track. In many ways, Formula 1 is like playing a video game, in which your gear and build matters right down to the very last detail, making it feel unlike any other sport out there. In fact, I'd argue Formula 1 is <em>the </em>sport to check out if you’re into gaming.</p><p dir="ltr">Let's start with the basics, namely: what is Formula 1 and how exactly does it differ from other Grand Prix racing leagues that are fairly common but far less popular? In most other leagues, drivers and teams are required to use the same chassis and vehicle specifications. For example, in NASCAR, every driver uses the same type of vehicle, and the racing advantage comes down to pure skill in the moment-to-moment racing. That’s not the case in Formula 1.</p><p dir="ltr">Each F1 team is instead given a series of broad guidelines, specifications, and a budget: a “Formula” for them to follow. Using these guidelines, the teams literally build their race vehicles from scratch, using a fleet of engineers and mechanics. Because every team is able to build their own vehicle, the teams look for every advantage they can in the design and build, right down to the smallest detail. This results in vehicles that have more in common with jets and spacecraft than they do the average car you would see on the street.</p><p dir="ltr">To make matters more interesting, each team has to actually build their vehicle <em>twice, </em>because in the rules of Formula 1, each team is required to have two drivers and two vehicles. And while these drivers cannot communicate with one another, having two racers makes it vital that they are in constant communication with their team boss and engineers. Through radio contact, teams can switch up strategies and make changes to gameplans situations on the fly in the heat of a race, much like how teammate communication would work in a first-person shooter or MOBA video game.</p><p dir="ltr">Once the cars are built, it's finally time to hit the track. Grand Prix events, a series of races in a championship series, in Formula 1 are typically split up into four different races: two practice rounds, one qualifier, and the Grand Prix race itself. In the practice rounds, drivers do exactly what is implied: they practice. In racing leagues such as NASCAR, the tracks are typically a round oval-like shape, providing a consistent driving experience throughout the race. Formula 1 shakes things up by featuring tracks that are filled with sharp turns and straightaways throughout. Because of this--and the fact that highly experimental vehicles are being used--drivers need to acquaint themselves with the track. Using these practice rounds, teams can also make adjustments to their vehicles and factor variables such as weather and track temperature into their final modifications and tire selection. Imagine it like playing a particularly difficult track in a racing game to learn it before hopping into an online match.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4531998-ss_41e2dc99ae68ff3f7628403fac109aa9b784fa8b.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4531998" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4531998-ss_41e2dc99ae68ff3f7628403fac109aa9b784fa8b.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4531998"></a><figcaption>EA's F1 25 is the latest entry in the popular series.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4531998-ss_41e2dc99ae68ff3f7628403fac109aa9b784fa8b.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Actually, let's talk a bit more about games here. Most racing games pride themselves on being accurate simulations of their respective motorsports. From Gran Turismo to EA’s yearly F1 franchise, recreating the motorsport experience is a priority for these games. Simulations are also essential to Formula 1 as well, as drivers use advanced simulators to recreate their cars and tracks without ever having to step on the pavement. With state of the art technologies and a smart use of screens and driving rigs, drivers are able to run <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/sim-racers-rejoice-f1-champ-max-verstappen-says-youre-getting-a-90-to-95-percent-accurate-experience-even-without-that-megabucks-motion-rig/" rel="nofollow ">near-exact replicas</a> of situations they’ll face in the race.</p><p dir="ltr">After practice is where it really starts to count. With all the knowledge the drivers and teams have gained during the practice rounds, they race in a qualifier to compete for starting position in the race. The coveted pole position also known as “P1,” the frontmost starting position, is what the teams strive for, and every further position is considered a disadvantage that could literally add seconds to lap time.</p><p dir="ltr">After starting positions are established comes the real-deal race, in which the teams earn points for the season score based on finishing position. It’s no-holds-barred, and teams are expected to operate at peak performance right down to the smallest detail.</p><p dir="ltr">During the race, when drivers are forced to make pit stops for tire swaps and repairs, the pit crew is expected to have the drivers back out on the course in two seconds or less--and often do. Even choosing when to have these pit stops is considered a tactical decision that is given a great deal of thought and consideration. That’s why teams not only earn points for driving, but also for pit and engineering teams. The Grand Prix event repeats multiple times throughout the season, and at the end, the winning team is crowned for their technical and physical skills, on and off the track. The outcome affects budgets for teams in the following year' the winning team receives less budget to work with than runner-up teams, meaning that other teams will have a chance to catch up from a tech standpoint.</p><p dir="ltr">In many ways, Formula 1 feels like gaming--even for someone who is not actively participating. In most sports, gear and builds don’t factor into performance, but Formula 1 replicates the feeling of perfecting a build to overcome an obstacle, and having to repeat the process again and again.</p><p dir="ltr">Take, for example, Nico Hulkenberg’s third-place podium win from a P19 starting position, making it his first podium win in 239 races, a feat not thought possible from a “weaker” team. As someone who’s heavily into Diablo, I can’t help but see parallels between streamlining and tinkering with a character build of mine for the highest damage output and putting it to the test in endless repeatable dungeons, and seeing a Formula 1 team made adjustments and modifications to shave seconds off of their fastest lap time. When everything clicks in, gaming and Formula 1 actions can run like clockwork and provide a grand sense of accomplishment especially when critical thinking is applied.</p>

The segment may have come about from producers reading <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/feb/15/theres-no-stress-gamers-go-offline-in-retro-console-revival&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/feb/15/theres-no-stress-gamers-go-offline-in-retro-console-revival" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repeated</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/apr/02/why-are-younger-generations-embracing-the-retro-game-revival&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/apr/02/why-are-younger-generations-embracing-the-retro-game-revival" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stories</a></span> about the resurgence of retro gaming in <em>The Guardian</em>. Who doesn’t love a nice trip down memory lane back to the ‘80s and ‘90s, when gaming was still a novel escape from the drudgery of life and not associated with the battle cries of the worst people you’ve ever encountered online?</p><p>But the segment went off the rails immediately when the camera zoomed in on the props: a ZX81, a Nintendo Wii, and a SNES with an NES cartridge stuffed into it. There’s no way to harp on this without reinforcing the worst <em>Simpsons</em> comic book guy stereotypes, but, I mean, come on folks. This is like stuffing a VHS tape into a DVD player. I hope anyone planning to get back into retro gaming took it as a helpful warning of what not to do. <br></p><p>“As Nick shared on the programme, it’s no surprise that older titles and classic consoles are back in demand,” UKIE posted on LinkedIn. “Retro gaming taps into a powerful sense of nostalgia and community, offering players a way to reconnect with their past and share the games they loved with a new generation.”</p><p>The organization later denied responsibility for&nbsp;the retro gaming debacle. “For transparency, the studio team set up the in-studio display independently and handled the placement of the consoles—unfortunately, we couldn’t adjust it whilst on air,” a spokesperson <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/i-want-to-report-a-crime-bbc-mocked-for-its-wonky-nintendo-setup/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/i-want-to-report-a-crime-bbc-mocked-for-its-wonky-nintendo-setup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>VGC</em></a></span>.<br></p><p>In fairness, the SNES’s lack of backwards compatibility <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTzyz2TgGls&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTzyz2TgGls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confounded news broadcasters</a></span> back when it came out as well. The fact that it couldn’t “mix-and-match” games with the NES was seen as part of Nintendo’s uphill battle to sell parents on a pricey next-gen upgrade. That’s a problem the Switch 2 doesn’t have. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/bbc-mario-bros-nes-snes-retro-gaming-switch-2-1851786266]]></content:encoded>

In the game’s recreation of <em>THPS 3</em>'s iconic Canada level, someone has been removed: The dude pissing off the edge of the map. I decided to reach out to the developers at Iron Galaxy to get to the bottom of this very important issue. We also talked about other stuff, too, I guess. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197562" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="197562,195618,196358" data-current="197562"><div><p>THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23086.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>First up, I had to know, why did Iron Galaxy remove the pissing man from Canada? Is this some grand conspiracy? What’s going on? Well, according to Iron Galaxy, the pissing man wasn’t removed from <em>THPS 3+4</em>. But he does have better bladder control. </p><p>“Overall, we’ve made a few changes to the game so we could cast skating in a more positive light,” said Kurt Tillmanns, <em>THPS 3+4</em>'s director. “Our old Canadian friend is not gone, he has just learned some much-needed bladder control. There is even a pro goal where you can help him hydrate.” </p><p>When I asked about other changes players have spotted in <em>THPS 3+4</em>, like a ramp being in a different spot or an area being slightly re-themed, Tillmans said that the studio’s main goals for levels are to make something “cooler” and “more fun.” </p><p>“Our goals for environment design are to create a visual spectacle and provide interesting opportunities to skate. Those two motivations inform all our decisions,” said Tillman.</p><h2 id="h293513"><a id=""></a>Missing levels and big changes</h2><p>Speaking of changes, the biggest and most controversial change (besides the ever-important presence of the pissing dude) was to<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-remake-remaster-thps4-original-career-mode-ps5-1851779836&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-remake-remaster-thps4-original-career-mode-ps5-1851779836"> how <em>THPS 4</em>'s levels work in the remake</a></span>. They aren’t open-world anymore and instead work like <em>THPS 3</em>'s levels, with two-minute timers and a list of goals to complete in that time. I asked if there were ever plans to do the <em>THPS 4</em>'s levels as open-world playspaces, but it was never an option. </p><p>“We set out to create a game that joins and embodies the best of what both of the classic games offered. The two-minute timer is the emblematic<em> Tony Hawk</em> gameplay loop,” said Tillman. “Players who aren’t as interested in that can customize the length of the timer, up to an hour. Many goals from <em>THPS 4 </em>return, and we can share goals and gameplay across both titles, bringing gameplay like Skitchin’ and COMBO goals to the <em>THPS 3 </em>parks. We feel that this best-of-both-worlds approach is a benefit to both games.” </p><p>And while the new levels—like Waterpark—in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-photo-mode-option-tool-tony-hawks-pro-skater-1851786140&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-photo-mode-option-tool-tony-hawks-pro-skater-1851786140"><em>THPS 3+4</em></a></span> are good, I had to ask about the missing levels, like<em> THPS4</em>'s Chicago. According to Tillman, they were cut as part of the process for delivering a “unique experience rather than just a predictable remaster.” </p><p>“When it came to rebuilding the parks from the ground up, we prioritized the ones that seemed to be the favorites, according to the community consensus. Passing on Chicago and Carnival freed us up to build Waterpark, Pinball, and Movie Studio, the first brand-new [<em>THPS</em>]<em>&nbsp;</em>parks in over a decade.”</p><p>Oh, and here’s Tillman’s full response about Eric Sparrow appearing in the game for all big fans of Tony Hawk’s Underground. </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Every game needs a villain. We just thought this would be a fun callback to the <em>Underground</em>. A lot of time has passed, so this is a chance to find out the path he has led himself down with his treacherous ways.</p></blockquote><p>Hmmmm.... That’s not confirmation of <em>Underground </em>getting a full remake one day, but at least it’s nice to know the devs behind <em>THPS 3+4</em> know their Tony Hawk lore. Looking forward, Iron Galaxy still has an “opportunity to update the game post-launch.” We know at least one change that will be made in a future update, as the developer confirmed after this interview that it was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-tony-hawk-banjo-guitar-hero-easter-egg-trash-1851786211&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-tony-hawk-banjo-guitar-hero-easter-egg-trash-1851786211">going to remove a joke from the Waterpark level.</a></span>&nbsp;</p><p>“We’re watching like a hawk as players drop back into the parks. We still have an opportunity to update the game post-launch, so we’ll keep an eye on their feedback.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-remake-peeing-guy-canada-level-removed-censor-1851786232]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I spent about 35 hours in <em>Hitman World of Assassination</em> this past weekend—interrupted mostly by the non-optional need to sleep and occasional concerns over the health of my GPU running for so long in a non-air conditioned apartment room in New York City in the summer. But I was determined to find out if the Agent 47 experience could really satisfy the stealth nerd in me. As it turns out, I’ve been so, <em>so </em>wrong to neglect modern <em>Hitman</em>’s potential as a third-person stealth game; I thought it fell drastically short in that regard, but in fact it’s quite capable of delivering the hide-and-seek thrills I came to love in games like <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196394" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Killing Your Heroes, And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="97" data-playlist="196394,197541,196013" data-current="196394"><div><p>The Week In Games: Killing Your Heroes, And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21942.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I blame my failure to recognize the freedom to go off-script and sneak around like Sam Fisher on the way the game foregrounds certain specific approaches you can take to each hit, which come with defined objectives that had me waiting around for the right costume to reveal itself, or for some waiter to leave an unattended glass nearby so I could slip some poison into it at just the right time. As I milled around waiting on these narrowly defined opportunities, I found myself wanting to just obsessively crouch-walk around every map, rarely changing outfits, slipping in and out of rooms never to be seen, but always lethally focused on my target. But can <em>Hitman</em> actually be played like this? Yes, I hear the diehard fans screaming right now, you always could just go off-script and do your own thing.</p><p>In my defense, <em>Hitman</em>’s default settings and game modes make it tough to ignore those narrative opportunities at first. These sub-quests are usually triggered by snippets of overheard NPC dialogue, followed by your handler narrating a bit of what’s going on. You’re then treated to a bright bluish-green lightbulb icon you can follow to victory through the whole map. Play the scenario right, and you probably never even have to crouch or stay out of sight. Hell, you could probably just play the game using the mini-map alone at that point. Straying from these narrative moments also results in a serious difficulty spike; guards are quite perceptive on higher difficulties, and there are more enforcers who can see through your disguises. So it’s easy to get discouraged and come to the conclusion that, yes, the easiest way to take out your hit is to wait for that perfect disguise, or that quick turn of a wrench on some piece of machinery that will crush your target. </p><figure id="" data-id="fd717e15f10615e787441aaea327765c" data-recommend-id="image://fd717e15f10615e787441aaea327765c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A person in a mascot outfit leans out from the corner." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A person in a mascot outfit leans out from the corner." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->IOI / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fd717e15f10615e787441aaea327765c" data-recommend-id="image://fd717e15f10615e787441aaea327765c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A person in a mascot outfit leans out from the corner." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The comically macabre story scenarios are an undeniable part of the theater of <em>Hitman</em>. But once I shut the guides off via Master difficulty, I found a very similar experience to the kinds of stealth games I grew up playing—and, dare I say, <em>Hitman</em> might even offer more interesting stealth opportunities? Before I knew it, I was clearing levels while going almost entirely unseen, rarely changing outfits, and waiting for <em>my</em> opportunity to land the killing shot. While some maps feel very familiar to ones I’ve played in other stealth games, <em>Hitman</em> also excels at providing types of maps that few dedicated stealth games seem willing to experiment with.</p><p>When was the last time Solid Snake had to infiltrate a suburban residential neighborhood? When did Sam Fisher ever have to break into a bank vault in the middle of the day while also assassinating the greedy, evil CEO? Yet here I was, using techniques and instincts baked during my many years spent playing as one of the many Snakes. I was surprised by just how organically it felt to crouch-walk everywhere while timing my takedowns with split-second urgency, instead of waiting for them to line up at just the right moment for me to deliver a low-effort execution by flipping a switch or turning a wrench on faulty equipment.</p><figure id="" data-id="c8dd5fea288e3c25aaec0100794066cb" data-recommend-id="image://c8dd5fea288e3c25aaec0100794066cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Agent 47 waits around a corner to strike his opponent." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Agent 47 waits around a corner to strike his opponent." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->IOI / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c8dd5fea288e3c25aaec0100794066cb" data-recommend-id="image://c8dd5fea288e3c25aaec0100794066cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Agent 47 waits around a corner to strike his opponent." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To be clear, some <em>Hitman</em> levels are easier to play in the style of <em>Metal Gear</em> or <em>Splinter Cell</em> than others. But the variety of environments, from a militia compound to a bougie high-tech hospital in Japan, makes for a nice mix of the familiar with unexpected scenarios that I’d never come across in the standard milsim milieu in which many stealth games operate. And even if I largely opted to ignore the narrative approaches the game offers to its various scenarios, they still exist on the periphery of my playstyle, making the maps feel more alive, sometimes presenting opportunities to get out of a sticky situation. I feel like I’m trespassing into spaces occupied by real people, not just mindless drones endlessly repeating a watch shift. And even when you don’t interact with them, turning a corner to find two NPCs flirting with each other, for example, makes these places feel occupied. You get the sense that you’re intruding not just because the HUD tells you that you’re trespassing, but because you’re clearly spying on or are within earshot of something you’re not supposed to be. </p><p>The narrative moments also helped me survive some failure burnout. As I consider getting spotted a fail state, I have a decades-learned habit of hitting “Restart Mission” every time a wrong move ruins my perfect stealth run. It’s not unusual for me to drill the same part of a mission over and over again until I can slip through, preferably without even firing a shot or taking down a guard. I aim for ghostly runs as often as I can. </p><figure id="" data-id="32d707119da59c088b49adb040cf85bf" data-recommend-id="image://32d707119da59c088b49adb040cf85bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Agent 47 crouches below an office desk to hide from two NPCs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Agent 47 crouches below an office desk to hide from two NPCs." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->IOI / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="32d707119da59c088b49adb040cf85bf" data-recommend-id="image://32d707119da59c088b49adb040cf85bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Agent 47 crouches below an office desk to hide from two NPCs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But stumbling upon a possible narrative opportunity during my stealthy trips around the map can be something of a release valve, helping me let go of the frustration of getting spotted. Or sometimes I’ll give in and disguise myself as a security guard. The fact that the game allows for this versatility is what helped me rack up 35 hours of play this weekend, and it’ll continue to call me back for future missions as well.</p><p>If you, too, have found that <em>Hitman</em> hasn’t been as stealthy as you wish it was, start changing the HUD settings and ramping up the difficulty; you’ll find a sneaking experience that might even make Big Boss sweat a little.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/hitman-woa-stealth-metal-gear-splinter-cell-freelancer-1851786255]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Playing defense is one of the most crucial elements to success in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-college-football-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675130">College Football 26</a>. While you might want to sim through all of the defensive series in a game or just use the coach's suggestion plays to get through a drive, you can really turn the tide of a game if you actually concentrate on defense.</p><p>If you want to make that job easier on yourself, it's imperative to use the right defensive playbook in College Football 26. A majority of the game modes allow you to select any team's playbook on offense and defense, giving you freedom to choose what kind of plays you have access to.</p><p>Of course, defensive plays are a little trickier to understand than offensive ones. So, to make matters simpler, you can take a look below at our picks for the best defensive formations and playbooks available in CFB 26. If you make your own custom playbook and combine these formations We've already covered the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-offensive-playbook-to-use-in-college-football-26/1100-6533072/" data-ref-id="1100-6533072">best offensive playbooks</a> if you want to check out that side of the ball.</p><h2>Best defensive schemes in College Football 26</h2><p>When it comes to selecting a defensive playbook, you have to consider a few different factors. You need to determine if you want to run a specific kind of defense and what that defense is. Of course, you can also select a solid all-around playbook that features plays from various formations, giving you access to a wide selection of plays.</p><p>Fortunately, we've got you covered regardless of your preferences. Below, you can see our pick for the best schemes, collectively making up the best defensive playbook in the game.</p><h3>3-4 Defense</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529644-img_6836.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529644" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529644-img_6836.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529644"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529644-img_6836.jpg"></figure><p>Let's start off with a classic. The modern 3-4 Defense was popularized by now North Carolina head coach Bill Belichick during his 40+ years in the NFL. In CFB 26, it's arguably the best standard defense that covers all of your bases when it comes to countering what play an offense will run.</p><p>In 3-4, you'll have three defensive linemen and four linebackers on the field. 3-4 relies on some stability from the interior of the defense, which means your defensive tackles and inside linebackers need to ensure they're covering the middle of the field. However, you also don't want to leave any passing lanes exposed, which is where your other linebackers come into play. For 3-4, you generally want to user the middle linebacker to cover passing lanes or possibly the defensive tackle to try and get pressure on the opposing quarterback.</p><h3>3-3-5 Defense</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529645-img_6839.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529645" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529645-img_6839.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529645"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529645-img_6839.jpg"></figure><p>Next up, we have an alternate defensive playbook, which uses the 3-3-5 defense. This defensive formation utilizes three down defensive linemen, three linebackers, and five defensive backs. Naturally, with one less lineman/linebacker, you're going to have to get creative when it comes to pressuring the quarterback.</p><p>Fortunately, the 3-3-5 defense utilizes plenty of safety and cornerback pressures to compensate for the missing pass rusher. You can also use your six linemen and linebackers to shoot different gaps on passing and rushing plays. 3-3-5 defense can come with some risk if you don't guess the right play or make the correct pre-snap adjustments, but it can also be a truly difficult defense to play against if you can cover all your bases.</p><h3>3-2-6 Defense</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529646-img_6838.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529646" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529646-img_6838.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529646"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529646-img_6838.jpg"></figure><p>The 3-2-6 defense is one you want to use if you're overly worried about defending against the pass in CFB 26. Utilizing six defensive backs and only two traditional linebackers, you'll have a difficult time getting any consistent pressure on the quarterback with this defense. However, that abundance of DBs makes it incredibly difficult for the quarterback to find any open receiver.</p><p>Moreover, the defense often makes use of speedier linebackers that drop into coverage as well, meaning you might only have three defensive linemen trying to stop the run and get to the quarterback. As long as you can predict when a pass is coming and use the right plays accordingly, the 3-2-6 defense will be a thorn in the side of any opponent that wishes to pass to ball.</p><h3>4-2-5 Defense</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529647-img_6837.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529647" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529647-img_6837.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529647"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529647-img_6837.jpg"></figure><p>Finally, we have the 4-2-5 defense, which is a mix between the 3-2-6 and 3-3-5 defenses. Compared to the 3-2-6 defense, which is all about defending against the pass, the 4-2-5 focuses more on defending the run and getting to the quarterback. While you do still have five defensive backs in the mix, one of them is often responsible for applying pressure from the outside. This, mixed with four down defensive linemen and a linebacker or two, makes getting to the quarterback much easier.</p><p>Of course, what makes the 4-2-5 great is that you also have some flexibility to defend against the pass. You can use all five DBs to drop into coverage along with your two linebackers. On plays where the offense takes some time to develop, you can cover all receivers and possibly get to the quarterback with your four linemen. Quick passing plays might beat the 4-2-5, though, so watch out for those.</p>

                <p>As one of the biggest games in the world, Fortnite has long had its fair share of bad actors targeting it and its players. Epic Games has responded over the years by beefing up its safety and security capacities and investing in protective measures to ensure the stability of the game.</p><p>Recently, Epic took legal action against two individuals, a cheat seller and the perpetrator of a string of DDoS attacks against Fortnite creators. According to Epic's comments on the matter, the DDoSer had been disrupting livestreams of Fortnite content, in addition to conducting "stream sniping" campaigns. The other person, meanwhile, had been selling and using permanent Fortnite bans.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1944788275711054250" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We took legal action against two people who cheated and broke our rules:<br>One sold and used cheats and the other carried out cyber attacks on content creators who were livestreaming gameplay (aka: DDoS attacks).

Their social media accounts have also been scrubbed of content.</p><p>In their apology video, the DDoSer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD-KyTph9DI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zebsi</a>, shared that they carried out the cyberattacks under a particular username. They also apologized for the "damage" the attacks did to Epic, the community, and the targeted streamers. The cheat seller, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyqijCVqMGM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mirrored</a>, admitted to using, selling, and distributing "cheats and hardware," and they said that they had cheated in Fortnite tournaments. They also shared that they were permanently banned from the game and would face additional legal action if they cheated again.</p><p>Epic has taken a hard line against cheating in abuse in recent times, and this move to force public apologies from two individuals is a clear example of the company's efforts to increase deterrence.

                <p>Late last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504256">Overwatch 2</a> got some serious competition in the realm of hero shooters when NetEase launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/" data-ref-id="5000-624043">Marvel Rivals</a>. A number of new Overwatch 2 features have also drawn comparisons to Marvel Rivals, including the recent reveal of the third-person <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-stadium-roadmap-reveals-future-heroes-maps-and-game-modes-coming-in-the-next-few-months/1100-6531278/" data-ref-id="1100-6531278">Stadium mode</a>. But according to Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller, Stadium mode and other features weren't made in response to Marvel Rivals. Instead, many of them were planned before Marvel Rivals debuted.</p><p>"I think that competition is healthy," said Keller during a guest appearance on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2508946186" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jay3's stream</a>. "It does force people to innovate more and to always be putting your best foot forward, but I don't think what you're seeing in Overwatch 2 right now is a response to Marvel Rivals. So much of what we were doing this year--from perks to Stadium to map voting, we did full hero bans--so much of what we're doing here and all the heroes we're releasing has been in the works for over a year as part of a new strategy for the game to have a big annual kick off to the year."</p><p>Keller suggested that there may things added to Overwatch 2 in the future if the games are still actively competing, but he didn't add any specifics beyond that. During the same stream, Keller acknowledged that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-director-acknowledges-that-game-needs-more-story-content-to-be-firing-on-all-cylinders/1100-6533118/" data-ref-id="1100-6533118">Overwatch 2 has had very little of the story content, cinematics, and animated shorts</a> that helped define the world in the first game. However, he expressed a desire to place more emphasis on story in the future.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-getting-g-i-joe-costumes-in-july/1100-6532738/" data-ref-id="1100-6532738">Overwatch 2 x G.I.

Some of the previous collaborations included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-x-transformers-collaboration-trailer-unites-the-heroes-of-two-worlds/1100-6524772/" data-ref-id="1100-6524772">a few Transformers-inspired costumes</a>, as well as some from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-overwatch-2-x-street-fighter-collaboration-is-a-match-made-in-heaven/1100-6531643/" data-ref-id="1100-6531643">Street Fighter</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-debuts-avatar-collaboration-costumes-and-a-free-skin/1100-6528431/" data-ref-id="1100-6528431">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/season" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">summer 2025 anime lineup</a> is an embarrassment of riches. While many of its catalog is top-heavy with big marquee shonen series like <a href="https://gizmodo.com/dan-da-dan-is-a-lovey-dovey-madcap-sci-fi-anime-drama-about-finding-your-balls-2000540322" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dan Da Dan</em></a>, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gachiakuta-doesnt-just-redefine-shonen-anime-it-anoints-itself-as-the-next-big-thing-2000622249" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Gachiakuta</em></a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sakamoto-days-premiere-review-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Sakamoto Days</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kaiju-no-8-season-1-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Kaiju No. 8</em></a>, what impresses me most about this new lineup is how my basket of cherry-picked, must-watch shows feels heavier than it has in previous years. Two series that I’ve become utterly captivated by are <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GKEH2G0X4/takopis-original-sin?srsltid=AfmBOoqAal1Qp8aY0Fde1aSXQJLF8Ar56UNHq8NjM-ih_K30abgK-f_y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Takopi’s Original Sin</em></a> and <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81948057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The</em> <em>Summer Hikaru Died</em> </a>because they evoke the fleeting, nihilistic, and disturbing vibes of compelling anime from the aughts.</p><p>When I say these two anime evoke a vibe of disturbing anime from yesteryear, I mean the kind of fatalistic, dark anime that doesn’t seem to be made anymore: your <em>Higurashi</em> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=escc512WoDw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>When</em> <em>They</em> <em>Cry</em></a>) or <em>Assassination Classroom</em>. Despite being on opposite ends of the spectrum—one being oppressively bleak and the other an absurdist riot—both anime feature big ideas wrapped in cutesy packaging with an unsettling, violent thematic throughline that would <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassination-classroom-censor-manga-shooting-florida-1850334204" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get them banned in schools</a>. These shows were iconic at the time and still stand out in retrospect because they are so visceral. The same is true for <em>The Summer Hikaru Died</em> and <em>Takopi’s Original Sin</em>, which, despite their source material being from 2021, feel so deeply connected to a more daring era of anime history that they surpass the rest of the summer 2025 shows as nostalgic, novel, and refreshingly dark takes on horror.</p><p>Let’s start with Crunchyroll’s six-episode limited series, <em>Takopi’s Original Sin</em>.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="アニメ『タコピーの原罪』ノンクレジットOP映像｜ano「ハッピーラッキーチャッピー」" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ciFvLHCThdg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Created by <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/56101/Taizan_5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Taizan 5</em></a> and animated by <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1991/Enishiya" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studio Enishiya</a>, <em>Takopi’s</em> <em>Original Sin</em> is a blend of the normal, human cruelty of <em>Higurashi</em> with the zany mascot of <em>Assassination Classroom.</em> The series follows Takopi, an alien on Earth on a mission to spread happiness. He’s from a planet called Happy Planet and has various "Happy Tools"—magical-girl-style items like a Happy Camera that resets its subjects to the moment a photo was taken, a Reconciliation Ribbon, a red string of fate meant to make people friends instantly, and a Transformation Palette that allows Takopi to impersonate others. Takopi ends up meeting Shizuka, a lonely fourth grader. After befriending Shizuka, Takopi takes on a <em>Smiling Friends</em> mission to improve her life. The series also contains viewer advisories for suicide helpline links, adult themes, profanity, and violence, which it earns.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Takopi’s Original Sin | OFFICIAL TRAILER" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j7dxZjwIhu0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Typically, overly cutesy shows like <em>Takopi </em>is a warning sign that <em>Takopi </em>might be an evil agent meant to worsen Shizuka’s life, similar to <a href="https://kotaku.com/madoka-magica-beginnings-may-be-better-than-the-series-5950073" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Puella Magi Madoka Magica</em></a>. While Takopi is indeed an unreliable narrator with a bubbly, naive view of Shizuka’s intense bullying by classmate Marina Kirarazaka, Takopi ends up acting like a desperate visual novel player trying to save a doomed protagonist from a bad ending. Watching Takopi’s pure optimism corrupted by Shizuka and Marina’s respective perils can’t be solved by a wave of a magic wand, in tandem with the extraterrestrial ball of hope getting ground down by how Shizuka willfully rejects the idea that an eye for an eye isn’t a viable solution, is wildly captivating to watch. Like <em>Madoka Magica</em>, <em>Takopi </em>is a deconstruction of the magical girl anime trope that situates its instigator on the back foot as he realizes that magic can’t fix a <em>Higurashi</em>-coded visual novel tragedy. You start feeling for the little chibi guy whenever disaster strikes, and, instead of being met with admonishment for his misplaced meddling, he’s flashed with a glittery smile as Shizuka enlists Takopi to <em>Weekend at Bernie's</em> folks that’ve made her life a living hell.&nbsp;</p><p>Now let’s dive into Netflix’s adaptation of <em>The Summer Hikaru Died</em>.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="「光が死んだ夏」ノンクレジットオープニング「再会」Vaundy：The Summer Hikaru Died Opening" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UP7la6a1H1g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>While <a href="https://aftermath.site/dandadan-anime-science-saru-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dan Da Dan</em></a> explores horror, <em>The Summer Hikaru Died</em> is an anime series deeply immersed in the macabre. Additionally, it's a boys' love story crackling with sensual, creepy energy that both arouses and disgusts equally. Created by <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2024-07-24/small-town-horror-with-the-summer-hikaru-died-creator-mokumokuren/.211571" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mangaka Mokumokuren</a> and animated by <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1893/CygamesPictures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyangames Pictures</a> (famous for <a href="https://aftermath.site/uma-musume-gacha-horse-racing-anime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Uma Musume</em></a>), <em>The Summer Hikaru Died</em> is set in a familiar horror setting: a quiet rural village in the mountains. The series follows Yoshiki, a high school student mourning his childhood friend Hikaru, who mysteriously died in the mountains. However, as the title hints, Hikaru isn’t actually dead and a mysterious, menacing entity has taken root beneath his friend's skin.&nbsp;</p><p>Hikaru wises up to the facade early in the show’s first episode, but what happens next is much more interesting than if the show had gone with a traditional body-snatching mystery like<em> The Thing</em>. “Hikaru,” now a mixture of memories and affection fermenting inside his host, doesn’t just ask to keep pretending to be human; he asks Yoshiki’s permission to keep living as his best friend. To Yoshiki’s horror, he agrees—and opens the door to his small town’s occult mysteries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from <em>The Summer Hikaru Died</em>’s impressive feature film-quality animation and composition, one of the most remarkable aspects of the anime is its clear queer narrative between its leads. While people are sure to debate online over whether they’re “just friends” who explicitly say they love each other, supporters of this view can argue with their mommas because The Summer Hikaru Died being “yaoi-coded” doesn’t start to describe it accurately.&nbsp;</p><p>Deadass, there’s a scene in its second episode, “Suspicion,” where “Hikaru” asks Yoshiki to reach into his chest cavity to learn first-hand how he dispensed of a yokai that was stalking him. This leads to an overtly sensual and disturbing scene where the former shudders, muttering shit like “Yeah, that’s the spot!” prompting Yoshiki to ask “This feels good?” and “Hikaru” responding, saying “Feels just like a good pat on the head. Nobody’s ever touched me here before” between moans.&nbsp;</p><p>While “Hikaru” protests to Yoshiki (who visibly enjoyed their chest fingering despite how scary it was) for wiping his hand off on his shirt, Yoshiki blushes and looks away after “Hikaru” tells him to get a good look at his abs. The scene is hilariously capped off by Yoshiki describing his tactile chest fingering, describing it like a touching marinated chicken. A remark the anime capitalizes on with a frame of marinated chicken (<a href="https://x.com/tsuchi31478044/status/1944085827648176493" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which the staff later enjoyed as karage</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>While other horror works like <a href="https://gizmodo.com/uzumaki-anime-review-adult-swim-junji-ito-production-ig-2000501288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Junji Ito’s manga</a> set the gold standard for stomach-churning horror, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/uzumaki-anime-bad-animation-episode-2-jason-demarco-2000509050" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their anime adaptations often lose their edge</a>. However, anime like <em>Takopi’s Original Sin</em> and <em>The Summer Hikaru Died</em> go beyond those shortcomings. They’re darker, sharper, and messier in ways that feel more authentic to emotional horror, resisting genre polish and pushing boundaries with every frame. They focus less on jump scares and more on existential decay, replacing loud panic with quiet unraveling. These qualities don’t just honor a past era of anime; they make them stand out amid today’s streaming riches and serve as exciting reminders of the wonder anime can still create.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/high-wheel-bike-race-frederick"><h3>The Penny Farthing Is Alive And Well In 2025</h3></a><p>The National Clustered Spires High Wheel Race takes place every summer in Frederick, Maryland</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/uma-musume-gacha-horse-racing-anime"><h3>Pretty Girl Horse Racing Game ‘Uma Musume’ Is Engrossing And Weird As Hell</h3></a><p>Breed horse girls to create even better horse girls, so that they can achieve their dream of winning races and performing a concert literally right after</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/outlier-best-mens-pants-indestructible-pants"><h3>All My Pants Are From Outlier Because They Appear To Live Forever</h3></a><p>Outlier makes pants that will survive the abuse of several presidential administrations.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/horror-anime-crunchyroll-netflix-hikaru-takopi]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The next Nintendo Direct might be coming up very soon. That's according to reputable source Nate the Hate, who said during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYkD9QCBp4Y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast</a> today, July 14, that the next Direct is slated for this month.</p><p>"It is the million dollar question. I have been told there is a Direct this month, the month of July, but that Direct will not take place until after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-release-date-trailer-gameplay-details-and-everything-we-know/1100-6530797/" data-ref-id="1100-6530797">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> releases," he said. "Beyond that, I have no additional information. I do not have information as to the exact timing at this point."</p><p>Bananza launches on July 17 for Switch 2, so a possible Direct would happen after that if this report proves to be accurate.</p><p>That's all he had to say about a possible upcoming Direct. Nintendo could have any number of things to announce at a Direct, like a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-movie-team-returns-for-a-donkey-kong-film-listing-reveals/1100-6533131/" data-ref-id="1100-6533131">potential Donkey Kong movie</a> or confirmation of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-may-be-heading-to-switch-2-report/1100-6532372/" data-ref-id="1100-6532372">Red Dead Redemption II for Switch 2</a>. Activision is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-still-coming-to-switch-apparently/1100-6532276/" data-ref-id="1100-6532276">keen to bring Call of Duty to Switch.</a></p><p>There is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-pokemon-presents-livestream-announced-for-july/1100-6531854/" data-ref-id="1100-6531854">Pokemon Presents event slated for July 22</a>. Nate the Hate pointed out that this Nintendo-adjacent event <em>and </em>a Nintendo Direct in the same week is not unprecedented, but he feels safer speculating that the July Direct could happen during the last week of the month instead. If that's true, it would happen just before Nintendo releases its latest earnings results on August 1.</p><p>The latest Nintendo Direct took place on June 18 and was exclusively dedicated to Bananza. Before that, there was the big Switch 2 Direct on April 2 and then a Mario Kart World Direct on April 17. Nintendo did not hold a Nintendo Direct event in July 2024 or July 2023, but that <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-direct/archive/?srsltid=AfmBOoo-X7hRDf7qr3vJ94YQpTr-eGgfDvyx6gP0lkrBREZtbPWVlMDV" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historical precedent</a> might not mean anything. Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p><p>You might also want to keep an eye on the Nintendo Today app, as Nintendo is known to make announcements there just ahead of sharing information in other places.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> How The Fallout TV Show Shapes Fallout's Future</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Corden said from what he has heard, part of the forward push for Fallout 5 and Fallout in general came at the expense of ZeniMax Online's next MMO, codenamed Blackbird, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/" data-ref-id="1100-6532915">canceled as part of Microsoft's latest round of layoffs</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">As Corden explains, MMOs are expensive to build and have to compete with established games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> and even ZeniMax's own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online/" data-ref-id="5000-140736">The Elder Scrolls Online</a>. With that in mind, Microsoft made the decision to cancel ZeniMax's unannounced project and invest that money into Fallout, an established IP that would more likely be a "surefire win."</p><p dir="ltr">"From what I heard, it was a case of 'Do we want to sink a ton of money into getting this [project Blackbird] to a point where it can compete with the established players in the market, or do we want to allocate that investment towards making Fallout 5?'" Corden said.</p><p dir="ltr">It is worth noting that Corden states that he doesn't have enough information to write a full story about Fallout 5 or who may be developing it, so it's worth taking the information above with a grain of salt.</p><p dir="ltr">Project Blackbird was still in pre-production when it was canceled, but no official details about the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-revealed-about-elder-scrolls-online-devs-rumored-canceled-game/1100-6532943/" data-ref-id="1100-6532943">next game from the Elder Scrolls Online dev</a> had been announced. It had reportedly been in development since 2018, ran on a new engine, and was to be a new sci-fi IP. Development on the game was said to have been going well and had begun ramping up, with higher-ups at Xbox seemingly approving of the game just a few months prior to cancellation.</p><p dir="ltr">Regardless of who is developing Fallout 5, the fact that it is just now greenlit means it will likely be many years before it releases. However, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/there-is-a-fallout-3-remaster-in-the-works-but-its-not-arriving-anytime-soon-report/1100-6530903/" data-ref-id="1100-6530903">Fallout 3 remaster is reportedly in the works</a> that could arrive sooner. Renewed interest in Fallout reached new heights with the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-is-more-popular-than-ever-on-steam-thanks-to-the-tv-show/1100-6522828/" data-ref-id="1100-6522828">Amazon's Fallout TV show</a> in 2024, with star Walton Goggins recently offering an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-gets-update-from-walton-goggins/1100-6529385/" data-ref-id="1100-6529385">update on Fallout Season 2</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the next Elder Scrolls game is currently being worked on, with Bethesda Game Studios head Todd Howard recently reassuring fans that it is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-obviously-being-worked-on-amid-oblivions-remaster-todd-howard-says/1100-6531019/" data-ref-id="1100-6531019">"obviously" working on Elders Scrolls 6</a> even amidst the release of Oblivion Remastered.</p>

                <p>The definitive edition of one of the greatest Warhammer 40K games of all time, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war/" data-ref-id="5000-20083">Dawn of War</a>, is just around the corner, and fans who own the previous anniversary edition will get a substantial discount on this new and improved version.</p><p dir="ltr">Announced back in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/warhammer-skulls-2025-all-the-game-announcements-and-news/2900-6608/" data-ref-id="2900-6608">May as part of Warhammer Skulls</a>, Warhammer 40: Dawn of War – Definitive Edition now has a release date of August 14, developer Relic Entertainment has announced. This updated version of the classic real-time-strategy game first released by Relic in 2004 will make the game far more playable on modern hardware and will include widescreen and 4K resolution support, upscaled textures four times that of their original resolution, an improved camera, HUD optimizations, and upgrades to lighting, unit reflections, and shadows.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY_JzB0WxSA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pY_JzB0WxSA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">This version of the game has also been upgraded to a 64-bit platform to "support the ongoing efforts of the modding community" and will be fully compatible with existing mods, according to a press release.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3556750/Warhammer_40000_Dawn_of_War__Definitive_Edition/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dawn of War – Definitive Edition</a> will be $30 and additionally include each of the game's three expansions: Winter Assault, Dark Crusade, and Soulstorm. Each expansion added new playable armies, multiplayer maps, and additional campaigns (in the case of Dark Crusade and Soulstorm, non-linear campaigns playable with different armies). Some of the armies added in Dawn of War's expansions include fan-favorites like the Imperial Guard, Necrons, and the Sisters of Battle.</p><p dir="ltr">The definitive edition of Dawn of War will essentially replace a previous anniversary edition released in 2006 that bundled together all of the game's content. Those "loyal fans" who own the anniversary edition will receive a 30% discount on buying the definitive edition, with the discount remaining active "for the foreseeable future," according to Relic. That puts Dawn of War – Definitive Edition's price at $21 for anniversary edition owners.</p><p dir="ltr">To celebrate the release date announcement, Relic dropped a 4K enhanced version of the original Dawn of War's iconic CGI trailer, one that shows the Space Marines of the Blood Ravens engaged in a desperate battle against an Orkish horde.</p><p dir="ltr">While fans seem to appreciate the updated trailer overall, one change--the removal of a Space Marine sergeant's scream and its replacement with voiceover from a well-established character not depicted in the trailer--has ruffled the feathers of some. Relic in a statement to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition-dev-says-replaced-space-marine-scream-was-even-more-beloved-than-we-realized-as-intro-cinematic-changes-spark-backlash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> said the Space Marine's original "roar was even more beloved than we realized," and that "we may have something for OG roar enjoyers before long."</p><p dir="ltr">In other Warhammer 40K video game news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/space-marine-2s-new-siege-mode-unleashes-endless-waves-of-enemies/1100-6532761/" data-ref-id="1100-6532761">Space Marine 2 recently received its long-awaited Siege mode</a> update, while the remastered re-release of the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40k-space-marine-pc-remaster-had-so-many-launch-issues-sega-is-offering-refunds/1100-6532885/" data-ref-id="1100-6532885">Space Marine has been mired in so many issues</a> publisher Sega has begun offering refunds.</p>
