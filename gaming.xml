<figure><a title="EA SPORTS Madden NFL 26 Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157920/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>One of the biggest misses for me personally with the original Switch is that none of the more popular sports games of our time, and I mean these big EA and 2K efforts like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-madden-nfl-26">Madden NFL 26</a> here, and the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ea_sports_fc_24">FC 24</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ea_sports_fc_25">25</a>, aren't up to standard seen elsewhere.</p>
<p>There have been decent enough<em>-ish</em> attempts, some of those footie games mentioned will do in a pinch (and they're leagues ahead of the awful legacy FIFAs which preceded them), but if you're someone who plays on Switch exclusively, you've been missing out on some fluidity, responsiveness, clarity of image, and a bunch of other stuff wot makes fancy modern sports games play good, innit.</p>
<p>And so, Madden 26 on Switch 2 is absolutely a triumph in most regards. It plays well, it runs decently, and it looks not too far removed from other console versions. I'm also playing the game on my PS5 in early access at the moment (forgive me, Mario), and so I can tell you that existing menu issues, long loading times, and/or a persistent issue that's locking me out of Madden 26 because the servers are busy, well, that's all happening on both systems.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS Madden NFL 26 Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157921/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It's lucky that I'm comparing it to PS5 here, actually, because I probably would have, and did initially, think it was all just too much, once again, for a Nintendo console to handle. However, this is not the case. Early access is just a little messy right now, pals.</p>
<p>Indeed, for a Madden effort that's really been impressing me thus far with its new additions (and a slick new overall look and vibe to its menus), it's a real shame that, if the servers are having any issues at all, the game is booting you out of whatever you are doing. Sort it before launch, folks, pretty please.</p>
<p>These teething problems aside, I think we've got a banger on our hands here; this is the best Madden I've played in a good few years. Now, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/madden_nfl_25">Madden 25</a> was no slouch either, and in terms of its on-field action, it had got everything feeling better than it had done in years. Offensively, there was more time and room on the ball, runs felt easier to pick out, the AI was smarter in making them, and tackles with the hit stick had never looked or felt more impactful and powerful. We were already in a decent spot with this franchise, even if the modes on offer were getting a little stale.</p>

<p>With Madden 26, we've got improvements that make last year's effort immediately redundant to anyone who spends much time playing these things. And for newcomers, this is a fantastic Madden to get started on your gridiron journey with, because they've juiced the hell out of the tutorials. Oh yeah. The new training games and skill challenges here blow the old ways of learning out of the water. You earn some cool rewards, the challenges are actually fun, and the game does a much better job of pointing you towards things.</p>
<p>This refresh on the training front really does make it much easier to get to grips with, and it's worth old heads having a look around, too, and not just for all the rewards, coins, and all that nonsense. You'll probably also find yourself learning little things you didn't know. It's deep and it covers all bases (wrong sport, but whatever) with regards to taking you from how to run or pass, when to run or pass, how to make up yards, and all that basic core stuff, right through to fancy skills and strategies and things that my brain refuses to listen to.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS Madden NFL 26 Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157922/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the field of play, it looks better than ever, which is no surprise, and although there's plenty of weird limb and funny collision moments going on thanks to the fancy new physics model, it plays a better game than last year, and you can feel that immediately.</p>
<p>Now, the first and really only issue with the Switch 2 version crops up here as the game is running at what I'm <em>guessing</em> is 40fps in both docked and handheld modes. In handheld mode, this feels absolutely 100% fine. The game also looks very, very close to other consoles when played on the Switch 2's LCD screen. I've given this the biggest test I could, playing games whilst alternating between a PS5 Pro and a Switch 2, and honestly, give it five minutes — ten minutes if you're grumpy — and you get used to the slight drop in slickness.</p>
<p>I should note here that there is a more important sticking point with the lowered frame rate, and that is cross-play being ditched on Switch 2. It's a shame, for sure, but an understandable measure given you'd be fighting an uphill battle against lots of Captain 60fps opponents.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS Madden NFL 26 Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157926/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, in docked mode on your TV, it's a bit more noticeable. The resolution drop makes the play-arts and other things that appear in-game look a little less refined, and the reduced frame rate takes a little longer to bed in with. Again, I've been switching between this and a PS5 Pro in 4K, so it's a harsh test, and for me the Switch 2 version of Madden 26 passes it pretty easily. This is a version of the game that I will very happily play when I can't get to my other console, and for gamers who only have a Switch 2, there's nothing in terms of performance or quality of the port that should stop you from picking this one up. Hooray!</p>
<p>Moving on, Franchise has been the one mode that I reckon long-time fans have felt needs a reboot most, and in this year's game it's definitely much better. This time out, you choose a coach philosophy to get you started (so you may choose to run with an aggressive, strategic, defensively-minded character - all based on real coaches and real data, apparently) before jumping into an improved character creation suite to make your manager look how you like. There's still not a devastatingly terrible widow's peak to make my guy look just like me yet, but I've found one close enough that I'm willing to let this slide - for now.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS Madden NFL 26 Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157924/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Everything about Franchise mode feels tidier this year. It's much more addictive to play, too, thanks to lovely things like new equippable abilities that can be unlocked with skill points and will change depending on what coach philosophy you are coming from. Franchise this year also has brand new presentation packages, with fresh halftime shows and presenter bits to camera, primetime TV-styled stuff, and lots of other bells and whistles, making for a game that feels way, way closer to watching NFL on the telly. Heck, teams even have their own entrances and pre-game presentations, and even the jumbotrons and hoardings in stadiums are more exciting now.</p>
<p>Weather now plays a factor in games, with hot climates making your little smashers tired more quickly - and while we're on that topic, the snow games look great. Yes, even on the Switch 2!. This is also a much faster game in general, and the new animation system (which I don't understand, but apparently it's got more branching so it can be more reactive in any given moment) makes it feel much closer to EA's other American footie game.</p>
<p>Indeed, I have also been playing lots of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ea_sports_college_football_25">EA Sports College Football</a> of late, and last year it was better than Madden. It was zippier and fresher, and it just felt like the more fun game to play. On the pitch it was more...expressive, let's say, and it blew Madden out of the water with its presentation, honestly.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS Madden NFL 26 Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157925/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This year, you can feel how both games are much closer, sharing lots of UI features and gameplay similarities, not just on the field, but in how all of the modes work and flow. And this is a good thing! It's much tighter this year, with both games offering a very high standard of action, and I can't say I can pick a favourite just yet between the two.</p>
<p>Away from Franchise mode, Ultimate Team is still an incredibly, dangerously addictive thing to get involved in. It took me about an hour to have my first actual match, as there are so many packs to open starting out. But I can't help myself with this kind of thing and I'm fully involved in the yearly grind for all the best cards. You already know if this mode is for you and — if you can control yourself — it's a blast, with a ton of ways to play both on and offline with your team of superstars. Team-themed rewards are also a nice touch here, with my Las Vegas Raiders getting lots of bespoke gear and profile items that match my fave team, which keeps me hooked way better than getting lots of random crap. Note, there is still lots of random crap, if that's what you are into.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS Madden NFL 26 Review - Screenshot 8 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157918/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Across the rest of the game, well, it's business as usual in terms of the crazy amount of modes there are to toy around with, all the usuals are here, with an almost endless array of offline and online ways to play. I do loathe how progression and rewards in some modes require an online connection, but at least you can create your franchise and whatnot at the outset so that you can have it work offline.</p>
<p>When playing online, it must be noted, there's also a world of difference here in trying to get a match. It all works just like it should - there's no Switch slowdown or waiting for an extra ten minutes because the images aren't loading in.</p>
<p>And so, overall, we've got a port that scared the bejeezus out of me initially. I really thought those early server issues and laggy menus were just more of the same for Switch 2 owners coming from a bevvy of bad ports on Switch 1. However, this is not the case. Madden 26 on Switch 2, once you get used to the drop in frame rate compared to elsewhere, is a perfectly good way to play this excellent outing - a version I'll happily play alongside others on more powerful hardware.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Server issues at launch aside, and with the loss of cross-play noted, Madden 26 is a very solid port of one of the best outings for this franchise in recent memory. Yes, you'll need to get used to a drop in the frame rate to 40fps on Switch 2, but it's a reasonable downgrade in order to get this type of game running as well as it does on a portable machine. It really is a very close match in all other ways to other consoles.</p>
<p>For newcomers, this is one of the best Madden games I've played in terms of teaching you the ropes, and for the returning hardcore, the improvements on the pitch, and with regards to presentation, should impress where its predecessor felt a bit lacking.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Take-Two reported outstanding results for its first fiscal quarter of 2026, delivering total net bookings of $1.42 billion, up 17% compared to the $1.22 billion registered during last year’s fiscal first quarter. Net bookings from recurrent consumer spending (virtual currency, add-on content, in-game purchases and in-game advertising) also grew 17%, accounting for 83% of total net bookings. The most significant contributors to the record net bookings were NBA 2K25, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, Toon Blast, Match Factory!, Color Block Jam, Empires &amp; Puzzles, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Words With Friends, and Toy Blast.</p>



<p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick was understandably bullish, especially since the publisher has arguably its strongest games lineup on the horizon. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-twos-strauss-zelnick-on-the-firms-most-robust-release-schedule-and-preparation-for-gta-6s-launch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to GamesIndustry.biz</a> ahead of the financial report, the executive listed a series of games coming next year, and in doing so also included Ken Levine's next game, Judas.</p>



<p><em>We have a number of releases coming in the next 12 months – it's probably our most robust release schedule ever. Obviously, Mafia: The Old Country is available on Steam and console. We have NBA 2K26 coming, Borderlands 4, which I'm really excited about, and WWE 2K mobile for Netflix. We've got WWE 2K26, then of course, GTA 6.</em></p>



<p><em>We have CSR 3 coming from Zynga, Judas coming from Ghost Story Games, and Project Ethos coming from 2K. It's the most robust lineup I've ever been able to talk about this far in advance.</em></p>



<p>The concept behind Judas, the so-called narrative LEGOs, has been in the works for over a decade. Levine famously hosted a GDC presentation about it in 2014 and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/ken-levines-new-game-is-small-scale-open-world-sci-fiai-themed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussed it again in late 2015</a>. The game itself was <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-announcement-trailer-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> at The Game Awards 2022 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-is-finally-unveiled-by-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> about fifteen months later. Just last month, Levine <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-creator-glad-allowed-design-judas-no-live-service/">thanked Take-Two</a> for not forcing Ghost Story Games to add live service elements.</p>



<p>That Judas is coming in the next twelve months is great news for the publisher, especially since the actual BioShock successor is <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-reportedly-development-hell-failed-review-narrative-overhaul/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly in development trouble</a> and may not materialize for quite a while yet.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the GI.biz interview, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick expressed his strong confidence that Mafia: The Old Country would be successful:</p>



<p><em>I feel great about it. It's a wonderful premium title, it's priced right and it's really beautiful.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojimas-physint-conceptual-phase/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideo-kojima%E2%80%99s-physint-is-still-in-the-conceptual-phase.1265514/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Physint, Hideo Kojima's <a href="https://wccftech.com/physint-kojima-new-stealth-ip-playstation-transcend-film-video-games/">return</a> to the stealth action genre, is not going to be shown anytime soon, as work on the game is still in a very early phase.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/death-stranding-2-hideo-kojima-interview-1235143146/">IndieWire</a> in a fresh interview, the legendary game director was asked about what he is working on following the release of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, confirming that work is proceeding on the mysterious <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-disappointed-industry/">OD project</a>, and on Physint, although Kojima-san is working by himself on the latter as it's still in the conceptual phase. While this doesn't come as a surprise, considering it was made abundantly clear back in May that the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-stealth-game-physint-is-five-or-six-years-from-release-by-kojimas-estimate/">five or six years away</a> by Kojima-san himself, it's still a little disappointing to hear that even a first look at the game is really far away.</p>



<p>With Physint still in the conceptual phase, the mysterious OD project will undoubtedly be Hideo Kojima's next project to see the light of day. Following its announcement, very little has been said about the project in development with Microsoft, making some fear that it was cancelled alongside many other projects, including high-profile games like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">Perfect Dark reboot</a> and an <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-cancelled-mmorpg-story-gameplay-details/">MMO from the developers of The Elder Scrolls Online</a>. Thankfully, the project seems to be safe, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-od-xbox-horror-game-still-in-development/">work is continuing.</a></p>



<p>Though not a stealth action game in the capacity Physint will likely be, Hideo Kojima's latest game, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, does have <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-make-stealth-and-combat-way-more-enjoyable-with-this-one-game-changing-trick/">a few mechanics</a> that bring the Metal Gear Solid series to mind, including some significant improvements for stealth and combat mechanics. You can learn more about the game now out on PlayStation 5 by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">review.</a></p>

If you've recently run into an never-ending loading screen while trying to jump into a Conquest match, the good news is that the devs have been working to solve those issues.</p>
<p>While EA reckon the problem's specific to that game mode and the Siege of Cairo map, that doesn't look to have stopped plenty of players from running into it over the past 24 hours. Cue a number of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1mkcz0j/infinite_loading_screen_glitch_in_beta/">frustrated</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1mko40z/bug_as_of_this_morning_i_cant_get_into_a_game/">Reddit</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1mklzer/need_infinite_loading_screen_fix_asap/">posts</a> that boil down to the word 'stuck' being yelled so loud it could bring down a helicopter.</p>

<p>"Our team has been investigating reports of an infinite loading screen sometimes occurring when matchmaking into Siege of Cairo while playing Conquest," the official Battlefield Comms account tweeted this morning. "We've identified the cause and are performing server restarts to resolve this. These restarts will not affect players currently in-match. Thank you for your patience."</p>
<p>While waiting for EA to address the issue, folks had been trying stuff like verifying the game's files on Steam or restarting it to solve their problems.</p> <div>

<p>With those server restarts, hopefully Cairo conquesters'll no longer keep getting stuck staring at some soldiers' shapely posteriors in perma-load, and be back to staring at a soldier's shapely posterior because they've decided to use someone else as cover mid-match. It's a strategy. A crap one, but hey, some of us aren't blessed with Alexander the Great's tactical nous.</p>
<p>For those waiting until this weekend to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-early-access">jump into the Battlefield beta</a>, first of all congrats on likely missing the longest queues.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/take-two-ceo-dodges-question-on-gta-6-costing-80-or-more-says-it-will-have-a-%E2%80%9Cfair-price%E2%80%9D.1265505/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has said that GTA 6 will have a “fair price” when the game releases in 2026.</p>



<p>Following a question from <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/take-two-gta-6-pricing-debate-june-earnings-1236481561/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a> ahead of Take-Two’s recent quarterly earnings report, the outlet asked Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick about $80 games and what that means for GTA 6.</p>



<p>According to Zelnick, that announcement will come from Rockstar Games, the developer behind GTA 6, in due time.</p>



<p>“Our goal always is to deliver more value than what we charge, so we’ve had variable pricing at the company forever. As you know, the approach of the industry is to launch at a premium price, sometimes with special editions, and over time, typically to reduce the price to enhance the overall size of the market. We do the very same thing. I think, probably more than most, we’re highly focused on making sure that the experience is great, not just because the game itself is great, but also because consumers have paid a fair price for it,” Zelnick said.</p>



<p>So to put it bluntly, Zelnick dodged the question pretty perfectly (hurrah for training), diverting the question from the actual price point to the value to customers.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-gta-6-release-at-the-80-price-point">Will GTA 6 Release at the $80 Price Point?</h2>



<p>Frankly, I find it hard to believe that GTA 6 won’t release at $80. Nintendo has already got the accolade for being the first publisher to make that plunge, and while <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-cuts-prices-of-the-outer-worlds-2-and-other-holiday-xbox-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft recently pulled back on their price increase</a>s, Take-Two won’t want to miss out on another 14% increase, especially for a game like Grand Theft Auto that is going to sell at that price point regardless.</p>



<p>Will other publishers follow suit with $80 games after GTA 6? I’d argue yes, and while Microsoft’s decision to revert their price points suggests otherwise, I believe it was a strategic move based on their current game pipeline and the issues the company is currently facing.</p>



<p>Another common rumor floating around is that GTA 6 will launch at $100, and while I don’t think that will be the case, they’ll almost certainly have an edition to tempt us, and likely go beyond that price point. </p>



<p>What do you think of GTA 6 costing $80 is a fair price? Do you think it will be justified, and what do you think of other games following suit?

            <p>
Retro fans rejoice! Raven Software's legendary (or at the very least, fondly remembered) fantasy FPS twosome Heretic and Hexen have risen from the grave and received the remaster treatment on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC, courtesy of retro specialists Nightdive.
</p>
<p>
Heretic, for those too young to remember, originally released in 1994 while its sequel, Hexen: Beyond Heretic, released one year later, with Raven Software - these days best known for its work on Call of Duty - creating both using a modified version of the Doom Engine. But while the titles had much in common with id Software's seminal shooter, they managed to bring something new to the still-fledgling genre with their medieval fantasy setting; beefy guns and demonic hordes making way for swords, spell-casting, character classes, and the likes of monstrous spiders, golems, gargoyles, and the undead.
</p>
<p>
Both games have garnered plenty of fans over the years, and have gone on to inspire the likes of developer Indefatigable's superb 2018 retro-shooter throwback Amid Evil, but the originals are now set to enjoy a new lease of life thanks to Nightdive Studios.

<p>
Nightdive - the team responsible for many an acclaimed remaster, including the recent upgrades for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-review">System Shock 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-star-wars-dark-forces-remaster-is-another-nightdive-triumph">Star Wars: Dark Forces</a> - announced its new Heretic + Hexen release ahead of this year's QuakeCon. Both games have now been finessed for modern machines and rereleased, alongside a whole bunch of extras, in one reasonably priced bundle.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Heretic + Hexen gathers together Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders (combining both the original 1994 game and its expansion), Hexen: Beyond Heretic, and Hexen's Deathkings of the Dark Citadel expansion. That's alongside two new episodes, Heretic: Faith Renewed and Hexen: Vestiges of Grandeur.
</p>
<p>
Multiplayer fans have a variety of options too. There's split-screen local multiplayer for up to four players on all platforms (that's increased to eight players on Xbox Series X/S and PC), as well as cross-platform online support for co-op and deathmatch - the latter accommodating up to 16 players. There's also community mod support, the option to toggle between the original midi/FM soundtracks and a new version by composer Andrew Hulshult, new accessibility features, plus a "vault" containing a collection of behind-the-scenes development materials.
</p>
<p>
Switch supports up to 720p/60fps in handheld mode or 1080p/60ps when docked (there's no native <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> support, sadly), while 1080p/60fps is available on PS4 and Xbox One. PS4 Pro and Xbox One X shunt that up to native 4K/60fps, and you can expect native 4k/120fps on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. PC resolution and framerates are, obviously, dependent on hardware.
</p>
<p>
Heretic + Hexen is available now on Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam, GOG, and the Windows Store), and costs £13.49/$14.99. It's also available as part of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Anyone considering purchasing it should check out the <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/heretic-hexen-release-notes">accompanying FAQ</a>, as players who own certain earlier editions are eligible for a free upgrade.

              <p>It’s time for your monthly reminder that your Amazon Prime subscription also comes with a bunch of free games. And in many cases, while that “free” perhaps deserves scarequotes for falling under a subscription fee for a monstrously evil corporation, they’re actually yours to keep forever, with no DRM, and no requirement to keep up your sub. That’s true for eight of this month’s offerings, including&nbsp;<em>Civilization III </em>and&nbsp;<em>Thief: Definitive Edition.</em></p> <p>The reason for this proper, actual ownership is Prime partners with GOG for a lot of the games it includes in the subscription, meaning that you’re getting a code that allows you to download a DRM-free version of the game that boots from an .exe, rather than requiring any launchers or proprietary software. So while you may observe that&nbsp;<em>Civ 3</em> is a 24-year-old game, and as such perhaps not quite matching the sorts of games added to services like PS Plus or Game Pass, in this case you’re getting&nbsp;<em>Civ 3</em> to&nbsp;<em>keep</em>. You could also point out that the game is <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/sid_meiers_civilization_iii_complete">currently available on GOG for $0.75</a>, which is approximately 185 times cheaper than an annual Prime subscription, and there I couldn’t argue back.&nbsp;<em>Thief: Definitive Edition</em>, however, is $25, so that’s definitely a sweeter deal. And, you know, as much as that game definitely shouldn’t have been called “<em>Thief</em>,” and as embarrassing as its <em>The Crow</em> cosplay may have been, it’s actually a pretty decent game in its own right.</p> <p>Amazon Prime likes to make it as confusing as possible to acquire your freebies, releasing the games in four separate batches across the month, guaranteeing you to forget at least some of them. It also removes other games from the selection at the same times, really keeping you on your toes. But the two headline games for August are <a href="https://gaming.amazon.com/home">both there to grab right now</a>, along with big names added in July like&nbsp;<em>Amnesia: The Dark Descent</em>, <em>Marvel’s Midnight Suns</em> and&nbsp;<em>Saints Row IV: Re-Elected</em>. Also coming later this month are&nbsp;<em>FATE: The Traitor Soul</em>–an expandalone entry in Travis Baldtree’s legendary&nbsp;<em>Diablo</em>-like series–and last year’s deckbuilding roguelite&nbsp;<em>Necroking</em>. Here’s the full list of games for August:</p> <p><strong>Available Now</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Sid Meier’s Civilization III Complete</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>Thief: Definitive Edition</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>The Academy: The First Riddle</em> (Amazon Games App)</li> </ul> <p><strong>August 14</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>FATE: The Traitor Soul</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>Filthy Animals – Heist Simulator</em> (Epic Games Store)</li> <li><em>Tin Hearts</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>Necroking&nbsp;</em>(GOG)</li> </ul> <p><strong>August 21</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Labyrinth City: Pierre the Maze Detective&nbsp;</em>(Amazing Games App)</li> <li><em>Silver Box Classics</em> (GOG)</li> </ul> <p><strong>August 28</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Heroes of Loot 2</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>Fantasy Empires</em> (GOG)</li> <li><em>City Legends: The Ghost of Misty Hill Collector’s Edition</em> (Legacy Games)</li> </ul> <p>You also get a bunch of games via the Amazon cloud gaming doodad, Luna, which rotate in and out. It currently contains&nbsp;<em>Saints Row: The Third</em>,&nbsp;<em>SkateBIRD</em>,&nbsp;<em>Overcooked! 2</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dungeons of Hinterberg</em>, among others.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Another week in the books, and it’s been one that’s raced by for me. Alas, we’ve not had Mafia: The Old Country through the doors for a review, but I’ve been able to sink a little time into Battlefield 6’s public beta now, made a little start on our review of the “brinepunk” roguelite Abyssus with Miguel, and repeatedly thrust my arms along a desk for something else.</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> popped in to tell us that he’s been playing&nbsp;SkyCards and Wild Hearts. “SkyCards is a very addictive mix of card collecting and Top Trumps, but it is based on FlightTracker24 data so you catch planes in your area as they fly past. You can also travel to other airports, but to do that you have to unlock the airports, and the only way to do that is to catch a plane going there.”</p>
<p>This sounds… expensive.</p>


<p><strong>Ade’s</strong> spent this week playing DOOM: The Dark Ages and has been absolutely loving it, while Jim has been playing Far Cry 5, having waited for a console performance upgrade before making a start on it – “Ubisoft has a done a great job patching past-gen titles to give them a higher frame rate on PS5”. He’s enjoying its characters, setting and open world, with the only negative being that the combat hasn’t been all that dynamic, he feels.</p>
<p>In stark contrast to one another, <strong>Nic</strong> has been ill, and that is all, while <strong>Steve</strong> has been holidaying in North Wales. He took his Retroid Pocket 3+ with him and played a bit of Breath of Fire II on the journey. Aside from that, he’s been working his way through Wuchang, which he’s enjoying despite hitting a brick wall of a boss, and has finished the main campaign of Space Marine 2 with his online buddies, “which was a fun time but it did seem to take control away at the end for cutscenes rather than combat which was a bit disappointing.”</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has been playing Peglin for review, and blended that with a mix of&nbsp;Death Stranding, a bit of Animal Crossing, which he’s already growing tired of, Burnout Paradise, Saints Row 3, and Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden.</p>

<p><strong>Dom</strong> has been playing Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar for our upcoming review, and turned in a report on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/05/tanuki-pons-summer-brings-together-a-bmx-raccoon-package-delivery-and-sumo-wrestling/">Tanuki Pon’s Summer</a>.</p>
<p>And we’ll finish things out with an essay from <strong>Tuffcub</strong>, who’s been playing Mindseye! Is it as bad as all that?</p>
<p>“It’s really clear that this was meant to be a GTA style game, there’s a lot of set-up for the vibrant city, and there’s a lot of driving to locations, the maps are big. However, somewhere down the line, time and budget meant it got cut down to a series of linear missions and all the features you would expect don’t exist. For example, you can murder the staff at your new job by running them over and nothing happens, No police, no retribution, not even a smacked wrist. Guns just vanish when you pick them up for ammo, and while it looks nice, examine closer and you can spot the cut corners, in one mission the same stick could be found on the ground about every ten paces.”</p>

<p>“Almost two months after launch, and it’s still got acres of screen tearing, and when a new scene loads the whole screen flashes like a disco as objects load in. The plot doesn’t make any sense either, whacked-out ex-marine gets the top security job at the world’s biggest tech firm just because his mate asked? What? And then there’s the office of this revered figure that the new boss has deliberately kept undisturbed for years.. and yet anybody’s security card will open it and you can have a look around and mess with stuff. What? I can see the game they wanted to make. Sadly, they didn’t get remotely close to achieving it.”</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played?</p>

    <div id="main-content">
  

        <p>Nightdive and id Software have been hard at work restoring yet more 90s things</p>

    </div>

            <p>Wake up, it's the 90s again. Ok, so maybe I've lied to you there, but two classic shooters from the decade that I as a child of 1999 definitely remember fondly have been re-released as one handy bundle with some extra features. Heretic + <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hexen-beyond-heretic">Hexen</a> is out now.</p>
<p>The surprise re-release of these virtual spell boxes came as part of QuakeCon, with Nightdive Studios and id Software collborating to revamp more old school shooty things after doing the same with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom">Doom</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-2">Doom 2</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/doom-modders-are-annoyed-at-the-chum-bucket-of-wrongly-credited-mods-in-the-latest-doom-remaster">last year</a>. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Announced by id’s Marty Stratton and Hugo Martin during last night's <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2533764889">QuakeCon welcome stream</a>, the <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/heretic-hexen-release-notes?linkId=100000377011247">Heretic + Hexen bundle</a> gives you Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders, Hexen: Beyond Heretic, and Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel. Plus, there are two new chapters developed specially for the re-release: Heretic: Faith Renewed and Hexen: Vestiges of Grandier.</p>
<p>If you've already got the old versions of one or more of the games in your library, you'll be offered a free upgrade to the new bundle and retain access to those previous versions, rather than the new thing annoyingly overwriting them.</p>

<p>"There were level designers (including myself) that wanted to work on something new for Heretic and Hexen," developer Matthew Tropiano said of how the new sections came to be in an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/07/heretic-hexen-surprise-release-today/">Xbox Wire interview</a>, "Kaiser (Sam Villareal) took point on the Heretic episode, while I handled the Hexen episode. We both enlisted the help of community member Not Jabba, as well as Heretic + Hexen lead Xaser Acheron for map design, and artist Arthur Biver for additional graphic work." He and Jaemen Moore added the games' original devs have been part of "inspiring some of the areas", with the Heretic chapter specifically drawing on "unused artwork" for some textures and two enemies, the draugr and troll.</p>
<p>Alongside those chapters, the new additions also include the likes of in-game support for community mods, local, online multiplayer support for up to 16 players with crossplay, and a remixed soundtrack by composer Andrew Hulshult. There are also performance tweaks that'll deliver up to 4K resolution and 120 FPS if you're packing the right hardware, and a vault where you can check out the likes of classic concept art.</p>
<p>Heretic + Hexen will set us PC folks back £13.49/$14.99, via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3286930/Heretic__Hexen/">Steam</a> or <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/heretic_hexen">GOG.com</a>, and it's also on Xbox Game Pass. If you've not played the original Hexen, here's our former deputy editor Adam with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hexen-retrospective">some words on it</a>. If you've not played Heretic then I dunno, maybe imagine it's 1994 and you're enjoying a dark fantasy sibling of Doom. It features a <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Morph_Ovum">magic egg</a> that can turn enemies into chickens. Life's good. Or at least I assume it was.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/classic-shooters-heretic-and-hexen-re-released-as-an-enhanced-bundle-with-cross-platform-multiplayer-and-mod-support]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Nintendo, apparently dissatisfied with being a stalwart of nearly every school child’s life, is aiming even younger. A new range of products under the banner of <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/my-mario/index.html"><em>My Mario</em></a> has been announced, including wooden block toys, board books, and a Switch and mobile app that’ll let kids mess with Mario’s face, all focused on a preschool market. Gotta get ’em young and impressionable.</p> <p>Initially launching in Japan, the physical toys will be available in select Nintendo stores, but will almost inevitably find their way to international markets soon enough. The range includes plastic crockery, a mini-backpack, rattle plushies, and super-adorable teeny clothing, so you can deck your toddler out as a nearly-walking Nintendo billboard.</p> <p>The app, which is confirmed as coming to Switch and iOS, lets little kiddos goof around with Mario’s face, pulling and stretching the poor plumbers various features, causing him to react in different ways. It sounds super-basic, which is precisely what kids that age will want, reacting to their experimental input. Also, it’ll be free, so they can keep their complaints to themselves.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000616597" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616597"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616597">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This new range launches in Japan on August 26, and will include the most beautiful-looking building block sets, but each block is also an amiibo! There’s a Mario, Toad, Yoshi, Luigi and Peach, along with items like&nbsp;? blocks and green pipes, letting your kid build up a gaming scene, or just smash them into each other before chewing on the side of Yoshi’s face until the paint wears away. A Mario picture book looks equally well made, each board page interactive in some form. And oh my goodness, I want to go back in time and get the Mario romper suit with a hoodie for when my boy would fit in such things.</p> <p>There’s also a collection of stop-motion animation videos that’ll appear on the My Mario website when it goes live, each about a minute long telling stories about the mustachioed hero, again aimed at the youngest kids.</p> <p>All the physical objects will initially go on sale in Nintendo stores in Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto, but hopefully Nintendo will see the demand for international customers once everyone realizes those wooden blocks are secret amiibos and adults go insane trying to buy them. It’s unclear if the app will be available in English, but again, it’d be pretty daft not to.</p> <p>I shall never stop finding it incredibly weird that an ambiguously aged, mustache-wearing portly Italian plumber is such a staple of everyone’s lives, and it only gets more strange when aimed at preschoolers. And yet he’s the best! Nintendo’s clearly aiming to ensure kids are fully enculturated before they can even say his name.</p>

Then, as the month progresses, there's some chaotic multiplayer infiltration in Filthy Animals: Heist Simulator, fantasy action in FATE: The Traitor Soul, a bit of tactical roguelite deck-building in Necroking, a splash of old-school D&amp;D in the Silver Box Classics bundle, and more.

            <p>Microsoft have brought development work on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/contraband">Contraband</a>, the co-op smuggling game that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/just-cause">Just Cause</a> developers Avalanche Studios announced back in 2021, to a standstill. That's the official line, while a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-07/xbox-drops-work-on-contraband-video-game-after-four-years">Bloomberg</a> claims the game's been cancelled outright.</p>
<p>Nothing had been been seen or heard of Contraband since its reveal to the world <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/just-cause-developers-announce-open-world-smuggling-game-contraband">at E3 four years ago</a>, and this sudden status update comes just weeks after Microsoft cancelled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">Perfect Dark</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-mysterious-nature-sim-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-mass-layoffs-according-to-reports">Everwild</a>, and an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-union-say-theyre-fighting-for-staff-left-in-limbo-by-microsoft-cancelling-mmo-as-part-of-mass-layoffs">unannounced MMO from ZeniMax</a> as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-staff-discuss-microsofts-inhumane-mass-layoffs-and-how-the-future-looks-for-the-carcass-of-workers-that-remains">mass layoffs that saw around 9,000 staff lose their livelihoods</a>.</p>

<p>"Over the past several years, Avalanche Studios Group and Xbox Game Studios Publishing have collaborated on Contraband," reads a <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/contraband-update">statement</a> Avalanche put out last night. "Active development has now stopped while we evaluate the project’s future. We’re thankful for the excitement we’ve seen from the community since we announced and will give an update on what’s next as soon as we can."</p>
<p>That statement's arrival followed reports from both Bloomberg and <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/breaking-microsoft-stops-development">Game File</a> about Contraband's fate. The former saw Jason Schreier claim that this halt to development isn't just a pause, but a full-blown cancellation decided on by Microsoft. Meanwhile, the latter said that the game has been put "on hold", linking the news to Microsoft's July layoffs - which saw cuts in Xbox’s publishing division that works with outside development studios.</p>
<p>We'd already seen the consequences of those cuts and the call to stop funding several unnanounced games, with Romero Games having funding for their upcoming FPS pulled, leaving them <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/romero-games-have-completely-closed-doors-but-theres-still-hope-for-the-doom-creators-new-fps">searching for a new publisher</a> to get the project over the line. Some third-party games, including Kojima Productions' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hideo-kojima-is-making-a-horror-game-with-jordan-peele-and-its-called-od">OD</a>, are reportedly unaffected.</p>
<p>Contraband's premise sounds very cool - you and your mates smuggling goods across borders in "the fictional Southeast Asian world of 1970s Bayan". That E3 trailer, which has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reuri4lT7jI">set to private</a> on Xbox's English YouTube channel (but is still up on the Mexican one), had some Steely Dan in the background.</p>
<p>"Yeah, you go back, Jack, do it again," go the lyrics. "Wheel turnin' 'round and 'round. You go back, Jack, do it again."</p>
<p>We'll have to see where the wheel for Avalanche, over 500 staff at whom <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-100-staff-at-just-cause-developers-avalanche-have-unionised">unionised last year</a>, turns next. That's assuming this truly is is the last stop for Contraband's convoy.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-halted-development-on-just-cause-devs-70s-co-op-smuggler-contraband]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marvel Rivals has a year’s worth of new characters planned, and preparation 12 months in advance for new heroes is underway, Marvel Rivals Director Guangguang has revealed to Insider Gaming.</p>



<p>New heroes are one of the core features of Marvel Rivals, which has transitioned into introducing a new hero every half-season, and the next 12 months of content are prepared.</p>



<p>Speaking exclusively to Insider Gaming at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-ignite-mid-season-finals-complete-scores-standings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals Ignite Mid-Season Finals</a> in Guangzhou, Guangguang revealed that initial work has begun on characters set to be released this time next year.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-character-development-takes-about-a-year">Marvel Rivals Character Development Takes ‘About a Year’</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Blade is the newest Marvel Rivals character. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p>It takes “about a year” to bring a new character into <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a>, with a long list of work to be done that includes gameplay aspects, concept art, modelling, animation, and voice acting. Therefore, content is planned for the next 12 months and beyond.</p>



<p>While other games have adopted a yearly roadmap for content drops, highlighting what players can expect in the months ahead, Guangguang explained why the preferred approach for Rivals is to reveal new content at the start of each season to maintain “freshness and surprises.”</p>



<p>This approach also allows the Rivals team to keep a close eye on what the playerbase and Marvel fans are enjoying most, paying attention to their discussions to see how that can inspire the team to see what they can come up with.</p>



<p>One of the most highly requested additions from the community is Deadpool, but Guangguang did not confirm whether Wade Wilson is on the release schedule for the next year, telling fans to “stay tuned” for future reveals.</p>



<p>Which character is at the top of your wishlist in Marvel Rivals? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/3226/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

			<p>For the longest time, I’ve associated Japanese developer MAGES with absolute anime nerd (weab) slop. Now, as a massive weab, I say that in the most endearing and well-meaning way. The dense sci-fi visual novel adventures of Steins;Gate&nbsp;and the schlocky, shocking horror of&nbsp;Corpse Party&nbsp;are some of my favorite games, but in the last year, I’ve come to appreciate MAGES for a series of games that their work on has seemed to be relatively unnoticed. The recent Famicom Detective Club&nbsp;remakes on Nintendo Switch were developed in part by MAGES, including the incredible new entry Emio – The Smiling Man.&nbsp;Delivering an incredibly mature, slow, ominous, and grounded visual novel detective mystery, it ended up as one of my favourite games of 2024. It’s no wonder I ended up loving Iwakura Aria, as it shares so much of that same DNA and style.</p>
<p><iframe title="Iwakura Aria | Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RSiPbhGA-AY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Iwakura Aria wastes no time delivering a drab and dour opening. In 1966, in the wake of the war, Japan is full of orphaned children with no reliable path forward. One such child is our protagonist, Ichiko Kitagawa, who clings to hope as she scrapes by and spends her time illustrating. One day, though, her art catches the eye of a mysterious man, who ends up being the head of the prestigious Iwakura household. Almost on sight, he invites her to join the household as a maid, giving her a home and a path forward, but for seemingly no clear reason or benefit to himself. The dominoes of uncertainty slowly tumble onward from there, as Ichiko gets familiar with the mansion, picks up on the secrets bubbling within it, and begins to bond with Aria, the heiress of the family.</p>



<p>The events of&nbsp;Iwakura Aria&nbsp;don’t immediately have a hostile or ominous air to them, but what makes that sense of dread creep through is the incredible aesthetic of the game. Every character is rendered in a gorgeous, detailed, painterly style that is reminiscent of&nbsp;The House of Fata Morgana.&nbsp;The backgrounds, though, are a bit sharper, a bit more realistic, and swathed with incredibly realistic shadows and lighting. The result is an unsettling tonal clash that kept me with a cold-sweat the entire time I was playing.</p>

<p>In an early scene, Ichiko uncovers a dark and dimly lit room that contains a wardrobe full of knives, hammers, and guns. The way household-head Amane Iwakura’s bright character art contrasts against the dark, foreboding room as he gaslights our protagonist into not worrying about the content of the wardrobe is incredible and sinister.</p>

<p>As the game progresses, Ichiko falls deeper and deeper into the hellish secrets of the Iwakura household. What I appreciated most about this game is that uncovering those secrets and seeing Ichiko’s story through to it’s bitter end doesn’t take long at all. The adventure wraps up in a dozen or so hours, which is light and brief compared to the gargantuan 40-80 hour runtimes of most other mystery VNs, including MAGES own Steins;Gate series. The brief runtime helps paper over some of Iwakura Aria’s weaker points, too – investigation gameplay is here, but often feels more arbitrary or forced than it does engaging or enticing. There’s also a surprising lack of expression variations for character sprites or unique illustrated CGs.</p>
<p>Still, those qualms are minor in the grand scheme of things. Iwakura Aria is an incredibly insightful, grim, and engaging visual novel that doesn’t overstay it’s welcome. The combination of dark subject matter and beautiful character art creates one of the most interesting visual novel experiences I’ve ever played, and is well worth checking out for anyone interested in a more grounded mystery VN experience.</p>

			<p>A new media blast for Ninja Gaiden 4 went out yesterday, and YouTuber GamersPrey has uploaded a full hour of new gameplay with absolutely no commentary attached. It's a feast for the eyes of all those fans who feared the franchise was dead. They had every right to believe so, given that the previous entry, Ninja Gaiden 3, launched in 2012 and received middling reviews to boot.</p>



<p>Now, the action series is coming back, and it is doing so with a sort of 'dream collaboration' between historic developer Team Ninja and fellow Japanese developer PlatinumGames, who is also known for acclaimed action titles like Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance and the Bayonetta franchise. </p>



<p>Speaking about this partnership in an interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryp7yKdq5Bc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the Iron Lords Podcast</a>, Game Director Masakazu Hirayama from Team Ninja explained:</p>



<p><em>Well, for Team Ninja, Ninja Gaiden is a very important IP and title, so we have always wanted to create a new Ninja Gaiden game. Initially, the presidents of our company, Mr. Ono from Team Ninja, and Mr. Inaba from PlatinumGames, who are actually of the same generation and have had ongoing exchanges, discussed whether the two companies could collaborate on something new. Given PlatinumGames’ excellent track record with action games like Nier and Bayonetta, which we respect greatly, we thought it would be a great challenge to work together on a new Ninja Gaiden title. Furthermore, as you mentioned, with support from Phil Spencer at Xbox, the project was able to come together with a three-way collaboration</em>.</p>

<p>"We're thankful for the excitement we've seen from the community since we announced and will give an update on what's next as soon as we can."</p>

		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/lego-party">LEGO Party</a>, the upcoming multiplayer party game, is building towards an official launch next month with the game slated to release on September 30th on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO Party! - Release Date Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6KPCZUY4s-g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Announced earlier this year during the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/summer-games-fest">Summer Games Fest</a>, LEGO Party does exactly what it says on the tin. Developed by Aussie outfit, SMG Studio, and published by Fictions, this new licensed LEGO video game hurls four players into a vibrant, board game-like gauntlet where they must compete to earn the highest number of gold bricks.</p>
<p>Clearly, the developer (who also worked on the brilliant <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/moving-out">Moving Out</a> series) is looking to emulate some of Nintendo’s <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-party">Mario Party</a> magic. As players navigate the board in LEGO Party, they will land on spaces that transport them to one of 60 mini games.</p>
<p>What sets the game apart from main influence, of course, is its LEGO universe setting. Instead of leaning on crossover IPs such as Star Wars, Harry Potter, or Marvel, Party features scenes and characters from familiar themed sets including Space, Pirates, and Ninjago. One of the game’s main draws for LEGO fans will be collecting various character customisation components, with over a billion minifigure combinations.</p>

<p>Whether or not the game appeals to you, it’s been interesting to see the uptick in more experimental LEGO video games that don’t lean on popular franchises. For a good long while, developer Traveller’s Tales was dropping new LEGO games year after year, plumbing every Star Wars film, both the Marvel and DC comic book universes, and more. Always a hit with younger audiences, the overarching blueprint of these games was beginning to stale until 2022’s Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga which evolved the formula with its open-world focus and free camera.</p>
<p>More recently, we’ve had games of all shapes and genres from LEGO 2K Drive and LEGO Bricktales to the upcoming LEGO Voyagers, complimenting Epic’s ongoing free-to-play LEGO Fortnite. Exactly where LEGO Party will ranked among these games is something we’ll be finding out very soon.</p>

              <p>Last week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-card-art-plagiarism-1851787197">controversy erupted</a> around the art for an animated card in <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>‘s latest set, Wisdom of Sea and Sky, where a drawing of legendary monster Ho-Oh looked almost identical to that of a piece of commissioned art by a Chinese creator. <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-art-plagiarism-card-apology-1851787290">The Pokémon Company swiftly apologized</a>, and announced the art for both the “immersive” Ho-Oh and Lugia cards would be temporarily pulled from the new set, <a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1950406273150693652?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1950406273150693652%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fpokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-art-plagiarism-card-apology-1851787290">while making it extremely clear</a> that the fault for the issue did not lie with the artist. Now, both cards have been added to the mobile app, with new art by the same artist.</p> <p>Every set of cards in&nbsp;<em>Pocket</em> comes with at least one so-called immersive card: a card that when tapped on comes to life, showing a short but elaborate animation that eventually loops back around to the original image. They’re absolutely magical, and offer something real-life cards could obviously never do. For Wisdom of Sea, those cards were intended to feature legendary Pokémon Ho-oh and Lugia, the two mascot characters from 2000’s <em>Pokémon Gold</em> and <em>Silver</em>. However, when the artist whose Ho-Oh drawing had been so clearly been copied drew attention to this, both immersive cards were pulled from the set at the eleventh hour–the result being both cards featuring nothing but some placeholder text and a black screen instead of an animation. It was clearly embarrassing for the company. TPCi made it clear at the time that the responsibility for the issue lay entirely with themselves, providing dodgy reference materials for the artist to work with.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000616592" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616592"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616592">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It was odd at the time that both cards were pulled, given no accusations had been made about the Lugia art, but today’s new cards feature a brand new piece of art for that Pokémon too, suggesting TPCi noticed something had been amiss there.</p>

 <p>That’s all been fixed now, with both cards added to the set overnight, featuring a brand new pieces of Ho-Oh and Lugia art from the same artist, the excellent Sie Nanahara. When you launch the app today, a very small patch will be added, and if you already pulled the cards you’ll find the new art and animations will appear.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We'd like to share a new update with you. Please take a look. 🙇 <a href="https://t.co/Gh6wgL7G3Z">pic.twitter.com/Gh6wgL7G3Z</a></p> <p>— Pokémon TCG Pocket (@PokemonTCGP) <a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1953683542182924568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>By sheer luck I’d pulled both immersive cards already, so when I started&nbsp;<em>Pocket</em> first thing this morning, as is my routine, I was able to watch both animations, and they’re both utterly splendid. Each shows the legendary pocket monster either descending from the sky or rising from the sea to meet their counterpart, with all manner of other Pokémon appearing along the way. (Including, in the Lugia animation, my beloved Mantine.) Oddly enough, those strange rectangular artifacts on the original Ho-Oh card remain, the elements sliding apart as the animation begins.</p> <p>Sie Nanahara is responsible for all the incredible art in both cards, which is clearly a stunning amount of work, and includes a brand new rendition of Ho-Oh and Lugia. While <em>Pokémon</em> card art is usually based on each artist’s own vision, when it comes to the immersive cards it’s become clear that far more precise instructions are provided, and this is how things went wrong. It’s excellent that Nanahara has been able to react so quickly to demonstrate her skill, and hopefully this whole messy incident will result in her receiving far more work.</p>

			<p>Sony executives shared <span>many details on PlayStation strategies during the <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/fast/20250807/Hm92pdqE/202603_1q_02_en/03_qa/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">company's Q1 2025 investors call Q&amp;A</a>. For example, we&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-executive-confirms-playstation-moving-platform-business/" target="_blank">received confirmation</a>&nbsp;that there will be a shift from a hardware-centric business model to a platform business model focused on engagement&nbsp;</span>beyond PlayStation consoles.</p>



<p>We also <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-release-march-2026/">reported</a> earlier from the Q&amp;A that Bungie's Marathon is expected to launch by March 2026. Bungie is set to lose most of its independence as it slowly gets absorbed into PlayStation Studios, despite initial statements at the time of the acquisition. The thorn subject of PlayStation live service games was touched repeatedly during the Q&amp;A, and Sony Chief Financial Officer Lin Tao admitted that the plan (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-confirms-itll-have-10-live-service-games-by-march-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally targeted 10 live service games released by March 2026</a>) hasn't gone as smoothly as they would have liked. At the same time, she pointed out that it's not all doom and gloom, and those lessons will be helpful for future projects.</p>



<p><em>Last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concord was canceled</a>, and this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon was postponed</a>, so somewhat negative news has been coming out. But if you look at the we look at the past five years, five years ago live service games were almost non-existent for PlayStation Studios. Now, we have&nbsp;Helldivers 2, MLB The Show and&nbsp;Gran Turismo 7, and&nbsp;Bungie's&nbsp;Destiny&nbsp;2, so we have these four live services contributing to sales and profits in a stable manner. For Q1 2025, live service ratio was about 40%. For the full year, it's a little less, probably between 20 to 30%. So, in terms of the transformation, it's not entirely going smoothly, but from a longer term perspective, if you look at the changes over five years, you see that there has definitely been change. Of course, we recognize that there are still issues, many issues, so we should learn the lessons from mistakes and make sure that we introduce live service content where there's less waste and it's more smooth.</em></p>



<p>Helldivers 2 is undoubtedly the biggest PlayStation success in the live service segment, but it didn't even come from a first-party studio. That alone is telling in how much Sony still has to learn to be successful in this elusive category of gaming. Marathon's fate will no doubt mark a pivotal moment - will it soar like Helldivers 2 or flounder right away like Concord? We'll know more in a few months.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Executive Confirms That PlayStation Is Moving Away from the Hardware Business Toward a Platform Business]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/sony-executive-confirms-playstation-moving-platform-business/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-executive-confirms-that-playstation-is-moving-away-from-the-hardware-business-toward-a-platform-business.1265379/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier today, Sony announced the quarterly financial results for Q1 2025, where we <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-reaches-80-million-units-shipped/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that the PlayStation 5 console had shipped 80.3 million units as of the end of June. The whole Game and Network Services (G&amp;NS) segment registered an 8% year-on-year increase in sales of 936.5 billion yen ($6.35 billion), primarily due to the rise in third-party software sales, which was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange rates.</p>



<p>As a consequence of the recent strong user engagement trend, Sony has upwardly revised their fiscal year 2025 forecast for sales slightly from last time to 4 trillion 320 billion yen ($29.31 billion), as well as the forecast for operating income by 4% to 500 billion yen ($3.39 billion). Year-on-year, user engagement continued to increase, with the number of monthly active users (MAUs) across PlayStation increasing by 6% in June compared to the same month last year, reaching 123 million accounts. Total playtime for the quarter also increased by 6% year-on-year.</p>



<p>Sony also said that operating income increased approximately 2.3x year-on-year to 148 billion yen ($1 billion), a new quarterly record high for the segment. This was primarily due to the impact of the increased sales of third-party software and an increase in network services revenue.</p>



<p>But arguably the most interesting tidbit, at least for gamers, came from the subsequent Q&amp;A with investors, where Sadahiko Hayakawa, Senior Vice President in charge of Finance and IR at Sony, said:</p>



<p><em>In the gaming business, we are moving away from a hardware centric business model more to a platform business that expands the community and increases engagement.</em></p>



<p>The Q&amp;A is available <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/fast/20250807/Hm92pdqE/202603_1q_01_ja/03_qa/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, and the translation was <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1953491713693217147" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared on X</a> along with the news by Tokyo-based user Genki_JPN, who often reports on Japanese news. This aligns with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-appears-preparing-port-more-playstation-exclusives/">recently discovered job listing</a> for a Senior Director of Multiplatform &amp; Account Management, which hinted that Sony would bring even more games not only to PC but also to Xbox and Nintendo platforms, too, in an effort to increase PlayStation users (those elusive monthly active users, or MAUs).</p>



<p>So far, it was believed that it might be limited to live service games such as Helldivers 2, but that caveat was seemingly not specified this time. If such a business shift were to be confirmed, it would mean that Nintendo alone will keep making first-party games for its own consoles only, essentially heralding the end of the console wars.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-cheaters-bans-issued/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-cheaters-3-600-bans-issued-in-21-days.1265373/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlestate Games has taken to social media to announce that 3,600 <strong>more cheaters </strong>have been banned from Escape from Tarkov in a 21-day window that ended yesterday, August 7. To some, this might look like a huge success, but to those in the know, this is business as usual for Escape from Tarkov, a game utterly plagued by malicious operators.</p>



<p>Recently, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games said that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-cheating-situation-nikita-speaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the fight against cheaters</a> is ‘hard and never-ending’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-eternal-battle">Eternal Battle</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov is one of the worst games when it comes to cheaters, and it has been that way for a few years. It’s one of the reasons why the launch of Escape from Tarkov’s PvE platform was such a success, as it allows players to get the fundamental Tarkov experience without running into cheaters.</p>



<p>In a document posted on social media, the Battlestate Games team revealed that more than 3,600 cheaters had been banned during a 21-day window spanning July 17 to August 7.</p>



<p>Even a cursory glance <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQKZ0uxCB5Zi3Q3PsM_Ud4opkrpAeNax6UxrfBJFN0uxLPbcSRJqXCo7BChE7OCQu7jQWLwL8stGYO5/pubhtml?gid=1329899061&amp;single=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">at the document</a> reveals some of the key concerns about the cheating epidemic spoiling the most popular extraction shooter ever made. For instance, there are batches of accounts with almost the same name, which indicates that cheaters are running multiple accounts and have plenty of backups to work through.</p>



<p>In a few months, Escape from Tarkov is expected to finally graduate from early access and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">become a fully released title</a>, but many claim that the game isn’t 1.0-ready, especially as the title is still swarming with cheaters.</p>



<p>It’s one of the biggest hurdles to the game’s success in longevity, and it’s why the peak player counts for the games are believed to be sliding. Recently, Battlestate Games unveiled a rare glimpse at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-player-count-rare-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game’s player count</a>, which prompted fans to wonder what portion of that count is represented by cheaters.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty To Rely on 17-Year-Old Character to Drive Pre-Orders for Black Ops 7]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-rely-on-17-year-old-reznov-pre-orders/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-to-rely-on-17-year-old-character-to-drive-pre-orders-for-black-ops-7.1265370/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been discovered that Activision’s studios are preparing to rely on the resurgence of a character almost two decades old to drive pre-order volume for Black Ops 7. In a series of posts on social media, the ‘Reznov Challenge Pack’ was unveiled, with dataminers finding a triple pack of skins focused on Victor Reznov, a character first seen in 2008’s World at War.</p>



<p>Reznov has surfaced a few times in the Call of Duty timeline, and his appearance in the pre-order pack for Black Ops 7 comes as little surprise, given how accustomed Activision has been to relying on nostalgia to drive sales.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-reznov-revealed">Reznov Revealed</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, HeyImAlaix revealed the three Reznov skins reportedly coming to Black Ops 6 and Warzone when you pre-order Black Ops 7:</p>











<p>This was followed up by a video from realityuk that shows the skins from all perspectives:</p>











<p>The same profile also uploaded shots <a href="https://x.com/realityuk/status/1953569138560971009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">of some pre-order screens</a>, specifically the one that thanks players for pre-ordering Black Ops 7 and immediately unlocking the ‘SOG Reznov Operator’ pack.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many Call of Duty fans lambasted the skins, stressing that the character doesn’t look like the Reznov they know and love. Others were quick to highlight that Activision’s studios did the same thing before Black Ops 6’s release, allowing users to unlock a triple pack of Woods skins for pre-ordering the game:</p>



<div><article><a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1953503715945484678" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Replying to @charlieINTEL</a><p><span>Literally the same pre order rewards as BO6 but instead it’s Reznov. They are relying heavily on nostalgia to keep this game alive😂 </span></p></article></div>







<p>As Battlefield 6 enters a beta period and takes the world by storm, decimating every Call of Duty game, we have to wonder about Activision’s marketing efforts. Is relying on a character revealed almost 20 years ago the best way forward when your chief competitor is bringing so much fresh content to the table?</p>



<p>Nostalgia sells, I guess.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that this content is the result of datamining efforts, which means there’s every potential it’ll change or be stripped entirely in the coming weeks.</p>
