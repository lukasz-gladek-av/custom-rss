Instead, the animated movie features three separate stories about different Predator aliens hunting down warriors and soldiers in different time periods. So for example, we will see a Predator fighting soldiers in World War II and another Predator hunting a samurai in feudal Japan. </p><p>Here’s the official synopsis for the movie: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The anthology story follows three of the fiercest warriors in human history: a Viking raider guiding her young son on a bloody quest for revenge, a ninja in feudal Japan who turns against his Samurai brother in a brutal battle for succession, and a WWII pilot who takes to the sky to investigate an otherworldly threat to the Allied cause. But while all these warriors are killers in their own right, they are merely prey for their new opponent – the ultimate killer of killers.</p></blockquote><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/predator-prey-2-badlands-secret-movie-animated-hulu-1851681811&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/predator-prey-2-badlands-secret-movie-animated-hulu-1851681811">In October 2024</a></span>, it was reported that an animated <em>Predator </em>movie was in the works <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/prey-2-predator-badlands-filming-new-zealand-trailer-1851636314&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/prey-2-predator-badlands-filming-new-zealand-trailer-1851636314">alongside a live-action <em>Predator </em>movie</a></span>.

            <p>
Amid speculation Nintendo might be considering a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> price hike following last week's announcement of significant US trade tariffs, one analysis firm has told Eurogamer it expects the company to stick with its previously announced $450 launch price in the US - as it predicts Switch 2 will become the fastest-selling console ever.
</p>
<p>
Last week saw Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">make the unprecedented decision to delay Switch 2 preorders in the US</a> just hours after announcing them, saying it was doing so "in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions". More recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-tariffs-werent-factored-into-switch-2-price-but-its-something-were-going-to-have-to-address">Nintendo of America boss Doug Bowser has admitted</a> that while the Trump administration's earlier trade tariffs weren't a factor in determining Switch 2's price point, the latest wave of tariffs - which have heavily impacted countries where much of Nintendo's manufacturing is focused - create a "challenge", and are "something [the company is] going to have to address." 
</p>
<p>
Some have speculated Nintendo might respond by raising Switch 2's price in the US, despite the fact its existing $450 USD price tag has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-treehouse-live-viewers-have-very-clear-message-for-nintendo">already seen a vocal pushback from fans</a>. However, analyst David Cole, founder of games industry marketing and research firm DFC Intelligence, has told Eurogamer his firm sees a change in price as unlikely at launch. "We are expecting Nintendo to stick with the $450 price point," Cole told Eurogamer, "and we believe that price point was reached with the threat of tariffs already looming."

<p>
However, in its <a href="https://www.dfcint.com/the-evolution-of-console-gaming-insights-on-the-switch-2s-debut/">initial Switch 2 guidance</a>, DFC also suggests US trade tariffs - which include a 24 percent levy on Japanese goods - could lead to a 20 percent price increase for the console over the next two years. As such, it's lowered its initial 2025 worldwide forecast for Switch 2 from 17m to 15m units sold. "If prices increase substantially due to tariffs," it notes, "a significant portion of prospective buyers are likely to hold back on a purchase until prices come down."
</p>
<p>
Cole tells Eurogamer DFC's revised forecast factors in both a potential price hike and "the possibility that there may be a supply issue if Nintendo chooses to limit production initially" due to tariffs. "Nintendo is very conservative," he adds, "and they don't like to take big risks on having surplus inventory. So they may take a bit of a wait and see approach given some of the current unknowns."
</p>
<p>
Despite DFC's revised sales forecast, the firm notes shifting 15m units in 2025 would still make Switch 2 the "fastest-selling gaming console to date, outpacing its predecessor". And looking further ahead, it believes "the upper limit for hardware sales... is enormous", adding, "As the Switch 2 matures it has the ability to capture an even larger share than the original Switch."
</p>
<p>
"With its expanded appeal and focus on capturing new consumer segments," the firm writes, "it will likely redefine what constitutes the core Nintendo audience. Historically seen as a niche or standalone ecosystem, Nintendo is now poised to engage more directly with the broader competitive landscape dominated by Sony and Microsoft... This shift could mark a transformational moment for the video game industry, as the Switch 2 positions itself as a serious contender across multiple demographics and game genres."
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 is still scheduled to launch worldwide on 5th June, despite Nintendo's decision to indefinitely delay pre-orders in the US - a delay that has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-orders-in-canada">now impacted Canada</a> as the company moves to "align with the timing of pre-orders to be determined in the US".
</p>
<p>
And it's not just Nintendo. Earlier this month, US trade group the Entertainment Software Association <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/trump-tariffs-will-have-a-real-and-detrimental-impact-on-games-industry-says-us-trade-group">said the Trump administration's tariffs will "have a real and detrimental impact" on the video games industry</a> as a whole.

            <title><![CDATA[Games Writing Words I Hate]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/games-writing-words-that-are-bad</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/games-writing-words-i-hate.1158603/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/games-writing-words-that-are-bad<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back at Kotaku, our style guide contained a list of over-used or meaningless phrases that were banned from headlines and articles. My strongest memory is of “looks” making an appearance every press conference season, very good advice that also forced me to think more deeply about what had actually <em>happened</em> during a marathon of trailers. In my decade-plus of working as a professional editor in games journalism, I’ve developed my own personal list of words I axe from drafts. Since it’s Inside Baseball week, here’s some games writing words I hate and why I hate them.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of these words are jargon, either from game development or games marketing, while others are vague. I am pretty pedantic as an editor (“But what does this <em>mean</em>?” is one of my most commonly-written notes), but it’s usually in service of pushing a writer to be specific. I'm also aware that I too have used these words, probably on this very website, because many of them are pretty entrenched in how we talk about games. I’ll try to offer some alternatives to the words I criticize in this list, just so I don’t come off like a complete crank. </p><p><strong>Immersive:</strong> This is an easy one, since discourse around this word returns every few years. In a 2012 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyY1xt-YnCY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video essay</a> on the topic, <a href="https://iam.benabraham.net/2012/04/14/attention-and-immersion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben Abraham</a> pointed out that calling something “immersive” can lead to “appealing but meaningless statements,” and I think that really sums up why this word is so useless in games writing. It looks good on paper, but what does it actually <em>mean</em> to be “immersed?” You’re just saying that you…had a lot of emotions, that the game felt realistic, that you were paying attention? As praise, it’s contributed to the high-fidelity graphics race that is ballooning production costs and pricing all of us out of hardware. You don’t need to help that happen.</p><p>As an alternative, you guessed it: Be specific. If the boulder scene in <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> felt “immersive,” think about what that word is really pointing to for you. Did the game’s accurate recreation remind you of seeing the movie for the first time as a kid? Did the scene have really good sound design? Was it paced in such a way that it felt tense or unpredictable? Tell the reader what you actually experienced and why you valued it, instead of throwing down a tired buzzword.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Franchise:</strong> Regular people do not use this word in their regular lives; no one who isn’t a shareholder is saying “oh boy, another entry in my favorite franchise!” (While we’re at it: “entry” also sucks, but I’m less of a stickler about this one.) “Franchise” is a marketing word, and you don’t work for a game’s marketing department. Just say “series,” jesus christ.</p><p>I know that not everything you might be tempted to call a “franchise” is strictly a “series,” but in this instance I’ll take a potentially fuzzy noun over one that makes you sound like a tool. We all know you’re talking about a video game.</p><p><strong>IP:</strong> Same. There is no reason for you to <em>ever</em> say “IP” unless you are making fun of <a href="https://aftermath.site/wb-earnings-zaslav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people who say “IP”</a> or are a contracts lawyer. Like with “franchise,” I know it can sometimes be hard to find a non-clunky alternative to this word, but it’s a PR word and you are not on a game’s PR team.&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of video games writing words veer close to marketing words; while I don’t consider journalists the enemies of PR per se, we’re doing very different jobs, and the words we choose can make that clear. When marketing words creep into our vocabulary, we blur a boundary fundamental to journalists’ independence, and we also miss out on the opportunity to say the things that we as journalists are uniquely situated to say. Leave the press release talk in your inbox.</p><p><strong>Revealed/Dropped:</strong> Look, I get that this one is pedantic, but unless you work in a video game’s marketing department, a company “showed” or “announced” something. They didn’t <em>reveal</em> it–it’s not a magic trick–and they didn’t <em>drop</em> it–it’s not a new album. Actually, I frequently get into arguments with writers about that last one, because while I get that people use this colloquially, I think it sounds like a hype word. You’re a journalist; you’re not in the business of hype.</p><p><strong>Fun: </strong>Hear me out. One of the big challenges of writing about games is trying to communicate your own reactions and emotions when you’re talking to hundreds or thousands of people you don’t know, who not only have their own tastes but also their own perceptions of their own emotions. What you find “fun” or “moving” or “interesting” or “boring” could be completely different not only to what kinds of experiences give them those emotions, but to how they even understand their experience of those emotions. It’s easy to write “this game is fun” or “this mechanic is fun,” but, like “immersive,” you actually aren’t communicating very much.</p><p>Here, again, is where being specific will be your friend. If you found a game “fun,” give a concrete example of a fun moment and dig into precisely what your experience was. What was “fun” for me about climbing up and down the tea-making machine in <a href="https://aftermath.site/wanderstop-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Wanderstop</em></a><em> </em>was that it was clunky and manual; this strange, slow machine gave the game its particular pace and highlighted that quality in the game itself, as part of its overall message. That has a lot more detail than “Making tea in this game is fun,” and asks you to really dig into your experience with a game.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplay loop:</strong> I feel like this one is going to be contentious. To me, this is a game design word, and much like marketing words, I think it behooves us as writers to remember that we aren’t game designers. (You might in fact also be a game designer, but hopefully you get what I mean!) Whether or not games journalists are “in the games industry” has come up a lot in the past few years, particularly in a few <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-insomniac-hack-reveals-the-ugly-truth-of-video-game-hype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high-profile</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-suicide-squad-situation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">instances</a> where our different roles and priorities became clear. I am firmly of the mind that games journalists are in the journalism industry, and as such, we have a wonderful wealth of our own words to use, rather than another field’s. Take advantage of it!</p><p>“Gameplay loop” also veers into jargon territory, another thing I try to excise from writers’ drafts. It can be really tough to avoid jargon without running the risk of talking down to your audience, because it’s hard to know what is or isn’t jargon to such a large, diverse group. Not everyone who plays video games is as dialed in as someone who likes games enough to write about them on the internet. Jargon can be useful–one word instead of several always <em>feels</em> better–but I find it almost never harms my writing to take a moment to consider if there isn’t a simpler or more accessible way to say what I mean. This gives me the opportunity to invite more readers in and maybe teach them something in the process.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Addictive:</strong> Many games sites have finally gotten on the same page about this, thankfully. “Addictive” as praise sucks, not just because your readers might struggle with <a href="https://kotaku.com/i-kept-playing-the-costs-of-my-gaming-addiction-5384643" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">compulsive behaviors</a> related to video games, but also because when you think about it, it’s not really meaningfully descriptive. The fact that I <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-to-play-games-sober-1839509936" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">struggled with alcohol use</a> isn’t a compliment to alcohol, nor is it–to me at least–a criticism of it; booze was a tool I used to solve a problem, and it took over all my other tools, but you might not have that struggle at all. Addictiveness might say more about you and your experience with something than the thing itself (this isn’t a blanket truth, obviously), and as such is not very useful when describing something.</p><p>“Addictive” also ties into some negative tendencies in game design and how some games want to keep you playing for longer than you might otherwise, but whether or not that constitutes “addiction” is a whole field of thought far bigger than a nit-picky blog about words. If you’re writing an article about predatory practices, just say that. If what you mean is that you really enjoyed playing a game and wanted to keep playing it, <em>just say that</em>, and, as always, give a specific example of a moment and why you felt the way you did.</p><p>(While we’re on substance talk, I’m always a bit chagrined when I have to explain this one, but I tend to edit out “drank the Kool-Aid” in pieces. This is a reference to the brutal end of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peoples Temple</a> in 1978; beyond the fact that research has shown that many people did <em>not</em> willingly drink the poisoned Kool-Aid, it was also a hideous tragedy that should not be turned into a glib phrase.)</p><p><strong>Genius:</strong> Maybe this is a hot take, but no one is a “genius.” “Genius” itself is often a marketing word that obfuscates the labor that goes into games and other creative work. People might be very good at what they do, and they might be in the right place at the right time or have access to the right resources so that they get lots of opportunities to be good at that thing, and they might have a whole system or marketing apparatus behind them so that everyone knows how good they are at the thing. But no good comes of praising an individual as a genius, not just for helping readers know more about a person, but for <em>anyone</em> who makes things. I’m looking at you, everyone who writes about Kojima.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re writing about someone who’s very good at something, try to dig into what precisely that looks like, and also <em>why</em>. It’s also a great opportunity to think about and <a href="https://aftermath.site/star-reporter-talent-pr-washington-post" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highlight </a>the people who are most likely helping them be so good at their thing. There’s probably a way more interesting story there than another fawning profile of someone who already gets talked about to death.</p><p><strong>Game of the Year: </strong>Apart from lists written for SEO purposes, ranking things against each other and deciding which one is the best is a fool’s errand. And look, I’ve written these lists, and I even <em>like </em>them, because it’s nice to see a roundup of things someone liked that I might like too. But it’s a weird practice that the whole internet ecosystem falls into that, sure, has some benefits, but in the long run probably does more harm than good.</p><p>“Game of the year” or “my GOTY” should especially be avoided when you’re writing about one specific game, particularly when the year isn’t over. “This is a contender for my game of the year” means nothing to a reader for the same reasons that “fun,” “boring,” and their ilk mean nothing. Furthermore, you don’t know what the year holds! Life is a terrifying roller coaster and anything could happen! Just say what stood out for you, or what you’ll remember, and, as always, be specific.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Review scores: </strong>I’ll end on an easy one, and I know this isn’t always in a writer’s hands. These are ridiculous and do nothing but serve as a <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-part-2-s-metacritic-page-shows-how-broke-1844106265" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">siren</a> for the worst kind of readers.

			<p>Almost immediately after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-a-smash-hit-says-analyst-high-retail-prices-are-meant-to-drive-digital-sales/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> direct had players excited about the new device and the new games revealed, a dark cloud took shape above that excitement with Donald Trump's announcement of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2s-price-could-go-even-higher-due-to-trumps-tariffs/">steep tariffs</a> imposed on countries around the world.</p>
<p>In the time since, there's been plenty of speculation as to how these tariffs will impact the cost of the console<span>. Nintendo even&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed pre-orders for the console in the United States</a> from the original April 9, 2025 date&nbsp;</span>to "<em>assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions.</em>"</p>
<p>That delay will now also impact Canada, as Nintendo confirmed to Canadian publication <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/04/08/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-canada-delay/">MobileSyrup</a> that pre-orders for the console have been delayed in Canada "<em>in order to align with the timing of pre-orders to be determined in the U.S.,</em>" the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>"<em>Nintendo will provide updated information at a later date,</em>" the statement continued. "<em>The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged</em>."</p>
<p>It's unfortunate news for Canadians who thought they might've avoided the delay that their southern neighbors are dealing with, especially considering that they are only hearing it a day before pre-orders were meant to go live.</p>
<p>The fate of Canadian gamers' Nintendo Switch 2 pre-order hopes is now tied to that of United States gamers, whether they like it or not. In this case, it's safe to assume not.</p>

			<p>The PvPvE extraction RPG game from Wolcen Studio, currently known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-pantheon-qa-a-post-apocalyptic-fantasy-extraction-arpg-from-the-makers-of-wolcen/">Project Pantheon</a>, just got a new teaser trailer revealed along with the announcement that Wolcen Studio is hosting a second closed alpha test that interested players can now sign up for.</p>
<p>The test will only last for a little less than a day, beginning on <strong>Friday, April 25, 2025 at 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm BT</strong> and ending the next day on&nbsp;<strong>Saturday, April 26 at 2:59pm PT / 5:59pm ET / 10:59pm BT.&nbsp;</strong>Those interested in joining the closed alpha to get an early taste of Project Pantheon can <a href="https://pantheon.firstlook.gg/">sign up for the play test at this link</a>.</p>
<p>If you already participated in the first closed-alpha test for Project Pantheon, you don't have to worry about signing up for this new one. You'll automatically be granted access to it. For everyone else, all you need to do is make sure to register your interest in the play test before <strong>April 22, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>There's a number of new features that play testers will be able to check out, including the player sanctuary now being a "<em>fully 3D navigable hub where players can customize gear, track achievements, and craft runes</em>," the studio says in a press release.</p>
<p>There's also a new dodge roll mechanic, new weapon and gear customizations, new weapons like a new magic weapon simply called "<em>The Staff</em>," new dungeons, a new monster faction to fight in t<span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">he Hamförir, and a structured gameplay tutorial to help newcomers get the hang of things.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Of course, there's also a slew of bug fixes<span>&nbsp;and new quality-of-life improvements. For example, a revamped health and shield system, abilities adjusted to feel&nbsp;<em>"snappier,</em>" according to Wolcen Studio, and the overall movement system </span>improved.</p>
<p>If you miss out on this closed alpha, Wolcen Studio currently has two more planned for Project Pantheon after this. The third closed alpha test will arrive sometime in summer 2025, with the fourth coming a bit later in the year in autumn.</p>

You know, I'm going to be very real with you right now: I thought <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-rumble">Sonic Rumble</a> was already out. It feels like I've been hearing about this thing for an eon now, probably because it was leaked a good while before Sega even officially revealed it. And yet here we are, with an announcement from the house of hog (sorry) saying that in actual fact, it's not out until May 8th, exactly a month from now! Perhaps this is a sign that I'm losing track of time, perhaps this is a game that Sega has been cooking in the kitchen for a bit too long. Who's to say!
</p>

<p>
This one's obviously a lot more geared towards kids that say to their parents "can you put Sonic on your phone" given that it'll be available on iOS and Android, but even though it does appear to be skipping out on a console release, it is coming to PC via Steam.

The skins-inclined amongst you - I appreciate this is the worst possible way to put this - might be interested to know that <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/special/register/en/?referrer=singular_click_id%3Ddb045d06-e0f8-4d7d-8de3-69c167c330d2">the more wishlists there are</a>, the more goodies you get when the game arrives, like a movie Sonic skin, who honestly looks a bit terrifying.
</p>
<p>
I'm not easily won over by free-to-play games all that much, though I do think the kind of toy vibe Sonic Rumble has is cute. It looks like it's being quite smart about how it folds in that general Sonic feel to its more <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a>-esque levels too. Seriously though, I like movie Sonic's design, but there's something not right about the Sonic Rumble skin…

<p>When asked about the sequel in a recent interview, the director of ‘A Minecraft Movie’ stated, “It seems like there’s already talk about it.”&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-a-minecraft-movie-director-would-have-a-blast-making-the-sequel-nbsp">A Minecraft Movie Director Would Have a ‘Blast’ Making the Sequel &nbsp;</h2>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/minecraft-movie-sequel-plans-director-jared-hess-jack-black-jason-momoa-1236362421/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/live-action-movies/minecraft-movie-director-says-sequel-will-without-a-doubt-feature-fan-favorite-character-alex-alongside-jack-blacks-steve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Minecraft Movie director Jared Hess was asked how he would deal with a sequel for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-mine-craft-movie-biggest-ever-video-game-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest-ever opening-day video game movie</a>. Hess stated that the team enjoyed creating this movie; however, the game world is so expansive that “there were so many things” they couldn’t tap into.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hess added that he “would have a blast doing the sequel” for the Minecraft movie before stating that he is excited because “it seems like there’s already talk about it happening.” The director added that it would be a lot of fun to dive back into this world, and the audience is also seemingly going ”wild” for their post-credits scene, which hints towards a potential sequel.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-a-minecraft-movie-sequel-will-feature-the-newly-teased-character">A Minecraft Movie Sequel Will Feature the Newly Teased Character</h2>

<p>The road to Room 46 is reached through one of several gaming platforms. Two of them are the PlayStation and Xbox, and we’re here today to let you know if Blue Prince’s journey can be explored as part of an Xbox Game Pass or PS Plus subscription.</p>



<p>Blue Prince is a game that wasn’t known by many at one point, but loved by those who did. It topped many early GOTY lists, and now that reviews are in, its Metacritic score is cause for some serious eyebrow raising. As of April 2025, Blue Prince is the highest-rated game of the year ahead of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-2-hardcore-mode-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-split-fiction-laser-hell-secret-level/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a>.</p>



<p>Its mind-bending series of rooms and puzzles is cause for serious applause. It revolutionized the roguelike genre—like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gdc-awards-balatro-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Balatro</a> did in 2024—to create a masterpiece. I don’t blame you if you’re eager not to miss out, so let’s check its Game Pass and PS Plus status. </p>

<p><strong>Blue Prince is a day-one addition to Microsoft’s extensive Xbox Game Pass catalog.</strong></p>



<p>Get ready to play Blue Prince if you have the correct Xbox Game Pass Membership. It’s an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-wave-1-titles-for-april-2025-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">April Game Pass 2025 addition</a>, and the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/blue-prince/9PFRTPRQ569Q?msockid=18c366288f2166303b0f72118e066724" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Store game page</a> quite clearly states: “Get Game Pass—Coming soon to Ultimate.” </p>



<p>As long as your subscription is active and ready to go, you can start tearing through rooms in a bid to find the elusive Room 46.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://x.com/dogubomb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Blue Prince X page</a> had this to say on February 24: “The secret is out!

                <p>One of the developers behind the long-awaited <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> has clarified that the indie Metroidvania will launch on both Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 when it finally does come out.</p><p>Because we've waited so long for this game and most recently saw it in a Switch 2 presentation, that can make one wonder if Hollow Knight: Silksong is now a Switch 2 exclusive. "Just to clarify...Hollow Knight: Silksong is coming to both Nintendo Switch AND the Nintendo Switch 2," Matthew Griffin, a member of Team Cherry's marketing and publishing team, <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1909395467945099502" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">explained on X</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv0f8mYemL4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rv0f8mYemL4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is infamous due to the long gap between its announcement and release. Developer Team Cherry first revealed the sequel to Hollow Knight at E3 2019 and even showed off extended gameplay during a Nintendo livestream. The game then disappeared for years before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-day-one/1100-6504333/" data-ref-id="1100-6504333">reappearing at Microsoft's 2022 Xbox Games Showcase</a>, where it was teased that it'd be out within the year. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-has-been-delayed/1100-6513963/" data-ref-id="1100-6513963">That didn't end up happening</a>.</p><p>We did not see Hollow Knight: Silksong in action again until April's Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, when it briefly appeared in a third-party sizzle reel with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-releasing-this-year-according-to-nintendo-switch-2-direct/1100-6530562/" data-ref-id="1100-6530562">2025 release window</a>. That all seems to suggest that we'll finally get our hands on Hollow Knight: Silksong this year, and Nintendo system owners will be able to pick which version of it they want to play.</p><p>Thankfully, Hollow Knight: Silksong won't be a console exclusive. It is currently slated to be released sometime later this year on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo consoles.</p>

The appeal of UVW-CWA is that you simply pay your dues to receive your membership, but that's merely the first step on a larger journey towards seizing control of your own fate.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This is a moment by and for all of us," says KB. "We've been answering a lot of questions such as 'what do I get by joining?' This movement is just beginning. If you think of IATSE and SAG-AFTRA—those unions have been around for hundreds of years. So if you think of this as the beginning of an industry-wide movement, you get to decide and vote on what we do and how our funds are used."</span></p><p>CWA union members begin a rally in Moscone West at GDC 2025 / Image via Game Developer</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Right now, UVW-CWA is focused on protecting workers from the encroachment of generative AI and the corporate sledgehammer of mass layoffs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you're wondering just how prevalent the latter issue has become, one organizing committee member explains that, during their founding meeting, every single person in the room had either been impacted directly by layoffs or knew someone who had.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/unity-promises-to-deliver-battle-tested-switch-2-support" target="_self" data-discover="true">Unity promises to deliver 'battle-tested' Switch 2 support</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The emotion [in that room] was so palpable," they explain. "The sadness. The anger. The compassion. It's very clear that's the galvanizing issue. Everything else kind of flowed downstream from it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those sat around me believe fighting back means convincing others that collective power can overwhelm even the largest corporation—who they feel have grown far too accustomed to exploiting a workforce that has accepted a false status quo.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The real point of this movement is to engage people and to get them to understand that we have way more power than any corporation will ever have," says Yao. "These are issues that are deeply rooted in human dignity and self respect, and we are told so often to put that all aside for your career. I believe that is a false dichotomy. You can have both and you should have both. We are trying to teach people that you deserve both."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's a sense within the group that corporate leaders across the industry view video games as shimmering golden goose. That might go some way to explaining the growing disconnect between the developers pouring their hearts and souls into their work and those cutting their paychecks.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/-we-ll-be-showing-them-just-how-valuable-our-labor-is-zenimax-workers-vote-to-authorize-strike-at-microsoft" target="_self" data-discover="true">Update: Microsoft claims it has made 'fair' proposals to union workers after Zenimax staff authorize strike</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The C-suite, at least in my experience, are not from the industry," explains Ray, a unionized worker at Sega of America. "They don't have a background in gaming. They often come from different industries, but they see the video game industry as this huge cash grab."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It a sentiment that others around the table share. Ostrander notes how studios are frequently bought by private equity and "squeezed for all they're worth"—but also feels there can sometimes be issues at smaller, indie studios, where some bosses might be laboring under the auteur delusion. He reiterates all workers—at every level—make valuable contributions when bringing a project to market. So why are some still struggling to get the recognition they deserve?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We want those workers to feel empowered as well—and not to be pushed around by bosses who think they have better taste," he adds.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Union members fear their passion and creativity is being 'crushed and destroyed'">Union members fear their passion and creativity is being 'crushed and destroyed'</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The fight for recognition and better conditions has also been hampered by union busting. When workers begin to organize, it's not uncommon for employers to undermine their attempts by deploying a litany of well-worn tactics.&nbsp;I'm told the playbook often includes misclassifying people who should be full-time workers as contractors to limit their rights, jettisoning large groups of employees post-launch to halt any organization attempts in their tracks, or siloing remote workers to prevent them from communicating with their colleagues and presenting a united front. It can make the fight harder, but not impossible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One member explains the CWA is now adept at spotting union-busting in action and is more then prepared to push back. The alternative to fighting—at least, for those sat around me—isn't worth thinking about.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We can see where [the game industry] is going to go [without unions]," explains Taylor Welling, OneBGS union member and organizer at Bethesda Game Studios. "Replacing employees with AI. Replacing employees with outsourcing. Treating employees poorly. It's really heading towards an unpleasant working experience for workers."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yao agrees. "I've already seen where this is heading within the multiple workplaces, where all the passion and creativity that goes into these games is just being crushed and destroyed," he explains. "We are experiencing burnout at an unprecedented rate—and the answer I keep hearing is 'stop caring about what you do.' We don't get into this industry because we don't care about video games. We absolutely care about this art form. So, to tell me the only way I can survive and have a career is to turn that side of my brain off and to stop caring about the art that I'm working on and the people I'm working with—that's impossible."</span></p><p>A digital version of the UVW-CWA informational zine handed out at GDC 2025 / Image via UVW-CWA</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The passion and empathy is palpable. There is also steely resolve and iron-clad determination forged in the fires of an industry that appears to believe its talented workforce is disposable. An asset to be depleted and discarded without mercy. Can unions provide a quick fix? No. This skirmish has been raging for years. In what feels like a battle for the very soul of the industry, it seems they do offer something in abundance: hope.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[I hope unions] can usher in a future where we don't look around and wonder where all of our older mentors have gone. Where we don't look around and wonder where all of the younger interns have gone, because it's an industry that's incompatible with having a family or taking care of a loved one when they're in the hospital," says Ostrander.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[I hope it becomes] an industry that's sustainable. One that reflects the people who play our games. Gaming is an incredibly diverse space. The appeal of games [is] wide and spans every walk of lives, and the people who reflect the games should reflect that diversity."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yao envisions future where people can expect a career that spans decades instead of "five years at the best." The outpouring from those around me continues. How about a future full of worker cooperatives? Full of people who have benefits? The security of full-time roles? These are all concrete things unions are collectively driving towards. For those still on the fence, one member poses a very simple question: are you satisfied with where you're at now?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's not going to get better if you do not do something about it," says KB.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ostrander feels the recent onslaught of layoffs and studio closures has underscored the risk of simply doing nothing. So does Yao, who explains devs were told to "survive until '25" only to arrive and realize the industry is still capitulating. "It's no longer about surviving," he says. "It's about taking the reins and making the change ourselves."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Welling, there is now only one way forward. "Nobody with power is going to just turn around and become benevolent and start taking care of you in the way that you really need them to," she adds. "The only way to get that is to use your own power and collectively work with other people to demand to be treated like humans."&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

Every now and then I abandon all of my responsibilities and go for a walk in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/book-of-travels">Book Of Travels</a>, a “tiny MMO” from Might And Delight. While a bit Orientalist in ways I’m still unravelling for myself, it’s one of the loveliest video game spaces I’ve ever inhabited: huge, picturebook horizons, molten shades of greenery, tiny wanderers keeping pace with beautifully combed clouds.</p>
<p>Might And Delight’s just-announced “cosy decoration game” Twinkleby doesn’t have quite the same magic, so far – it’s less mysterious, more wholesome. But I do enjoy its focus on antique dollhouses. Here’s a trailer.

In Twinkleby, you build cutaway houses on floating islands and decorate them with furnishings such as sofas and lamp posts. In the process, you’ll attract vagrant bobble-head people, who will arrive in astral sailboats and make requests you can fulfil for additional rewards. It reminds me of how you'd turn wild creatures into residents in Viva Pinata.</p>
<p>The campaign is a procession of these breezy pastelcore asteroid conversions, with map fragments to discover that unlock hidden islands. You can also collect shooting stars and spend them at a place called Molligan’s Antiques, which I’m hoping will turn out to be a proper vintage toy emporium born of some designer’s extra-curricular obsessions. There are, needless to say, no lose conditions and no game-overs: this is about tricking out dioramas as you please.
</p>
<p>
Every “wholesome” game needs its undercurrent of darkness, especially when the name has you picturing some kind of gerbil butler. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a> has the concept of a mortgage; Twinkleby has the option of throwing everything and everybody away like a spoilt child. Just lob anything you're displeased with over the side of the island and it'll return to your inventory.</p>
<p>“Expand your collection, discover antique secrets, decorate, and when you change your mind – evict everyone and throw their furniture into space!” sings <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3362960/Twinkleby/">the Steam page</a>. The jarring choice of "evict" here makes me suspect that Twinkleby is some kind of Molleindustria black op. Perhaps the bobblehead people will eventually form a co-operative and depose you.
</p>
<p>
Look out for Twinkleby sometime in 2025. The only thing I outright dislike about the game so far is the familiar choice of sound effect when you place objects – that delicate "kiss pop" which, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/islanders-new-shores-is-the-follow-up-to-2019s-gentlest-town-builder">as I noted in my write-up of Islanders: New Shores</a>, has become ubiquitous in cosy building games, and which I now find repulsive for its dopamine-milking inoffensiveness. 
</p>
<p>
I didn’t know it was possible to feel patronised by a sound effect. It reminds me of those automated doors in The Hitchhiker’s Guide that were made sentient specifically so that they could sigh in satisfaction when you walk through them. We need a next gen of “kiss pop”, cosy game developers. Musical fart noises? The clattering of actual dollhouse furnishings?
