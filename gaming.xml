            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												
			<p>Elder Scrolls 6 release date</p>		</div><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Bethesda Game Studio’s Todd Howard has stated that The Elder Scrolls 6 is &nbsp;“still a long way off” despite being announced at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/06/11/the-elder-scrolls-vi-and-starfield-announced-by-bethesda/">&nbsp;E3 2018</a>.&nbsp; Before that announcement <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/13/dont-expect-to-see-the-elder-scrolls-6-any-time-soon/">we noted that</a> “we probably won’t see a new Elder Scrolls until the 2020’s” which seemed outrageous at the time but now appears to be a conservative estimate.</p>
<p>“I’m preaching patience,” explains Todd, “I don’t want fans to feel anxious.”&nbsp; So there you go, do not get your hopes up for a good three or four years at least and you will be fine.&nbsp; “I think it’s good for an audience to have a break – The Elder Scroll<em>s</em> has been too long, let’s be clear,” he adds, “But we wanted to do something new with Starfield. We needed a creative reset.”</p>


<p>Todd also hinted that The Elder Scrolls 6 may arrive with no advertising or pre-sales. When asked about the<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/22/the-elders-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-has-been-announced-and-its-out-today/"> surprise release of the Oblivion remaster</a> and if something similar could happen to The Elder Scrolls 6, Todd commented, “You might say that was a test run. It worked out well.”</p>
<p>When Microsoft bought Bethesda, a document leaked that showed that neither Starfield, Redfall, or The Elder Scrolls 6 would come to PlayStation. Despite Xbox juggernauts Forza and Halo landing on the Sony console, this image is still holds true with no sign of Starfield or Redfall on PS5. The remaster of Oblivion, a Bethesda game, did make it onto PlayStation 5, but that was developed outside of Bethesda’s main studio</p>


<p>No details for The Elder Scrolls 6 have been revealed, just the fancy and completely CGI trailer that probably won’t bare any resemblance to the game when it’s finally released near the end of this decade. Maybe. It’s quite nice to look at so maybe watch it one more time and then forget about it for a while.</p>

Reimagined is faithful in some respects, but <a href="https://press.na.square-enix.com/DRAGON-QUEST-VII-REIMAGINED-A-BOLD-NEW-REMAKE-OF-THE-RPG-CLASSIC-LAUNC">Square Enix has been very clear</a> that it's meant to be a more streamlined way to play through the 100-plus-hour story of Dragon Quest VII, and it does so by streamlining the main scenario to take considerably less time to complete.&nbsp;</p><p>The team is also doing some interesting things in combat to bring the play clock down a bit, but for this feature, let's dive into how Square Enix is reshaping the story of Dragon Quest VII to be more digestible. Contrary to what you might think, the Reimagined team didn't start by figuring out what to cut.&nbsp;</p><h3>Streamlining</h3>

<p>"We didn't really have specific discussions about which parts we wanted to remove from the game," Reimagined lead scenario writer Sayaka Takagi tells me within Square Enix's Shibuya, Tokyo, offices, a day after I played through roughly two hours of this remake. "We actually never had any discussions, or like proactive discussions at least, about which parts we wanted to remove from the game, but we did have an extensive discussion about which parts we wanted to keep in the Reimagined version."</p><p>Takagi says one of the big themes of Dragon Quest VII's story is how it depicts these characters – like Hero, Prince Kiefer, Aishe, Maribel, Ruff, and Sir Mervyn – as facing significant adversity. "But another core theme of the story is that it also portrays the humanity of people in its characters, so with these two core elements in mind, we tried to understand all the essential stories of Dragon Quest VII that we wanted to keep."&nbsp;</p><p>If you haven't played a Dragon Quest VII version before, the game certainly has an overarching story, but it's divided into subplots or arcs, if you will. Those "essential stories" Takagi is referring to are the game's various arcs and how they weave in and out of the main story. With this in mind, Takagi and the team asked other staff members developing the game and throughout Square Enix to lay out their ideas, favorite story moments, and more. "There were a lot of people saying, 'When I was playing this as a kid, I didn't really understand what the story was,' or, 'I don't really understand what the themes are, but for some reason, it's stuck in my head because it's very memorable,'" Takagi says. "So we laid out a lot of them, a lot of these story moments that fit this description, that criteria, and worked toward keeping those stories in the Reimagined version."</p>

<p>She adds that in this process, the team also identified many story moments that didn't align with Square Enix's vision for Reimagined. Narratively, that vision includes giving players some choice in determining how they tackle the story of Dragon Quest VII. In the original release, the island-hopping story is quite linear, but in Reimagined, players have some options to shape which direction they go.&nbsp;</p><p>"They get to choose which island they want to go to next, and in the original release, it wasn't really like that; the story moments were dependent on the order," Takagi adds. "[Because of the original's fixed story order], some of the story moments didn't make sense if we were to keep that in Reimagined [...] because in the Reimagined version, we allow players to choose which story they want to move forward with." Those story moments that didn't make sense were lowered in priority and eventually cut from Reimagined.&nbsp;</p><p>Players can actually see <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive/2025/11/04/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-will-have-a-new-never-before-seen-conclusion">a new, never-before-seen conclusion</a> as a result of these new choices present within Reimagined's scenario, too.&nbsp;</p><h3>Rebuilding</h3>

<p>All this said, Square Enix tells me the core of Dragon Quest VII's story remains intact in Reimagined. In fact, Takagi says the scenario is the one piece of Reimagined that wasn't built from the ground up.&nbsp;</p><p>"While our goal was to reimagine everything and revamp everything from the ground up, [...] it was never our intention to put forth significant changes to the story from the original work," she says. "Obviously, we wanted to respect and honor the original work, and we wanted to kind of maximize how amazing it was. So yeah, we remade everything from the ground up, but as for the story, it was more like rebuilding, taking it piece by piece. We never started from zero."&nbsp;</p><p>I ask if that means putting the original script on a desk and taking what the team likes and leaving behind what it doesn't, to which Takagi says no. "It wasn't really like putting the original dialogue or original scenario side-by-side and going off of that," she says. "What we did was we started with the overview of the plot – the shorter version of the entire scenario of Dragon Quest VII – and laid out some ideas of what we could do to make the story more interesting."</p><p>She says it was like creating a puzzle that the team then had to build, and it did so by switching up the order of story sequences, rewriting dialogue, reshaping plot points, and more. Each time it made a change —like switching the order of a story sequence — it required the team to examine how that affected dialogue and other aspects of the scenario, which led to cascading adjustments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I try throughout this conversation to get some specifics, but Square Enix largely keeps its cards close to its chest.

              <p><span>There aren’t many games I recommend as wholeheartedly as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/before-your-eyes-steam-sale-pc-psvr2-mobile-netflix-1851411401"><span>2021’s </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes</span></i></a><span>. GoodbyeWorld Games’ brisk, beautiful narrative adventure game is a devastating, cathartic, and clever project that rolls a lifetime’s worth of ups and downs into its quick 90-minute play time. Its eye-tracking control scheme is one of the most meaningfully frustrating ones I’ve experienced, as it skips through entire segments of its story every time your webcam sees you blink. </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe</span></i><span>, the follow-up from Nice Dream Games, extrapolates this idea into a 3-and-a-half-hour experience, and it feels like turning a really tight Pixar short into a feature film, for good and ill.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>has the same sentimentality running through its veins that made </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes </span></i><span>an incredibly heartwarming story despite the tragedy at its center, but it’s far less introspective. The new release</span> <span>is the story of a baby named Isaac who, somehow, has adult-level intelligence, though he can’t communicate that to his frazzled mother, spritely sister, and suspiciously chill father. But because he has an adult’s intuition, he can observe all the chaos of their lives and try his best to be a helpful son and brother. Sometimes that takes the form of just being a chill baby who isn’t causing trouble; at other times, he gets a bit more hands-on. What can a baby who can barely crawl do as his family navigates all their adult bullshit? A lot, actually, because Isaac has psychic powers.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642518" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642518"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642518">© Nice Dream Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Where </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes </span></i><span>was entirely built around eye-tracking tech as a bit of narrative design, </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe</span></i><span>’s implementation of a webcam is far more mechanical in the traditional sense. Blinking activates Isaac’s psychic abilities in a way that often changes depending on the situation. It can shut down machinery, help you clean up a mess in your bedroom, and if you close your eyes and turn your head, you can listen in on your family’s worried thoughts. In this game, blinking is basically an extra button that certainly still feels novel, but it’s not quite as effective in what it communicates. </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes </span></i><span>made an entire mechanic out of “blink and you’ll miss it,” but when </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>uses the same webcam-based control scheme, it feels like something that could have just as easily been communicated by pressing a different button on your controller. In a way, it feels more like a reference to the team’s previous history than it does something truly integrated into everything </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>seeks to explore.</span></p>

 <p><span>Some of the later game sequences, in which </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>sheds some of its focus on its supernatural family story in favor of some surprisingly dark science fiction and espionage twists, have you blinking as Isaac navigates mazes of obstacles and threats to his safety, and the game registers these inputs based on where your cursor is if you’re playing with a mouse and keyboard. I played through all of </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>with headphones to listen in on my family’s thoughts and a webcam to blink my psychic will onto the world around me, but in its effort to stretch out </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes</span></i><span>’ concise ideas into something longer,&nbsp; </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>fails to develop as strong of a grasp on why it’s implementing these ideas, beyond the team wanting this approach to gameplay to feel like a signature facet of their work.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642520" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642520"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642520">© Nice Dream Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>I don’t want to keep comparing </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>to </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes</span></i><span>, but the contrast between the two is one of the most interesting things about Isaac’s journey. It’s about twice as long, but doesn’t feel like it overstays its welcome, even if it’s lacking the same singular vision. The game’s psychic set pieces are more mechanical, but they’re doused in a childlike mischief and naivete that is delightful, and that makes the moments when reality intervenes as devastating as any slap on the wrist you received as a kid. Despite Isaac’s adult-level intellect and grown-ass voiceover from </span><i><span>Thunderbolts</span></i><span>*</span> <span>actor Lewis Pullman, </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>hits at childhood shame, embarrassment, and familial resentment like they’re all raw nerves. Then it gradually becomes about so many other things that even gesturing at its many twists and turns risks spoiling it entirely.</span></p> <p><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>runs with every idea it has with a childlike confidence, but it’s also such a different story by the end than it is at the start that I wouldn’t be surprised if people find that one half of its tale resonates with them, while the other falls flat. When it’s at its best, it feels like being cradled and read your favorite story; then come moments when it’s as if the reader got bored with one story and picked up an altogether different one. What it lacks in focus, it makes up for in a heartwarming message at the end, but it’s a bit of a rollercoaster getting there. At least it’s worth riding for the highs.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/vivi-ornitier-cauldron-ban-mtg-final-fantasy-2000642504</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-9%E2%80%98s-vivi-has-finally-been-banned-from-magic-the-gathering.1349158/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Vivi is a small and unassuming Black Mage caught in an existential crisis in<em>&nbsp;Final Fantasy IX</em> and an absolute wrecking ball <a href="https://kotaku.com/even-more-gorgeous-final-fantasy-mtg-cards-are-coming-and-theyre-already-selling-out-again-2000630364">in <em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>. The clever, lovable riff on a classic RPG archetype was responsible for what many considered the most busted deck in the card game’s current format. Fans have been waiting for him to be banned from Edge of Eternities Standard for months. Today, it finally happened.</p>

 <p>Wizards of the Coast <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/banned-and-restricted-november-10-2025">revealed</a> its updated banned and restricted list on November 10 as promised and, sure enough, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/248/vivi-ornitier">Vivi Ornitier</a> was on it. The 0/3 Wizard gets a +1/+1 counter and deals 1 damage to each opponent every time you cast a noncreature spell, but that’s not all. Once per turn, players also get to use Vivi to generate red and blue mana equal to his power.</p>

 <p>At just three mana to play, Vivi’s a very powerful, very versatile card. Pair it with <a href="https://aetherhub.com/Metagame/Traditional-Standard/Deck/ur-soul-cauldron-1348701">Agatha’s Soul Cauldron</a>, which stacks more +1/+1 counters and gives creatures access to all exiled creatures’ abilities, and you have a recipe for the most dominant and annoying deck of the year.</p>

 <p>“God, Vivi-Cauldron decks make for miserable games,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1nbwgh6/rant_god_vivicauldron_decks_make_for_miserable/">wrote</a> one player months ago. “The worst part are repetitive, monotonous play patterns and waiting for my opponent to take 5-minute turns when they had lethal on board after 30 seconds.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/uJVLmvNVp3">https://t.co/uJVLmvNVp3</a> <a href="https://t.co/bADvMaFx4u">pic.twitter.com/bADvMaFx4u</a></p> <p>— Dr. Perplexed (@drperplexed) <a href="https://twitter.com/drperplexed/status/1987959578399535473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>As a result, Vivi Cauldron was dominating top-deck lists and driving up the prices of the relevant cards to ridiculous post-launch levels. Some players were looking at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1mj8va3/the_vivi_cauldron_deck_is_8001000_in_paper/">prices of over $400</a> to build competitive decks with Vivi Ornitier, only falling <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/631015/magic-final-fantasy-vivi-ornitier?srsltid=AfmBOooPpIF-JpPxhFkm4z1dPrbgI3gTepv91SKyFS8973Cjz2PhqdFp">below $30 apiece</a> once the autumn hit. Things got so bad in competitive <em>MtG </em>that Wizards of the Coast stepped in back in September to try and quell frustrations.</p>

 <p>“With the results of the latest Spotlight Series arriving on the heels of several high-profile Standard events, the conversation around the cards <span data-missing-image="false" data-auto-card-v="3.0.7" data-card-name="Vivi Ornitier" data-card-identifier="vivi-ornitier">Vivi Ornitier</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span data-missing-image="false" data-auto-card-v="3.0.7" data-card-name="Agatha's Soul Cauldron" data-card-identifier="agathas-soul-cauldron">Agatha’s Soul Cauldron</span>, and speculations on ’emergency’&nbsp; bans in Standard, we thought now would be a good time to check in,” read a <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/standard-and-moving-ban-announcement">blog post from September</a>.</p>

 <p>While Wizards didn’t act then, it took the unusual step of bumping up its normal ban date by two weeks and promised a stricter crackdown on broken cards in 2026. The saga of Vivi Ornitier, while great for <em>Final Fantasy</em> fans happy to see one of the series’ unsung heroes shine, reinforced skepticism that many <em>MtG</em> players have had for <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313">the Beyond Universes sets,</a> which some feel prioritize flashy fan service at the expense of obvious power creep.</p> <p>“To open up the Standard format for innovation and a wider variety of decks, it’s clear we need to disrupt the <span data-missing-image="false" data-auto-card-v="3.0.7" data-card-name="Vivi Ornitier" data-card-identifier="vivi-ornitier">Vivi Ornitier</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span data-missing-image="false" data-auto-card-v="3.0.7" data-card-name="Agatha's Soul Cauldron" data-card-identifier="agathas-soul-cauldron">Agatha’s Soul Cauldron</span> combo,” Wizards wrote in today’s banned card update. “That interaction is too much stronger than the rest of the format. We are opting to ban Vivi Ornitier as it is the card that’s more likely to create future balance problems if allowed to remain in the format. We believe Standard will be more fun and diverse without Vivi Ornitier in it.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new mode for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, called Endgame, has been revealed by Activision. The open-world mode, which will unlock after completing the campaign, furthers the multiplayer experience.</p>



<p>With Black Ops 7, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-trailer-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer is the main focus</a>. Its campaign, playable solo or co-op, does differ from previous entries, but it plans to expand on the narrative of Black Ops 2 and the Mason family. Despite returning to the somewhat-controversial futuristic settings of past games, it’s still poised to be one of 2025’s biggest titles. Ahead of its November 14th release, the team has revealed a new mode that plans to expand the narrative after the credits roll.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-s-endgame-mode-unlocks-after-campaign-goes-open-world">Black Ops 7’s Endgame Mode Unlocks After Campaign, Goes Open-World</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a Dev Talk, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign-endgame#PvE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">as well as a blog</a>, Activision has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-endgame-details-coming-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally announced</a> that a new launch mode will be available for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. Titled Endgame, it’s unlocked after players complete the 11 main missions in the base campaign. In the mode, you and up to three other players will be dropped onto an island called Avalon and take on various objectives. </p>



<p>The mode will allow for up to 32 players to one map and be divided into four sections, each with various recommended levels. You get to choose between four Operator classes and customize your loadout before dropping. In addition, progress in the mode contributes to your overall ranking, unifying all modes for experience. More details about the mode can be found on the blog, linked here.</p>



<p>An open-world style of gameplay was tried before in Call of Duty with 2023’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/review-modern-warfare-3-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Warfare 3</a> to little praise. Still, it seems like the team is committed to delivering a great new experience for fans. If anything, it does encourage players to try out the campaign and get a cool reward for doing so. It’ll be interesting to see how it fares against the usual Multiplayer and Zombies modes and, if successful, return for future games.</p>



<p>What do you think about Endgame’s addition to Black Ops 7? Are you going to try it out at launch? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/seven-deadly-sins-origin-preview-its-a-whole-vibe-and-the-combats-not-bad-either</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seven-deadly-sins-origin-preview-its-a-whole-vibe-and-the-combat%E2%80%99s-not-bad-either.1349149/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sometimes, you go into a game not really knowing much about it. I knew exactly three things going into Seven Deadly Sins: Origin: one, it is based on the popular Seven Deadly Sins manga/anime; two, it is an action-RPG; and three, that I could play it on PC or PS5. I looked at it long enough to decide that it could be up my alley, and then dived into its closed beta test blind. And I’m happy I did. Seven Deadly Sins: Origin is an impressive game, even with its gacha mechanics, and I enjoyed hanging out in its world and spending time with its characters. Oh, and the combat? That’s not bad, either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seven Deadly Sins: Origin follows Prince Tristan of Liones and Tioreh. After stumbling upon a strange cave inside a tree (that’s not a typo), our heroes discover a mysterious pendant called the Book of Stars that seems to have mystical powers neither of them fully understand. When they emerge from the cave after a knock-down, drag-out brawl against a surprisingly large and hostile golem, our heroes discover that the world is a little different than when they left it. The topography’s changed, creatures that are supposed to be extinct are running around in living color, and Hawk – everyone’s favorite flying ham – was being chased by a dragon. He’s not really sure how he ended up here – he could have sworn he was in Purgatory – but he’s down to clown with Tristan and Tioreh while they figure out what’s going on. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, and this weird black corruption is springing up all over, long-dead heroes are showing up to cause problems, and there’s this mysterious scholar named Clotho who seems to know both everything about the Book of Stars, which can magically restore broken things, and where Tristan and Tioreh are going to be before they get there. Time travel shenanigans? Multiple timelines? Something funky’s going on, y’all, and our intrepid crew are going to get to the bottom of it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What sells The Vibe™ of Seven Deadly Sins: Origin is how it looks. It’s absolutely stunning.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The story here is fun (and very well-acted, though there was no English dub in the beta, so everything I heard was in Japanese), but what sells The Vibe™ of Seven Deadly Sins: Origin is how it looks. It’s absolutely stunning, but what impressed me most was how well-animated everything was. There’s a particularly great scene where Tristan is trying to hand over the Book of Stars, only to find it’s stuck to his hand, that had me rolling, but there’s a lot of really great moments here. Seven Deadly Sins: Origin has a story to tell, and you can tell its developers have taken that responsibility seriously.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s a solid action game here, too. Origin is an action-RPG at heart, and there’s meat on this combat’s bone. In addition to a standard defensive dash (the only way you’ll be blocking in Origin is with your face), each character comes with a standard combo, a couple of special attacks, and an ultimate that can range from calling in some fireballs to transforming into a demon. These distinctions are what gives each character flavor, and I really enjoyed playing around with them, whether I was buffing my standard fire attacks with Tioreh or using Howzer’s wind-based strikes, and everything in-between. And yes, characters like Diane are here, too. Just… smaller than you might figure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since each character’s abilities are associated with an element, it’s good to have a balanced team. You can have up to four characters traveling with you at once, and switch to them on the fly. Play your cards right, and they’ll even come in with an attack. The twist is that your whole team shares a health bar; there’s no switching characters when you’re running low on health to save the day.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is about managing your cooldowns, landing hits when you can, and most importantly, not getting hit. Origin is kind enough to show you where large attacks are going to be ahead of time, and smaller hits generally have enough windup so that you can get out of the way if you’re paying attention and not just mashing buttons. This isn’t Devil May Cry or Ninja Gaiden, but there’s some juice here, and combat feels good.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This isn’t Devil May Cry or Ninja Gaiden, but there’s some juice here, and combat feels good.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But it’s not all about hitting things with all manner of sharp and blunt objects. You can also collect materials in the world and use them to craft potions to keep you alive in a pinch, cook a delicious meal, or upgrade your characters with permanent stat buffs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a lot to explore. Soon after meeting Hawk, I could ride him around, and like seemingly every video game released since The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, you can climb on objects in the environment if you’ve got the stamina for it, and glide down from high places. All of this is good because the world of Britannia is absolutely massive. You can teleport around if you activate the fancy fast-travel stones scattered around the environment, but that means you gotta find ‘em first. So, you know, be prepared to do a little walking. Or pig-riding.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But spending time in the world means you’ll get to do Origin’s sidequests. They’re simple stuff, and, as you’d expect, not nearly as well-produced as the story beats, but I enjoyed trying to help out a crying kid and got a kick out of a castle worker who was so lazy that I had to deliver food for her. Stuff like that makes the world feel more lived in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If there’s one thing about Seven Deadly Sins: Origin that gives me pause, it’s the gacha-ness of it all. I’m inherently wary of gacha and other reward systems built on gambling, and Origin is one of those games. It seems fairly easy to get enough currency to roll the dice, but the beta throws currency at you, and it’s hard to get a sense of the economics of something when that happens. Whether or not that will be true in the full game remains to be seen. The UI also feels designed for a mouse and keyboard in a way that makes it awkward to navigate on a controller, especially when you’re managing a lot of gear. It’s not gamebreaking, but it’s something I wonder about when it comes to a full release.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I spent about five hours with Seven Deadly Sins: Origin, unlocking several characters, opening up the ability to party up with other players, and taking the main quest far enough that Tristan and Tioreh got to the point that they’d demonstrated enough skill to be trusted to head to the Fairy King Forest. That seemed like a natural place to stop, but before I did, I wanted to take on one of the beta’s optional bosses. In my case, it was a red demon who belched fire and had a thing for belly flops, and another weird looking thing with arms that were doubling as legs. I couldn’t beat either, mostly because I just wasn’t doing enough damage. My choices were clear: level up, get more gear, and play more gacha to Get My Numbers Up, but I opted out. I’d seen the fights, which were fun enough that I wanted to play them again if I jumped in at release, and I was tired of fiddling with the inventory screen. End on a high note.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sometimes, going into a game blind can be the best thing you can do for yourself. I enjoyed spending time in Seven Deadly Sins: Origin’s world, hanging out with its characters, and riding around a flying hog. And yeah, the fighting stuff part was pretty solid, too. I’m always wary of gacha elements in games, but the core of Seven Deadly Sins: Origin got my attention. The only question is whether it can hold it when it comes out next year. I wouldn’t mind a rematch with a couple of those bosses, but I’m not in a rush. They’ll be there when I return to Britannia.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/seven-deadly-sins-origin-preview-its-a-whole-vibe-and-the-combats-not-bad-either]]></content:encoded>

Team Cherry has previously shared a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-makes-the-game-easier/1100-6534577/" data-ref-id="1100-6534577" data-mce-href="/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-makes-the-game-easier/1100-6534577/">PC Patch to lower Silksong's difficulty</a>, but the game's newest update goes even further by nerfing the damned Muckmaggots that make things so difficult in Bilewater and the Putrified Ducts.</p><p>The Muckmaggots previously ate Hornet's silk with impunity, and even binding these creatures forced players to use what little silk they had to hold them back. The update makes it easier to clear out the Muckmaggots with the Wreath of Purity, which gives Hornet a chance to heal herself by using a second bind.</p><p>Silksong's Chinese translation has also been updated with fan-made translation by Team Cart Fit. Team Cherry <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/silksong-patch-4" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/silksong-patch-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">praised the new translation</a> by calling it "well-versed in the (quite dense) narrative and lore of both Hollow Knight games" and thanked the members of the team for letting the studio use it. The earlier Chinese translation drew criticisms from native Chinese speakers and led to the game being review-bombed.</p><p>Some of the other beneficial changes in the patch include the elimination of the same delivery in a row from couriers, as well as enabling rumble comparability with more controllers. However, the game is making Gurr the Outcast a little bit harder to fight by decreasing the time he stands unmoving.</p><p>The latest patch is currently only available for PC users, but Silksong players on consoles will get it in the near future. The complete patch notes are included below.</p><h2>Hollow Knight: Silksong Patch 4 (1.0.29242) Notes</h2><ul><li>Updated Simplified Chinese translation to use fan translation provided by Team Cart Fix.</li><li>Switched to Unity's Input System to improve overall controller support.

			<p>ARC Raiders continues to hit new heights of success for developer and publisher Embark Studios, which has confirmed that over the past weekend, across all available platforms, ARC Raiders surpassed 700K concurrent players.</p>



<p>Thanks to <a href="https://steamdb.info/">SteamDB</a>, we can get a look at any game's concurrent players to help gauge how it is doing popularity-wise and, to a lesser extent, sales. But neither PlayStation nor Xbox shares player numbers in the same way, so the number of players on console remains a mystery, for the most part.</p>



<p>So while we can't know exactly how many players ARC Raiders had on PlayStation and Xbox consoles over the weekend, looking at the SteamDB page for the game, we can see that most of those 700K came from PC, with <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/">a new peak of 462,488 players playing ARC Raiders on Steam alone just yesterday</a>.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey Raiders!<br>It's been a little over one week since we opened up the tunnels for you to head Topside, and this past weekend we reached over 700,000 concurrent Raiders on the surface! 🥳<br>We're so happy to have you all here!<br>The many different ways you play and participate in ARC… <a href="https://t.co/Do6bAhWf4o">pic.twitter.com/Do6bAhWf4o</a></p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1987930324156678210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It's another milestone for the game, which has <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sold-2-5-million-copies-in-debut-week/">reportedly already surpassed 2.5 million copies sold</a> (most of those, unsurprisingly, coming from Steam), and has not fallen below 100K concurrent players on Steam since it launched on October 30, 2025.</p>



<p>Now that it has definitively had a strong launch, the question becomes whether Embark Studios can turn the strong launch into a strong month, into a strong first year, and beyond. For now, ARC Raiders is having its moment in the spotlight in the gaming industry, but that won't mean much if the game isn't around in a couple of years.</p>



<p>Not that it's likely to disappear anytime soon. Embark Studios has already proven it knows how to make a multiplayer game people want to play and keep it going with The Finals, and ARC Raiders is having a bigger launch than The Finals. </p>



<p>Either way, it'll be interesting to see how ARC Raiders continues to evolve. Embark <a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-arc-raiders-2025-roadmap/">currently has the game roadmapped for the rest of 2025</a>, though there's nothing publicly on the schedule yet for 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Company Used Fake Reddit Posts To Advertise Game, Then Deleted The Evidence]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/trap-plan-marketing-astroturf-warrobots-fake-reddit-accounts-posts-2000642503</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/company-used-fake-reddit-posts-to-advertise-game-then-deleted-the-evidence.1349122/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Trap Plan, a large video game marketing company, admitted that it used multiple fake Reddit accounts to help promote a game called <em>WarRobots: Frontiers</em>, pretending to be “authentic” fans and players who just happened to discover the mech game and wanted to share it with others. Trap Plan has since deleted the post, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1ot0nvg/game_dev_admits_to_large_astroturfing_campaign_on/">but not before folks on Reddit spotted it.</a></p>

 <p>On November 9, <a href="https://www.trapplan.com/about-us">Trap Plan</a> CEO and “marketing expert” Pavel Beresnev posted a short article to the agency’s official website. The post, titled “How we promote <em>WarRobots: Frontiers</em> on Reddit,” goes into detail about how the agency used multiple Reddit accounts to create over 40 posts across multiple subreddits, including r/pcmasterrace and r/PlayStation5, to create “a wave of organic visibility before the next Twitch activation.”</p>

 <p>“The content varied from short clips and GIFs to&nbsp;‘I found this game…’ discovery-style posts,&nbsp;screenshot threads, and&nbsp;light discussion prompts about tactical mech combat and movement mechanics,” explained the CEO. “We avoided direct promotion and focused on&nbsp;native conversation formats. Players discussed the game naturally — asking questions, comparing it to&nbsp;<em>Titanfall</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>MechWarrior</em>, and sharing opinions about tactical mechanics.”</p>

 <p>According to Beresnev, in order to make the posts feel “authentic,” the team played the game, recorded footage, and posted about what they had played. “This created a steady stream of credible, varied content that matched Reddit’s organic tone,” said Beresnev.&nbsp; After sharing some stats about the campaign’s effectiveness, the CEO concluded the post by saying, “Most players didn’t even realize they were part of a marketing effort.”</p>

 <p>At some point in the last 24 hours, the post was seemingly <a href="https://www.trapplan.com/studios-cases/promo-campaign-on-reddit-for-for-warrobots-frontier">deleted from Trap Plan’s website.</a> If you try to read the Reddit marketing article now, it just takes you to a 404 page. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251110014044/https://www.trapplan.com/studios-cases/promo-campaign-on-reddit-for-for-warrobots-frontier">However, it was saved by someone via the Internet Archive</a>, allowing us to see the post as it appeared on Sunday.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted both Trap Plan and <em>WarRobots</em> developer My.Games about the post and the Reddit marketing strategy.</p> <p>As many pointed out on Reddit, this is far from the first time we’ve heard about a marketing agency or publisher using fake accounts to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13ti3e/mowing_the_astroturf/">create an astroturf campaign for a video game</a>. But it is odd to see a marketing agency’s CEO so publicly and directly confirm what was done and how it was done. It makes you wonder how many social media posts on sites like Reddit and Twitter are actually written by real fans and how many were trying to trick you into becoming part of a larger marketing campaign.</p> <p><em><strong>Update; 11/10/2025, 3:00 p.m. ET:&nbsp;</strong></em>In an email to <em>Kotaku</em>, Trap Plan CEO Pavel Beresnev explained that while the company did work with My.Games on a marketing campaign, “any Reddit-related activities” were handled “independently” by the marketing agency without approval from My.Games.</p> <blockquote> <p>Our intention was to experiment with a more organic way of promoting games on Reddit — without using bots or fake accounts — and to build a new case study we could use in the future. Unfortunately, when publishing the case study on our website, we wrongfully mentioned MY.GAMES and <em>War Robots: Frontiers</em>, which created a misleading impression that these activities were done on their behalf.</p>  <p>This was entirely our initiative and not commissioned or endorsed by MY.GAMES in any way. We understand this was a mistake and have since removed the case study. We sincerely apologize to MY.GAMES and the<em> War Robots: Frontiers</em> team for the misunderstanding and any confusion it may have caused.</p> </blockquote>

<p>In Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, you have the next CoD game, but also the continuation of the Black Ops saga. It allows Treyarch to flex its muscles once more, and if you can’t wait to play Black Ops 7, knowing its launch times is the perfect weapon.</p>



<p>Between a plethora of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-7-zombies-maps-survival-dead-ops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zombies</a> content, Black Ops 7’s fascinating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-endgame-details-coming-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endgame</a> content, and the usual year-long multiplayer madness, you’ve got a lot to keep you busy in BLOPS 7. The title neatly wraps up this mini-chapter in Call of Duty history, which can lead to a nice break for Treyarch as it works on its next entry.</p>



<p>For now, let’s enjoy Black Ops 7 and find out its launch times.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-black-ops-7-live">When Is Black Ops 7 Live?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Do the robot! Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Black Ops 7 first goes live at 9:00 PM PST on November 13.</strong></p>



<p>Whereas November 14 is considered the default release date for Black Ops 7, a small handful of areas technically get access on November 13—lucky you!</p>



<p>We know many of the launch times for key regions around the world. To make this easier, here’s a complete list showing you each highlighted region and what time and date Black Ops 7 is available there.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Timezone</th><th data-align="center">Black Ops 7 Launch Times &amp; Dates</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">PST</td><td data-align="center">9:00 PM-November 13</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CST</td><td data-align="center">11:00 PM-November 13</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">EST</td><td data-align="center">12:00 AM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">BRT</td><td data-align="center">2:00 AM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GMT</td><td data-align="center">5:00 AM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CET</td><td data-align="center">6:00 AM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">SAST</td><td data-align="center">7:00 AM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GST</td><td data-align="center">9:00 AM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">KST</td><td data-align="center">2:00 PM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">JST</td><td data-align="center">2:00 PM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">AEDT</td><td data-align="center">4:00 PM-November 14</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-black-ops-7-early">Can You Play Black Ops 7 Early?</h2>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, there is no early access for the Campaign, Zombies, or Multiplayer this year in Black Ops 7.</strong></p>



<p>There’s not much to add. There was initial speculation that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-campaign-zombies-release-early-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 Campaign and Zombies were set to release four days early.</a> However, while Activision didn’t address the speculation directly, the company covered the rumor by stating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-doesnt-have-early-access-activision-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 doesn’t have early access</a>—breaking all of our hearts in the process.</p>



<p>Still, there are only a few days to go now. As long as you have your referenced timezone on hand, you should know when the new Call of Duty goes live in your digital storefront. Furthermore, for more help on this, we also have an in-depth <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-preload-black-ops-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 preload guide</a>, showing you how to set this up and enable you to play the second Black Ops 7 drops!</p>



<p>It also covers the game’s excessive file sizes across all formats. We hope this and our other CoD guides are answering your biggest questions about the latest CoD release.

The short begins with Homer being given some useful exposition from resident <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">The Simpsons</a> scientist Professor Frink, until Homer turns the scientist into new version of Fortnite banana Peely (soon to be available as a skin to battle pass holders).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Homer causes a rain of giant donuts to fall down from the sky — something players will experience this coming week in-game — Springfield's residents turn against Homer. The second half of the short then seemingly sets up <em>next </em>week's Fortnite theme, where Homer manages to clone himself and somehow create a form of zombie army.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite plans to release a further two Simpsons shorts which will be available online or via Disney+ across the latter half of its Springfield mini-season, which is due to culminate in a big in-game live event on November 29.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Todd Howard isn’t a big fan of talking about his video games, but in a new interview he has discussed Fallout 4’s divisive dialogue system — and where he thinks it went wrong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> — which turns 10 today, November 10, alongside the release of an Anniversary Edition — broke away from what the post-apocalyptic role-playing game franchise had done in previous entries and gave the playable character a voice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only that, but Fallout 4 shifted the traditional first-person, zoomed in camera perspective for dialogue in favor of a dynamic, third-person camera perspective more in keeping with a cinematic, Mass Effect style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Fallout 4 dialogue is typically determined by a handful of short summaries, usually lining up with positive, inquisitive, sarcastic, and negative responses. It is not possible to select exact answers, and some players criticized the dialogue choices for not having a meaningful impact on the outcome of conversations, quests, or events either way.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Fallout 4 went on to become a hugely successful release for Bethesda, with 12 million copies shipped to retailers within the first 24 hours representing $750 million in revenue, Fallout fans never really warmed to its dialogue system, and indeed there are a number of mods available that make significant changes to it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in a new interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a> (the one where <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/im-preaching-patience-the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-warns-fans-teases-potential-shadowdrop">he reveals The Elder Scrolls 6 is still some way away</a>), Bethesda development chief Todd Howard singled out Fallout 4’s dialogue system as something from one of his games that failed to “resonate” with fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We spent forever on the dialogue system in Fallout 4,” Howard said. “How do we do an interactive conversation in an interesting way? How do we make that gamey? But it really did not resonate. It was also hard on our designers to write that way. Players want to role-play more and we had a voiced protagonist. The actors were phenomenal, but a lot of players were like, ‘That's not the voice I hear in my head.’”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Fallout Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It was telling that for 2023’s Starfield, Bethesda reverted to a silent protagonist with lines of dialogue the player could choose from and the first-person perspective seen in The Elder Scrolls games and pre-Fallout 4 entries in the Fallout series. It seems likely that Bethesda will leave Fallout 4’s dialogue system behind, so I don't expect to see it in the upcoming The Elder Scrolls 6, for example, or indeed Fallout 5, whenever it gets around to making that game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On a more positive note, Howard said he thinks Fallout 3 has the best opening of any game he’s worked on (I agree!), Starfield has the best gunplay and “gameplay in areas” (agree on the gunplay bit, not sure on the gameplay bit), while the varied landscape of Fallout 76 is “really good” (yep, I'll give him that). Skyrim is, “tonally and player agency-wise… really good,” Howard added, and I doubt anyone would argue with that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<p>Those additional options should be welcome news for fans looking for new ways to play PC games of a certain era. The PC Gaming Wiki <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/List_of_Direct3D_2-7_games">lists over 400 titles</a> written with the D3D7 APIs, and while most of those games were released between 2000 and 2004, a handful of new D3D7 games have continued to be released through 2022.</p>
<p>The D3D7 games list predictably includes a lot of licensed shovelware, but there are also well-remembered games like <em>Escape from Monkey Island</em>, <em>Arx Fatalis</em>, and the original <em>Hitman: Codename 47</em>. WinterSnowfall writes that the project was inspired by a desire to play games like <em>Sacrifice</em> and <em>Disciples II</em> on top of the existing dxvk framework.</p>
<p>Despite some <a href="https://github.com/WinterSnowfall/d7vk/issues">known issues with certain D3D7 titles</a>, WinterSnowfall writes that recent tuning means “things are now anywhere between decent to stellar in most of the supported games.” Still, the project author warns that the project will likely never reach full compatibility since “D3D7 is a land of highly cursed API interoperability.”</p>
<p>Don’t expect this project to expand to include support for even older DirectX APIs, either, WinterSnowfall warns. “D3D7 is enough of a challenge and a mess as it is,” the author writes. “The further we stray from D3D9, the further we stray from the divine.”</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-11-might-be-its-biggest-rework-yet/1100-6535476/" data-ref-id="1100-6535476">Diablo 4 Season 11</a> is bringing huge changes to Blizzard's ARPG, among them a major departure for how the game's map and Waypoints work.</p><p dir="ltr">Since launch, players of Diablo 4 every season have had to unlock most fast-travel Waypoints at the beginning of each new season. This was because discovering Waypoints and uncovering fog of war from the map was tied to Diablo 4's zone-based Renown system, which partially reset each season.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzBb0OsE0AY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fzBb0OsE0AY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Come Season 11, that will no longer be the case. In an interview with Diablo content creator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzBb0OsE0AY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DuQ</a>, lead live game designer Colin Finer said players who skip the campaign at the start of a new season will have all Waypoints unlocked. Skipping the campaign requires players to have completed it once before.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a big change that will make the start of each new season go significantly faster, as players will no longer need to mount up and manually travel to various locations, unlocking Waypoints along the way. Instead, Waypoints will be available from the start, letting players quickly and easily travel to wherever they need to go, which should substaintially speed up the start of each season.</p><p dir="ltr">The change goes hand-in-hand with one of Diablo 4's other big Season 11 changes, as the game will be removing the current Renown system that Waypoints are tied to in favor of a new Season Rank system. Many of the most important rewards from Renown, like additional skill and Paragon points, will instead be tied to completing seasonal objectives as part of Season Rank. Altars of Lilith, another aging piece of Diablo 4 that saw players exploring the map and was tied to the Renown system, are also seeing a big change. They are being reworked to no longer grant permanent stat boosts and will instead grant experience and other minor rewards when discovered.</p><p dir="ltr">Other huge system reworks coming in Season 11 include significant changes to how Masterworking and Tempering gear works, adjustments to defense and healing, updates to make <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-monsters-are-getting-deadlier-and-smarter-in-season-11/1100-6535477/" data-ref-id="1100-6535477">monsters smarter and more deadly</a>, and the reintroduction of leaderboards in the form of a new challenge dungeon called The Tower.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 11 is set to begin on December 9. Blizzard has not yet officially announced Diablo 4's second expansion, but it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-second-expansion-isnt-coming-until-2026/1100-6529452/" data-ref-id="1100-6529452">expected to arrive in 2026</a>, and just might introduce the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evidence-of-a-diablo-4-paladin-class-may-have-just-leaked/1100-6533963/" data-ref-id="1100-6533963">Paladin class</a>.</p>

		<p>January is a month that most people don’t like. It is cold, dark, and wet. However, the plus side to January is that you can stay inside, get cosy, have a warm drink and relax. Coffee Beans is aiming to replicate some of that vibe with its cosy cafe sim Tailside, which has been given a release date of January 21st.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tailside: Cozy Cafe Sim - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zR9YeieTIj0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Tailside will let you design your cafe, serve drinks to customers, and follow mini storylines. There are no time pressures to adhere to so players can take things at their own pace. As you make progress, new items and drinks will be unlocked, along with new visitors to the cafe. Tailside will also have a sandbox mode allowing players to decorate the cafe however they wish. Additionally, Tailside will allow players to import their own custom characters into the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2922570/Tailside_Cozy_Cafe_Sim/">A demo for Tailside</a> is currently available on Steam ahead of its January 21st release date.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/premium-vtt-fantasy-grounds-is-going-free-to-play.1349053/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fantasy Grounds is going free-to-play. The VTT, which has been around since 2004, has stood out from other competitors in the market due to its premium price. Now, as of today, that is no more. However, its premium library will remain as is.</p>

<h2>The Fantasy Grounds Free-to-Play Announcement</h2>

<p>If you pull up Fantasy Grounds' official Steam page, its MSRP has gone from $50 to free-to-play. Obviously, this means anyone can install the platform, then host and join as many online games as they want. No upfront purchase or premium subscription required.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fantasy-grounds-steam-page-screenshots.jpg?itok=jUP-XJPq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fantasy-grounds-steam-page-screenshots.jpg?itok=KgMTbg7y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>But, much like other VTTs like Alchemy RPG or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/official-roll20-demiplane-integration-feature-is-now-in-beta" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Roll20</a>, Fantasy Grounds still has premium content. This includes official support for prewritten adventures, systems, and supplements for many popular TTRPGs like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pathfinder" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder</em></a>, and <em>Traveller</em>.</p>

<p>In terms of service, Fantasy Grounds is a more feature-rich experience, albeit with a steeper learning curve. A lot of rules and resolution is automated, and GMs can get a lot more creative with the tools provided. But it can be overwhelming for players brand new to the hobby.</p>

<p>In addition to this new free-to-play status, the latest update for Fantasy Grounds includes an online reader. This is a web-based compendium where users can access their library of material from the VTT from the comfort of their browser.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Steam User response to this free-to-play pivot has not been kind. All recent reviews currently have the "Mixed" status. Primarily, this is coming from negative reviews from users angry that they bought the game only for it to go free-to-play with no warning given or compensation provided. This includes both the base game at $50 and the $70 Deluxe version; a not insignificant amount of money effectively wasted.</p>

<p>At time of writing, Fantasy Grounds hasn't addressed if there will be any loyalty rewards for older users.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-6-still-long-way-off-todd-howard</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-elder-scrolls-6-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard.1349050/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Elder Scrolls 6&nbsp;</em>director and Bethesda studio head Todd Howard has some bad news for you: the game is not launching anytime soon.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> with GQ, Howard says that&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls 6&nbsp;</em>(which still doesn't have its&nbsp;<em>Morrowind&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Skyrim</em>-style secondary title) is "still a long way off", although it is "the everyday thing" on which Bethesda is currently working.</p>

<p>Howard says that his "perfect version" of&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em>'s launch is that "it's going to be a while and then, one day, the game will just appear", calling the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-released" rel="nofollow">shadowdrop</a> a "test run" that "worked out well". It sounds like&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls 6&nbsp;</em>may well have no fanfare at all when it does eventually release.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-elder-scrolls-6-long-way-off-oblivion-remaster.jpg?itok=myWmu2Au 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-elder-scrolls-6-long-way-off-oblivion-remaster.jpg?itok=bcTz3QMV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls 6&nbsp;</em>shadowdrop like&nbsp;<em>Oblivion Remastered</em>?</figcaption></figure><p>This isn't the first time Howard has set expectations for&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em>. Back in September 2023, he said that the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-vi-after-2026-no-ps5" rel="nofollow">would launch in "2026 or later"</a>, and that it probably wouldn't appear on the PlayStation 5. Of course, that may well have changed in the interim, given Xbox's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sea-of-thieves-grounded-and-pentiment-officially-announced-for-playstation-platforms" rel="nofollow">new multiplatform strategy</a>.</p>

<p>The last we heard of&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em>&nbsp;was in February this year, when Bethesda announced that it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-vi-auction-charity-npc" rel="nofollow">hold a charity auction</a> allowing the winner to create their very own character to appear in the game. We still don't know where the RPG will take place or what its story might look like.</p>

<p>As a quick reminder,&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls 6&nbsp;</em>was originally announced all the way back in 2018. The reveal was so long ago that it predates Microsoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-acquires-zenimax-media-for-75-billion" rel="nofollow">acquisition of Bethesda and its parent company ZeniMax</a>.</p>

<p>When the game was announced, it was through a trailer that simply showed a logo for&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em>, along with a rural fantasy landscape. To date, that's still all we have in terms of the art direction and location for the highly-anticipated RPG.</p>




<p>It remains to be seen whether any more news on&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls 6&nbsp;</em>will be revealed in the near future (or, indeed, throughout the rest of next year). Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>
Anyone that's spent any amount of time playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> recently will already know that the thing the game needs right now isn't new features, its fixes. A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-huge-into-the-unjust-410-update-fires-out-over-200-bug-fixes-plus-some-weapon-balancing">massive patch dropped last month bringing</a> in over 200 bug fixes (you know, the technological kind of bugs), as part of the dev team's promise to get the game in running order again. That promise even extends to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-director-confirms-arrowhead-are-biting-the-addition-delay-bullet-while-working-on-performance-fixes">holding off on adding new stuff</a> for the time being. When it comes to new stuff, however, one thing you shouldn't expect for the time being is cross progression.
</p>
<p>
As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-has-no-plans-to-add-cross-progression-even-though-arrowhead-ceo-says-wed-love-to-as-other-things-take-priority/">GamesRadar</a>, when asked by a member of the official <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> Discord server if there were any updates on cross progression, community manager Katherine Baskin had this to say: "We have no plans to add cross progression currently." That obviously kind of says it all, yet all hope on the feature is not necessarily lost.
</p>
<p>
Later on, responding to similar questions regarding cross progression, CEO Shams Jorjani explained, "[for what it's worth] we'd love to add cross platform progression, but other things take priority." There doesn't appear to be what those other things are, but we can probably assume that those aforementioned bug fixes are a part of that. Not to mention the fact that live service games are a tricky thing to balance, especially considering they essentially facilitate entire economies. Doesn't sound like an easy thing to translate across platforms.
</p>
<p>
When we may see such a thing, I can't tell you, it sounds like a while away. So, if it's that much of a problem for you, perhaps you can try out one of the million other live service games that are out there. You're spoiled for choice!

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-official-20w-usb-c-charger-for-iphone-sells-for-pennies-and-it-includes-a-5-foot-cable-2000642458</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-official-20w-usb-c-charger-for-iphone-sells-for-pennies-and-it-includes-a-5-foot-cable.1349044/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  This 20W dual-port charger bundle includes two adapters plus two 5-foot USB-C cables, and it's selling for nothing.
                </p><div>
              
              <p>Apple’s official 20W USB-C charger costs $20 and doesn’t even include a cable, forcing iPhone buyers to pay extra just to charge their new devices at proper speeds. Anker has positioned itself as one of the few third-party brands sold directly in Apple Stores and it earned Apple’s stamp of approval for quality and compatibility.</p>
<p>The good news is that right now, this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/">two-pack of Anker 20W chargers currently sells for just $15 on Amazon, down from the standard $18 price</a>, and each unit includes a 5-foot USB-C cable. You’re essentially <strong>getting two complete charging solutions</strong> with cables for less than the cost of Apple’s single charger alone.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Why Anker Earned Apple’s Trust and Your Money</h2>
<p>The <strong>20W output provides the fastest charging speed currently supported by iPhones</strong> which brings an empty device to about 50% in roughly 30 minutes. That’s really fast and something important for those rushed mornings when you forgot to charge overnight or need to top up before going out in the evening. Power Delivery ensures compatibility across the entire iPhone lineup from the iPhone 8 forward and it will work seamlessly with iPads that support fast charging, AirPods cases, and various other USB-C devices.</p>



<p>But that’s not all: the <strong>dual-port design on each charger</strong> brings with it some unexpected versatility that Apple’s single-port adapter simply can’t match. You <strong>get both a USB-C port and a USB-A port on each unit</strong>, and lets you charge two devices at the same time without needing multiple wall outlets. If you’re using the USB-C alone, it’ll continue to pump out the full 20W while the USB-A adds additional charging capability for any older devices or accessories that haven’t yet made the switch to USB-C.</p>



<p>That compact form factor makes these chargers truly portable without the bulk that seems to afflict too many high-wattage adapters. The<strong> foldable prongs on the US version fold flat against the body</strong> so the sharp metal pins won’t catch on clothes or scratch other items in your bag. The size is small enough to fit in crowded power strips without blocking the adjacent outlets, which addresses one of the most annoying things about big charging bricks: they tend to monopolize multiple spaces.</p>
<p>The<strong> included 5-foot-long USB-C to USB-C cables</strong> provide you with enough length to comfortably use your phone as it charges, even when the outlet is located inconveniently. Apple’s own cables are only 3 feet, which in turn makes you sit strangely close to wall outlets or sacrifice active use of your phone during charging. The extra two feet of cable length completely alters charging from a restrictive tether into something that allows natural movement and comfortable usage of the device.</p>
<p>For $15 for two charging solutions with cables included, this <strong>Anker pack is 75% less than buying two of Apple’s official chargers</strong> that would run you $40 plus the additional cost of cables.</p>

<p>Activision is getting ready to launch Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 on November 14. With that preparation comes an update to the Call of Duty app on various platforms, and one platform needing the update is PlayStation 5 (PS5).</p>



<p>The Call of Duty HQ app on PS5 requires around 100GB to install. This update includes Multiplayer and Zombies while a separate Campaign pack is needed for that section of the game. And while that should be it to get ready to playing Black Ops 7, if you still want to play either Black Ops 6 or Warzone, you’re going to have to do more after the updating the HQ app.</p>



<p>After the new update, you’re going to be <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1987931198442643822" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">required to reinstall</a> both the Black Ops 6 and Warzone packs if you want to keep playing those games and their modes. It’s an extra step and more time to play the games that were already previously installed. And, because the app update is mandatory for everyone, there’s seemingly no way around it on PS5.</p>



<p>Are you going to reinstall Warzone or Black Ops 6 to keep playing on your PS5 after the Call of Duty app update, or are you just going to wait now for Black Ops 7?

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> I Was Wrong About Elden Ring: Nightreign...</p>
      </div>
<p>"From Software is currently developing Elden Ring Nightreign DLC (planned for release in FY2025), Elden Ring Tarnished Edition (planned for release in 2026 for Nintendo Switch 2), and The Duskbloods (planned for release in 2026)," Kadokawa said in the report, which was released on November 6. "A mobile game for [the supernatural mystery monga] Oshi no Ko is under development (distribution is planned to begin in 2026)."</p><p>Fiscal years are broken into three-month quarters. "FY2025" normally means the end of the 2025 fiscal year, which is September 30 in the US. But because From Software and Kadokawa are Japanese companies, fiscal years are different there, with "FY2025" pointing to March 31, 2026; this is the end of the 2025 fiscal year for Japan. Not to spell it all the way out, but this suggests that Nightreign DLC should come out before March wraps. Everything is tentative, though, and until From Software announces it, take all of this with a grain of salt.</p><p>Still, this could be good news for a Nightreign community that’s been clamoring for DLC since the game's Deep of Night mode, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-is-about-to-get-harder-for-those-wanting-a-challenge/1100-6534351/">made the rougelike/souls-like way harder</a> than it already was. Despite being well received by critics and fans after its May 30 launch, Nightreign has slipped to a "mostly positive" Steam rating, with <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Raventg/recommended/3515610/">a handful</a> of <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/katarinabluu/recommended/3515610/">recent negative reviews</a> criticizing From Software for <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/CAXX/recommended/3515610/">the lack of add-on content</a> to the game.</p><p>Elden Ring's Nintendo Switch 2 port was moved out of 2025 to a nebulous 2026 window due to "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-for-switch-2-delayed-to-2026-due-to-performance-adjustments/1100-6535648/">performance adjustments</a>," with From Software wanting to polish this version as much as possible. Meanwhile, The Duskbloods, a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-cant-create-your-own-character-in-the-duskbloods-but-you-can-customize-one/1100-6530631/" data-ref-id="1100-6530631">appears to be a slight departure</a> for the notoriously single-player-focused studio, but don't worry: From Software's Hidetaka Miyazaki said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-is-not-abandoning-single-player-games-studio-boss-says/1100-6530620/" data-ref-id="1100-6530620">the team isn't abandoning what it's best known for</a>; it's just experimenting right now.</p><p>As such, the Japanese studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-unannounced-from-software-game-will-reportedly-be-coming-sooner-than-you-think/1100-6533277/" data-ref-id="1100-6533277">reportedly has a multiplatform title</a> that's so far in production it could release next year. From Software seems very busy.</p>
