            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>BLAST has set the stage for one of the biggest structural overhauls in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/counter-strike/" id="482">Counter-Strike’s</a> history, unveiling a massive redesign of the BLAST Premier circuit that will kick off in 2027. This update marks a decisive pivot towards a full LAN-focused model, deeper integration with Valve’s Regional Standings, and a significant financial boost aimed at stabilizing the competitive scene.</p>



<p>At the heart of the overhaul sits a whopping $10 million investment directly into teams and the wider ecosystem, which is a leap up from the $8.5 million commitment in 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-blast-bags-bigger-financial-commitment">BLAST Bags Bigger Financial Commitment</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/blast/" id="3530">BLAST</a> has promised that the $10 million investment for 2027 will be spent across four critical pillars:</p>



<ul>
<li>Prize Money</li>



<li>Team Payments</li>



<li>Acceptance Fees</li>



<li>Player Experience Investment</li>
</ul>



<p>The lion’s share of the $10 million goes to team payments, with $4.5 million being attributed to ‘performance-based compensation retained by organizations.’</p>



<p>Behind that, there will be $3 million prize money, and $1.8 million reserved as rewards for teams attending events. The player experience portion of that investment concerns upgrades to travel, accommodation, and on-site conditions.</p>



<p>This is all part of BLAST’s drive to produce a more LAN-centric competitive structure. The endeavour means that some major changes have taken place:</p>



<ul>
<li>BLAST Bounty is reduced from 32 to 16 teams and will now focus 100% on LAN play</li>



<li>More regional open qualifiers will be hosted across all territories</li>



<li>An extra week of competition has been added to the overall season</li>
</ul>



<p>BLAST Bounty, Open, and Rivals have all been brought back with key refinements, but it’s Bounty that faces the biggest changes.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://blast.tv/cs/news/premier-2027-new-formats" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a statement</a>, Anne Banschbach, the Programme Director for BLAST Premier, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are evolving BLAST Premier to better serve the entire Counter-Strike ecosystem.</p>



<p>Increasing our investment to $10 million is not just about bigger prize pools, it is about revamping our formats to deliver a more sustainable and premium experience for teams, players and fans.</p>



<p>With a fully LAN-focused structure, stronger VRS impact and the removal of main event online matches, the biggest moments will play out on the biggest stages.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>BLAST Rivals remains the ‘crowning jewel’ of the ecosystem in 2027, and will retain the same eight-team format. <strong>But</strong>, in 2027, the prize pool will be increased to the maximum possible – $1.25 million.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/openai-says-hell-yea-to-to-helping-government-with-fully-autonomous-weapons-as-trump-bombs-more-countries-2000674755</link>
            <guid>1449529</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Last Thursday, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthropic-claude-ai-department-of-war-military-murder-2000674386"><span>Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei made a surprise statement</span></a><span> regarding the company’s decision to bail on negotiations with the Department of War. While the Pentagon had already made extensive use of their generative AI model, they began requesting that Anthropic ease restrictions on their terms of use. In a first for the tech industry, the major AI company took an unexpectedly pro-human-existence stance, with Amodei citing mass surveillance and “fully autonomous weapons” as lines he wouldn’t cross. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, however, is a-okay with these terms, with Altman recently taking to social media to boast about its new venture in arms dealing with the U.S. government.&nbsp;</span><span><br> </span></p>

 <p><span>“In all of our interactions, the DoW displayed a deep respect for safety and a desire to partner to achieve the best possible outcome,” </span><a href="https://x.com/sama/status/2027578580159631610"><span>Altman posted Friday night</span></a><span>. “We remain committed to serve all of humanity as best we can. The world is a complicated, messy, and sometimes dangerous place.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ok, what kind of American Ai company are you? <a href="https://t.co/7IJFMnpdrb">pic.twitter.com/7IJFMnpdrb</a></p> <p>— Skely (@123skely) <a href="https://twitter.com/123skely/status/2027588056686203228?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 28, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Though light on the details, Altman also said OpenAI had principles regarding surveillance and the training of killing machines, but said that their terms match the Department of War’s enough to shake on it. “We are asking the DoW to offer these same terms to all AI companies,” wrote Altman, “which in our opinion we think everyone should be willing to accept. We have expressed our strong desire to see things de-escalate away from legal and governmental actions and towards reasonable agreements.”</span></p> <p><span>Altman’s commitment to existence on Earth doesn’t breed a lot of confidence. The week prior, </span><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2026/02/21/sam-altman-would-like-remind-you-that-humans-use-a-lot-of-energy-too/"><span>Altman made a very bizarre defense of AI’s infamous energy usage</span></a><span>, saying that as gnarly as OpenAI’s water consumption is, training a human to reach the same stage of development requires “20 years of life and all of the food you eat during that time before you get smart.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>On the other end, whatever spooked Anthropic in the Pentagon was enough to rankle the rest of the administration. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth threatened to label Anthropic </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn48jj3y8ezo"><span>a security risk or to enforce new laws in retaliation</span></a><span>. It even </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn48jj3y8ezo"><span>riled up President Donald Trump’s usual brand of ire</span></a><span>.</span></p>   <p><span>The people Altman just handed over the OpenAI keys to are the same ones currently waging illegal wars from Latin America to the Middle East. Mere hours after Altman celebrated his new deal with the Department of War, the U.S. military initiated an unprovoked bombing campaign against Iran in partnership with Israel. It’s reportedly been planned for months without any authorization from Congress.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“The lives of courageous American heroes may be lost and we may have casualties,” Trump said in a video message earlier today. “That often happens in war.” </span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2026/2/28/live-israel-launches-attacks-on-iran-multiple-explosions-heard-in-tehran?update=4345839"><span>According to newswires like </span><i><span>Al Jazeera</span></i></a><span>, one of the bombs hit an all-girls elementary school, with at least 50 civilian casualties and counting. Whatever Altman’s new conditions are regarding AI’s usage on self-automated death machines, we may learn sooner than later.</span></p>

            <p>Just days after Sony decided to close remake masters Bluepoint Games, a new report claims that wasn't PlayStation itself that stonewalled the idea of a Bloodborne remake by Bluepoint, but developer FromSoftware.</p>
<p>Despite calling Bluepoint Games "an incredibly talented team" full of "technical expertise" which has "delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-closes-acclaimed-demons-souls-and-shadow-of-the-colossus-remake-studio-bluepoint-despite-acknowledging-it-had-delivered-exceptional-experiences-for-the-playstation-community">Sony shut down the studio last week</a>, impacting around 70 employees. At the time, a spokesperson said the decision was made "following a recent business review".</p>

<p>Sony - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buys-demons-souls-remake-developer-bluepoint-games">which acquired Bluepoint in 2021</a> - put the studio to work on a live-service God of War game, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">project it ultimately cancelled last year</a>, after Bluepoint released Demon's Souls as a launch exclusive for the PS5 in 2020. It was always hoped that Bluepoint would, at some point, be instructed to do the same for Bloodborne.</p><p>Now, a new report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-27/sony-s-bluepoint-pitched-bloodborne-remake-before-closure">Bloomberg</a> claims that Bluepoint did, in fact, approach FromSoft in early 2025, pitching a remake of the 2015 game. It's said that "the studio was told that the numbers made sense, but FromSoftware didn't want it to happen".</p>
<p>Interestingly, former president of Sony Interactive Entertainment <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-hasnt-playstation-done-anything-new-with-bloodborne-shuhei-yoshida-has-a-theory">Shuhei Yoshida posited the same this time last year</a>, saying: "Bloodborne is one of the most popular asks on my Twitter/X. And the people wonder why we haven't really done anything... it should be easy, right?</p>
<p>"Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, what he created. So I think he is interested but he's so successful and he's so busy, so he cannot do it himself, and he doesn't want anyone else to touch it."</p>
<p>After this rejection, Bluepoint allegedly pitched a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> remake to Sony, as well as a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a> spin-off, but these ideas were also turned down, with Bloomberg suggesting that other studios were "concerned about dedicating significant resources to another team's project".</p><p>Bloodborne has long been considered one of the greatest games ever made. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloodborne-review">We gave it an Essential, writing</a>: " it will be a painfully long time until I play anything else that matches up to Bloodborne's breadth of vision, generosity of content, and - yes - genius".</p>

              <p>There was a moment back in 2024 when it seemed like a switch had flipped on console exclusivity. Microsoft was bringing some of its biggest games to Switch and PS5 and Sony was <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-xbox-exclusivity-helldivers-spiderman-switch-2-1851787122">supporting PC ports more than ever</a>. A fully multiplatform future felt almost inevitable. But things have shifted since then and Sony is reportedly pulling back from platforms like Steam to double down on the PlayStation 5 ecosystem, at least when it comes to single-player games like<em> Wolverine</em>.</p>

 <p>We reported on rumors of this upcoming shift <a href="https://kotaku.com/nvidia-gpu-prices-eurogamer-layoffs-wolfenstein-3-casting-2000674011">earlier this week</a>. “I get the feeling that under the current leadership, that PC has become less important.” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnZsurPI5EY&amp;t=1413s"><em>Digital Foundry</em>‘s John Linneman</a> said on a recent podcast. <em>Bloomberg</em>‘s Jason Schreier coincidently shared a <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-phil-spencer-retired-and-whats-next-for-xbox/id1507834679?i=1000751690666">similar inkling on <em>Triple Click</em></a>, adding that he wouldn’t be surprised if <em>Wolverine</em> just never came to PC at all.</p> <p>To make clear that this wasn’t just idle speculation, Schreier followed up on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/jason-schreier-the-sense-i%E2%80%99m-getting-is-that-sony-is-backing-away-from-putting-their-exclusive-console-traditional-single-player-stuff-on-pc.1447141/page-6#post-151851202">gaming forum ResetEra</a> to clarify. “It’s not speculation, but sometimes topics come up on the show before I’m quite ready to publish a story about them,” he wrote. “More to come soon I’m sure.”</p> <p>Since then, insider NateTheHate has come out with an even more clear-cut pronouncement. “They are shifting their PC release strategy,” he tweeted <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2027438633997734231">on February 27</a>. “You’ll be seeing fewer single player games arrive on PC. The decision to shift away from supporting PC was made last year. Naturally, some may still release (pending how far along the ports were) but it no longer appears to be a priority for Sony moving forward.”</p>

 <p>That’s an awful lot of smoke for no fire, and in fact the flames have been building for a few months now. &nbsp;“It does seem like the games that PlayStation released on PC didn’t move the needle for them at all,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/EZkatWINAYE?t=10034s"><em>WindowsCentral</em>‘s Jez Cordon</a> said on a podcast last November based on what he’d heard from a source. “Partially because they were launched so late, but maybe they’ve used that as evidence that they shouldn’t go any further, and that they should remain more Nintendo in their approach and keep things more exclusive.”</p> <h2>PC ports made sense for Sony</h2> <div data-testid="cellInnerDiv"> <article tabindex="0" role="article" aria-labelledby="id__tfgnkwds43 id__3etdtbapts id__gkxm2zlkei5 id__yqgonprm9do id__95brirup5o5 id__rdsbu47lxs id__hpo3dl7sdw9 id__2xq9ja27s33 id__fh019t7ap2s id__u92w1vn3toc id__3xqb51w38fy id__9i7o8q9wt2c id__y8nxgtzxrol id__fape6cbjv87 id__hsg9hgs038p id__vz3me5ss3gk id__k8roej4k9p id__54j0po2ixwj id__90gwquh60vk id__oqfqs22kv1" data-testid="tweet"> <div id="id__oqfqs22kv1" role="group" aria-label="9 replies, 11 reposts, 224 likes, 10 bookmarks, 10301 views"> <p>Sony pulling back on PC outside of live-service games like <em>Marathon</em> and <em>Horizon Hunters Gathering</em> would fly in the face of recent conventional wisdom, which states that as development budgets balloon, publishers need to sell their games wherever they can in order to claw back as much sales revenue as possible. While ditching exclusives altogether might be lethal to a very lucrative PS5 console business, a hybrid approach like delayed ports coming to PC seemed like a smart way for the company to have its cake and eat it too.</p> <p>Has the strategy been successful though? Sony’s latest <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/110045/sony-has-made-at-least-dollars2-3-billion-selling-first-party-games-on-pc-and-xbox/index.html">earnings report</a> pointed to $2.37 billion in sales revenue from games on PC and Xbox. While that number is dominated by the success of live-service franchises like <em>Helldivers 2</em> and <em>MLB The Show</em>, it also includes over a million unit sales across recent ports like<em> Spider-Man 2</em> and <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>. How much added revenue is enough to offset the costs of porting the games and any potential PS5 momentum that gets sacrificed from PC players who just wait instead of buying a console (and don’t forget Valve’s 30 percent cut of Steam sales)?</p> <p>Here’s what PlayStation Studios boss Hermen Hulst told investors last year. “It’s important to realize that we’re really thoughtful about bringing our franchises off console to reach new audiences and that we’re taking a very measured, very deliberate approach in doing that,” he said. “Particularly on the single-player side, our tentpole titles, they’re such a point of differentiation for the PlayStation console.”</p> <h2>The case for not bringing<em> Wolverine</em> to Steam</h2> <p>Perhaps the last few years of data suggests the trade-off isn’t as worth it as Sony once hoped it would be. It could also be that the cinematic, story-driven blockbusters PlayStation Studios have become synonymous with just aren’t the types of games may PC players are very interested in, especially a year after launch hype has died down and with very little marketing.</p> <p>The genres that routinely blow up on Steam, from roguelikes with complex systems to hardcore soulslikes with unforgiving mechanics, are not the ones Sony is known for. Maybe that explains why <a href="https://alineaanalytics.com/blog/stellar_blade/"><em>Stellar Blade</em> sold a million copies</a> on Steam in just three days where games like<em> God of War Ragnarök</em> have struggled (the occasional <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-steam-framerate-network-login-1851654888">busted port doesn’t help either</a>).</p> <p>Better to get those PC players who actually want to play Naughty Dog’s <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em> to just go out and buy a PS5 (or a PS6) instead. If the current console generation has proven anything for Sony, it’s that it’s easier to make money off of existing diehard fans than try to rope in new ones.</p> </div> </article> </div>

    <article>
      <p>Hi Aftermath readers! Welcome to the weekend open thread. Here’s what I’d like to try. I’ll tell you a story about a game I’m playing, and then you share one in the comments.</p><p>I have been playing an ungodly amount of <em>Caves of Qud</em>, mainly in “roleplay” mode, which allows you to create checkpoints in settlements that you can return to if you die. And you’re going to die a lot in <em>Caves of Qud</em>. Its combat system is so interesting and robust that almost every encounter can be deadly if you’re not careful. Before I entered the very first dungeon, one of my first characters was stoned to death by angry baboobs, a fate apparently so common I got an achievement for it.</p><p>In <em>Qud</em>, the world ticks along turn by turn. If you take a step, that’s a turn. Attacking someone is also a turn. If you initiate a turn, the entire rest of the world also takes their turn simultaneously. You can cheese your way through a lot of enemy encounters when you’re overpowered by taking advantage of this cadence. Ranged enemies need sightlines to attack, so you can avoid aggro-ing enemies by stepping behind a tree. You can coax enemies into a choke point peeking into a room and then sprinting down a hallway, forcing enemies to attack one at a time. It’s also nice to be able to pause the game at basically any point, either to figure out a strategy or to just go do something else because you’re old.</p><figure></figure><p>Right now I have what feels like an incredible combo of mutations and weapons that has made me a little more courageous in my exploits. I was able to buy a new mutation that granted me a second set of arms. I’m using daggers, which aren’t very deadly but have a chance to give enemies a “bleeding” status effect that does damage over time. I also invested some points into tinkering, which allows me to modify my weapons, so I am now wielding four electrified daggers. The electricity flies out in arcs when I attack, often obliterating two or three in one stab. On top of this, I also have a fungal infection on my hand and my foot that essentially gives me a free healing item, if I’m willing to eat mushrooms that sprout from my feet. It makes members of the faction the Consortium of Phyta all hate me, which I have discovered may bite me in the ass later—but that’s a later problem.</p><p>I have been gallivanting across Qud with my four electric daggers, basically melting everything in my path. The one major issue is that the electric arcs from my dagger often also kill other random animals in the area, meaning I’m still fucking dying to like, an angry horse. Roleplay mode makes trying things out and exploring a little less intimidating. There’s a part of me, though, that sees how bizarre and interesting the game can get when you let its systems crash into each other, and wants to just start a new character anyway.</p><p>How about y’all? What games have you been playing that have given you a story worth sharing? And who else out here is completely obsessed with <em>Caves of Qud</em>?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I never knew how easy it was to die in an orgy. But that’s just one of the many threats facing Geralt of Rivia in his latest adventure. The studio behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/7/16743406/reigns-her-majesty-review-iphone-android-steam">the <em>Reigns</em> series of Tinder-like choose-your-own-adventure games</a> has now adapted <em>The Witcher</em>, following a handful of original titles and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/23/17764070/reigns-game-of-thrones-hbo-devolver">a take on <em>Game of Thrones</em></a>. And for Francois Alliot, creative director at <em>Reigns</em> studio Nerial, the series’ structure actually makes it an ideal way to ease players into sprawling fantasies like this. “There’s something about the way you can bring really complex universes, lore, and storylines to simple actions,” he says. “It can work in a lot of contexts.”</p><p>What makes <em>Reigns</em> so approachable is the way it distills every action into a binary choice. As you play, you’re presented with cards, and you progress by either swiping right or left. In the case of <em>The Witcher</em>, for instance, an elf might ask Geralt for protection, and your options are simply to say either yes or no and then deal with the consequences. Each run through the game involves making a number of these decisions to progress a storyline until, well, you die.</p><p>The idea was for <em>Reigns: The Witcher</em> to work on two levels. For existing fans, it’s a fun way to play around and experiment in the world. “It’s not a new <em>Witcher</em>,” Alliot notes. “It’s a meta game around this universe, a bit like a fanfiction simulator.” But for those who might be intimidated by the franchise, which spans multiple books, games, and TV shows, it’s also a good place to start. “It works nicely as an entry point because you can really get a feel for the tone and rules, or lack of rules, of the world,” says narrative designer Oscar Harrington-Shaw. “But you’re not having to commit to a complex RPG.”</p><p>There are several aspects of the <em>Reigns </em>formula that had to be tweaked to work with <em>The Witcher</em>. One of the key conceits in the games is that you can die; in the original <em>Reigns</em> you played as a king, and when that was over you picked up as their successor. But that doesn’t really work when you’re playing a character like Geralt who can’t die. So you aren’t actually playing as Geralt; instead, you’re his bard pal Dandelion, singing tales of Geralt’s exploits that may or may not be true. This allowed the team at Nerial to “free ourselves from the lore,” as Alliot describes it, and have fun with things. This is especially apparent in the deaths, which come in the form of the aforementioned orgies or even from Geralt drinking himself to an early grave.</p><p>“It really helped in two ways,” Harrington-Shaw says of coming up with the Dandelion idea, which came about from discussions with <em>Witcher </em>studio CD Projekt Red. “One is that it helps explain the loop; it gives a really neat end point. And we can have loads of fun deaths because it’s just a satisfying ending to a song. But we think it adds a really fun tension because you are playing as Geralt and you’re trying to survive, but you’re also trying to write good content.”</p><p>As I played, this setup made me much more open to experimenting. Instead of trying to roleplay as Geralt, I would often make odd choices just to see what happened. This, in turn, helps open up new storylines, giving some payoff for making the seemingly wrong decision. Even an early death can lead somewhere interesting in future runs.</p><p>The other notable addition in <em>Reigns: The Witcher </em>is a combat system. It wouldn’t be <em>The Witcher</em> if Geralt wasn’t slaying some monsters, but the idea of battles also had the potential to complicate the streamlined <em>Reigns</em> structure. The team settled on a sort of rhythm game, where you’re moving Geralt side to side on a board to attack or avoid monsters. What makes this system work within the confines of <em>Reigns</em> is that you’re still using the same commands; whether you’re making a pivotal decision or staring down a striga, everything comes down to swiping either right or left.</p><p>Despite those changes, Harrington-Shaw says that <em>The Witcher</em> universe is an almost ideal fit for <em>Reigns</em> thanks to its dark sense of humor and frequently bleak world full of opposing factions. More important, though, is the main witcher himself. “Geralt is always facing these tricky binary choices,” he says. “The world of <em>The Witcher</em> is full of murky, gray morality, and that seemed perfect to translate.”</p><p><sub>Reigns: The Witcher <em>is out now on PC and mobile.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/885432/reigns-the-witcher-interview-steam-iphone-android]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/30-horror-masterpieces-to-play-before-you-die</link>
            <guid>1449496</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Masterpieces. As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/welcome-to-ign30-a-note-from-peer">IGN celebrates its 30th anniversary</a>, it’s the perfect time to reflect on the past and celebrate the defining experiences that shaped gaming as we know it. In recognition of the release of a new Resident Evil (a series that's produced at least <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-4-remake-review">one masterpiece</a>) we thought we'd start by exploring the incredible world of horror games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Few genres have mutated and evolved quite like horror has. It’s given us absolute classic franchises like Silent Hill, Castlevania, and Resident Evil, along with modern masterpieces like Dead Space, Bloodborne, and Mouthwashing. From humble and simplistic pixel art beginnings to the hyper realistic, ultra violent games of today, here we run down 30 horror masterpieces, plus the dozens of horror games that inspired them - and scared the hell out of us - along the way. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>1. Shadowgate (1987)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/25/ign-30-horror-masterpieces-shadowgate-1772036966523.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The earliest days of horror video games are characterized by minimalist, creepy text based adventures like Mystery House and Transylvania, the maze-like Haunted House, or even the dread inducing Space Invaders, where waves of creatures slowly descend upon your lone defenses against a deathly black screen. But 1987’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/shadowgate-1987">Shadowgate</a> bucked that simplistic trend to become of the most immersive early horror games. It paired a unique first person perspective with a cryptic setting, great writing, and the kind of obtuse environmental puzzles that would eventually make their way into games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">ICOM Simulations, the original studio responsible for Shadowgate, went on to create a sequel, Beyond Shadowgate, and dabble with several other horror games, dipping into the worlds of Dracula and Are You Afraid of the Dark, before ultimately shuttering in 1997. Although the original Shadowgate recieved handsome remake in 2014, and was ported to the adorable little crank-driven Playdate handheld just last year, it’s not part of a franchise regularly getting new games like so many of the other entries on this list. Regardless, it will always be one of the early masterpieces that helped set the stage for years of horror games to come.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>2. Doom (1993)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/25/ign-30-horror-masterpieces-doom-1772034664366.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">These days, we largely associate Doom with revolutionizing the first person shooter and delivering tons of ripping, tearing, and ass-kicking across several games in the decades since it first changed the world, back in 1993. But <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-1993">Doom</a>’s contributions to the horror genre are just as important, which make sense considering Alien and Evil Dead were some of its biggest inspirations. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Through its dank, dimly lit corridors filled with horrible, guttural sounds, you face zombified humans, cybernetic spiders, and flying demons from hell, all of which are very fitting for a game that kicks off with a chapter called “Knee Deep in the Dead”, a difficulty level that caps off at “Nightmare!”, and a chainsaw-wielding hero whose face gets covered in blood as he takes damage. If that doesn’t scream horror, I don’t know what does.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Doom series would explore these themes repeatedly as it evolved, pushing and pulling its horror elements to balance them with its notoriously badass power fantasy, with varying degrees of success. 2004’s Doom 3 took the series into (literally) dark places, utilizing shadows, jump scares, and tight environments to elicit fear, while later games retained the horrific creature design but cranked up the original's violence, using widened level design and increased scale. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Building off of the success of 1992’s Wolfenstein 3D, Doom will always deserve its flowers for changing first person gaming forever. But never forget what it did for horror, too. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>3. Clock Tower (1996)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/clock-tower-1772215158203.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Building off the story established in 1995’s Clock Tower, the 1996 PSX sequel - also called Clock Tower - took the original 16-bit cryptic point and click adventure game and overhauled it with full 3D graphics, CD quality voice acting and sound effects, and a deeper unraveling of its villain Scissorman, leading to a truly unnerving experience. While horror games in this era may not have been intentionally sparse, Clock Tower’s minimal use of a soundtrack meant that players would often go long stretches of time hearing only the echo of their own footsteps before the big and unexpected cinematic moments would sweep in to disarm them and make them jump off of their couches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clock Tower takes inspiration from classic Italian giallo films like Suspiria and Phenemona, and follows a similar structure of dropping an unsuspecting female lead into an increasingly bizarre and dangerous world. But unlike a traditional horror film, it also gives you multiple endings to encounter across several storylines. The 1996 Clock Tower game went on to get several sequels and spiritual successors, but it never really took off like its contemporaries for various reasons, the biggest of which was releasing just as another horror masterpiece had opened the door and entered the room...</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>4. Resident Evil (1996)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/25/ign-30-horror-masterpieces-resident-evil-1772036663544.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a golden horror rule that a creepy old mansion in the middle of nowhere is a top tier setting for terror. Movies like 1963’s The Haunting and 1980’s The Changeling knew that, as did games like 1987’s Maniac Mansion (even if leaned more into the absurd). Resident Evil producer Tokuro Fujiwara’s original horror game, 1989’s Sweet Home, did so, too, and is a top down precursor to the original Resident Evil in nearly every way. Old mansions are scary. What’s behind that creaky door? What’s that thumping sound in the attic? What’s down there lurking in the basement? Better hunt down a flashlight, some old keys, and see for ourselves if we want to figure out how to get out of here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-1996">Resident Evil</a> took the lumbering, groaning hordes of undead from the likes of Romero’s 1968 classic Night of the Living Dead, put them in a mansion-sized puzzle box, and sent you in to explore and survive the night. It took some of the best elements from early horror across every medium and turned them into something entirely new. Cinematography isn’t generally a word that video game geeks throw around to describe their favorite hobby like film buffs do, but Resident Evil had it in spades, with its locked camera perspective and dynamic angles framing protagonists Chris and Jill in unique ways - often deliberately so you couldn’t see what was lurking around the corner. Combine that with clunky tank controls, limited weapons and healing items, a sparse, sinister soundtrack, campy voice acting, and good old fashioned jumpscares, and Resident Evil instantly became one of the greatest horror games ever made when it launched in 1996. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom’s stunning remake, released in 2002 for the GameCube, completely redid the graphics and added some deranged new story beats (shout out to Lisa Trevor lurking in the basement) which only continued to exemplify Resident Evil’s masterpiece status. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">1992’s Alone in the Dark originated many of the ingredients that made Resident Evil’s gameplay so successful. While Alone in the Dark never quite took off on the same trajectory (many of its sequels and reboots have been critical duds), the Resident Evil franchise continued to iterate, evolve, and even reinvent itself entirely several times over for years to come.

Combining the nonlinear progression of games like Castlevania 2 and Super Metroid, Symphony of the Night gave you a massive castle in which you could explore, grind levels, and hunt vintage movie monsters like werewolves, sea monsters, and bats. You'd do all this while searching for unique items that allow you to reach new areas, battle brutal bosses, and ultimately work towards a surprise twist that turns the entire game on its head. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are horror games that revel in crippling your ability to fight back, forcing you to hide in fear and wait out the horrors. Castlevania, on the other hand, is a power fantasy that constantly rewards the inquisitive with new weapons, armor, abilities, and summons as they rise in strength to take down Dracula once and for all... or at least until he returns again in the next game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night set the tone for many future 2D Castlevania games to come, including several similarly scoped games on the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS, and would go on to inspire an entire generation of Metroidvania games.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>6.

It took a much more dynamic approach to the third person action and puzzle format established in Resident Evil and Clock Tower. Using some clever hardware trickery, Konami obfuscated the PlayStation’s draw distance limitations by using fog and lighting techniques which ended up playing to the genre’s strengths, creating a dreary, atmospheric world to explore. Silent Hill also tells a much sadder, more morose story than your usual survival horror game, awarding various endings depending on your actions, and manages to do all this while introducing some of the most bizarre enemies seen in video games to date. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Silent Hill series continued to grow and mutate over the years, notably with an incredible sequel in 2001 along with several other more experimental titles along the way, cementing it as one of the most important horror game franchises of all time. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>7. Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem (2002)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/25/ign-30-horror-masterpieces-eternal-darkness-1772036238616.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The “unreliable narrator” trope in fiction - making the audience view the story through the perspective of someone who may or may not be telling the truth - often leads to fascinating results and unforeseen twists. Movies like Rashomon, The Sixth Sense, and Memento all revel in distorting the audience’s trust of the storyteller. Silicon Knight’s revolutionary 2002 classic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/eternal-darkness-sanitys-requiem">Eternal Darkness</a> creates the same relationship between art and audience, but uses it as a gameplay mechanic, forcing you to control a protagonist who frequently goes temporarily insane. It demands you push through disturbing visions and horrific encounters that often aren’t actually happening, occasionally even breaking the fourth wall entirely. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If surviving a creepy Rhode Island mansion packed with violent monsters while going slowly mad wasn’t enough, Eternal Darkness also occasionally pretends to shut your television off or infest your screen with bugs. At the time it was nothing short of brilliant, and while numerous attempts were made to revitalize the IP and build a brand new game, none ever made it to the finish line, leaving the original as the one and only Eternal Darkness game, left standing on its own forever. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>8. Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly (2003)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/25/ign-30-horror-masterpieces-fatal-frame-2-1772036098225.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Wedged between the first and third Fatal Frame games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fatal-frame-ii-crimson-butterfly">Crimson Butterfly</a> is the clear survival horror standout of the trilogy, once again relying on a clever camera mechanic that allows you to both document and debilitate ghosts. It’s a truly, deeply scary experience where you can never really feel comfortable. Nor should you be when you're in a village infested with all types of bleeding and deformed spirits. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Compared to some of the more contemporary games on this list, the graphics and mechanics do feel a bit dated. But with a slick new remake running on a wholly new engine on the way this year, 2026 is the perfect time to bring the old ghost hunting camera back out for a night on the town.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>9. Resident Evil 4 (2005)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/25/ign-30-horror-masterpieces-resident-evil-4-1772034763105.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">While 2000’s Resident Evil: Code Veronica took the original Resident Evil formula to brand new heights, 2005’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-4-2005">Resident Evil 4</a> completely reinvented it, finding a new balance between action and horror that would be the series' recipe for for years to come. Classic Resident Evil hero Leon Kennedy is ripped out of an urban environment and thrown into the deep end of a rural folk horror teeming with murderous villagers. This yielded incredible results, and no wonder every other third person action game immediately took notes. Resident Evil 4’s gunplay and move set changed the genre forever, and its awesome set of upgradeable weapons, unique side characters, giant set pieces, and over the top bosses became enduring icons. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil 4’s real achievement, though, is taking all of those action movie-inspired elements and layering them into a gritty, atmospheric horror game. Wolves leap out at you from the night, chainsaw wielding psychopaths decapitate you, blood showers down, and hordes mob you with pitchforks and torches, hoping to tear you limb from limb. Sure, you’ve got a bigger arsenal than any prior Resident Evil game had offered up, but that doesn’t mean you still won’t die horrifically a bunch of times. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil 4 may have altered the franchise’s DNA for good. While older players may prefer the series' pure survival horror roots, this seminal entry is undeniably one of the best video games ever made - a statement only reinforced when you experience its excellent 2023 remake.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>10. Condemned: Criminal Origins (2005)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/25/ign-30-horror-masterpieces-condemned-1772035598239.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">While Resi 4 terrified GameCube and PS2 players, Xbox 360 owners were treated to a very different horror game in 2005: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/condemned-criminal-origins">Condemned: Criminal Origins</a>, a brutal and crude first-person horror game about the hunt for serial killers across a sprawling urban setting. Little of the style of the typical first person shooter is on display here; guns are extremely limited, both usage and presence, forcing you to use everyday objects as blunt melee weapons. It's an approach that creates combat scenarios that feel extremely violent and personal. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Between those visceral life-or-death altercations you’ll need to find forensic clues to unravel the larger mystery and figure out exactly what is making everyone in town so psychotic. It’s a foul, dirty feeling gameplay experience with bad vibes that linger long after the credits roll. It’s certainly unique, although 2012’s ZombiU managed to capture a similar feeling by throwing a pipe wielding player into a city gone mad.    </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>12. F.E.A.R. Extraction Point (2006)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/25/ign-30-horror-masterpieces-fear-extraction-point-1772034807914.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fear-extraction-point">F.E.A.R Extraction Point</a> - a standalone expansion to the original F.E.A.R. - successfully mixes fast paced first-person shooting with a Matrix-style bullet time slo-mo mechanic and a unique balance system that rewards you with faster movement if you holster your weapon. This all helped create a rapid risk/reward combat setting. It’s admittedly a bit on the short side and reuses many of the original game’s sounds and visuals, but manages to resurrect them in a smart, cohesive way to tell a singular horror story that plays differently to practically every other game on this list. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>13. Siren: Blood Curse (2008)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/25/ign-30-horror-masterpieces-siren-blood-curse-1772035475007.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">While many horror games opt to go in guns blazing, particularly since Resident Evil 4 showed how it could be done effectively, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/siren-blood-curse">Siren: Blood Curse</a> closes out the excellent Siren trilogy with deeply satisfying stealth mechanics that see you silently creep across an ominous, sepia toned Japanese village. It’s a tense and harrowing experience that arms you with limited offensive abilities, often leaving you waiting in the shadows as a nearby enemy passes, with only the sound of your own increasing heartbeat for company. Siren: Blood Curse is also home to some of the most horrific creature designs in gaming, with each one seemingly lifted straight from a Junji Ito drawing. Seeing them leap from the shadows never stops being utterly terrifying.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>14. Dead Space (2008)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/25/ign-30-horror-masterpieces-dead-space-1772034833463.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Ridley Scott’s 1979 film Alien proved that pitting regular workers against a nasty creature in a derelict spaceship was the perfect concoction for sci-fi horror, and 2008’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-space-2008">Dead Space</a> totally received the message loud and clear. It pitts engineer Isaac Clarke against some of the grossest looking aliens you’ve ever seen and arms him with little more than some rusty mining tools. Using a genius combat system that encourages you to target and dismember individual body parts, severing limbs and heads to slow enemies down, Dead Space took survival horror to bold new heights, and that’s before the anti-gravity sequences even kick in.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two sequels, along with spiritual successor in The Callisto Protocol, revisited this same thesis, as did the fantastic Dead Space remake in 2023. Unfortunately, the future of the franchise feels uncertain at the moment. Until it returns, though, the first game is always worth a playthrough, no matter which version you decide to experience.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>15. Amnesia: The Dark Descent (2010)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/25/ign-30-horror-masterpieces-amnesia-1772034863887.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Returning to video game horror’s adventure game roots, 2010’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/amnesia-the-dark-descent">Amnesia: The Dark Descent</a> relies - like Eternal Darkness - on its own twist on a sanity meter, this time tethering it to the darkness. Or, more specifically, how much time you opt to dwell in the shadows. Throw in some vintage H.P. Lovecraft inspiration and a big spooky castle trapping a character who - you guessed it - can’t remember why they’re there, and you’ve got a modern classic indie horror. It managed to connect deeply with tons of players, thanks largely to its unique physics-based puzzles and unforgettable story moments that culminate in big, satisfying ways. There’s an argument to be made that Amnesia: The Dark Descent might just be the scariest game ever made, even if you don’t scare easily.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>16. The Evil Within (2014)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/25/ign-30-horror-masterpieces-the-evil-within-1772034885027.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">2014’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-evil-within">The Evil Within</a> brought Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami back to his roots after he realized that survival horror games had begun to take a backseat to action horror. The first project of his then-new studio, Tango Gameworks, The Evil WIthin feels equal parts classic Resident Evil and the Saw film franchise, with a couple of dashes of things like 2003’s Manhunt thrown in like a nice stab in the gut. It’s a harrowing and deranged experience riddled with death traps, torture, violent enemies, and a general sense of hopelessness that pervades its overall tone. Despite being much more gruelling than any Resident Evil game, it still feels like the natural maturation of the classic survival horror formula, right down to its safe rooms where you can briefly disconnect from being hacked by blunt objects during a psychotic hallucination. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Evil Within also features an clever mechanic where downed enemies can come back to life if you dont burn their corpses with a match, a resource that’s just as hard to come by as bullets and healing items. It's a clear nod back to Mikami's remake of Resident Evil, which had a similar mechanic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like many classic horror films, the plot tends to take a backseat to the gore, death, and general creepy ambiance, but the overall experience feels so cohesively horror that it ultimately never really gets dragged down by its faults. Tango Gameworks followed things up with the equally successful The Evil Within 2 in 2017, as well as the open world first-person horror Ghostwire: Tokyo in 2020. In 2024, Shinji Mikami announced he was starting a new studio that will move its focus away from horror games, which is definitely a bummer for many, but hey, the guy is a legend responsible for some of the most incredible games ever made. As long as he’s making new ones, we’ll be happy, even if they aren’t designed specifically to terrify us.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>17.

Alien: Isolation pits Amanda Ripley, daughter of the original film’s Ellen Ripley, against a quick moving, unpredictable, and utterly vicious xenomorph in a painstakingly recreated retro-futuristic spaceship and the vibes are, as the kids say, immaculate. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout the experience the xenomorph’s artificial intelligence constantly learns new tricks, tracking your patterns to quite literally rip you out of your comfort zone. It’s not perfect; as one of the game’s original writers admits, the game goes on a tad too long - a sentiment many critics were saying at the time - but it’s such a mechanically and visually engrossing experience as a whole that it doesn’t really matter. And sure, it’s absolutely scary as hell, but it’s also such a total delight to be basking in this world if you’re a fan of the original Alien films. The team at Creative Assembly put so much love into recreating so much about what made those movies cool, although that does mean you have a pretty good chance of getting stabbed by a huge alien tail because you stand around gawking at the gorgeous ship interior details for too long. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative Assembly has since announced that a new Alien: Isolation game is in early stages of development, so hopefully it won’t be long until we’ll get to return to that special corner of space where no one can hear you scream. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>18. Five Nights at Freddy’s (2014)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/25/ign-30-horror-masterpieces-five-nights-at-freddys-1772034931446.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">If you grew up in the ‘80s and ‘90s, there was a strong chance one of your friends would invite you to a birthday party at Chuck E. Cheese; a glorified arcade that featured skeeball, rubbery pizza, and the world’s dirtiest ball pit full of sunken treasures like lost bouncy balls, someone’s missing left sock, and a dental retainer (and somehow those weren’t even the scariest things there.) Back in the party room, a bug-eyed animatronic band sang songs and made jerky movements behind fake instruments until the previously mentioned rubber pizza was served. The band and the spotlights above them would then shut down, cease moment, and ominously watch over you as you ate. Basically, it was nightmare fuel for any kid just trying to win enough arcade tickets to get a crappy prize. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Decades later, in 2014, developer Scott Cawthorn realized that this fast-food nightmare was the perfect setting for a horror game in which he could introduce a whole new generation to the Chuck E. Cheese backrooms, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy’s</a> was born. It turns that inspiration into a point and click adventure game in which you play a lonely night guard tasked with watching over Freddy's pizza restaurant once all the customers are gone, only now the animatronics are psychotic murderers that can’t wait to jump scare you and kill you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What specifically kicks ass about the FNAF games is that younger audiences who were generally shut out from the more violent and mature games in the genre latched on to them quickly, making them a global hit and creating a whole new generation of horror fans in the process. Five Nights spawned several sequels and two theatrically released films, and while the actual Chuck E. Cheese restaurants still exist in dwindling numbers across America, it’s safe to say that Freddy’s has surpassed Chuck E’s in pop culture popularity and propensity to scare children everywhere.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>19.

Bloodborne’s plagued city of Yharnam is entirely out to kill you, from brutal environmental hazards to its rogues’ gallery of gnarled monsters that lash out at you from the darkness. But underneath its oppressive and dimly lit themes of evil monstrosity is a fast paced, immensely satisfying action RPG with some of the best and most varied combat in the genre. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, Bloodborne and its masterfully created army of creatures will kill you over and over again, but every time you succeed in inching closer to its next shortcut, or taking down one of its many towering beasts with only a speck of your life remaining, you’ll leap off the couch jumping for joy and screaming in victory. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is a deep, complex story tying Bloodborne together, one that fans have interpreted in unique ways for over a decade now. Every inch of its dilapidated cobblestone streets, barren countryside, rotting alleyways, and impossibly magnificent castles feels packed with life, death, and lore, with a beautiful and haunting orchestral score swelling over it all. FromSoft went on to revisit similar feelings later in the excellent grim fantasy inspired games Dark Souls 3 and Elden Ring, but nothing has nailed horror as well as Bloodborne has. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>20.

SOMA opts to make you largely powerless against its wild array of both mechanical and organic enemies that trudge around a sunken research center on the ocean floor, focusing more on survival as the story beats are doled out little by little. It’s only when learning that things might not exactly be much better up there on land do things really start to congeal and become truly hopeless.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>21.

It took the deliberate construction of a great TV show, mixed it with the creative autonomy of a great video game, and created a wholly unique thing that felt both personal and powerful. It was the natural extension of games like 2010’s Heavy Rain, a pulpy serial killer story that played out differently depending on your choices and actions, leading to a variety of good, bad, and really bad endings. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2015, Supermassive Games revisited the concept with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/until-dawn">Until Dawn</a>, this time leaning on classic “young adults go somewhere they’re not supposed to be and start getting killed off one by one” movies while integrating the branching narrative functionality that only the medium of video games can offer. Until Dawn throws together tons of great slasher film tropes into an experience that works really well as a single player game and even better with a group of real life friends huddled around a television, frantically shouting their personal decision choices before watching characters die in violent and absurd ways. It’s an utter blast to replay over and over again, watching individual story beats play out differently, seeing how sparing a specific character from death might lead to another dying an even worse one, and so on. Until Dawn went on to get a prequel, a remake, a spiritual successor, and a film adaptation, so it’s clearly a concept with some life left in it, even if its protagonists rarely get to share the same fate.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>22.

Inside is once again a largely monochrome platforming game starring an emotionless little boy who will suddenly and frequently die to various environmental horrors in brutal and violent ways. As you explore his world, you slowly peel back the layers of the bigger picture... if he manages to survive the night, that is. It’s a far cry from the colorful hop and bop sidescrolling games that came before it, but that’s precisely why it works so well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are no walls of text to parse through, no voice over cutscenes. Just a sad, morose, minimalist story drip fed through simplistic imagery and a subtle-but-profound score that has more in common with an industrial engine room than a Koji Kondo soundtrack. And, like Limbo, it’s the kind of experience that begs to be unpacked and dissected through numerous interpretations long after the credits roll. Playdead is currently working on an unnamed third game that clearly takes visual cues from its previous work, and the sooner we learn more about it, the better.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>23.

And while watching a scary movie with others is great, it’s even more fun when you know one of them is the killer who's hunting down the rest of you. That’s why 2016’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead By Daylight</a> works so well. It's a brilliant, fast paced asymmetrical multiplayer game where one player takes on the role of a violent murderer while the rest try to team up to survive... or just scramble separately into the night where they’ll get picked off one by one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like many popular online games, such as Fortnite and Call of Duty, Dead by Daylight eventually became defined by its collaborations with other intellectual properties and brands. But being a horror game allowed it to introduce all sorts of licensed monsters from both movies and TV to join its roster of cunning and savage killers. Everyone from Freddy Krueger to Ghostface and even Chucky eventually made their way to the game, turning Dead by Daylight into a massive celebration of genre icons. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>24.

There’s a monster under the bed, a creature in the closet, and the shadow cast by a chandelier's flickering lightbulb is really a six foot tall venomous tarantula waiting to devour them... at least until the screams begin and their parents run in to tell them to go back to sleep because it’s all in their head. 2017’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/little-nightmares">Little Nightmares</a> builds on this idea, grabbing the iconic yellow raincoat from Stephen King’s IT and putting its young protagonist in a house of horrors that feels like playing hide and seek in a Tim Burton sketchbook. It mixes some truly fun monster designs with some occasionally frustrating game decisions, but it ultimately all balances out to become a special puzzle platforming horror game. In fact, the premise was so solid that Little Nightmares eventually went on to become a full trilogy of games, leading up to Tarsier’s Studios latest ambitious horror game, Reanimal. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>25. Visage (2020)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/25/ign-30-horror-masterpieces-visage-1772035079659.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">2014’s groundbreaking horror experience P.T. - aka “Playable Teaser” - brought together the minds of Hideo Kojima and Guillermo Del Toro for a claustrophobic, looping horror experience filled with terrifying surprises at every turn. Originally intended to lead up to a full-fledged modern reboot of the classic Silent Hill series, the universe (or, specifically, Konami) got in the way and the game was cancelled. P.T. was delisted from the PS4 store and all parties went their separate ways, leaving a gigantic “what if?” situation for gamers to slink into forever. It’s a bummer, as the potential of a collaboration between those two creative geniuses seemed limitless. On a more positive note, Kojima is working on a new horror game, Del Toro keeps making great horror movies, and in 2020, the talented folks at SadSquare Studios launched Visage, an excellent spiritual successor to P.T. So hey, not all is lost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/visage">Visage</a> revisits a similar premise as that seen in P.T., trapping you in a haunted house, tormenting you and slowly chipping away at your sanity as you explore and try and get to the bottom of exactly what went down to make the place so evil. It’s a genuinely unnerving experience, repeatedly succeeding in catching you off guard in bold and scary ways, largely due to the way each room feels natural, lived in, and deliberately staged. You rapidly begin to feel like the house is a real place where really bad things happen. Sure, it sucks that we never got the true follow up to P.T., but its potential lives on in the indie horror game scene. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>26. Resident Evil 2 (2019)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/25/ign-30-horror-masterpieces-resident-evil-2-remake-1772035099248.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">2012’s Resident Evil 6 was critically divisive and failed to reach internal sales goals, and so Capcom used this stumble as an opportunity to put the brakes on Resident Evil for a bit and come up with a brand new plan for the franchise. The result was a brilliant two pronged attack, led by 2017's Resident Evil 7, a taut first-person game that traded over the top action for tense survival horror, and quickly followed by a full remake of the 1998 classic, Resident Evil 2. But unlike Capcom’s previous Resident Evil remake, 2019’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a> ditched the tank controls and fixed camera angles, instead gaving you full, fluid control of movement and aiming. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The result was an absolute masterpiece, and proof that Capcom could take a decades-old game and make it feel both novel and nostalgic, honoring the original for older fans while modernizing the formula for newer players. And while 2020’s remake of 1999’s Resident Evil 3 missed the mark and felt like a slight step backwards, 2023’s remake of Resident Evil 4 picked things right back up and is largely regarded as one of the best video game remakes of all time. Overlapping with these releases was the excellent Resident Evil Village and now, in 2026, Resident Evil Requiem utilizes its two main characters to give players both the survival horror and action combat experiences that Resident Evil has been known for for decades. None of these achievements would have been possible without Resident Evil 2 and Capcom’s willingness to go back to its roots while also future proofing the series. It's exciting to think how, after 30 years, this legendary horror game franchise might only just be getting started. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>27. Phasmophobia (2020)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/25/ign-30-horror-masterpieces-phasmaphobia-1772035115970.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Resident Evil franchise continues to thrive by incorporating first-person horror, indie games have their own successes in the same space, doing groundbreaking and terrifying things with the perspective. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> is a brilliant ghost hunting simulator that can be played either solo or with friends, providing a deeply unnerving experience either way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the best indie horror games, combat is deemphasized in favor of survival, but unlike games that expect you to hide and wait out the night, Phasmophobia’s focus on paranormal investigation means you’re forced to head deeper and deeper into its world to document everything you see. And man, you will see some shit. And as is the case in the previously mentioned Eternal Darkness, your character’s sanity is actively hindered by the ghosts you witness or interact with. This formula turned out to be a smash hit with the streaming crowd, as it turns out the only thing more fun than watching one player suffer in fear is watching a group of friends go through hell together. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>28. Alan Wake 2 (2023)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/25/ign-30-horror-masterpieces-alan-wake-2-1772035331742.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">13 years after the original Alan Wake and four years after their monumental and subversive action game Control, the folks at Remedy Entertainment released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/alan-wake-ii">Alan Wake 2</a>, a stunning psychological horror game that blends two different protagonist’s stories together to create one of the most unique experiences of all time. At first glance, Alan Wake 2 might seem like your standard issue third-person action horror game, but things very quickly go completely off the rails and the experience becomes one of the least predictable horror stories of all time - a pretty stunning achievement considering how deep the genre had run by the time of its release. It’s also one of the best looking games ever made, thriving for photorealism in everything from its foliage to its facial hair. Its most interesting achievement, though, is the way it balances gritty murder investigation work with insane Twin Peaks absurdity, hitting comedy high notes just as well as it hits the horror ones. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>29.

There’s something spectacularly creepy about a lo-fi aesthetic, fuzzy textures, warbled sound effects, and weird, obtuse characters. After all, that’s the backbone of so many early horror video games, which were built around hardware and technology limitations. That approach created a look and feel that seemed mindblowing at the time, felt dated years later, and has now looped back around to being a specific style people are genuinely nostalgic for. 2022’s Signalis understood the assignment when it used beefed-up PS1 era graphics to tell a modern sci-fi horror story. 2024’s bleak and violent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mouthwashing">Mouthwashing</a> took things even further while stripping back gameplay mechanics to a bare minimum, focusing on exploration and limited interactivity in a derelict ship lost in space, weaving together stories from both before and after the crash to feed you a delirious double-crossing horror story where no one can be trusted and things just keep getting more and more insane. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>30.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/far-far-west-helldivers-robot-cowboy-demo-co-op-steam-next-fest-pc-review-2000674562</link>
            <guid>1449487</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Do you like <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><em>Helldivers 2</em>,</a> but wish its gameplay loop of dropping into a hostile environment solo or with buddies, completing some side objectives, a main mission, and then escaping by holding back waves of enemies and extracting via vehicle was a bit more chill? Maybe a bit more cowboy-themed, too? Well, one of the most popular demos out now as part of <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-next-fest-best-demos-free-seth-mythmatch-2000673268">Steam’s Next Fest</a>, for a game called <em>Far Far West,</em> makes it seem like exactly the game you’ve been wanting.</p>

 <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3819240/Far_Far_West_Demo/"><em>Far Far West</em> is from the indie devs at Evil Raptor,</a> the same small team behind the excellent <a href="https://kotaku.com/pumpkin-jack-is-colorful-halloween-action-game-1845056040"><em>Pumpkin Jack</em></a> and the good-if-a-bit-flawed <em>Akimbot</em>. Unlike those single-player action platformers, however, the studio’s next game is a co-op (or solo) mission-based first-person <em>Helldivers</em>-like robot cowboy adventure. And folks, it’s a blast to play even in this unfinished demo stage.</p>  <p>The basic gameplay loop of <em>Far Far Wes</em>t has you and up to three other players hopping into a large western-themed map to complete small side objectives and open-world activities before deciding to take on the map’s boss in a big final fight. Each run rewards you with a few different currenices and XP, letting you upgrade your rifles, pistols, and magic spells (robot magic!), and equip joker cards that offer bonus abilities and special traits. I found one card that let me do extra damage when I was low on health. Useful! Another card would sometimes make headshots spit out confetti. Useless, but very funny!</p> <p>Like <em>Helldivers</em>, you can explore the entire map and complete everything, or just go straight to the big finale mission and then (hopefully) escape alive via a hover train.</p>

 <p>This is a very rewarding loop, but that alone doesn’t make<em> Far, Far West</em> worth playing. The actual reason I enjoyed the demo so much was how well it plays. Guns feel both snappy and hefty in a way that makes blasting away skeleton armies a blast. I also really loved how movement feels in <em>Far, Far West</em>, with its air dashes and big jumps. You also have a horse you can ride whenever you want, which makes it easy to get across empty sections of the world.</p>

 <p>The magic spells, while a bit odd in this cowboy sci-fi world, add an extra layer of depth to the combat. The acid spell doesn’t just spit out damage-dealing green goo; you (or your buddies) can shoot a fireball at the puddles and blow it all up, and any enemies nearby along with it.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000674577" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674577"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674577">© Evil Raptor / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Between missions, you return to a little Wild West-themed town, complete with a saloon, sheriff’s office, and a few different vendors and shops that let you upgrade your gear, guns, and abilities using the resources you collect from missions. There’s also a shooting range where you can try out new guns or upgrades, something I’d love to see in <em>Helldivers 2</em>, actually.</p>

 <p>The vibes in town, like in the missions, are a bit more laid back, at least on lower difficulties, compared to those in <em>Helldivers 2</em>. You don’t die as fast. Enemies don’t hit as hard. It’s a bit easier to stick around and fight, even if you make mistakes. But be warned: If you crank up the challenge, <em>Far Far West</em> will slap you down quickly and teach you a lesson.</p> <p>I’m excited to play the full game when it launches sometime later this year in early access. I also hope it gets a console port, as I know my friend group that plays primarily on console would sink hours and hours into <em>Far Far West.</em></p>

<figure><a title="Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162441/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>When <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/elder_scrolls_v_skyrim">Skyrim</a> featured in the Switch reveal trailer back in 2016, it was a statement of intent for the system. This was a big title in every sense of the word, and for the first time, Nintendo-only console owners could step into a Bethesda RPG and take it on the go, too. Sure, it was yet another version of a terminally re-released game, but it was also a key selling point for Switch.</p>
<p><strong>Fallout</strong>, the post-apocalyptic sister series to <strong>Elder Scrolls</strong>, has never had a mainline entry on Nintendo hardware. Aside from the vault management sim <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fallout_shelter">Fallout Shelter</a> back in 2018, Nintendo players have largely missed out. That makes the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a> on Switch 2 worthy of real fanfare.</p>
<p>The second season of the TV show has rekindled interest in the franchise and alongside rumours of remasters of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/fallout_3">Fallout 3</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/fallout_new_vegas">New Vegas</a>, now feels like the perfect time to strap on the big iron and go for a wander.</p>
<figure><a title="Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162435/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Much like its fantasy counterpart, Fallout presents a huge open world that is easy to get lost in. It is packed with hundreds of quests, branching narratives, and NPCs driven by dynamic AI. The result is a living, breathing, and frequently broken world (more on that later).</p>
<p>Set in the irradiated wasteland of the Commonwealth — Boston and its surrounding areas — Fallout 4 offers a standalone adventure within the franchise's broader timeline. Your created character is torn from their idyllic suburban life when atomic war breaks out, forcing them to seek refuge in one of many corporate-built vaults. Awakened from cryogenic slumber, they witness the murder of their partner and the kidnapping of their infant son. Emerging into a world of mutated monsters and fractured tribal societies, they begin a desperate search to find their child.</p>
<figure><a title="Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162430/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You take on this new frontier using a combination of stealth, melee, and firearm skills, shaping your character through a versatile upgrade system. Combat leans heavily into the series' stylistic calling card, the slo-mo combat system V.A.T.S.</p>
<p>Like previous entries, the main quest is merely a jumping-off point for the wider mountain of tasks and diversions your wastelander will undertake. Along the way, you encounter different factions trying to survive and shape this crumbling world. Some, like the totalitarian Brotherhood of Steel, pursue domination through fascist ideology. Others, like the clandestine Institute, seek to rebuild civilisation through science.</p>
<p>You are free to pursue any of these groups up to a point, each faction questline leading to a late-game decision that will fundamentally change the main story's conclusion.</p>
<figure><a title="Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162426/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Alternatively, you can just do… whatever you want. The wasteland is a gigantic sandbox, and there are no restrictions on your exploration. It's often the case that Bethesda Fallout titles carry their best content in ignorable side tasks, and that is certainly true here.</p>
<p>Starting strong with some great setpieces, your mission to find Shaun is ultimately shallow and convoluted. The best things to do in the Commonwealth happen off this beaten narrative path. Unlocking the mysteries of Cabot House or reliving the adventures of Silver Shroud are clear highlights among many. Elsewhere, there are one-off encounters and a wealth of locations to plunder. These moments capture Fallout at its most creative and memorable.</p>
<p>Then there’s the biggest diversion that Fallout 4 brought to the franchise - settlements. Early in your travels, you will meet Preston Garvey and his Minutemen, who guide you through building makeshift homes for wasteland survivors. Think of it like a post-apocalyptic <strong>Animal Crossing</strong>, except you have to defend your villagers from bandits high on Jet and Psycho.</p>
<figure><a title="Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162427/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Like most aspects of Fallout 4, this surprisingly deep base-building can be largely ignored. It’s a love-it-or-hate-it time sink, so feel free to skip right over it, or alternatively spend hundreds of hours rebuilding civilisation in your own image.</p>
<p>This toolset is further expanded by the numerous workshop bundles included in the Anniversary Edition. This bumper, all-in package is also bolstered by shorter questlines like Nuka World and Automatron, the latter of which introduces customisable robot companions.</p>
<p>The main course of extra content is the excellent Far Harbour. Here, you join synth companion Nick Valentine on an expedition to the titular island. This expansion features new quests, enemies, and compelling faction storylines.</p>
<p>So, Fallout 4 is a game that’s constantly giving, bursting at the seams with content and endlessly replayable thanks to a deep upgrade system and multiple routes through the story. But content is one thing, experience is another. This is a Bethesda RPG and Switch 2 port; the proof will ultimately be in the optimisation.</p>
<figure><a title="Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162428/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You have three performance modes to choose from in the main menu. 30, 40, and 60fps offer quality, balanced and performance options, respectively. Given this game is a couple of generations old and has been optimised for the current platforms, all of these modes are pleasingly stable from a visual standpoint.</p>
<p>Higher frame modes add softer edges to textures, which mars the fidelity of the long-distance vistas somewhat. There is also the occasional frame dip in busier scenes on any mode, but these issues are rare across a long playthrough.</p>
<p>I chose to play mostly at 40fps as it removed that texture smoothing and maintained stable frames. It’s worth noting that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/fallout-4-on-switch-2-is-getting-dlss-support-and-stability-improvements">an announced update</a> will add DLSS to 40 and 60fps modes, alongside some stability fixes.</p>
<p>Far more pronounced than the occasional frame hiccup is the rich suite of bugs and technical issues carried over from previous incarnations of the game. Unfortunately, the Switch 2 version does not make any effort to iron out these kinks.</p>
<figure><a title="Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162439/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I spent most of my playthrough dealing with a bug that completely disabled sprint (reminder to always be saving, people). This isn’t a fun issue to have when you have alpha Deathclaws snapping at your back. I also suffered multiple audio issues, scripting glitches, and good old-fashioned crashes. Much like the performance fluctuations, these bugs become diluted over a long enough period. They still frustrate every time they occur, though.</p>
<p>It’s customary for Bethesda titles to arrive on a new platform with an existing suite of issues still intact, of course. It’s just a shame that Fallout’s first appearance on a Nintendo console is blighted by a less-than-optimal experience.</p>
<p>Further disappointment comes from the complete lack of Switch 2 system features, such as gyro or mouse controls. Mouse control in particular feels egregious, especially considering how comfortably the series plays on PC.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In spite of its issues, Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition remains a key title for the console. It’s a hugely generous package that looks great and, much like Skyrim before it, is very enjoyable to play undocked.</p>
<p>It’s Fallout, on Switch 2. A giant experience, overflowing with content and featuring some of the best quests in the series, and a mostly great visual optimisation that tests patience with more bugs than a bloatfly nest. If you can endure its (many) technical shortcomings, there are hundreds of hours of solid RPG here.</p></section>

              <p><span>Leon Kennedy has become known for many things over the course of the </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>series, including his stylish fighting style, good looks, and the fact that he cannot shut the fuck up in even the most dire of circumstances.</span></p> <p><span>The Raccoon City cop turned anti-bioterrorism agent loves to crack wise even when a zombie’s got its teeth at his neck, and my guy does not let up on that in </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span>. So I decided to take note of all his one-liners and decide which are the best ones. We won’t be getting into major story spoilers here, but in giving context to Leon’s remarks, we’ll be making vague references to some events. Here are all of his quips, ranked from the blandest to the most delightfully stupid. Reader discretion is advised.</span></p>

 <p><span><strong>“Didn’t realize I had such a big fan. How about an autograph?”</strong> – Leon after a rando enemy says he’s been waiting to fight him</span></p> <p><span><strong>“When was the last time you brushed your teeth?”</strong> – Leon, while being interrogated by an infected man with fucked-up teeth</span></p> <p><span><strong>“Funny, I don’t remember getting an invitation.”</strong> – Leon, upon being told a bioterrorist doctor he’s been tracking was expecting his arrival</span></p> <p><span><strong>“Well, that’s my cardio for the week.”</strong> – Leon after defeating a wave of zombies that cornered him in an office room</span></p> <p><span><strong>“I don’t have time for pest control.”</strong> – Leon while fighting a giant spider</span></p> <p><span><strong>“I missed that Raccoon City hospitality.”</strong> – Leon after killing a giant spider</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[“I Think The New Xbox Console Is Already Dead, They’ve Blown It by Embracing Game Pass”, Says Michael Pachter]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As regular readers of gaming news know all too well, <strong>Wedbush Securities</strong> Strategic Advisor <strong>Michael Pachter</strong> is not one to mince words, always speaking his mind regardless. In 2018, he famously <a href="https://wccftech.com/pachter-loot-boxes-consumers-are-stupid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> <strong>loot boxes only existed because consumers were stupid</strong>. In 2022, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-vastly-overpaid-for-bungie-says-pachter-unlike-microsoft-take-two-for-activision-blizzard-zynga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">criticized Sony</a> for <strong>vastly overpaying Bungie in the $3.6 billion acquisition</strong>, especially compared to <strong>Microsoft</strong>'s acquisition of <strong>Activision Blizzard</strong> and <strong>Take-Two</strong>'s acquisition of <strong>Zynga</strong>. </p>



<p>In the same year, he also <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-to-reach-100-million-when-activision-games-are-added-says-pachter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prophesied</a> that <strong>Xbox Game Pass</strong> active subscribers <strong>would blow up to 100 million when Activision Blizzard games were added,</strong> and literally doubled down on the prediction in 2024, when he <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-will-get-to-200-million-subs-in-10-years-bets-michael-pachter-exclusivity-model-is-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> <strong>Game Pass could reach 200 million active subscribers in 10 years</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://gamesbeat.com/the-internet-reacts-to-departure-of-phil-spencer-and-sarah-bond-from-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a brief conversation with GamesBeat</a> (available only to GB Max users) following the leadership change at <strong>Microsoft</strong>, Pachter has now completely modified his stance. To begin with, <strong>he wasn't positive at all about the next Xbox console</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-gen-might-launch-2027-but-its-best-case-scenario/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which is currently targeting a tentative 2027 launch</a>), and that's precisely because of Game Pass.</p>



<p><em>I think the console is dead. I think they’ve already blown it with the console by embracing Game Pass.</em></p>



<p>Wasn't Pachter pro-Game Pass? He was, but he appears to have changed his mind following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent Game Pass restructuring</a> (and price increase), <strong>which he strongly believes is the wrong model</strong>.</p>



<p><em>The problem with Game Pass was it was all or nothing. Give me 30 bucks a month or f*** you. You aren’t playing my games. Why wouldn’t you sell EA Sports FC to the 100 million people who would like to play it but don’t want to buy a console? Of course you should. I think that’s the ultimate solution, leveraging Microsoft’s game library, live ops understanding and cloud infrastructure to be like Steam, but for connectivity.</em></p>



<p><em>If they ever did that, I think it would work. I think the all-in on $30 a month subscription was the wrong way to go. The price should be $10 a month, all you can eat. Who’s going to pay for a buffet knowing it’s five times the cost of a meal? How can you make a business charging people $360 a year up front when a game costs only $70? They should have run it like a cafeteria. That’s their mistake.</em></p>



<p>He does have a point: <strong>Microsoft likely cannot have its cake and eat it, too</strong>. By pushing so heavily on Game Pass and the multiplatform strategy, <strong>they have decreased the value of owning an Xbox console</strong>, as shown by the console's hardware sales over the last three or four years. But now, with the Game Pass price increase, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-subscription-cancel-page-overwhelmed-after-game-pass-price-hike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they've also lost many subscribers</a> who believe paying that much for the service isn't really worth it anymore</strong>. </p>



<p>According to recent rumors, Microsoft <strong>might be looking to add more <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-could-be-merged-with-pc-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third-party</a> and/or <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-considering-adding-wow-subscription-game-pass-ultimate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first-party</a> services to make Game Pass Ultimate a more attractive proposition at $30</strong>, but it might already be too late to turn the ship. </p>

<p>With a relatively slim week for reviews, we had plenty of other features. For the previews, Steve sunk into the cosmic horror of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/23/cthulhu-the-cosmic-abyss-brings-investigation-to-the-fore-in-a-way-that-youll-lovecraft-to-see/"><strong>Cthulu: The Cosmic Abyss</strong></a>, while Dom climbed the Scoville Scale with some <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/24/dosa-divas-preview-is-this-2026s-spiciest-rpg/"><strong>Dosa Divas</strong></a>.

<p>There was plenty of juicy news this week, as we saw <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/balatro">Balatro</a> arrive in an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/balatros-back-to-steal-all-your-spare-time-in-new-switch-2-version">all-new Switch 2 version</a> (RIP our spare time), Nintendo continued to release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/donkey-kong-bananza-has-been-updated-to-version-3-2-0">waves of updates</a>, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/poll-whats-your-favourite-3ds-model">3DS turned 15</a>, and that's not to mention everything we heard in the annual <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/pokemon-presents-february-2026-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">Pokémon Day Presents</a> showcase.</p>
<p>It was reviews that stole the show this time, however, as we shared our thoughts on a bunch of Resident Evils — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Village Gold Edition</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">7/10</a>), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Biohazard Gold Edition</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">9/10</a>) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Requiem</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">9/10</a>) — as well as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rayman_30th_anniversary_edition">Rayman: 30th Anniversary Edition</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/rayman-30th-anniversary-edition">7/10</a>), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/caves_of_qud">Caves of Qud</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/caves-of-qud">8/10</a>) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/disney-afternoon-collection">The Disney Afternoon Collection</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-disney-afternoon-collection">8/10</a>).</p>
<p>Now then, what's everyone up to this weekend?</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:198088,198072 @ 1772294688 -->
<h2>Alex Olney, Senior Video Producer</h2>
<p>As much as I'd like to say I'm planning on playing Resident Evil Requiem this weekend, I can't make that claim. That's because I've already completed it like the cheeky boy that I am. Instead, I'll be dipping my toes into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown">Star Trek: Voyager - Across The Unknown</a>, and probably spending 50% of that time allocated to Janeway's adventures in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ball_x_pit">BALL x PIT</a> because I have a problem.</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Apologies for the last two weeks of silence, haven’t had much time for video games due to “adulting”, but I'll make it up this week because not only is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-rave-racer">Arcade Archives 2 Rave Racer</a> on the grid, but something else I have been quite looking forward to: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/raiden_fighters_remix_collection">Raiden Fighters Remix Collection</a>! Time to dust off my arcade stick. Oh, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fur_squadron">FUR Squadron</a> sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fur_squadron_phoenix">FUR Squadron Phoenix</a>, has been released without much fanfare and is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/star_fox_64">Star Fox 64</a> in all but name. Do a barrel roll… ish! Rounding it all off is a major update on <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/warhammer_40000_space_marine_2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> that brings the new Tech Marine class to the table. Bless the Omnissiah and whatnot... but where is the Switch 2 port?</p>
<p>My game of the week is Resident Evil Requiem. It has been a very long time since I played a Resi game on release day (I believe <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/resident_evil_2">Resident Evil 2</a> 2019 remake was the last), and seeing the latest RE Engine entry in the series running this well on Switch 2 gives me great hope for future Capcom support on the system.</p>
<h2>Mai Ladyman, Video Producer</h2>
<p>After playing the ever-so-lovely <strong>Resi</strong> games for the review on Monday, I think my nerves need a wee break with some cosy games. I've been playing even more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disney_dreamlight_valley">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dave_the_diver">Dave The Diver</a> (I'm obsessed now) and some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cast_n_chill">Cast n Chill</a>. I still intend on jumping back onto Resi 7 &amp; Village as I really enjoyed both of them. I'm determined to have nerves of steel by the end of the year!</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm still on my classic Pokémon kick with all the 'mon news in recent weeks and have been enjoying training up my <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/pokemon_emerald">Emerald</a> squad after getting sufficiently <em>whooped</em> by Tate and Liza in Mossdeep's Psychic Gym. It really takes me back to the good old days, and I'm doing everything in my power to resist dropping 20 quid on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">FireRed</a> this weekend to do it all over again on Switch.</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This week is the Steam Next Fest, and though I usually abhor playing a demo (I'm too hungry to eat just a snack), I have been playing tons of demos on stream this week to entertain my friends! It's been a mixed bag, for sure, but some real gems in there, too. I'm going to be keeping an eye out for any of them coming to Switch, so I can say "aha! I knew it was good ages ago. I am very cool" and everyone will nod and respect me for my deep wisdoms. That's the plan, anyway.</p>

<p>Capcom has done it again</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Capcom has done a great job with the Switch 2 port of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, but if you're still debating about it and the PlayStation 5 release, you've come to the right place.</p>
<p>We've <a href="https://youtu.be/8izgK3xQHWY">shared a side-by-side comparison</a> of the game running on the Switch 2 and the PS5 Pro, and as you can see, the wizards behind other Switch 2 ports such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> have done it again!</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/reviews/dlss-is-the-game-changer-for-resident-evil-requiems-impressive-switch-2-port?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">Digital Foundry</a> mentioned in its own technical analysis, the Switch 2 is running a low internal resolution in docked but this version and the PS5 release actually end up comparing "fairly equivocally", and it's all thanks to DLSS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Digital Foundry:</strong> On paper, a 540p image blown up to 1080p on a modern flat panel display doesn't sound great. However, DLSS looks surprisingly competitive. Fine detail like wires and fences can actually appear more temporally stable on Switch 2, while PS5's spatial upscaling solution (likely FSR1 or similar) looks noisier and less refined in motion. PS5 still wins overall on clarity, aided by its higher internal resolution and 4K UI (Switch 2 uses a 1080p UI), but the gap is much narrower than raw pixel counts would suggest."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In terms of cutbacks, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/digital-foundry-delivers-its-tech-analysis-of-resident-evil-requiem-on-switch-2-capcom-deserves-kudos-for-this-port">as previously noted</a>, geometry is pared back in the Switch 2 version and there are lower-quality textures. Capcom has also taken a "different" approach to the character hair design on Nintendo's new hardware, but overall it's a solid effort.</p>

<p>Game Freak is moving on from the original Switch hardware</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="8367be104bdbb"><a title="Pokémon Winds And Waves" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8367be104bdbb/pokemon-winds-and-waves.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since the arrival of the Switch 2 generation last year, certain first-party titles have received cross-platform releases. Trainers saw this with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, but this won't be the case for the new mainline entry <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-winds-and-waves">Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves</a>.</p>
<p>In case you somehow missed it, The Pokémon Company has clearly stated in official press materials and the new webpage how these next-generation entries developed by Game Freak are "exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2". In other words, Nintendo's existing hybrid platform isn't part of the plans.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fsulywt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Developed by GAME FREAK exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2, these new titles feature an open world to explore, with beautiful windswept islands and a vast ocean with glittering waves."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At a glance, this new generation is already looking quite promising, and Game Freak potentially has over a year to polish the experience, with the titles currently scheduled for a 2027 release.</p>
<p>So, this means <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet</a> and Legends: Z-A are likely the last "major" new entries that will be released on Nintendo's original Switch hardware.</p>
<p>Nintendo previously said it would continue supporting the original Switch as long as there's an audience, but also understands "exclusive games are crucial when launching new hardware" and intends to shift support to its new hybrid system as the fan base grows.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>This article contains </em><em><strong>spoilers</strong></em><em> for Resident Evil Requiem. </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem finally sees the series return to Raccoon City, so it’ll surprise no one that it’s campaign is loaded with Easter eggs and references to the past. From deep cuts referencing 1998’s Resident Evil 2, to nods to more modern games in the franchise, here are 28 brilliant little details we’ve spotted in Resident Evil Requiem so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For veteran fans, the unquestionable highlight of Requiem is Leon’s return to the RPD. Well, its ruins – it definitely didn’t look like this last time. As expected, the dilapidated department is packed with references to the past.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>1. </strong>Before you enter the doors of the Raccoon City Police Department, you'll notice the streets around you feel very familiar. Look behind you, and you’ll see the <strong>tanker</strong> that separated Leon and Claire, and then subsequently exploded, still in the exact same position it was 28 years prior.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/sakura-1772205559303.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>2. </strong>Right next to the tanker is a building with <strong>ARUKAS</strong> written on it, which is a reference back to the original 1998 game, which in turn referenced Street Fighter Alpha 2’s Sakura. Arukas is Sakura spelt backwards. Perhaps surprisingly, that isn’t the only Street Fighter reference you can find, but there are a couple of steps before we get there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once Leon is finally reunited with the RPD, he’s flooded with memories of his traumatic experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>3. </strong>In Resident Evil 2, just before you’re introduced to the Licker, you find a dead police officer with its jaw sliced almost completely off. 28 years later, <strong>that police officer</strong> (well, his skeleton) is still in that exact same position, now notably sans jaw.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/weird-puzzle-1772205622401.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>4. </strong>Also still in the RPD are the remnants of all the strange puzzles Leon and Claire had to solve, frozen in time and covered in dust. The <strong>Lion statue puzzle</strong> in the main hall is declared by Leon to be the oddest of them all when he says, “This puzzle was weird”.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>5. </strong>A trip to RPD wouldn’t be complete without a snoop around the <strong>S.T.A.R.S office</strong>, and although you can find lots of cool details in there, such as Jill’s beret, it’s Barry’s scavenger hunt that’s the most fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After following the two clues, you’ll find a hidden key for a locker. This key has the word Jojo written on it, and for those who don’t know, Jojo is a reference to the Japanese manga JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, which was also written on a locker in the original 1998 version of Resident Evil 2.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/joj-1772205685222.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>6. </strong>The Jojo key opens a locker that contains a whole host of goodies, including Barry’s gift of two tickets to the <strong>Raccoon City Zoo</strong>, a location that appears in the Resident Evil Outbreak series, which also happens to be the game our hero Grace’s mom, Alyssa, is from.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/ps1-1772205655087.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>7. </strong>At the base of this locker, though, is a wealth of PS1 nostalgia, which includes boxed copies of the <strong>original Resident Evil, Street Fighter Alpha 2 and Mega-Man 8</strong>. There’s also a poster for Street Fighter Alpha and what looks to be a TEMU PS1 that looks more like a Sega Saturn than a classic PlayStation.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/tofu-1772205723794.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>8. </strong>Later on, on the ground floor of the RPD, you can spot random appearances through the cracks in the wall of everyone’s favourite edible hero, <strong>Tofu</strong>, who was an unlockable playable character in the original Resident Evil 2. Tofu, beret and all, peeks out to say hello. And yes, if you’re quick enough, you can pop a shot at him to do some damage to his squishy consistency.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not sure what the exact trigger is for Tofu, but it feels like it’s just after you pick up Barry’s To Do List, which also appears to be the trigger for the next detail.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/rebecca-1772205744242.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>9. </strong>Wesker’s desk drawer is now an infamous location in the history of Resident Evil 2. In the remake, it contains a weapon component; in the original, after hitting the action prompt 50 times, you were “rewarded” with an inappropriate photo of Rebecca Chambers. In 2026, after looking at Barry’s to-do list, you’ll find a note about a book called ‘Medicinal Benefit of Herbs’, showing that it’s been returned to the library by Wesker. Make your way over to the library to find this book, look inside, and once again you’ll find <strong>the photo of Rebecca</strong>, with a note referring to her as “Rising Rookie Rebecca”. RRR then happens to be the code for Wesker’s briefcase, in which you find a charm of his iconic sunglasses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>10. </strong>Once you’ve left the RPD, make sure to head left, and you’ll be able to revisit the <strong>parking garage</strong>, the location where Leon first met love interest/frenemy, Ada Wong. In here, you’ll find a <strong>cute bear charm</strong>, the same one seen on the keys that Ada hands to Leon in Resident Evil 4.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/mr-x-1772205784653.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>11. </strong>In the RPD, you’ll once again come face-to-face with <strong>Mr. X</strong>. But did you notice that Grace actually bumps into him, too? Well, not really, but the guy that she brushes against the streets of Wrenwood at the very start of the game sure does look like he’s wearing Mr.X's outfit…complete with the fedora hat he wears in the RE2 remake.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/hunk-1772205801324.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>12. </strong>Like Tofu and Mr. X, there’s also another returning Resident Evil 2 legend, who, although never outright named, is quite clearly everyone’s favourite no-nonsense mercenary, <strong>Hunk</strong>. This unlockable character from the original Resident Evil 2 (and many games that came after) turns up as a boss in Requiem’s final act, and somewhat lives up to his legacy, with Leon declaring him to be a tough bastard after they duke it out to the death. RIP Hunk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil 2 isn’t the only game from the series referenced in Requiem, though, with the previous entry, Resident Evil Village, also getting a couple of nods.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>13. </strong>Just after you reach the helipad, you enter a room full of items to examine. One of these is a <strong>wine bottle</strong> which has the name Dimiterscu written on it, clearly referring to everyone’s favourite goth mummy from Resident Evil Village. The bottle is labelled “Sanguis Virginis”, which is the same wine used to solve a puzzle in Village’s castle location.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/mother-m-1772205831801.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>14. </strong>Later on, in Spencer’s study, you can see a picture of a lone woman with the letter M on it. This refers to <strong>Mother Miranda</strong>, the big bad of Resident Evil Village and (as we find out at the end of that game) Ozwell E. Spencer’s idol and inspiration.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/rings-1772205849284.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>15. </strong>One of Requiem’s big bads is Victor Gideon, who sports some significant jewellery. Look close and you can see a <strong>snake motif</strong> on his ring. The same snake motif is seen on Krauser’s knife in RE4. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>16. </strong>Requiem also has a reference to the silliest of Resident Evil’s puzzles, with Grace pointing out the <strong>ludicrous systems of opening doors</strong> in these zombie-infested mansions. When inserting the Red Gem into a door at the Rhodes Hill Care Center, Grace rightly states, “How do normal people get in here?” </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>17. </strong>But perhaps no door in Resident Evil is more iconic than the <strong>original game's loading screen animations </strong>between rooms, something that is referenced near the beginning of the game with a slow zoom on the door before the chainsaw-wielding Doctor attacks Leon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That battle is complete chaos, with a host of cool interactions with the chainsaw. There are a couple of brilliant details you might miss, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>18. </strong>The chainsaw is unwieldy at the best of times, spinning wildly when on the floor. If you manage to kill a zombie while they’re still holding it, <strong>the chainsaw will end up dragging the fallen flesh eaters</strong> along for the ride.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/chainsaw-1772205889416.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>19. </strong>A zombie can also be impaled with a still-operational chainsaw, the revving blade protruding straight through their rib cage. Don’t let them get too close, though, because if they grab you, then <strong>they’ll drive their chest with the chainsaw directly into yours</strong>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>20.</strong> It’s quite clear that many of the other zombies roaming the halls of the Rhodes Hill Care Center have their own personalities, but there are also <strong>medical records </strong>you can find that share their names and defining traits, with a personal favourite being Eileen Zimmerson, one of the singing zombies whose personality disorder is described as “main character syndrome”.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>21.</strong> Meanwhile, the enormous mass grinding its way through the hallways who we know as “Chunk” is actually called <strong>Thomas K. Jackson</strong>, and the version Leon takes on is called <strong>Timothy B. Jackson</strong>. So they’re actually brothers, both with irregular eating pattern disorders.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>22. </strong>Interestingly, several zombies still retain traits from their mortal existence, like the <strong>cleaning zombie</strong>, who is super focused on scrubbing the blood out of the mirror. She will, however, also move locations to clean up the gore you create by killing other zombies.  </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/helicopter-1772205936816.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>23. </strong>Later on, when Grace and Emily meet Harry Reed, most would progress on with the story while Emily is safe in the helicopter. If you’re a psycho, though, Capcom has prepared <strong>custom dialogue</strong> for Harry should you, for some reason, decide to unload on the whirlybird.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/learn-to-stter-1772205964214.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>24. </strong>Capcom has also layered subtle instructions into the environment when Leon first takes to the motorbike in Raccoon City, with a billboard appearing very early on that says <strong>“Learn to Steer”</strong> just after the player takes control.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>25. </strong>Leon is a master with his equipment, as shown when using a flashlight with his handgun. When you go to reload, Leon will smoothly <strong>tuck the flashlight into his shoulder</strong>, making for a very slick and detailed animation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>26. </strong>Also interesting: when reloading, both Grace and Leon will <strong>retain the magazine</strong> if there are still rounds in it. If it’s empty, they’ll discard it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The final details are, at the time of writing this, part of an unsolved mystery, so answers might be out there by the time you watch this, but they’re super cool nonetheless.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/just-ignore-a-1772205981770.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>27. </strong>After taking out the Tyrant, you’ll notice a basketball court with a <strong>suspicious-looking head</strong> in the middle. Shuffle kick that head along until it goes through the hoop, and you’ll get a new action prompt that tells you “There’s no time for playing around”. Instead of pushing forward to the orphanage, head back to Kendo’s gun shop, and you’ll now find a prompt on a headless Toy Uncle bobblehead that reads “just ignore A”. Our first theory was that this was a reference to the ending choice, since the first option (or "A" ending) isn’t the canon one, but we’ve since stumbled on something else that might explain it further…</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>28. </strong>The <strong>final mystery</strong> is a doozy that we’ve yet to solve, but here are the hidden clues we have so far. After your escape from The Girl in the elevator shaft, her arm will be severed and available to pick up. It didn’t appear to serve any purpose until we decided to run it through the analysis machine you use to upgrade your crafting recipes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After solving this puzzle, you’re shown a black screen that says ‘Let’s Play’, and a sequence of letters: G,A,U, and C. Based on the prior clue, I think it’s safe to ignore A. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/lets-play-1772206008985.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Hidden in the game are some clues to what these letters mean. In an hourglass you can find and rotate, U is revealed to be linked to the number 380,000. In Grace’s blood analysis report, C is 4.2 LY, and on the side of the blood analyser device, there’s a sticker that says G = 15,000,000.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What does all this mean? Well, our guess was that it’s the distance to the moon, sun, and nearest star, which also happens to be the sequence buttons for the puzzles in the Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center. After using the G, U, C sequence and translating them into moon, sun, and star inputs for the machine, entering that code triggers a creepy laughter sound effect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What does that mean? That’s where we’re stumped! Hopefully, you’ll already have the answers and can drop it in the comments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s everything we’ve spotted so far in Resident Evil Requiem. Did we miss any cool Easter eggs, or are there small gameplay details we missed? Let us know in the comments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Dale Driver is an Associate Director of Video Programming at IGN.

But of all the newcomers to that space, none have captured my attention more than Marathon since I first played its early alpha over a year ago. Even through some of Bungie’s recent lows, the idea of taking the high-stakes looting deathmatch that is an extraction shooter and combining it with the unparalleled shooting for which the studio is known has always been an awesome idea. Now, after playing Marathon for the better part of a day as it kicks off its server slam ahead of launch next week, that rad concept seems to have turned out about as well as I was hoping it would, with absolutely stellar gunplay, some interesting characters and lore, ands a a loot grind that’s made it hard to step away long enough to even write this initial review. It’s still way too early for me to say if any of this will have staying power all the way through my 100th run, but it’s left a very strong first impression.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marathon - Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve always had a difficult time describing exactly what makes a Bungie gun feel so damn good, but whatever it is, Marathon’s got it. Maybe it’s the deliberate musicality to weapons, like that crisp snap from a rifle report, the metallic clink of a trigger, or those amazing hollow thuds when you land a shot. Maybe it’s the way recoil feels rhythmic, with pulse rifles kicking like a heartbeat and handcannons bucking theatrically. Maybe it’s the way the world reacts to your shots, with shields crackling and splintering, and enemy NPCs staggering in place as you riddle them full of holes. Maybe it’s invisible qualities, like the almost perfectly tuned bullet magnetism and finessed projectile speeds, all working together to make you feel slightly better than you actually are. An old Bungie dev once told me that the secret to making a great shooter is in making four seconds of gameplay that feel perfect, then repeating those four seconds as many times as you can. I don’t know if this remains a guiding philosophy of the current team, but in any case, they really seem to have nailed just that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who adores PvP, one massively refreshing aspect of Marathon so far is how far it deviates from the group hug energy of ARC Raiders’ PvE-friendly community. Don’t get me wrong, cooperating with other players can be a hell of a time, but one of the major drawbacks is that you don’t get to see the PvP shine when it rarely happens. In a game like Marathon, with Bungie’s legendary FPS chops on full display, I’d be pretty disappointed if PvP encounters were as rare as they’ve become in ARC Raiders, because those gunfights are without question the best part of any match. The pressure of two teams squaring off in claustrophobic, dark hallways as you try to outmaneuver one another makes for some of the most tense encounters I’ve ever had, and the loot reward you get for winning those firefights is worth the stress (after all, the best way to loot is to let someone else do it for you and take it from their cold, dead hands).</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The mark of a great extraction shooter is that “one more run” feeling, and a big part of that lies in how fun the long-term loot game is. That relies on both the badass weapons and gadgets you’ll find, as well as the quest items you’re asked to collect if you want to unlock an upgrade or complete a mission you’ve been given. In the early hours, I’ve been completely glued to my screen, poring over dense menus and trees to figure out which map I’ll need to play to complete this quest or loot that item, then going into battle with a specific set of objectives in mind – only for it to all go to hell when I run into a rival gang and the shrapnel starts flying. I’m really impressed by how fast the progression feels so far, and even during failed runs, I’ve seemed to make at least some kind of progress despite losing valuable loot along the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obviously, acquiring a new weapon on the battlefield, like a long-distance rifle capable of one-shotting poorly-armored characters, then customizing said weapon with neat mods you’ve found along the way feels awesome. But there’s also little ways you can progress, like unlocking the ability to buy a larger backpack if you’ve lost all of yours in the battlefield, or gaining access to better shields in the store instead of having to rely purely on your ability to loot them out in the world. So far I’ve never felt like any of the progress lost on failed runs has hindered my desire to immediately jump back in, even when a particularly devastating loss left me with only white-rarity weapons.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite Extraction Shooters</h3><p>For those who like risking it all on loot that's well worth it, these are your best bets.</p></div><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/Tieguytravis/lists/tieguytravis-favorite-extraction-shooters" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also been great to see the story play a larger role than I expected it to. After each mission, I’ve had some new faction to meet, a few quick lines of dialogue thrown my way, or some lore unlock for me to read, and I find myself really interested in learning more about this world and its inhabitants. I haven’t had nearly enough time to actually dive in here, as it can be tough to find reading time when your crewmates are waiting on you to launch the next match, but the vibe of these cutscenes and the spooky cyberpunk aesthetic is so damn interesting. I’m eager to know more. Here’s hoping the pace of lore continues as strongly as the first day has, and that it actually leads to some kind of payoff, since Bungie notably isn’t always great at this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Server Slam alone doesn’t paint a full picture, but it has got me excited to play more as we approach the full launch next week. I’ll be diving deep into every aspect of Marathon and be back with a final review once I’ve fully put it through its paces.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-review]]></content:encoded>

<figure data-uuid="27101ee173e6e"><a title="Pokémon FireRed Version" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/27101ee173e6e/pokemon-firered-version.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>One of the joys for many trainers during the earlier generations of Pokémon was giving the main character and their rival a rude or downright inappropriate name. In the Switch eShop versions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed &amp; LeafGreen</a>, it seems there have been some updates to this.</p>
<p>As reported by Kotaku, you'll either have to get <em>really</em> creative now, or there's a good chance the game will override whatever you've input and instead give you a generic name. Here's a sample of some of the words that won't fly:</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fsulywt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Kotaku</em> has verified that some words, such as “d**k,” “p***y,” “s**t,” and even the f-slur are replaced by names like “Gary” or “Janne.” This doesn’t seem to extend to some milder words, however, as “hell” and “damn” were not replaced."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This update appears to impact Pokémon names as well. One theory suggests the update is to prevent users from flooding social media with screenshots and footage containing offensive language. It could also potentially be linked to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_home">Pokémon Home</a>. Either way, some names wouldn't be the best look, as Pokémon is intended to be a friendly experience for all ages.</p>
<p>As many trainers have highlighted, this confirms these classic Game Boy Advance releases have actually been edited for this special release. There have also been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/psa-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-switch-version-gives-you-the-mystic-ticket-and-aurora-ticket">some other updates...</a></p>

<p>It’s a we, Mario!</p>



<p>March 10 has become Mario Day (Mar 10) for many gamers. This year, a New York City GameStop is to celebrate the day by attempting to break a record for the largest gathering of people dressed as Mario. The current record for the largest gathering of people dressed as Mario is 230 participants. This was set on August 18, 2010, in Chifeng City, Inner Mongolia, China.</p>



<p>It will be an entire Mario-themed event. There will be prizes and many photo ops. The best Mario cosplayer will receive a free <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. All who participate will also receive $5 in bonus store credit to use on any item in the store. You’re free to come dressed as Luigi, but you won’t get the store credit.</p>



<p>Qualifications for the costume are simple. All you need is a red shirt, blue overalls, a red hat, and a mustache.</p>







<h2 id="h-mario-is-still-celebrating-his-40th-anniversary">Mario Is Still Celebrating His 40th Anniversary</h2>



<p>Through April, with the release of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie/" id="3170">Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a>, Mario continues to celebrate his 40th anniversary. As part of the anniversary, Nintendo has released <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/mario-tennis-fever-2/" id="170927">Mario Tennis Fever</a>. There’s also an upcoming Yoshi game, Yoshi and the Mysterious Book. However, most are wondering when the next 3D Mario experience will be released.</p>



<p>It has been almost 9 years since Nintendo released<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/super-mario-odyssey/" id="165895"> Super Mario Odyssey</a> on the original Nintendo Switch. This is easily the longest timeframe between brand-new 3D Mario releases. Nintendo released a port of Super Mario 3D World on the Nintendo Switch, which included a secondary mode in Bowser’s Fury. However, they have not released a full 3D Mario game since 2017.</p>







<p>With the latest Mario movie celebrating the legacy of one of the best-reviewed 3D Mario games of all time, many are dying to get back to the Mushroom Kingdom in a brand new experience. For now, maybe you can go to New York City and dress up like Mario and hope of winning a free Nintendo Switch 2 so that you’ll be ready whenever that new game does come.</p>



<p>RSVP for the gathering <a href="https://partiful.com/e/BhTQ2ZaAdQaLoiqX0Fb2">here.</a></p>



<hr>



<p>Would you participate in an event like this? When do you think the next Mario game will be announced?</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/raven-software/" id="1897">Raven Software </a>has revealed <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2026/02/call-of-duty-bo7-warzone-season-02-patch-notes">patch notes</a> for the latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" id="147395">Call of Duty: Warzone</a> Season 2 update. The patch includes an update to Killstreaks in multiple modes and other bug fixes.</p>



<p>Regarding Killstreaks, several updates have been made. They have adjusted the spawn rates of Killstreaks in loot. Resurgence modes have received a 50% reduction from Supply boxes and a 25% reduction from ground loot. This adjustment also counts for Ranked Play. Battle Royale modes have received a 10% reduction in Killstreaks overall.</p>



<p>They’ve also made specific adjustments to Precision Airstrikes, Napalm Strikes, Cluster Strikes, and Bunker Busters. The radius for Killstreak call-ins has gone down to 150 meters. It was originally 255 meters. They’ve also adjusted the limit from three to two. Additionally, they’ve made a change to where only one type of Killstreak is allowed in any given radius.</p>



<p>“Individually, you can deploy one Killstreak of a specific type every 20 seconds. Your squad is limited to one active Killstreak of that type as well. Once used, this allows opponents a window to retaliate. We will continue monitoring Killstreak usage and performance across all modes and make adjustments as needed,” the notes state.</p>







<h2 id="h-additional-bug-fixes-in-the-latest-call-of-duty-warzone-patch">Additional Bug Fixes in the Latest Call of Duty: Warzone Patch</h2>



<p>Additional bug fixes include a fix to an issue that prevented players from properly progressing the “Absolute Zero” mastery camo challenge for the NX Ravager. Also, an issue that allowed players to fall through maps in certain areas has been fixed. </p>
