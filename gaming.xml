            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-no-switch-2-news-direct-museum<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced a brand new Direct presentation, but before you get too excited, it's not the kind of show where you'll learn more about the Switch 2, a point about which Nintendo is being very clear.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1825291849990304138" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X</a> (formerly known as Twitter), Nintendo announced yesterday that a new Direct will be held later today, and it'll show off some of the exhibits you'll be able to see at the Nintendo Museum, which is opening this fall in Kyoto.</p>
<p>The showcase will last around ten minutes, so it's not going to be a particularly long presentation, but it should be a good opportunity to learn more about Nintendo's history and find out more about the museum. What it won't feature, however, is any info about the Switch 2.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-direct-switch-2-museum-original-switch.jpg?itok=xH_hPIhw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-direct-switch-2-museum-original-switch.jpg?itok=Ew4WCL1T 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sorry, Switch fans. Today's Direct isn't for you.</figcaption></figure><p>Likely understanding that speculation about the Switch 2 is ramping up, Nintendo followed up its original Direct announcement with <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1825291853861683644" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> stating that "there will be no game announcements or mention of the Nintendo Switch successor" during today's show.</p>
<p>It might be hard to understand what kind of person would seriously expect a Switch 2 announcement as part of a museum tour video, but, well, there's a good reason Nintendo has disabled the chat on the new Direct's YouTube feed.</p>
<p>For context, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">announced back in May</a>&nbsp;that information about the Switch 2 would be revealed sometime before the end of the fiscal year, which gives the studio until the end of March 2025 to announce something.</p>
<p>Of course, March is a long way away, and the announcement could come any time between now and then, but every new announcement Nintendo makes, however seemingly unrelated to the Switch 2 it is, stokes the fires of rumor even further.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/super-mario-odyssey-nintendo-direct-museum.jpg?itok=JAheMpGg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/super-mario-odyssey-nintendo-direct-museum.jpg?itok=u3H3cLek 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't expect a&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>&nbsp;successor to be announced during today's Direct, either.</figcaption></figure><p>If you want to tune into Nintendo's new Direct and treat yourself to a little slice of Nintendo history, you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JApUMBscKOc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">do so right here</a>. The stream is set to start at 3pm Pacific (that's 6pm Eastern). Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Nintendo.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-dead-cells-update</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-dead-cells-update-brings-new-mobs-new-weapons-and-much-sadness.956664/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-dead-cells-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Motion Twin has released the final&nbsp;<em>Dead Cells&nbsp;</em>update, and although it's been a long time coming, the update is also tinged with sadness, as it represents the end of major content drops for the roguelite platformer.</p>
<p>Appropriately enough given Motion Twin's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-cells-updates-ending">comments back in February</a>, Update 35 is also known as "The End is Near", and it brings new Curse-based mechanics including new mobs, new weapons, and a new biome effect that asks you to weigh up risks and rewards.</p>
<p>First up, you're getting three new enemies. The Sore Loser clings to you and curses you when you kill it, while the Doom Bringer stacks curse when it attacks you rather than causing damage. Finally, the Curser launches a projectile that adds 5 curse stacks if you're hit by it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-cells-update-35-the-end-is-near.jpg?itok=c0AmD0S4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-cells-update-35-the-end-is-near.jpg?itok=iywD2raZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dead Cells&nbsp;</em>is getting three new enemies and more as part of its final update.</figcaption></figure><p>If you want to encounter these new enemy types, you'll need to head into the new Cursed Biome, which features these mobs but which will also give you increased rewards as a result of its higher difficulty.</p>
<p>Cursed biomes will only appear in Boss Cell level 2 or higher runs, and the boss biomes themselves won't be cursed. Assuming you meet this requirement, biomes will have a 25% chance of being cursed, and there will always be at least one non-cursed biome per run with "no exceptions", according to Motion Twin.</p>
<p>You're also getting three new weapons in this update. Anathema is an AoE weapon that curses you (yes, you) if you hit something with it, and Indulgence calls down a ray of light to damage enemies. If you kill an enemy with it, you'll be purged of three curse stacks.</p>
<p>Finally, Misericorde deals critical damage if enemies have less than 50% health, but it curses you if you don't kill your target with said critical damage. Yeowch.</p>

<p>If you want to know everything that's new as part of&nbsp;<em>Dead Cells&nbsp;</em>Update 35, you can check out the update's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/588650/view/6100774879119621994" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full patch notes right here</a>.</p>
<p>So, now that&nbsp;<em>Dead Cells&nbsp;</em>is (mostly) done, what's next for the teams that worked on it? Well, Motion Twin is hard at work on&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-cells-motion-twin-windblown-gameplay">isometric 3D action-roguelite&nbsp;<em>Windblown</em></a>, and fellow developer Evil Empire is working on the very&nbsp;<em>Dead Cells</em>-esque&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-rogue-prince-of-persia-release-date"><em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em></a>. Stay tuned for more on those projects!</p>

Adding magic was a frequent request from the players of IRONSTRIKE’s prequel, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ironlightsgame.com/">Ironlights</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, so I knew from the beginning that I wanted to include some kind of spellcasting system. But it couldn’t just be a matter of selecting spells from a glorified menu. I wanted to go beyond radial menus or one-step gestures and design something that took real advantage of VR.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most importantly, I wanted something that rewarded </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>skill</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We can trace my inspiration fairly easily. See, I’m a nerd. And I read a LOT of cheap fantasy books as a kid. What made the spellcasters in these books so cool wasn’t (just) that they could throw fireballs around. It’s that they were skillful experts of the arcane arts, manipulating complex energies by practicing intricate gestures and memorizing mystical incantations. (They were nerds too!)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, I decided that I wanted a magic system that:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Makes full use of VR motion controls</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Is conceptually simple and viable for total newbies to use in a fight</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rewards expert players who hone their skill</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Can be used even when jumping, turning, and moving rapidly</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Makes you feel like an awesome pulp-fantasy spellcaster</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I started by trying two very different approaches. Spoiler: both were doomed.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Failed Approach #1: Tracing Runes">Failed Approach #1: Tracing Runes</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I started with a simple idea: tracing a line through the air.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">(I failed to save my old prototypes, so here’s a mockup.)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This has some nice features. You can make the lines twist into all sorts of shapes, from very simple (e.g. drawing an X) to extremely complex (intricate runes). You could make the lines into cool 3D shapes. You could have two lines, one for each hand!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And even better: what if we only showed the player the *next portion* of the line they’re supposed to trace, rather than showing the entire complex path? That way, expert players who’ve memorized the entire spell can rush through it, while newbies can keep tracing it bit by bit until they learn it by heart!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Frankly, I loved this idea. I had a vision of players waving their hands through intricate convoluted gestures, but doing it so fast you can barely see the structure, amassing magical energy and then blasting it toward their foes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Cool! But it fell apart during playtesting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The problem came from combining lightning-fast hand motions with precise line dimensions. Whenever we tried to cast a spell quickly, we’d repeatedly end up “missing” the line by a fraction of an inch, requiring us to go back and retrace the missed section, only to miss the line again a second later. This felt incredibly frustrating, and the frustration didn’t seem to get better with experience. Sure, at some level this was probably a “skill issue”, but it was still a problem if it felt </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>this </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">bad in practice.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At first I thought we could fix it by subtly tweaking the implementation. We tried a LOT of variations. For instance, what if we removed any sharp corners from the spell line? Or dynamically reduced the precision required during tracing? Or tweaked the tracing-detection algorithm in a dozen different ways?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A few times, we were successful at making fast spellcasting viable! But this involved making the system so lenient that the best strategy was to flail your hands around wildly. Kind of the opposite of the “elite wizard” vibe we were aiming for.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Failed Approach #2: Direction Sequences">Failed Approach #2: Direction Sequences</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Okay, forget the whole line-tracing complex-shape thing. What if the whole spell were just a series of directional swipe motions? Move your wand up, then down, then diagonal, then U-U-D-D-L-R-L-R and *poof* you’ve got a fireball!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Can’t get simpler than that! And it still had the potential to reward memorization and skillful execution. But it came with a few problems. For one thing, you can cast any spell by drawing rapid tight circles (i.e. hitting every direction) as fast as possible. (This can be mitigated in various ways, but then it starts getting complicated again.) For another, this system doesn’t use space in a meaningful way. It feels more like inputting a code than casting a spell. It doesn’t make me feel like a wizard.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You could make this work, but I wasn’t thrilled by the idea. Thankfully, however, this inspired the mechanic that actually worked:</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Synthesis: Line Crossing">Synthesis: Line Crossing</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It turns out that if you combine the two approaches above, they join to form the perfect mechanic! Sort of!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We needed a mechanic that was more strict than just swiping in a given direction, but more lenient than hitting a certain point on a path. So, why not merge the two ideas: make the player swipe in a given direction </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>near a certain point</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Well, that sounds easy to implement! Define a spell as a series of line segments, and require the player’s motion to intersect each of those line segments in the correct direction. We can define an “intersection” either in 2D (by projecting both the line segments and the player’s hand motion vector onto a 2D plane) or in 3D (by giving the player a long wand / beam extending from their hand and detecting when it hits the line segment).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And... it works!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s easy to explain and teach to new players:</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hhfo3y6bp3Q?si=Dxd5U-bmZiNsdw2y" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It can easily expand to accommodate lots of complex gestures:</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WfrewV8X5Hc?si=DfqW6IfPQDz7xdLH" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And, with practice, you can cast complex spells quickly and smoothly:</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GJ1IyQDfKcw?si=ruUDDiXZPkTLX10A" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I can tweak the lengths of the line segments to control how precise the motions need to be at any point, but mindlessly flailing your hands around won’t cast these spells effectively.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This system encourages players to memorize the spells and to practice the physical skill of casting them quickly. Here’s some footage just recorded by an IRONSTRIKE player to show off their spellcraft in combat:</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sexZ1KPMtrw?si=5JegYIAWUjTBYKlz" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This spellcasting system has been a great success so far. Casters represent about a quarter of players in any given run of IRONSTRIKE, usually playing the role of support or artillery. And there’s a ton of room for expanding the system with more spells, since it’s easy to author new gestures of any complexity</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When I look back at this system, it’s interesting to note how the key elements (requiring a certain directional swipe / at a certain position in front of the player) are similar to those of one of VR’s biggest hits, Beat Saber. That’s not intentional, but that kind of convergent evolution suggests to me that these might be useful ingredients for other game mechanics. I’d be curious to learn about other systems that use a similar approach in the future!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">- </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/e_mcneill">@E_McNeill</a></span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-tcg-pocket-release-date-set-for-late-october.956640/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>release date, and the digital card-collecting app launches in just a couple of months, so get ready to collect 'em all.</p>
<p>As announced during yesterday's Pokemon World Championships,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>launches for both iOS and Android on October 30th, which is one day before Halloween (and just one day shy of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-leaked-trailer">the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>release date</a>, incidentally).</p>
<p>The app was first revealed during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced">February's&nbsp;Pokemon Presents showcase</a>, alongside a brand new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends&nbsp;</em>game, although we sadly don't have a release date for that one just yet. Hang in there.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-release-date-cards.jpg?itok=fFQ-ZrcW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-release-date-cards.jpg?itok=68bpyFir 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>will let you collect and battle your cards digitally.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as offering the chance to collect various types of cards,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>will also feature a more "casual" version of the TCG battle system, one that you can enjoy either alone or alongside your friends.</p>
<p>The game will allow you to open two booster packs per day, free of charge, and since the app will feature all-new exclusive cards, it's worth doing so, even if you've got an extensive physical collection.</p>
<p>You can also look forward to new "immersive" cards, which will effectively allow you to zoom into their artwork to "make you feel like you've leapt into the world of the card's illustration", as The Pokemon Company has it.</p>

<h2>More&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>announcements from the World Championships</h2>
<p>Besides&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, we also got new information about other&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>-related games during the World Championships.</p>
<p>Morpeko is making its way to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go</em>, and The Pokemon Company is also teasing "something big and mysterious" for the future, so stay tuned for more info about whatever this turns out to be.</p>

<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Unite&nbsp;</em>is getting a new type of battle in which teams compete to be the first to reach 500 points, and new Pokemon Armarouge, Darkrai, and Psyduck are joining the game's roster.</p>
<p>We also learned where the 2025 and 2026 Pokemon World Championships are due to take place. 2025's event will be held in Anaheim, California between August 15th and 17th, while 2026's championships will take place in San Francisco from August 28th to 30th.</p>
<p>Sadly, the event didn't feature any info about&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, nor did it play host to any announcements regarding the next generation of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games. Stay tuned for more on all things&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>.</p>

After earning more than $1 billion at the box office, it’s officially the biggest movie of the year. <em>Inside Out 2</em> faces the horrors of puberty with a host of new emotions such as Envy, Ennui, Embarrassment, and Anxiety. Although it’s still going strong in theaters, <em>Inside Out 2</em> will be available for digital rental and purchase on August 20, 2024 through AppleTV+, Prime Video, and Fandango at Home. Though, we’ll have to wait until at least the end of September 2024 for <em>Inside Out 2</em> to appear on Disney+.

The 4K disc will also be available in a beautiful, limited edition Steelbook. One awesome advantage that physical media has over streaming purchases are the bonus features which include a documentary on all the new emotions, deleted scenes, alternate opening scene, and other behind-the-scenes looks. While the first <em>Inside Out</em> explored Riley’s struggles with sadness after moving, <em>Inside Out 2</em> addresses more complicated emotions that invade Headquarters, the name for the switchboard that Joy, Sadness, Disgust, or any other feeling takes turns handling. </p><p>The biggest one is Anxiety, a frizzy-haired orange sprite exceptionally voiced by Maya Hawke (<em>Stranger Things</em>). Anxiety has some of the most relatable and emotional scenes in the movie, like when she moves so fast trying to control all her worries and what-ifs at the center console that she turns into an electric hurricane, but at the eye of the storm, she is frozen in fear. Anxiety also oversees a room that looks like an animation studio where workers draw a million different bad things that could happen. These scenes depict exactly what it feels like to have anxiety, and does so better than any psychology textbook ever could.</p><p>Anxiety has quickly become a ubiquitous part of popular culture, sparking hilarious memes from fans of <em>Inside Out 2</em>, like one showing her carrying multiple suitcases, with captions on each suitcase reflecting different stressors that affect people with anxiety. In response to someone saying “Just relax, there’s nothing to be anxious about,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/C8fTpMEOIj6/?fbclid=IwY2xjawErMsFleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHe4jUUBNoEWozbR7ExS2UOAWktuud5vkfNtTJqkyq3LqpJhReUDCKMpg5w_aem_6gxb1LDWQk6v4_OLc9rmhw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C8fTpMEOIj6/?fbclid=IwY2xjawErMsFleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHe4jUUBNoEWozbR7ExS2UOAWktuud5vkfNtTJqkyq3LqpJhReUDCKMpg5w_aem_6gxb1LDWQk6v4_OLc9rmhw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Buzzfeed </em></a></span>shared an image where each suitcase reads the following: “Childhood trauma, dying, making an appointment, that one thing in third grade,” and “Do I smell?” The meme is simple but says so much. Not only do people with anxiety tend to overpack in general (What if it rains? What if I didn’t pack enough? What if I get too cold?), but past, present, and future worries constantly weigh you down. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/discover/Thought-i-was-a-disney-princess-turns-out-im-anxiety&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/Thought-i-was-a-disney-princess-turns-out-im-anxiety" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adult TikTokers</a></span> are also sharing clips of Disney princesses, joking that as children they dreamed of becoming as beautiful and elegant as Belle or Ariel, but instead they ended up like the small, perpetually jittery Anxiety with messy hair.</p><p>The widespread sharing of these memes, especially by older audiences, demonstrates the universal appeal of <em>Inside Out 2</em>—this isn’t just a kid’s movie, but one that manages to perfectly articulate an emotion that becomes harder and harder to deal with after middle school, particularly with new, adult responsibilities. <em>Inside Out 2</em> strikes a chord with <em>everyone</em>, which is why it has become one of the biggest movies of all time and why we can’t wait to rewatch it when it’s released on home media.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A new rumour claims that Xbox is trying to re-license Deadpool and Marvel Ultimate Alliance.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/nHvGU-bBptQ?t=1h46m0s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest episode</a> of The XboxEra Podcast, Shpeshal Nick revealed some details about Deadpool and Marvel Ultimate Alliance. According to rumours, Nick claims that Xbox “is trying to work through the process of getting” the Xbox One ports of Deadpool and Marvel Ultimate Alliance re-licensed for PC and Xbox Series X/S consoles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Activision released the Deadpool game in 2013 for Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS3 and PS4, but it was delisted in 2014 when the publisher’s Marvel license expired. Similarly, Marvel Ultimate Alliance was also removed due to the license expiration. Because of this, many players have never had the chance to play these games. Buying a physical copy is not always ideal, as prices can be high after the games are removed from digital stores.</p>



<p>Regardless, this is just a rumour, and we will have to wait for an official announcement from Xbox to know for sure. Fortnite is the way to go if you want to play a game featuring Deadpool or other Marvel characters right now. The battle royale title recently released a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-tease-release-dates-for-deadpool-wolverine-content-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bundle</a> featuring comic-accurate outfits and accessories for Deadpool and Wolverine. Additionally, Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4 marks the return of the Marvel season, with Dr. Doom taking over the entire island. Check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-5-season-4-is-live-heres-everything-new/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">everything new in the latest season</a>.</p>



<p>Talking about Xbox rumours, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-16-is-coming-to-xbox-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 16</a> is seemingly gearing up to release for the Series X/S consoles and PC. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-xbox-game-coming-to-playstation-next-week-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumours</a> about the next Xbox game coming to PlayStation have started surfacing online.

			<p>With such an established format as the visual novel, games now quite often look to break outside of the text-heavy storytelling with snippets of other gameplay genres&nbsp; that help break up the monotony of tapping endlessly through often unvoiced dialogue. Some of my favourite games of this style, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/05/03/va11halla-review-cyberpunk-bartender-action/">VA-11 HALL-A</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/08/16/coffee-talk-release-date-pc-ps4-switch-xbox-one/">Coffee Talk</a>, let you mix drinks and brew beverages between conversations, and that blend of interaction creates such a unique connection with the game and it’s characters. Tavern Talk takes that formula and steeps it in high-fantasy, but with a uniquely modern and tabletop-inspired voice that makes it one of the most unique takes on a Dungeons &amp; Dragons style setting I’ve seen in gaming.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tavern Talk: Launch Trailer | 20.06.2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PDEGfPJ_rg0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Tavern Talk, your humble inn and drinkery serves as a hub for adventurers, warriors, and pretty much anyone else to gather at. Some are looking for rest after a tough battle, others are sharing quests they need party members for, and a few just need a refreshing beverage and someone to talk to.</p>


<p>On the surface, a lot of these characters are pretty standard fantasy stereotypes – your pale blonde elves, your stout dwarf warriors, your aloof assassins and so on – but what makes all of them so interesting is that they aren’t characterised and written like typically stoic fantasy heroes. Instead, their casual tone and quite literal adherence to things like the D&amp;D alignment chart make them feel more like a real persons tabletop character mid-session. It helps them come to life in a much more interesting fashion, and leads to fun moments where you might see two characters with very different personalities instantly connect on a subject because of their placements on the alignment chart – you can even check this in-game through your journal.</p>


<p>When one of these characters visits your shop, they’ll ask you to make a drink for them. On top of general preferences for flavour or style, your patrons will also have stat-related needs that your concoction has to help with, requiring you to brew something that boosts strength, charisma, dexterity, intelligence, or defence.</p>
<p>The act of brewing a beverage isn’t very complicated, and I have mixed feelings about that. On one hand, the simplistic nature of the drink-mixing gameplay makes it easier to vibe with the story and follow it without interruption, but on the other hand, it gets so repetitive so quickly. Despite unlocking new recipes drink modifiers as the game goes on, your patrons will almost always stick to their same usual favourites. A more challenging version of the drink mixing would make your bond with the patrons and the info and rumors they share with you feel so much more earned and meaningful.</p>

<p>Once you learn enough info or rumours from various patrons, you can piece them together and post an open quest on your taverns’ quest-board to let any of your patrons tackle the adventure. This also isn’t as difficult or open-ended as I would have liked. There isn’t a lot of variety or meaningful experimentation that goes into putting these quests, or the drinks your patrons need before tackling them, together. The idea of your interactions with your shop visitors culminating in these big quests is interesting, but it already lacks some oomph since you don’t get to witness the quests at all – the lack of challenge in putting them together makes the most impactful moments of the game fall a bit flat.</p>
<p>Still, there’s a lot of charm and wonderful world-building to Tavern Talk that make it a worthwhile experience despite a lack of gameplay depth. The game is full of diverse, interesting, and engaging characters, and even the patrons who I despised for their rancid vibes or twisted personalities made for really interesting interactions. The world needs more drink-mixing visual novels, and Tavern Talk is a welcome, if slightly flawed, addition to that niche subgenre.</p>

		Tavern Talk is a wonderful window into a high-fantasy world that I never wanted to leave. Despite some repetitive gameplay, the unique tabletop spin on world-building and character interactions was an absolute delight.	</p></div>

She’s also a talented voiceover artist (she’s provided voices for <em>The Boy and the Heron</em>, <em>Callisto Protocol</em>, <em>Pokemon Concierge</em>, and <em>Star Wars</em>: <em>Visions</em>) and an accomplished athlete (she’s got a brown belt in karate, which she used not just in <em>The Boys</em>, but in <em>Suicide Squad</em> and <em>Bullet Train</em>, as well). So when she came into the <em>Kotaku</em> offices for an on-camera interview, we had a lot to talk about.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="9b140b5128943deef31107021017c7a3" data-recommend-id="image://9b140b5128943deef31107021017c7a3" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="in-house-art" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Graphic<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9b140b5128943deef31107021017c7a3" data-recommend-id="image://9b140b5128943deef31107021017c7a3" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>With <em>The Boys</em> season 4 finale recently airing, we had to touch on Kimiko’s arc for the season. Though Fukuhara’s character has been non-verbal since she was first introduced, which meant the actor has had to rely on her physicality in the role, she does eventually utter a single word during the season finale. “In season one we kind of just see her as this creature-like figure that was trapped, very violent. And then over the few seasons that we’ve had she’s really grown into this independent woman. Still trying to figure it out, but there’s a lot more to work with,” Fukuhara told us.<br></p><p>Though Kimiko finally speaks, the finale doesn’t end on a good note. Frenchie, under the influence of a superhero who can seemingly convince people to do what they please, walks away from her as she’s being restrained. But Fukuhara hopes Kimiko gets a happy ending, even if that’s unlikely in the <em>The Boys</em> universe. “My hope is that she ends up with Frenchie and they go to France together and they’re singing and dancing together and cooking through life and it’s all happily ever after. But I think in true <em>Boys </em>fashion we kind of have to be a little more dark and miserable, at least maybe before the end.”<br></p><p>I, for one, hope she’s wrong, and that Kimiko and Frenchie <em>do</em> end up happily ever after.

                <p>Silent Hill 2 composer Akira Yamaoka has announced that the remake's soundtrack will be a "brand-new, reworked" experience. Yamaoka revealed the news to GameSpot and various press outlets during a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-preview-significantly-better-than-the-trailers-youve-seen/1100-6525893/" data-ref-id="1100-6525893">recent preview event for the upcoming psychological horror game</a>. The longtime composer went on to say that, while he understands that the original soundtrack is "beloved," he ultimately wanted to ensure that all players would have a "fresh experience."</p><p>"I have reworked all the tracks. There are segments and bits and pieces of the original tracks that you can hear, but all of the tracks have been reworked from the ground up. I understand that the soundtrack is very much beloved, but ultimately I composed over nine hours worth of music and I'm still wondering how in the world we are going to fit all of that into a soundtrack."</p><p>Though this news might disappoint fans of the critically acclaimed soundtrack, rest assured that--based on our time spent with the Silent Hill 2 remake and some additional comments given by Yamaoka--it seems as if the soundtrack will remain very familiar. The composer explained that he both referenced and sampled tracks from the original score while composing the new soundtrack. During our three-hour hands-on preview, we noted that the game's music perfectly suited the new experience and kept many of the original's motifs and stylings.</p><p>Later on during the event, Yamaoka spoke a bit more about the upcoming soundtrack and his process for making it. According to the composer, the project required a lot of "self-counseling" as he tried to reconcile the person he is now with who he was when he recorded the original soundtrack nearly 25 years ago. Yamaoka said he tried to reflect on what his "mental state was" and how he was "approaching life." He then laughed as he told reporters that, back then, he was not "financially stable" and had to take "extreme measures" to be creative with what he had. He recounted how he used to have to tune down his guitar to record bass tracks as he didn't have enough money to afford a bass guitar.</p><p>"I had to be very creative because I had the passion to make something great. But now, unfortunately, I can't quite remember that part of me as vividly," Yamaoka said. "I can't replicate the same circumstances I was in 25 years ago. But I still want to deliver something that is fresh for both existing fans and newcomers."</p><p>In addition to chatting with Yamaoka, GameSpot had the chance to play about three hours of the Silent Hill 2 remake at the title's Tokyo preview. Though the trailers thus far for the upcoming psychological horror game might be slightly underwhelming, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-preview-significantly-better-than-the-trailers-youve-seen/1100-6525893/" data-ref-id="1100-6525893">we walked away extremely impressed by the game's opening hours</a>. We were also able to catch up with Masahiro Ito, the art director behind both Silent Hill 2 and its upcoming remake, who revealed that he very nearly rejected the offer to work on the remake. The Silent Hill 2 remake--simply titled Silent Hill 2--is scheduled to release on October 8 for PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <p>The Borderlands film adaptation will seemingly be available to watch digitally from the comfort of your home very soon.</p>
<p>While nothing has been officially announced by Lionsgate itself, multiple sources such <a href="https://thehollywoodhandle.co/2024/movies/movie-news/movie-digital-release-dates-august-2024/">The Hollywood Handle</a>, <a href="https://www.dvdsreleasedates.com/movies/11077/borderlands">DVD Release Dates</a>, <a href="https://x.com/screentime/status/1825298022915330303">ScreenTime</a> and <a href="https://www.whentostream.com/news/borderlands-digital-streaming-release-date-revealed">When to Stream</a> all have the Cate Blanchett-fronted film listed as being made available digitally from as soon as 30th August.</p>
<p>That's less than a month after its cinematic release, with the film only debuting on 9th August.</p>

<p>The Borderlands film follows bounty hunter Lilith, played by Blanchett, as she returns to her home of Pandora to find the missing daughter of a chap named Atlas. Atlas (played by Edgar Ramírez) is the owner of a mega corp known as Atlus.</p>
<p>Along the way, Lilith will meet a "ragtag team of misfits" including mercenary Roland (played by Kevin Hart), pre-teen demolitionist Tiny Tina and her protector Krieg (played by Ariana Greenblatt and Florian Munteanu respectively), scientist Tannis (played by Jamie Lee Curtis) and robot Claptrap (voiced by Jack Black).</p>
<p>"Together, these unlikely heroes must battle an alien species and dangerous bandits to uncover one of Pandora's most explosive secrets. The fate of the universe could be in their hands - but they'll be fighting for something more: each other," reads the official line.</p>
<p>The film failed to ignite enthusiasm from critics, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/early-borderlands-movie-impressions-brand-it-a-disaster-and-a-huge-misfire">one branding it a "huge misfire"</a>. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-earned-4m-on-its-opening-day">adaptation then generated just $4m on its opening day</a>, a disappointing result that looks set to result in the film becoming a commercial flop.</p>
<p>Our Lottie has seen Borderlands already, and while she said it is dull and full of plot holes, she still felt there are a few saving graces for fans of the games. She told me Pandora and all the creatures that live there are "spot on" in the film. Meanwhile, the film team has also included a lot of games' music.</p>

A flurry of Pokémon news has confirmed a launch date for the long-awaited Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket, and a look ahead at what's next for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>.
</p>
<p>
Pokémon TCG Pocket, a digital version of the phenomenally-popular trading card game, will go live via the iPhone App Store and Google Play for Android worldwide on 30th October. 
</p>
<p>
As previously announced, you can open two packs of Pokémon cards for free per day - just enough to get you hooked - and it's interesting to see the pack-opening mechanic front and centre in the game's trailer below.

There's some lovely card art on show, and some impressive visual effects. But as the trailer turns back to that pack-opening mechanic at the end, it's hard not to feel like this - and its associated revenues - is why the app has been made.
</p>
<p>
In other Pokémon news, we now have official confirmation of the Dynamax/Gigantamax mechanic coming to the next season of Pokémon Go. 
</p>
<p>
"We've all learned a gigantic amount from exploring the world and encountering all sorts of Pokémon together over the last eight years," Pokémon Go developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/niantic">Niantic</a> wrote in a new <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/something-big-is-coming">blog post</a>, "and yet there always seem to be new mysteries to uncover, looming just over the horizon. A new Season means big changes, big battles, and... big Pokémon?" 
</p>
<p>
A teaser shows a Pokémon Go player interrupted at the beach by the arrival of a towering monster from the clouds - yep, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-dynamax-elements-in-pokemon-go">previously forecasted through numerous leaks and datamines, Gen 8's big Gigantamax mechanic is coming</a>.

<p>
A separate <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/morpeko-charged-for-battle?hl=en">announcement</a> - that the cute/scary Pokémon Morpeko is coming to the app - has potentially given some indication of how Dynamax/Gigantamax will work. Morpeko will be able to change form mid-battle - into its Hangry Mode - by using a special Charged Attack. Is the addition of this feature suggesting Pokémon will be able to Gigantamax in battle too? And what other Pokémon might be able to change forms mid-fight? 
</p>
<p>
Pokémon Go's next season begins on 3rd September. 
</p>
<p>
"We've definitely been thinking a lot about Gen 8 for a while in Pokémon Go," the game's director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-looks-set-to-add-gen-8s-dynamax-mechanic">Michael Steranka told me back in June</a>. "Know that as the team is thinking about Gen 8 Pokémon, they're thinking about Galar, they're thinking about what makes those Pokémon special, and when it's time for them to make their debut in Pokémon Go, it will make sense."

            <p>I’ve likely mentioned hitting Lovecraft fatigue so often that it’s now evolved into a second phase of Lovecraft-fatigue fatigue. This is not the same as Lovecraft refreshment, no matter how much I might want to return to the days before old one plushies and Cthulhu children’s books terrorised the internet en masse. There’s not quite enough information about “story generator” <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marry-a-deep-one-innsmouth-simulator">Marry a Deep One: Innsmouth Simulator</a> for me to confidently say it’ll cut through my exhaustion with all things tentacular and horrifically be-gilled. But it is <em>beguiling</em>, isn’t it? There’s all sorts of little widgets and details shown off that remind me of everything from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-pirates">Sid Meier’s Pirates</a> to classic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure games</a>, and maybe even a little <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rimworld">Rimworld</a>? It’s a heady soup, although one I’d recommend against quaffing, given where the water comes from.</p>

<p>“Marry a Deep One is a story generator with social mechanics at its core,” reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3143760/Marry_a_Deep_One_Innsmouth_Simulator/">store page</a>. “You play as a villainous cult leader exerting considerable control over a small community. Nevertheless, you must also meet the demands of the Deep Ones, or they will punish the village."</p>

<p>Here’s a feature list. Probs don’t recite it out loud. And if you do, make sure to check your neck in the mirror afterward.</p>
<blockquote><p>STORY: The game doesn't follow a fixed script or sequence but features numerous randomized story elements that can interconnect into a larger narrative. Your actions—and even those of the NPCs—significantly influence the outcome.</p>
<p>MAGIC: Develop creative ways to manipulate villagers even further, to the point of breaking the game. Study documents to learn sigils, which you combine into spells.</p>
<p>POWER: Your grimoire grants you the power to monitor all villagers' feelings, relationships, actions and motivations. You even have the authority to choose villagers as sacrifices to the gods of the Deep Ones.</p>
<p>CUSTOMIZATION: Name yourself, your cat, grimoire, cult, village, spells and children. Try out various hairstyles, glasses, and hats. Construct, expand, and modify the village's buildings to your liking.</p>
<p>CATS: You can pet them.</p></blockquote>
<p>This one’s due out sometime this year. Could it finally be the game to wash the completely average taste of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dredge">Dredge</a> out of my mouth? Am I going to elaborate on calling Dredge completely average? Nope! If you’re hankering for some Lovecraft in the meantime, the devs behind visual novel <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1481400/Dagon_by_H_P_Lovecraft/">Dagon</a> recently announced they’d raised <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/free-lovecraft-horror-game-developers-bit-golem-raise-50000-for-humanitarian-aid-in-ukraine">over $50,000 for humanitarian aid in Ukraine</a> - despite their game being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Dead Cells today has received its final major update, The End is Near, after seven years of development.
</p>
<p>
This will be the 35th update to the game, which has received a number of DLCs to expand gameplay and reference other popular games, from Castlevania to Hollow Knight. 
</p>
<p>
The End is Near expands on the curse mechanic, with three new mobs, three new weapons, and three new mutations.

<p>
However, the new cursed mobs won't randomly spawn. Instead there's a new biome effect, Cursed Biomes, players can select in exchange for extra rewards.
</p>
<p>
In addition, the update includes new legendary affixes, over 40 new heads to customise the player character, new routing between levels, and more accessibility options. These include adding a background to text to improve readability, an option to invert player and camera movement, a reworking of the auto-hit assist mode, and more.
</p>
<p>
Full details can be found in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead_Cells/">Steam post</a>. You can also see the update in action in the above video, in which developers Motion Twin and Evil Empire thanked the game's community.

</p>
<p>
The game will still receive small updates for bugs and issues and will remain playable. Plus, Motion Twin said the "beheaded will continue to feature outside of the game itself".
</p>
<p>
Both studios have also shared their thanks on social media.
</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Welp, this is it - the last update we made for Dead Cells (and its last update ever) is out now 🫡<br>Huge thanks to everyone in the community, we had such a great time creating insane content with you, and of course thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/motiontwin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@motiontwin</a> for letting us play with your creation! <a href="https://t.co/fpq8L5yGMA">https://t.co/fpq8L5yGMA</a></p>— Evil Empire (@Studio_Evil) <a href="https://twitter.com/Studio_Evil/status/1825466895853645859?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 19, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
Dead Cells was first released into early access in 2017. Updates to the game have brought new biomes, quality of life improvements, a boss rush mode, and plenty more.
</p>
<p>
Motion Twin's next game will be the combat roguelite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-cells-developers-next-game-is-lightning-fast-combat-roguelite-windblown">Windblown</a>, while Evil Empire (which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-cells-developer-ends-support-focusing-on-new-projects">ended its own support for the game earlier this year</a>) released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-lot-of-dead-cells-in-the-rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a>.



</p>
<p>
The original designer of Dead Cells, Sébastien Benard, formed a new studio and has a new roguelike game on the way called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tenjutsu-is-an-all-new-roguelike-action-game-from-the-designer-of-dead-cells">Tenjutsu</a> in which players take the role of a renegade yakuza.

</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, Benard called the decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-cells-designer-calls-decision-to-end-development-the-worst-imaginable-asshole-move">end Dead Cells development "the worst imaginable asshole move"</a>.

            <p>One of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">best roguelikes on PC</a> is getting a farewell of sorts this week. Twitchy slashfest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a> received its final major update, introducing new enemies, fresh weapons, and a few mutations. Unfortunately, all this new stuff is very cursed. In other words, it all toys with the game's "curse" status effect, a hex that causes you to be killed if you take even a single hit. You'll probably die a few times as a result of this update, which in some ways is a fitting finalé for this fast-paced jar smasher of a game. You can see the new features in the trailer below. </p>

<p>Usually, you suffer the "curse" status by agreeing to open cursed chests in a risk-reward gamble for good gear. It's a Faustian bargain that plops a number over your head - kill that amount of enemies to lift the curse. But take even a teeny weeny bit of damage and you are toast. With this final update, there are going to be some new ways to catch the curse, and new ways to benefit from it. Enemies like the Doom Bringer and Curser will curse you with their attacks. And a new "cursed flask" will let you regain health infinitely but you'll also take a stack of curse with every slurp. There's also a mutation that increases your damage by 30% if you're cursed.</p>
<p>The new mobs won't appear randomly like other enemies, though. They only appear in biomes marked as "cursed". You'll see a special skull showing this is the case before entering the area, letting you make the decision to face those creeps or take another route. The upside is that all gear dropped in those bewitched biomes will be of a higher level. There is other stuff in the update, like new heads with which to customise your character, and new routes to take on your run. I'll not explain everything, you can see the nitty gritty for yourself in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/588650/view/6100774879119621994">the patch notes</a>.</p>
<p>Although this is the final update when it comes to special features (it's fittingly titled "The End Is Near"), there will still be minor bug-fixing patches in future, developers Evil Empire say. They've been working on this last blast of goodies for a while. We've known about it since at least February, as they reported the studio was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-cells-to-receive-its-final-update-as-devs-move-on-to-new-secret-projects">winding things down</a> on Dead Cells to focus on a new game. We've since learned this new game is co-op roguelike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/windblown">Windblown</a>. That swapover is a decision that Dead Cells's former lead designer Sébastien Benard called an "asshole move" out of frustration, although it's not particularly unusual for studios to move on to new projects in this way. Benard later apologised for the strong words but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ending-dead-cells-updates-is-a-marketing-stunt-to-leave-room-for-windblown-claims-former-lead-designer">clarified his thoughts</a>. (Benard worked at Motion Twin when they created the game, but it has since passed onto Evil Empire as the de facto custodians).</p>
<p>When I first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-cells-review">reviewed Dead Cells</a>, I called it "blisteringly fast when it needs to be, challenging without being frustrating, and packed with sharp, fatal toys." After eight years and 35 updates, it is simply more so. An exceptional game. In the endless butter churn of video games news, people may see talk of a game's final update through a mortal lens, adopting the rotten "dead game" mentality that feeds the anxiety of an industry (and an audience) obsessed with games-as-a-service. I hope that doesn't happen here. There will be people who only get around to picking up Dead Cells years from now, and fall madly in love with its speed, fury, and playfulness. There will be folks who return to it again and again. Nobody ever says "dead movie" or "dead book". And even though "dead" makes up 50% of this game's name, this franchise is as unlikely to perish as the flame-headed hero who carries it. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Konami has dropped a brand new story trailer for its highly-anticipated Silent Hill 2 Remake.</p>
<p>The teaser essentially matches the original's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md-vvbxyjDA">acclaimed 2001 E3 trailer</a>, and the script is almost identical, too, all set against a fabulous reimagining of (one of) Silent Hill 2's end themes, Promise.</p>
<p>The Remake trailer is below. For comparison, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md-vvbxyjDA">here's the 2001 E3 trailer for Silent Hill 2</a>:</p>

<p>Perhaps most excitingly, we <em>finally</em> get our first peek at the Remake's take on Eddie and Mary, two key NPCs that, until now, had not been shown in any cinematics (or at all, in Eddie's case).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-releases-on-ps5-and-pc-this-october">The last character reveal</a> generated, uh, <em>interesting</em> responses from some corners of the internet, but Eddie's face - if highly reminiscent of Tweedle Dee/Tweedle Dum - is much more faithful to the original, complete with his backwards baseball cap. He is palpably weird in all the right ways.</p>
<p>Mary, too, closely mirrors the original character, including her outfit and hairstyle.</p>
<p>We also get to see a little more combat, and a longer peek at Silent Hill 2's grungy environments courtesy of that all-new over-the-shoulder camera perspective. In this particular trailer, we briefly see the prison, the hotel, the park, and Brookhaven hospital, of course. All appear to have been so faithfully recreated, they look almost identical to the originals.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-releases-on-ps5-and-pc-this-october">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> - one of gaming's worst-kept secrets <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-is-back-but-is-it-too-much-too-soon">before it was formally revealed back in October 2022</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-releases-on-ps5-and-pc-this-october">is set to release on PC via Steam and PS5 on 8th October, 2024</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Tom Morgan shared his thoughts on the opening hours of the remake in Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2s-remake-dares-to-modernise-a-classic-and-is-largely-succeeding">Silent Hill 2 Remake preview</a>.</p>
<p>"In rebuilding such a beloved classic with upgraded visuals and controls, the new combat style fits in surprisingly well then," Tom wrote in his excellent summary.</p>
<p>"The puzzles, too, find a natural place in its world. A remake project is a delicate balancing act for any developer, it's fair to say: stray too far from the source at your own risk, while a failure to innovate defeats the point of the whole endeavour.</p>
<p>"What I've seen so far of Silent Hill 2 Remake, though, shows a team determined to stick to the original blueprint first. It provides the game a comfortingly familiar structure - while allowing new detail to flourish around it like a trellis - and I'm looking forward to seeing where it grows past its first three hours."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In comparison, The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered, which was released earlier this year on PS5, is priced at £44.99.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there's been no mention of a £10 upgrade path such has been done with other re-releases. Eurogamer has contacted Sony for more.</p>

<p>Those interested in getting their hands on the PC and PS5 version of Until Dawn will be able to pre-order the game from 21st August. In a PlayStation blog shared last week, it was confirmed a PSN account is required on PC.</p>
<p>On its release this autumn, remaster studio Ballistic Moon promises that this souped-up version of Until Dawn will offer a more "atmospheric experience" for players, thanks to a number of tweaks and adjustments. This includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-gets-suitably-spooky-pc-ps5-release-date">changes to graphics, gameplay, story elements and "more"</a>.</p>
<p>Until Dawn is set to release across PC and PlayStation 5 on 4th October. If you are still on the fence as to whether this game is for you, be sure to check out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-review">Eurogamer's original Until Dawn review from 2015</a>, where Dan Whitehead called it "weird, gory and surprisingly moving".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
This week's launch of Black Myth: Wukong has brought further controversy to the game with the leak of a document sent to influencers requesting they do not include "politics", "feminist propaganda", or references to Covid-19 in their coverage.
</p>
<p>
Over the weekend, a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1aKlZvxWxbPOzldSUdc6CaHmoy80Fl7W_wQt-Ex-vl0k/mobilebasic?pli=1">document</a> from the marketing team at co-publisher Hero Games leaked, which was sent to influencers and streamers ahead of coverage and contains a list of do's and don'ts.
</p>
<p>
While the do's simply reads "enjoy the game", the don'ts includes a number of caveats. "Do not insult other influencers or players" and "do not use any offensive language/humour" are both understandable, but other requests are far more political.

</figure>
<p>

In full, the don'ts are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Do NOT insult other influencers or players.</li>
<li>Do NOT use any offensive language/humour.</li>
<li>Do NOT include politics, violence, nudity, feminist propaganda, fetishisation, and other content that instigates negative discourse.</li>
<li>Do NOT use trigger words such as 'quarantine' or 'isolation' or 'Covid-19'.</li>
<li>Do NOT discuss content related to China's game industry policies, opinions, news, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The document was shared on social media by French content creator and journalist Benoit "ExServ" Reinier (thanks <a href="https://videogames.si.com/news/black-myth-wukong-streamers-feminist-propaganda">VideoGames.si</a>). Forbes reporter <a href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1825193786273681489">Paul Tassi</a> has also confirmed its validity.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer can confirm this document was not shared with journalists for review coverage. 
</p>
<p>
While guidelines for coverage are relatively normal, the above stipulations for Black Myth: Wukong are strict for their political nuance. It's unclear if this is typical practice in China, or for dealing with Western influencers.
</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong is the first major console release from the Chinese developer and has received massive attention around the world. The document perhaps suggests some inexperience working with Western media.</p>
<p>
However, it's clear Game Science, through Hero Games, is keen to control the narrative around Black Myth: Wukong to avoid negative coverage and ensure focus is on the game itself. This matches my own experience during preview, when I was told Game Science "will only answer questions related to gameplay".
</p>
<p>
The guidelines are also likely in place to avoid mention of previous reports of misogyny at the studio. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-black-myth-wukong-trailer-resurfaces-misogynistic-comments-from-developer">Posts from Game Science CEO Féng Jì</a> including sexualised and misogynistic language were reported on in 2020, while <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west">IGN</a> also reported on the studio's history with sexism.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Game Science for comment. Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wheres-our-black-myth-wukong-review">review of Black Myth: Wukong</a> is still on the way.

</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong will release on PS5 and PC tomorrow, 20th August. There is still no news on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch">delayed Xbox Series X/S release</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Last week, the Xitter account for H2M - a mod aiming to recreate the heyday of classic Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer inside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered</a> - <a href="https://x.com/H2Multiplayer/status/1824167247436542167">announced that they had received a cease and desist</a> from Activision Blizzard, and would shut down the project. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2">2022 version of Modern Warfare 2</a> lacked the original’s multiplayer, and H2M was so highly-anticipated that Steam sales of the 2016 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS </a>balooned in the lead-up to the mod’s planned release date. It didn't hurt that Activision had it on sale, of course, but the timing lined up so well that some fans<a href="https://x.com/okGRAPHS/status/1824168720819753007"> speculated the discount was a deliberate bait-and-switch</a> on the publisher’s part to profit from excitement over a mod they were already planning to shut down.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In all, H2M was set to include remasters of every classic Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer map, campaign levels tweaked for multiplayer, and all the maps from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare">Call Of Duty 4</a> - for a total of 54 maps. Basically, it was a lot of work, took a long time, and Activision waited until the very last minute to get all litigious about it.</p>

</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyZY_BiTmd8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>Now, H2M project lead and ‘founder’ Watchful Wolf has <a href="https://youtu.be/WhHQ76SgPUI">taken to YouTube</a> to speculate on the reasons surrounding Activision’s decision, as spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/h2m-creator-activision-interfere-black-ops/">Insider Gaming.</a> Watchful Wolf had this to say about the publisher’s motivation for sending the cease and desist.</p>
<blockquote><p>Essentially, because of the popularity H2M was gaining and how close it is to Black Ops 6, releasing and kind of the marketing and the beta stuff like that, they did not want H2M interfering with possible sales of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a></p></blockquote>
<p>If you were looking forward to H2M, there is somewhat of a silver lining to the story, however. Hours after the news of the cease and desist came out, the mod had leaked online through several Discord servers, again via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/h2m-leaked-online/">Insider Gaming</a>. “Around 800 people were playing the Mod at the time of writing, with thousands believed to have downloaded it,” they write.</p>
<p>There’s also currently a petition, with over 8000 signatures at the time of writing, named “Let H2M-Mod Live in peace.” From the petition:</p>
<blockquote><p>H2M is a passionate project that has revived interest in a game long considered dormant, actually helping Activision earn money from a title many thought was dead. The proof? It's been in the top 5 on the Steam charts for almost a week since it was announced and gained attention.</p>
<p>Instead of sending a cease and desist letter, Activision should thank the creators for dedicating countless hours to developing such an impressive mod for their game.</p>
<p>Consider the hundreds of thousands of dollars Activision has likely made thanks to this mod.</p>
<p>They should follow Rockstar's example with FiveM—a multiplayer mod created by players for players—and partner with H2M instead of fighting it. This is what the community wants.</p></blockquote>
<p>Best of luck with that, lads - although its hard to disagree with the sentiment. In other COD news, Activision are aiming to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-are-finally-cutting-down-call-of-dutys-horrendous-install-sizes-for-black-ops-6s-release">cut down the obscene install size for the next entry in the series. </a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Former team behind The Division: Heartland restructured.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
Ubisoft has cut 45 staff across two of its North American studios, as part of its third round of redundancies so far this year.
</p>
<p>
The company has laid off workers at both Ubisoft San Francisco, the developer of XDefiant, and Red Storm Entertainment, which had been working on the now-cancelled The Division: Heartland live service game.
</p>
<p>
"Last week Ubisoft San Francisco and Red Storm Entertainment informed their teams of a restructuring that will result in 45 employees leaving Ubisoft," a spokesperson confirmed in a statement to Eurogamer.

<p>
"This difficult yet necessary decision was made to align these studios' organisations with their future business and development objectives. We are committed to providing comprehensive support to those affected, including severance and career assistance, and we thank them for their many contributions to Ubisoft."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-free-to-play-shooter-the-division-heartland-cancelled-three-years-after-being-announced">Ubisoft canned The Division: Heartland after more than three years' worth of work</a> back in May, when the publisher said it needed to refocus resources on "bigger oppurtunities". 
</p>
<p>
At the time, Ubisoft said it was moving some staff to work on San Francisco's XDefiant, as well as ongoing work on Rainbow Six. 
</p>
<p>
Back in June, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-lays-off-30-ubisoft-toronto-devs-so-it-can-deliver-on-its-ambitious-roadmap">Ubisoft laid off 33 staff at its Toronto studio</a> as part of a "targeted realignment". The company is currently working on the long-awaited Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake and Splinter Cell. A further <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-hit-with-another-wave-of-layoffs">45 workers were let go from Ubisoft's global publishing teams</a> in April.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft has repeatedly shrunk in size over the past couple of years as it grapples with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-ceo-admits-mario-rabbids-sequel-should-have-waited-for-next-nintendo-console">disappointing financial results</a> and searches for its next big hit. The company is doubling down on Assassin's Creed over the next few years, beginning with the arrival of Japan-set <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> in November, with several other games in the pipeline. The publisher also has Star Wars Outlaws set to arrive in just a couple of weeks.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/19/check-out-two-new-trailers-for-silent-hill-2/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We have two new videos for the remake of Silent Hill 2 from Konami which will be landing on 8th October. The first is almost all cut scenes and gives you an idea of the story of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Silent Hill 2 - Story Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CMvrMTmuJuA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This second video is from footage from a preview event earlier this month in Japan. This is a preview build so may not be exactly the same as the final game, and the video focuses on the new features that are found in the game, as well as a decent look at combat which has also been enhanced. Just a quick note, the English captions are auto generated from the Japanese so they’re not perfect.</p>
<p><iframe title="【サイレントヒル2】『SILENT HILL 2』リメイク版の進化を体験。レッドピラミッドシング戦までの序盤を世界最速先行プレイ" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Ni3-2MmMF4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In development by Bloober Team, Silent Hill 2 is a big step up for the studio, but one that absolutely makes sense. They’re best known for their work on psychological horror games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/15/layers-of-fear-review-2/">Layers of Fear</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/19/observer-system-redux-review-ps5-series-x/">Observer</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/01/27/the-medium-review-xbox-series-x-pc/">The Medium</a>. That experience will be vital when updating a game made and designed for the limitations of the PlayStation 2 hardware in 2001.</p>

<p>In terms of the core gameplay, Silent Hill 2 will most noticeably be transformed by a shift away from fixed cameras and tank controls to over-the-shoulder and a more modern control scheme, similar to the treatment that Capcom gave to their Resident Evil remakes.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s also a massive leap forward graphically, with Bloober Team tapping into Unreal Engine 5 and all the cutting edge technology that this features like Lumen for realistic lighting effects and Nanite for exceptionally detailed 3D modelling and texturing.</p>
<p>It had been a while since Silent Hill 2 was first <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/20/silent-hill-2-remake-is-using-unreal-engine-5-with-lumen-and-nanite-graphics/">announced back in 2022</a> – of course, it had been heavily rumoured for a good long time before then – but true to their word, it seems that development had been progressing smoothly in the time since then.</p>
<p>Silent Hill 2 will be released on 8th October 2024 for PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-hands-on-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Ever since the release of the Resident Evil 2 remake, developers have returned to the well en masse to give their classic games a new lease of life, more often than not with mixed results. From what I’ve seen so far, the upcoming Silent Hill 2 remake doesn’t come close to hitting the heights of Resident Evil 2 – a blueprint for how a great remake is made – but it certainly feels like developer Bloober Team has made a lot of the right decisions when building on the survival horror classic’s undeniable legacy, even if at times it feels a little too safe.</p><p>I played the opening three hours of Silent Hill 2 and it was immediately apparent from the off that the remake gracefully captures all the important elements; an oppressive tone and straightforward game mechanics, even when the task itself is being obtuse. As with any Silent Hill game, atmosphere is king, and Silent Hill 2 immediately and consistently puts you into a state of unease. A thick fog surrounds the town like the original, now benefiting from modern lighting and volume thanks to today’s technical improvements. The streets are now filled with a new level of detail, shops are explorable, and strange sounds, cries, and groans are dynamically lurking around every corner.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The diegetic sounds of Silent Hill are where the game really sings, or rather, drones.</p></div><p>I can imagine it would have been incredibly tempting to layer music into the Silent Hill 2 remake, bringing the scares more in line with contemporary horror hits. But its slavish resistance is commendable, as the diegetic sounds of Silent Hill are where the game really sings, or rather, drones. Every room in the Wood Side Apartments creates its own version of uneasy tension, subtly assaulting you with an oppressive, unearthly soundscape of pulses and organic audio. From the moment protagonist James enters Silent Hill, the onslaught of bad vibes is present and never lets up for a second. Often fear is driven by anticipation, but Silent Hill 2 is <em>all</em> anticipation, with the sounds of the Lying Figures and co being ever-present. In some ways, it’s a difficult state of mind to be locked into.</p><p>It’s fair to say that Silent Hill 2 has stepped up its visual and audio game, but that’s to be expected for a 2024 release. The bigger and perhaps more impactful change is perspective, with Silent Hill 2 adopting the trusty over-the-shoulder playstyle that’s become a staple of the genre. What could have once been considered sacrilege for the series now serves the gameplay well, helping the unearthly combat encounters feel surprisingly familiar. Like the original, James’ arsenal is limited, with the only weapons available in the section I played being a handgun and his trusty wooden plank. Combat is certainly light and rudimentary, but Silent Hill 2 was never about that. It’s serviceable in a way that compliments the character’s ability – although I imagine it would have been extremely tempting for Bloober Team to strap James up Rambo-style, it would have been a disservice to the character and story it’s telling. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>That’s not to say James doesn’t have a new move in his locker though. Silent Hill 2 implements a new dodge mechanic, allowing James to quickly dart out of the way of an enemy’s projectile vomit or Pyramid Head’s swinging blade. It’s a simple quick shuffle, not a Dark Souls-like forward roll, but it’s a tool that helped me to quickly establish a swing-swing-dodge rhythm before the Lying Figures threw up all their guts on me. Perhaps the biggest compliment I can give is that it’s a move that feels like it always should have been in Silent Hill 2.</p><p>From what I’ve seen so far the story is largely faithful, and I visited all the locations I expected to in the first few hours. The opening jaunt through the streets of Silent Hill is expanded, though, tasking you to solve a puzzle involving a jukebox in Neely’s Bar and forcing you to visit several of the town’s locations. Along the way, there’s plenty to examine further and marvel at the detail layered into this once sparse location. While purists might scoff at this addition, I feel it’s a smart move that encourages you to spend a little more time roaming the iconic, foggy streets. It’s a welcome addition before you spend a large portion of the game funnelled down dark hallways in a largely linear path. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>My usual urge to brute force the puzzles was quickly replaced by a wish to legitimately solve them.</p></div><p>Fans of the original will be happy to hear that the remake doesn’t hold back with its returning puzzles. Like the original, the remake scales clues based on your difficulty level ( you can individually choose how challenging both combat and puzzles are in the main menu, although I didn’t get to test out how this is implemented in-game), but even on the normal difficulty setting I found some puzzles momentary head-scratchers that encouraged me to truly absorb my surroundings, especially after hard switching from my ‘kill everything that moves’ head space. Fans of the 2001 classic and the Resident Evil series know exactly what kind of thing to expect – using environmental clues to solve riddles and combinations –  but it felt like there was a little less signposting in Silent Hill 2 than its peers. It’s hard for me to quantify this, but all I can say is my usual urge to brute force the puzzles was quickly replaced by a wish to legitimately solve them. Hopefully that speaks to the puzzle’s design and not the pressures of the play session’s environment. </p><p>Bloober Team’s decision-making when rebuilding this classic has been clever, but it’s not perfect. The dialogue and performances still feel too campy and silly for my taste, often taking me out of the super serious tone. Unlike Resident Evil, where the campy nature is a big part of the vibe, Silent Hill in 2024 requires a subtle touch to complement the same masterful approach in atmosphere and sound design. Purists might celebrate its faithful remaking of the original’s lines, but I felt there was an opportunity here for some subtle rewrites and tweaks. I only got a small taste of the dialogue though, and Silent Hill 2 isn’t exactly known for its long conversations, so perhaps it’s not any kind of deal breaker.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Silent Hill 2 Remake</h3></div></output><p>Another irksome inclusion is the logical, but slightly tedious activity of opening countless kitchen cupboards and drawers to collect handgun ammo and healing items, similar to modern games like The Last of Us. It makes sense on paper, organically placing your collectible items in realistic locations, but I can’t help but feel the process took me out of the atmosphere, altering my thought process from fear to loot every time I entered a new room. Maybe it says more about me than the game, but several times after entering a room I was jumped by a hidden mannequin because I had prioritised scouring for pick-ups instead of enemies. </p><p>Disappointingly, from what I’ve seen so far Silent Hill 2 doesn’t appear to incorporate my favourite feature the best remakes tend to have: Taking your expectations based on what you know about the original and subverting them. 2002’s Resident Evil Remake, which played around with the ‘dogs jumping through the window’ jump scare that all fans expected, is the perfect example of how this can be expertly crafted. The approach allows for the tension of a fake out, and the creative space to drop new scares where you least expect it. This Silent Hill 2 remake doesn’t appear to have any real moments like that and, ultimately, no real big swings that change the landscape for hardcore fans. At least not in the opening three hours. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>As a remake, Silent Hill 2 falls more in line with BluePoint’s faithful Shadow of the Colossus rather than Capcom’s rejuvenated Resident Evil 2. It substitutes bold new swings for a slavish dedication to the original, which is by no means a bad thing, just not the radical step some might expect. Silent Hill 2 certainly needed a fresh coat of paint and a tune of the engine, and Bloober Team has provided that in spades, but everything else is an extremely faithful reimagining that mostly resists the urge to alter the successful formula of a stone-cold classic.</p><p><em>Dale Driver is IGN's Executive Producer of Video Programming.
