            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/rog-ally-v-rog-ally-x-which-is-best/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Asus ROG Ally was considered the best gaming handheld device on the market – until the ROG Ally X showed up. This next-generation variant of Asus’ Windows 11 gaming handheld was released in July 2024, which means gamers worldwide have had more than half a year to fully get to grips (no pun intended) with the device.</p>



<p>I’m the proud owner of both the ROG Ally and the ROG Ally X, and I figured it was about time I settled the comparison beef once and for all. Is the ROG Ally X worth the massive price increase over the ROG Ally, or are you better off sticking with the original and saving a few hundred dollars?</p>



<p>Let’s find it – it’s time for ROG Ally v ROG Ally X – the battle between the best.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-the-rog-ally-x-worth-it">Is The ROG Ally X Worth It?</h2>



<p>The ROG Ally can be bought brand new for around $450 – $600, depending on where you look. By comparison, the ROG Ally X costs up to $800, which is a considerable increase.</p>



<p>But is the extra power under the hood of the Asus ROG Ally X worth the jump?</p>



<p>I went straight from an Ally to an Ally X, and the difference was noticeable both in and outside the device. Internally, the ROG Ally X has 8 GB more RAM and a 1 TB SSD as standard, which beats the Ally’s 512 GB SSD into the ground. The biggest selling point of the Ally X is the battery – while the Ally has a 40Wh battery, the Ally X boasts a beasty 80Wh battery.</p>



<p>Bizarrely, the Ally X isn’t all that much bigger to account for the boosted hardware and capabilities – it’s just 65 grams heavier than the Ally, which was released in 2023.</p>



<p>Both devices utilise the same screen and speakers, but the Ally X has an extra USB-C port and the micro SD card slot was relocated to counter an overheating issue that was present in the Ally – <strong>and still is</strong>. That extra port means that you can run a USB-C headset on the device while charging it, which is a nice bonus.</p>



<p>Asus also reported that the Ally X has a better internal cooling solution, with fans that boast more blades.</p>



<p>On the surface, the ROG Ally X is quite different. The overall shape of the device has been rounded off in place, the default colour is black as opposed to white, the rear ‘extra’ buttons have been shrunken down, and the thumbsticks feel much more durable and tactile.</p>



<p>But is all that worth the price increase, or should you stick with the ROG Ally? I put both of these handheld gaming devices to the test.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-the-rog-ally-still-hold-up">Does The ROG Ally Still Hold Up?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The Ally X is the new king of handhelds</figcaption></figure>



<p>Until recently, the ROG Ally was my flagship handheld, and it was a trusty one at that. However, I did have a few issues</p>



<ul>
<li>On the ‘turbo’ mode (25W or 30W plugged in), the heat generated by the ROG Ally would be extreme after too long</li>



<li>Also on turbo, the battery life was laughably short, with a AAA game killing the battery in around 30 minutes</li>



<li>I was never a fan of the stark white colour for a handheld, as it’s bound to get dirty or discoloured</li>
</ul>



<p>It was fine for plane rides and commutes, but beyond that, I couldn’t sing its praises too much. It’s a Windows 11 device, just like the Ally X, but it’s not like I was using it for multitasking and web browsing – the Windows interface just doesn’t translate well to a handheld device like this.</p>



<p>Once I switched to the ROG Ally X, the benefits were plain as day.</p>



<p>For example, I played Diablo 4 off-charge and on turbo mode, and I was able to coax around an hour and a half out of the battery before it collapsed in on itself. That’s more than enough to please me, but I was able to notice a performance boost too, thanks to the enhanced RAM in the Ally X.</p>



<p>The face buttons, shell, multi-directional d-pad, and even the shoulder buttons (which are more ‘mouse-clicky’ on the Ally X) all look and feel superb, and overall, the device is much more attractive in a black-on-black aesthetic. Also, the front-mounted speakers sound much more powerful. Having the volume on just ’20’ is more than enough for me.</p>



<p>I have no gripes with the Ally X – <strong>yet</strong>.</p>



<p>Is the Ally X worth the money, though? I’d say so – but $800 is a severe price point for any gaming device, least of all a handheld with a relatively limited battery life and a UI that just isn’t comfortable when it comes to gaming.</p>



<p>I can see the improvement over the Ally, and that’s what I was going for. I would have liked an upgraded screen or a switch-up in the RGB on the device, but I’ll take what I’ve been given, I suppose. It’s still a nice 7-inch IPS display running at 120Hz.</p>



<p>While you can still get the Asus ROG Ally, I just don’t think it’s worth investing the cash if you’re not getting the best and most up-to-date available model on the market. Ultimately, it’s your decision.</p>

<p>Shopify Rebellion and Moist Esports, the esports organization owned by content creator stars Charles “Cr1TiKaL” White Jr. and Ludwig “Ludwig” Ahgren, have fully merged under the Shopify banner. Both Cr1TiKaL and Ludwig are now co-owners of Shopify Rebellion.</p>



<p>The two organizations have partnered together in recent years, but now move forward together as one.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-shopify-rebellion-and-moist-esports-fully-join-forces">Shopify Rebellion and Moist Esports Fully Join Forces</h2>



<p>In addition to Cr1TiKaL and Ludwig joining Rebellion as co-owners, the organization will use some of Moist Esports’ branding (including the droplet mascots) and absorb the esports divisions competing under the Moist banner. All the Moist divisions will compete as Shopify Rebellion moving forward.</p>







<p>Moist Esports was founded by Cr1TiKaL in 2021, with the YouTube star jumping into the expansive fighting game community (FGC) first before entering Rocket League and Apex Legends a year later. Ludwig joined Moist as a co-owner in 2023, spear-heading the organization’s entry into VALORANT. Later that year, Ludwig announced that Moist and Shopify would partner together to run a VALORANT NA Challengers roster, which competed under the name MxS.</p>



<p>Both Cr1TiKaL and Ludwig have been very forthcoming and public about the costs of running an esports organization. Back in 2021, Cr1TiKaL told his audience plainly that he was running Moist Esports at a loss. When the organization entered VALORANT, Ludwig said that entering the scene cost roughly <a href="https://dotesports.com/valorant/news/ludwig-spends-half-a-million-dollars-to-pick-up-na-valorant-challengers-roster-for-moist-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“$500,000 of Charlie’s money.”</a></p>



<p>With Moist and Shopify Rebellion now merged, the Rebels now field several different esports rosters. “Coming together allows us to field more and stronger teams, invest deeper for fans, and provide more to our players,” <a href="https://x.com/ShopifyRebels/status/1880287780817056025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote Shopify Rebellion founder</a>, Jeremy Steeves. Shopify Rebellion fields the following esports rosters:</p>



<ul>
<li>Two VALORANT teams (including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shopify-rebellion-game-changers-vct-win/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the two-time defending Game Changers champions</a>)</li>



<li>A League of Legends roster in the newly rebranded LoL Americas conference (formerly in the LCS)</li>



<li>An Apex Legends roster</li>



<li>A Halo roster in the HCS</li>



<li>A Rainbow Six Siege roster (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shopify-rebellion-in-rainbow-six-soniqs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">signed just this past December</a>)</li>



<li>A Dota 2 roster</li>



<li>Four StarCraft II players</li>



<li>A Rocket League roster</li>



<li>Several Smash and Street Fighter 6 players</li>
</ul>

<p>Between the 3rd and the 16th of February, the Six Invitational 2025 will unravel in Boston. This historic tournament is one of the biggest single events in the esports ecosystem, boasting a $3 million prize pool shared between 20 competing teams.</p>



<p>Recently, Ubisoft took to social media to reveal the full suite of Six Invitational 2025 groups, uncovering four rosters each made up of five teams apiece. Judging from the lineup that has been revealed, we’re already set to see some stellar matches at the Six Invitational 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-line-them-up">Line Them Up</h2>



<p>Here are the Six Invitational 2025 groups per the recent release from Ubisoft:</p>



<p><strong>Group A</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>G2 Esports</li>



<li>M80</li>



<li>Team JOEL</li>



<li>Team Liquid</li>



<li>Unwanted</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Group B</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>CAG Osaka</li>



<li>FaZe Clan</li>



<li>FURIA</li>



<li>Shopify Rebellion</li>



<li>Team Secret</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Group C</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>DarkZero</li>



<li>PSG Talon</li>



<li>RazaH Company Academy</li>



<li>Team BDS</li>



<li>Team Falcons</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Group D</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Oxygen Esports</li>



<li>SCARZ</li>



<li>Spacestation Gaming</li>



<li>Virtus.pro</li>



<li>w7m Esports</li>
</ul>



<p>By far the most exciting group at the Six Invitational is Group B, featuring the talents of FaZe Clan and FURIA. At the last Six Invitational in Sao Paolo, these two rosters went head-to-head in the grand final, which turned out to be the most popular esports event in Rainbow Six Siege history.</p>



<p>That’s already a fixture to watch out for.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, all eyes will be on Team BDS, sitting in Group C alongside challengers like DarkZero, Team Falcons, and PSG Talon. It was BDS that scooped a solid performance last year, netting the Esports World Cup trophy and finishing in second place at back-to-back BLAST Major tournaments. It’s easy to see how Team BDS could go all the way in Boston.</p>



<p>Following the group stage, the teams will be seeded into the Six Invitational 2025 playoff stage. From there, it’s a fight through the double-elimination bracket to the grand final, with the lion’s share of the $3 million prize pool waiting for the victor.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-wouldve-tried-to-resist-sonys-live-service-push<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida has said he would have tried to resist Sony’s controversial live service video game push.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yoshida, who was President of SIE Worldwide Studios for Sony Interactive Entertainment from 2008 to 2019, told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jMsGB2PItes?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinda Funny Games</a> that Sony always knew its investment in live service games was risky.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yoshida’s comments come amid a tumultuous time for PlayStation live service games. While Arrowhead’s Helldivers 2 was a breakout hit, becoming the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks, Sony’s other live service games were either canceled or suffered disastrous launches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Sony’s Concord is one of the biggest video game disasters in PlayStation history, lasting just a couple of weeks before it was brought offline amid eye-wateringly low player numbers. Sony later decided to kill the game entirely and shut its developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It has proved a costly failure for Sony. Concord's initial development deal was around $200 million according to a report by <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Kotaku</u></a>. It said the $200 million was not enough to fund Concord's entire development, nor did it include the purchase of the Concord IP rights or Firewalk Studios itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Concord flop came after Sony had already canceled Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us multiplayer game. And just this week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games">Sony reportedly canceled two unannounced live service games</a>, one a God of War title in development at Bluepoint, the other in the works at Days Gone developer Bend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yoshida, who left Sony this week after 31 years at the company, discussed PlayStation live service in the interview with Kinda Funny Games, saying if he were current Sony Interactive Entertainment Studio Business Group CEO Hermen Hulst, he would have pushed back on live service back when it emerged. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For me, I was managing this budget, so I was responsible for allocating money to what kinds of games to make,” Yoshida said. “If the company was considering [going] that way, it probably didn’t make sense to stop making another God of War or single-player game, and put all the money into the live service games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“However, what they did when I left and Hermen [Hulst] took over is the company gave us a lot more resources. I don’t think they told Hermen to stop making single-player games. [They said] ‘these games are great, keep doing that, and we’ll give you additional resources to work on these live service games and try it.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m sure they knew it was risky. The chance of a game becoming successful in this hugely competitive genre would be small. However, the company, knowing that risk, gave Hermen the resources and chance to try it. I think that’s the way they did it. In my mind, that’s great, and hopefully some games will become successful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Luckily, Helldivers 2 did so well. Nobody expected that. So you can’t plan a success in this industry. That’s the most fun part of this business. I hope that this strategy will work in the end. If I was in Hermen’s position, probably I would’ve tried to resist that direction. Maybe that’s one of the reasons they removed me from the first-party!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent financial call, Sony president, COO and CFO Hiroki Totoki said the company had learned lessons from both the record-breaking launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a> earlier this year and Concord’s failure. On Concord specifically, Totoki said Sony should have run its development gates such as user testing or internal evaluation “much earlier than we did.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Currently we are still in the process of learning,” Totoki admitted. “Basically, with regards to new IP, of course you don’t know the result until you actually try it. So for our reflection, probably we need to have a lot of gates, including user testing or internal evaluation, and the timing of such gates, we need to bring them forward. We should have done those gates much earlier than we did.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The suggestion here from Totoki was that Sony should have noticed and reacted to Concord’s issues earlier in the development process, presumably so that it could have improved the game before launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Totoki then went on to point fingers at Sony’s “siloed organization” and Concord’s release window, which may have caused cannibalisation. Concord launched in August, not long after smash hit Black Myth: Wukong hit PS5 and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have a siloed organization, so going beyond the boundaries of those organizations in terms of development and also sales, I think that could have been much smoother,” Totoki said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then going forward, in our own titles and in third-party titles, we do have many different windows. And we want to be able to select the right and optimal window so that we can deploy them on our own platform without cannibalisation, so that we can maximize our performance in terms of title launches.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the same financial call, Sony senior vice president for finance and IR Sadahiko Hayakawa compared the launches of Helldivers 2 and Concord, saying lessons learned would be shared throughout the business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We launched two live service games this year,” he said. “Helldivers 2 was a huge hit, while Concord ended up being shut down. We gained a lot of experience and learned a lot from both.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We intend to share the lessons learned from our successes and failures across our studios, including in the areas of title development management as well as the process of continually adding expanded content and scaling the service after its release so as to strengthen our development management system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We intend to build on an optimum title portfolio during the current mid-range plan period that combines single-player games — which are our strengths and which have a higher predictability of becoming hits due to our proven IP — with live-service games that pursue upside while taking on a certain amount of risk upon release.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking to the future, a number of PlayStation live service games remain in the works, including Bungie’s Marathon, Guerrilla’s Horizon Online, and Haven Studio’s Fairgame$.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p>This measurement method requires some judgment calls to decide where the edges of certain Switch 2 elements begin and end in the relevant frames. Issues of distortion associated with the camera lens (or video editing on Nintendo's part) might also affect the precision of the measurements. Still, the results of this calculation should be close enough for a first-order estimate.</p>
<p>Overall, the Switch's expanded screen size would give it something of a leg up over portable PC competition like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/steam-deck-the-comprehensive-ars-technica-review/">Steam Deck</a> (or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/review-steam-deck-oleds-brilliant-screen-fixes-the-portables-biggest-flaw/">Steam Deck OLED</a>) and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/asus-rog-ally-x-review-better-performance-and-feel-in-a-pricey-package/">ROG Ally X</a>. To get a significantly <em>bigger</em> screen on a gaming handheld, you have to look to <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/outletus/en/p/handheld/legion-go/len106g0001">the Lenovo Legion Go</a> or monsters like the upcoming <a href="https://www.acer.com/us-en/handheld-gaming/nitro-handheld-gaming/nitro-blaze-11">Acer Nitro Blaze 11</a>. Yet despite the larger screen, the Switch 2 still comes in significantly narrower than competition like the Steam Deck (10.48-inch width with Joy-Cons for the Switch 2 versus 11.7 inches for the Steam Deck).</p>


<p>As for the new Joy-Cons, a lengthening of roughly 13 to 18 percent along either axis should make holding them a little less cramp-inducing for adult hands. And the additional surface area on the joysticks (~43 percent larger) and buttons (~60 percent larger) should make them significantly more comfortable under the thumbs.</p>
<p>We won't really know how the comparative hardware battle will shake out, though, until we get crucial details from Nintendo about things like the Switch 2's thickness, weight, screen resolution, and hardware power (not to mention the price, of course). For now, though, at least we can look at these images and measurements and imagine how the next Nintendo console will feel in our hands.</p>
<h2>Switch 2 estimated dimensions</h2>
<p>(As calculated by Ars Technica, based on freeze frames from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/its-official-take-a-first-look-at-the-switch-2/">the teaser trailer</a>)</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/austin-suther-top-10-games-of-2024</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/austin-suthers-top-10-games-of-2024.1085418/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/austin-suther-top-10-games-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last year, I made the brazen claim that "2023 will go down as one of the best years for game releases in a <em>long</em> time." I might have to eat my words after seeing what 2024 had to offer. I played the most JRPGs I ever have, and that's most definitely reflected in this list. I also had to cut a few things out of my list, which hurts, but I'd like to give honorable mentions to <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-review-id-explain-but-i-dont-think-i-can" rel="nofollow">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stellar-blade-review-mother-sphere-knows-best" rel="nofollow">Stellar Blade</a></em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lorns-lure-review-call-of-void" rel="nofollow"><em>Lorn's Lure</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mullet-madjack-review-nostalgia-fueled-frenzy" rel="nofollow"><em>Mullet MadJack</em></a> to name just a few.</p>



<h2>10. <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em></h2>

<p>I feel like <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em> fell a bit under the radar. Admittedly, it released during a tumultuous time, with other blockbusters taking the limelight. I'm a glutton for HD-2D games, though, so I was all over this when it released.</p>

<p><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D</em> is also my first time playing the series, and needless to say, I am eagerly awaiting 2025's HD-2D rendition of the first two games, as well.</p>



<h2>9. <em>Dragon's Dogma 2</em></h2>

<p><em>Dragon's Dogma 2</em> is an incredibly imperfect game, but I'd be lying if I said this wasn't one of the most fun games on the list. The long-awaited follow-up to the 2012 cult classic didn't disappoint me, at least, with its wildly immersive world and addicting combat.</p>

<p>Enemy variety is somewhat lacking, but tackling a new monster in <em>Dragon's Dogma 2</em> was always an exciting moment. Climbing on a cyclops' face to stab his eye is immensely satisfying. Unlocking all of the different vocations lead to myriad ways to tackle different monsters, which made experimenting with builds a rewarding experience.</p>



<h2>8. <em>Unicorn Overlord</em></h2>

<p>So, no <em>Fire Emblem</em> release this year? Fine, I'll find another strategy game to play. <em>Unicorn Overlord</em> might not be the same gameplay-wise, but it still scratches that tactical itch. Creating squads of powerful soldiers and fine-tuning their tactics is delightfully fun.</p>

<p>The story is also somewhat similar to that of <em>Fire Emblem</em> -- an ousted prince must reclaim his conquered kingdom. It's a familiar narrative, for sure, but conquering territories and gaining many allies along the way is a satisfying loop. The characters are diverse with its wonderful, undeniably Vanillaware art style. All things said, it is a fantastic package from start to finish.</p>



<h2>7. <em>Persona 3 Reload</em></h2>

<p>My Spotify playlist has a bunch of <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> songs. Every once in a while, the credits theme will play and I'll start feeling all depressed. <em>Persona 3</em> <em>Reload</em> hit me in the feels like few games do. An incredible cast of characters accompanies a darker story, making for a somewhat somber but nonetheless fantastic playthrough.</p>

<p>This was also my first time playing <em>Persona 3</em> in any form, so I was spared the arduous task of navigating pre-<em>Reload</em> Tartarus. I found the dungeon-crawling gameplay to be quite therapeutic, so climbing to the top was a breeze for me.</p>



<h2>6.&nbsp; <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em></h2>

<p>As you can probably tell by the number of JRPGs on this list, I've played some long games this year. Yet, if I had to guess what game had my highest number of hours played, it would probably be <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>. Since it's launch, I've played it every single day. The power of gacha is strong in this one.</p>

<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>'s hook isn't just the admittedly addicting gacha, though. It's the art style, a surprisingly compelling story and cast of characters, and its<em> </em>simplified <em>Devil May Cry-</em>style combat that keeps me coming back. With a steady stream of content every few weeks, I won't be dropping <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> in the foreseeable future.</p>



<h2>5. <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></h2>

<p>It seemed like the internet was out to get <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> -- like people wanted it to fail. Well, surprise, it's actually quite amazing. I had hope that MachineGames would knock it out of the park considering the studio's pedigree, and I was happy to see <em>Indiana Jones</em> get <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/indiana-jones-and-great-circle-review-perfect-adaptation-of-original-ip" rel="nofollow">critical acclaim</a> from critics.</p>

<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> captures the essence of what makes this franchise so beloved. The iconic music, quirky story, and supernatural elements come into play and create a game as good as any <em>Indiana Jones</em> movie.</p>

<p>I'd like to give props to the level design, as well. The Vatican is a full-blown immersive sim level, like a more grounded-in-reality version of <em>Dishonored</em>. With a DLC along the way -- presumably later this year -- I'm hoping the excellent level design carries over.</p>



<h2>4. <em>Astro Bot</em></h2>

<p>Praise be the DualSense, with its haptic feedback and a bunch of other bells and whistles. <em>Astro's Playroom</em> took full advantage of the controller's capabilities when it launched with the PS5, and <em>Astro Bot </em>takes it a step further. I truly believe the future of gaming is not in higher graphical fidelity, but in the way a controller can enhance gameplay.</p>

<p>So yes, <em>Astro Bot</em>'s utilization of the DualSense is mindbogglingly good, but the world design and platforming are even better. Many compared <em>Astro Bot</em> to <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>, and they're definitely similar both in theme and in design. Team ASOBI found the secret formula that made <em>Super Mario</em> games so great, and made their own incredible platformer with it.</p>



<h2>3. <em>Tsukihime -A Piece of Blue Glass Moon-</em></h2>

<p>Soooo, technically this game came out several years ago, but only in Japanese. In 2024, we received an English translation for <em>Tsukihime. </em>It's my list, so I make the rules.</p>

<p>I already talked extensively about this absolutely fantastic visual novel. This was, in fact, my first true visual novel I've ever played/read, and I was gripped by its powerful storytelling and prose. If you want to read why <em>Tsukihime </em>turned me into a visual novel fan, look no further than this <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/tsukihimes-turned-me-into-visual-novel-fan" rel="nofollow">opinion piece</a> I wrote in July.</p>

<p>I'd like to give a quick shout-out to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2396980/Fatestay_night_REMASTERED/" rel="nofollow"><em>fate/stay night Remaster</em></a>. The <em>Fate</em> franchise is now a household name among weebs, and this is the first official translation for the visual novel that started it all. Check that one out too!</p>



<h2>2. <em>UFO 50</em></h2>

<p>Curse the word limit my tyrannical editors thrust upon me. Had I more words, I'd write a novel on why <em>UFO 50 </em>is so great. It's a collection of 50 separate games, many of which are quite lengthy. This isn't just some mini-game collection, it's like the equivalent of having 50 physical games on a shelf you can plop into your system at any time.</p>

<p>So yeah, while I could go on and on about <em>UFO 50, </em>I'll instead give a shout-out to some of my favorites in this retro-inspired collection: <em>Mooncat; Warptank; Elfazar's Hat; Pilot Quest;</em> and <em>Mini and Max</em>. In fact, <em>Mini and Max</em> is so good, it could be a game of the year contender by itself. To find out what I mean, you just need to play it for yourself.</p>



<h2>1. <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></h2>

<p>If you didn't scroll down to this list right at the start of the article, then it's probably a pretty easy guess that <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>is my Game of the Year. It's not just the best JRPG I've played this year, it's just the best game, flat out.</p>

<p>Unparalleled visual design (even if the graphics themselves are somewhat dated), compelling characters, a well-written story, and an addicting combat system coalesces into what I might consider a masterpiece.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/anson-chan-top-5-games-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Looking back at all the games of 2024, it would be cliched to say that there were too many good games to decide which would be the best. It would be far more accurate to say that there were too many interesting-looking games to try instead.</p>

<p>Indeed, 2024 might have been the first year to make Xbox Game Pass feel like a trip to the buffet after already consuming a full dinner with dessert and appetizers. Thus, while it would be easy to say that the following games have made an impression, it is by no means a comprehensive list of games that everyone should sample.</p>

<h2><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zzz-lycaon.jpg?itok=uOLevf9b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zzz-lycaon.jpg?itok=8kdc6Qr3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The classiest werewolf butler that you ever did see</figcaption></figure><p>While there were a lot of (or more accurately, too many) excellent games released in 2024, <em>Zenless Zone Zero </em>is probably the one that I am the most fond of. Unsurprisingly, <em>ZZZ's</em> combat mechanics are the star of the show. In a nutshell, it's a fighting game that doesn't require you to memorize dozens of combo attacks mixed with a hint of <em>Dark Souls</em> damage scaling. Throw in some flashy visuals and sound effects and you've got a winning gameplay recipe.</p>

<p>Of course, gameplay isn't the only thing that's important. Storytelling and style matters just as much, and while good storytelling is somewhat subjective, oh boy does <em>ZZZ </em>have style. Among Hoyoverse's existing games, it's hardly a controversial statement to say that <em>ZZZ </em>has the most interesting and unique roster of playable characters from a design perspective. There's robots, humans with animal characteristics, animals with human characteristics, and everything in between.</p>

<p>The thing that pushes <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> to be my personal favorite of the year though is the Bangboo. It would've been easy to have these silly mascots do cute things in the background, but the developers went above that and integrated them into the gameplay in meaningful ways. Recent updates introduced a tower defense and platforming mode exclusive to the Bangboo, they are active participants in combat and the story, and they are varied enough to be consistently visually interesting.</p>

<h2><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kunitsu-gami-demons.jpg?itok=Pl5Iv9iq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kunitsu-gami-demons.jpg?itok=frAQRzT0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>So maybe it would be a good idea to close that freaky face door in the back</figcaption></figure><p>Who could've guessed that one of the most emotional narratives of 2024 would come from a tower defense game where the story, which draws heavily from Japanese folklore, is told more or less entirely through interpretive dance. It sounds silly on paper yet it works for <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em>, a game that is greater than the sum of its parts.</p>

<p>Indeed, one would be hard pressed to recommend <em>Kunitsu-Gami's</em> based on any singular aspect of the gameplay. You need the game's creative enemy design, the interpretive dances, and the sound design to work together in unison to provide such an excellent product. If any of those aspects are lacking, then the game fundamentally changes, and likely for the worse.</p>

<p>That being said, it would be interesting if the developers decided to expand upon <em>Kunitsu-Gami, </em>whether it be through a spiritual successor or otherwise. After all, it's not often that you get to banish demons with power of dance (and extreme violence). Plus you could theoretically take the game's concept and apply it to other cultures.</p>

<h2><em>Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eiyuden-chronicle-forest.jpg?itok=jJSH3Qy9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eiyuden-chronicle-forest.jpg?itok=K7dNLayt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Would've preferred it if the characters from <em>Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising</em> had a larger role in the story, but the new main party is good too</figcaption></figure><p>While most RPGs prefer to limit your roster of playable heroes to dozen characters at most, presumably due to practical reasons, <em>Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes</em> does what the title says it will do by giving you over a hundred characters to interact with. The kicker is that the vast majority of these characters are playable and everyone has some meaningful screen time, brief as it may be.</p>

<p>In spite of the obvious limitations, having such a huge cast of characters does make <em>Eiyuden Chonicle's</em> story a little bit more grounded. Having legendary warriors and mages on your side means little when you don't have cooks, lumberjacks, farmers, and all the other logistical staff needed to keep the party fed and clothed. Thankfully the game does handwave the actual logistics in the interest of compelling gameplay, but it's a nice change of narrative pace.</p>

<p>The fact that the developers clearly put no small effort into the side quests associated with the supporting characters is a nice added touch. The cook's side quest is particularly memorable, as are the optional plays that you can perform at the theater. If anything, it is the focus on these traditionally minor characters that help <em>Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes </em>stand out from its turn-based JRPG peers.</p>

<h2><em>Botany Manor</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/botany-manor-plants.jpg?itok=1Qzb8eui 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/botany-manor-plants.jpg?itok=9HYOJup6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's like a Bob Ross painting!</figcaption></figure><p>Sometimes it's nice to take a break from games where you have to save the world or eliminate a million enemies in three minutes with a min-maxed character, and this is where a game like <em>Botany Manor</em> shines. The stakes aren't particularly high in the <em>Manor--</em>it's just you, some plants, and a fancy house. Frankly, the puzzles aren't exactly challenging either. In other words, the perfect game for escapism.</p>

<p>That's not to say that <em>Botany Manor </em>isn't a good puzzle game in its own right. Growing individual plants is the goal, and the solutions tend to involve collecting some clues and messing around with the environment. Fairly basic stuff compared to what other puzzle games might offer, and it admittedly makes the game somewhat short, yet it's competently and creatively executed each and every time.</p>

<p>As one would expect from such a game, the art direction and sound design are positively stunning. At the conclusion of each puzzle, the associated plant blooms to life in a spectacular display of color. Some of them affect the environment too, adding even more color to an already colorful world, more than enough proof that games are a form of art.</p>

<h2><em>Little Kitty, Big City</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/little-kitty-big-city-sit.jpg?itok=jWD9vhLL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/little-kitty-big-city-sit.jpg?itok=Uwek8akm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The kitty is plotting something, or about to take a nap, it's hard to tell which.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Little Kitty, Big City </em>is another relaxing game where you're just a cat who's trying to get home. There's platforming and puzzle elements involved, and an unexpected amount of dialogue between animals as well. While there's some narrative urgency to the game, you can go at your own pace and admire the adorable cat animations as much as you want.</p>

<p>Obviously, <em>Little Kitty, Big City </em>is more than just a game where you do cat things like knock over objects and climb into places where you probably shouldn't. Ultimately, it's a competently made sandbox game. Regardless of if the protagonist is a cat, a dog, or a tiny Mario and Luigi sprite, the scale of the world and the degree to which you can interact with it makes the game so amusing.</p>

<p>Again, <em>Little Kitty, Big City </em>is on the shorter side, and it's somewhat lacking in replayablility considering the genre, but in all honesty these kinds of shorter games are a perfect complement to the seemingly endless stream of current and upcoming games that will likely demand dozens of hours of playtime for a single playthrough.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/tyler-chancey-top-10-games-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gaming in 2024 felt like the start of a shift in trends. The death of live services. The rise of nostalgic remasters and remakes. A time of big budget stagnation and indie innovation. It was also a year awash with layoffs and studio closures alongside a massive disruption of both the games industry and games press. As such, my top 10 of the year may be the most eclectic it's been in a while. The strange, the challenging, the exciting, and the profound all have a place here.</p>

<p>Here are my top 10 games of 2024.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/black-myth-wukong-boss-temple.jpg?itok=UbiCoZnG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/black-myth-wukong-boss-temple.jpg?itok=MBZjP0u0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>10. <em>Black Myth Wukong</em></h2>

<p>GameScience's debut title made a considerable splash this year. Its recursive narrative moves back and forth between adaptation, retelling, and sequel to <em>Journey to the West</em>. Combat hits a euphoric blend of challenging and satisfying, utilizing Sun Wukong's arsenal of clones, teleportation, heavenly transformations, and powerful quarterstaff strikes. Boss battles walk a fine line between monumental challenges and bombastic spectacle.</p>

<p>It is a game with such passion and dedication put into every polygon that it overshadows some undercooked level design and some questionable story presentation. <em>Black Myth Wukong</em> is one massive swing that gets a lot right on its first go, and It has made GameScience a studio to keep an eye on.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-witness-final-fight.jpg?itok=g6S_F2u8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-witness-final-fight.jpg?itok=w1sJn3KV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>9. <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em></h2>

<p>A lot can happen in 10 years. In the case of <em>Destiny</em>, three different console generations, the rise and fall of gaming trends, and countless sea changes and course corrections for its epic space opera shooter.</p>

<p>But this year, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/destiny-2-final-shape-end-to-light-and-darkness" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bungie did it</a>. <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> delivered an epic conclusion to its decade-spanning story, packed with emotional setpieces, impeccable gunfights, and a wonderful 12-member finale event that lives rent-free in my head.</p>

<p>While <em>Destiny 2's</em> current climate has been meandering and anemic, I cannot deny the craftsmanship that went into telling the final chapter of The Traveler and The Witness. And it is a finale that I and some close friends will remember for a long time.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-king-darius-boss-fight.jpg?itok=ukibIoRb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-king-darius-boss-fight.jpg?itok=Pazg3mmg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>8. <em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em></h2>

<p>It has been years since I've touched a major release from Ubisoft. Their in-house style, while enjoyable in small doses, can be an overwhelming exercise in excess. In the current gaming landscape, that can mean dozens or even hundreds of hours of precious time lost.</p>

<p>Which is why I absolutely loved <em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em>, a scaled-down, straightforward action platforming adventure packed with polish, punch, and presentation by some of the industry's best designers.</p>

<p>It blends <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/prince-of-persia-lost-crown-review-its-about-time-and-space" rel="nofollow">the spectacle and style of shonen anime into its boss fights</a>, the creative and thoughtful level design of the best Metroidvanias on the market, and an escalating set of challenges tailor made for platforming purists and combat junkies alike.</p>

<p>It's an experience soured by the fact the studio that made it <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-disbands-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-team" rel="nofollow">got laid off</a>. But, <em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em> is the kind of game we need more of in this industry, and for that, it earns a spot on my list.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-seethe-attack.jpg?itok=wolhA6vx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-seethe-attack.jpg?itok=vIwjtpom 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>7. <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em></h2>

<p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/kunitsu-gami-path-of-goddess-review-tactical-demon-slaying" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em></a>, when described on paper, reads like an ad lib. A hack-and-slash, real-time strategy, tower-defense game about banishing an army of demons from a mountain set in ancient Japan. It represents design from an older time, a wild era of experimentation where developers could try anything without worrying too much about selling millions of copies. It's an attitude that is downright alien in this day and age.</p>

<p><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> is an infectiously rewarding game. It keeps all of its plates spinning with style and grace, a testament to Capcom letting their imaginations go wild.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-foggy-street-corner.jpg?itok=qp_PIQC3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-foggy-street-corner.jpg?itok=inuJ56JJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>6. <em>Silent Hill 2</em> (2024)</h2>

<p>What else can be said about the legacy of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/best-gaming-sequel-silent-hill-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Silent Hill 2</em></a>, one of the greatest horror game stories ever told? Not much. What can be said about the prospect of it getting remade by Bloober Team, a development studio with an uneven track record? <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/silent-hill-2-remake-revives-classic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Quite a bit</a>.</p>

<p>It is a remake that doesn't just play the hits but explores different parts of the narrative left implied. This has led to more naturalistic dialogue, impressive subtle character performances, newfound depth in the supporting cast, as well as new theories about the nature of the town and James' fate within its foggy walls.</p>

<p>Is it that magical remake that perfectly captures the spirit and impact of the original release? Of course not. But it is a remake that understands why the original has endured for so long and admirably updates itself with overhauled combat and revised puzzles.</p>

<p>The <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake was one of 2024's pleasant surprises. A modern return to the iconic haunted town that has successfully entranced a new generation of players.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metaphor-refantasio-sandworm-attack.jpg?itok=9JPQpkS9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metaphor-refantasio-sandworm-attack.jpg?itok=V4q3sn9u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>5. <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></h2>

<p>Atlus' developers continued to push the envelope this year with <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>, an original property helmed by former developers from the <em>Persona</em> series.</p>

<p>In strict game terms, it is an evolution of <em>Persona's</em> strengths: engaging and difficult turn-based combat juxtaposed with quiet social bonds and real-world time management.</p>

<p>But what makes <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> so compelling is its various artistic inspirations. It seamlessly blends Renaissance art motifs, medieval high fantasy architecture, contemporary fashion designs, and monsters that have leaped off the pages of Hieronymus Bosch.</p>

<p>Impressively, despite being set in a fantasy setting, <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> tells a timely tale. A big idea narrative around the underhanded corruption of elected officials and protecting the ideals of a just world. In a modern political climate where institutional trust is at an all-time low, it is a hopeful narrative worth telling.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/neva-adult-and-alva.jpg?itok=6IzBkW0e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/neva-adult-and-alva.jpg?itok=Y9Lch-wP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>4. <em>Neva</em></h2>

<p><em>Neva</em> is a visually magnificent game with its heart on its sleeve. A <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/neva-review-poetic-platforming-perfection" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">short but impactful</a> game about parenthood and environmental awareness.</p>

<p>It is both a game and an impressionist painting brought to life. A polished platformer and a serenely beautiful allegory for the enduring spirit of life and nature. A game where you can pet an adorable white wolf pup as much as you want. An experience forever burned into my memory thanks to its striking imagery and playful gameplay. A wonderful blend of audiovisual art and interactivity that leads to some transcendent setpieces.Truly unforgettable.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mouthwashing-curly-and-cake.jpg?itok=sOpA_mbO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mouthwashing-curly-and-cake.jpg?itok=tY2-hgpb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>3. <em>Mouthwashing</em></h2>

<p><em>Mouthwashing</em> by Wrong Organ may be the most disturbing horror game I have played in a long time.</p>

<p>On the surface, it is about the doomed crew of a space cargo freighter. But this simple tale of entrapment degrades into a pitch-black tale of human misery. A tale packed with commentary on late-stage capitalism, unflinching depictions of operational incompetence, disturbing nightmare vignettes, and a descent into delirium, distrust, and despair.</p>

<p>In addition, it is deceptively grotesque. <em>Mouthwashing's</em> retro polygonal look hides horrifying setpieces with some gross body horror. This game has ruined cake for me.</p>

<p>But all of that cruelty and revulsion is not in the service of cheap shock. It earns a place on my list thanks to its fantastic script, three-dimensional characters, and its masterfully labyrinthine nonlinear narrative structure. A brand new interactive horror classic that stands head and shoulders above its peers this year. I hope this hurts.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/1000xresist-watcher-statement.jpg?itok=SzOjclVc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/1000xresist-watcher-statement.jpg?itok=vT5nZnSe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>2. <em>1000xRESIST</em></h2>

<p>Sunset Visitor has pulled off something phenomenal with <em>1000xRESIST</em>. A narrative-focused game with an explicit central message about societal injustice, civil dissent, and religious dogma. It is also a deeply personal narrative drawing from lived experiences involving immigration, cultural diaspora, trauma, and societal anxiety. On top of all of that, it tells an existential sci-fi story spanning hundreds of years, an alien invasion, and the collapse of two different civilizations.</p>

<p>It is the most gameplay-light experience on my list. Yet,<em> 1000xRESIST</em> is a wonderfully written tale with a lot to say about family, friendship, romance, and the power of endurance in the face of hardship and unjust leadership. All of which is expressed with no condescension or pretension.</p>

<p>It is because of that confident, measured, and precise storytelling that I will be thinking about this game for years to come. Heki Grace.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pacific-drive-visitors-in-road.jpg?itok=t3UHqGaB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pacific-drive-visitors-in-road.jpg?itok=EN1-XC_l 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>1. <em>Pacific Drive</em></h2>

<p><em>Pacific Drive</em> is a game I have not been able to put down. An '80s sci-fi game where you unravel the mysterious origins behind a radiation exclusion zone with the aid of a broken-down station wagon.</p>

<p>This is mostly thanks to its impeccable atmosphere and tone. Just driving from location to location, jamming out to indie rock as the mountainous Pacific Northwest degrades into surreal landscapes and alien life would have been enough to put it on this list. But Ironwood Studios also built deeply rewarding survival gameplay and genuinely challenging traversal missions into the main experience, making each drive compelling.</p>

<p>There were countless moments throughout my playthrough full of unique, emergent moments. Running out of gas during a key mission leading to me siphoning fuel from every wreck I could find. Barely escaping a radiation storm on three flat tires and all my armored plating stripped off. The list goes on.</p>

<p>All of this combined with a solid sci-fi story steeped in retro kitsch makes <em>Pacific Drive</em> one of my favorite games this year.</p>

(There will also be events across Europe and Asia with registration for <a href="https://experience.nintendo.com/?_gl=1*1j9ey0o*_gcl_au*MTEyMjUzODAzOC4xNzMzMzI4MzA0*_ga*MTI3MjM4ODg2Ny4xNzI0NzY5NjE1*_ga_8CCMZ61YS8*MTczNzEzMzI2Mi4xLjAuMTczNzEzMzI2Mi4wLjAuMA..#/events/10447?lang=en-GB">London</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fjp%2Fevent%2Fexperience%2Findex.html">Tokyo</a> already live.) But getting the chance to play for yourself isn’t as simple as showing up and waiting in line. There’s a registration process to go through first and registering doesn’t guarantee you’ll get in.</p><p>First, anyone who wishes to attend must have a Nintendo account, including children aged seven years or older. If you don’t have an account, they’re free to make and young children can be registered under a Nintendo family account. Children younger than seven don’t need to register.</p><p>For families or folks who want to attend as a group of up to six people, all members must have a Nintendo account that’s linked to <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fen-gb%2FSupport%2FNintendo-Switch%2FWhat-Is-a-Nintendo-Account-Family-Group-1468055.html%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOopLwr000OYi6T0j1PEc0T6l1a4WVfRzCpmVYR51ky10T-2YVY-v">a Nintendo Family group</a> and everyone in the group must attend the same session.</p><p>Registration opens on Friday January 17th at 12PM PT / 3PM ET and closes on January 26th. Tickets are free but awarded by lottery, similar to what Nintendo does for admission to its museum. So once you’ve registered, you have to wait. There are multiple hour-long sessions for each day of the event but you can only register for one time slot. (Really, Nintendo?) Trying to sign-up for additional time slots will require you to cancel your previous registration.</p><p>The website doesn’t indicate exactly when folks will be notified if they’ve been selected, just that it should happen shortly after the registration window closes.</p><p>As with anything Nintendo, demand will be high so if you’re vying for a chance to see the Switch 2 early, good luck. You’ll need it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The first one will be against Broly. While it’s not completely clear how the mode will work (or why it’s only sticking around for a little bit)  players are interpreting it as the fighting game equivalent of an MMO raid, similar to events in<em> Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</em>.</p><p>Otherwise, the focus is largely on incorporating all of the characters and transformations showcased in 2022's <em>Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>which gave both Gohan and Piccolo massive power-ups to take on the return of Cell. DLC2 and DLC3, while not fully revealed, teased further additions from <em>Dragon Ball Super</em> and the new<em> Dragon Ball Daima </em>anime series that recently started streaming on Crunchyroll—it features the Z-fighters transformed back into children. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The unofficial Skyrim Unreal Engine 5.5 remaster brings significant visual improvements over the original using Lumen and Nanite, but at a considerable performance cost even on a powerful GPU like the RTX 4080.</p>
<p>A new comparison video put together by MxBenchmarkPC puts the fan-made remaster and the original side by side, highlighting how much hardware Lumen and Nanite improve the game's visuals while leaving the original assets intact. The visual improvements, however, bring a significant impact on performance, often in the 100+ FPS range on an RTX 4080, which isn't all that surprising, considering how demanding Lumen can be and how the unofficial remaster is only a demo so far that has likely not been optimized.</p>
<p><iframe title="Skyrim in Unreal Engine 5.5 vs Original - The Ultimate Graphics/Performance Comparison | RTX 4080" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Uoa_gyZe0A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In case you are afraid of stressing your system out a bit to check how Skyrim has been recreated in the latest version of Unreal Engine 5, you can download the demo <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1neuhForpjGF_wAyD8Hdox3iQZA-DYvSU/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>Despite having been originally released well over ten years ago, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim continues to be an extremely popular game, also thanks to the modding community, which is still extremely active today. The latest official version of the game is the Anniversary Edition, which was launched back in 2011 to celebrate the game's 10th anniversary with new content and gameplay tweaks.</p>
<p>While an official Skyrim remake is nowhere on the horizon, we will soon be able to return to one of Tamriel's regions, Cyrodiil, thanks to a yet-to-be-announced remake of Oblivion. This remake, rumored to be in the works at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-unreal-engine-5/">Virtuos</a>, will not only improve the original game's visuals using Unreal Engine 5 but also reportedly introduce plenty of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/">gameplay tweaks and changes.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/joe-allen-top-6-games-of-2024</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/joe-allens-top-6-games-of-2024.1085367/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/joe-allen-top-6-games-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are many ways in which 2024 has been, to put it mildly, a rough year, and our industry hasn't exactly been faring well.</p>

<p>Amid mass layoffs, C-suite executives pocketing embarrassing amounts of money, and studios shutting down left, right, and center, studios must have had an exponentially harder time releasing games worth talking about.</p>

<p>Thankfully, many of them managed to do just that. However harrowing a year it's been for the industry on a business level, the games happily speak for themselves, and while I don't think 2024 raised the bar like 2023 did, that bar's high enough that it can sit right where it is without feeling too bad.</p>

<p>Without further ado, then, here are my top 6 games from 2024!</p>

<h2>6.&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/black-myth-wukong-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=1PFY-PUS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/black-myth-wukong-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=vcW2dcNr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>made more than its fair share of contributions to the Soulslike genre this year.</figcaption></figure><p>The folks behind&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>might have made a couple of unsavory remarks surrounding the game's release, but that doesn't diminish the quality of what is thankfully an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/black-myth-wukong-review-serious-monkey-business" rel="nofollow">excellent Soulslike action RPG</a>.</p>

<p><em>Wukong</em>'s array of heavily Chinese mythology-inspired enemies and bosses is dizzying, and I've often said that Soulslikes live and die on their enemy variety, a brief developer GameScience seems to have understood very well indeed.</p>

<p>Couple that with satisfyingly complex levels that pack a plethora of optional paths to explore, and you've got yourself a Soulslike that deserves to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with some of the genre's greats. The story's a touch muddled, but when the combat's this fun, I'll let that slide.</p>

<h2>5.&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona-3-reload-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=6GHwOoKH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona-3-reload-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=-U0s4dwd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>may have been lengthy, but the payoff was worth it.</figcaption></figure><p>Oh,&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>, how you broke my heart. I never quite managed to click with previous versions of&nbsp;<em>Persona 3</em>; they always felt just a touch incomplete, like each one could do with some of the features another one had.</p>

<p>For the most part,&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>feels like the holistic package I've been waiting for. It's another delightfully offbeat slice of&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>fun, complete with everything you could want from one of these games: relationship-building, great characterization, and music that won't leave your playlists for months.</p>

<p>Some of the improvements made by&nbsp;<em>Reload&nbsp;</em>easily elevate it above its forebears, too. Its improved visuals, extra story elements, and extensive quality-of-life changes make it a much more palatable and welcoming experience than the often-punishing original.</p>

<h2>4.&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astro-bot-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=Qa_l2_4P 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astro-bot-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=dGdKbO_e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>For 3D platformer thrills of yesteryear, look no further than&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>I haven't been as much of a fan of Sony's more recent AAA output than many; games like&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>lean a little too heavily on cinematic setpieces for me. What I want is a game that could only ever be a game, and&nbsp;happily, Sony provided this year with&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>.</p>

<p>I'm about to praise it, so don't worry, but I've got a bit more of a bee in my bonnet about&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>than many of my peers seem to. Its celebration of properties Sony seems happy to leave buried troubles me, and I wish it wasn't quite so self-congratulatory.</p>

<p>Even so, I'd be a churl if I pretended Team Asobi's throwback 3D platformer was not, on a moment-to-moment basis, the most fun I've had with a video game this year. It's delightfully colorful, beautifully playable, and wonderfully childlike without ever feeling childish.</p>

<p>If you can sit in front of&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>, DualSense clutched in your hands, and watch its expertly choreographed action unfold in front of your eyes without <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/astro-bot-review-90s-platformer-done-right" rel="nofollow">cracking a massive smile</a>, then I think your heart may have stopped beating.</p>

<h2>3.&nbsp;<em>Animal Well</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/animal-well-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=4aUtL7UU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/animal-well-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=-YG6mHTT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Animal Well&nbsp;</em>layered mysteries atop mysteries to great effect this year.</figcaption></figure><p>You can almost always rely on the indie circuit to go where AAA games fear to tread, and&nbsp;<em>Animal Well&nbsp;</em>certainly fulfilled that remit this year. Bigmode's inaugural title was a solo effort created by one-man outfit Shared Memory, and as opening salvos go, it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/animal-well-review-icebergs-worth-of-puzzles-deep-below-surface" rel="nofollow">hard to top this one</a>.</p>

<p>It's been a long time since I've seen a game world so absolutely stuffed to the brim with secrets. Pretty much every screen of&nbsp;<em>Animal Well&nbsp;</em>is hiding something, and you can choose on what level you want to engage with those puzzles, creating a deeply satisfying experience for players of all stripes.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is heretical to admit, but I was absolutely not bothered about the deeper, more ARG-adjacent layers of&nbsp;<em>Animal Well</em>. I was content to potter about its world, discovering its surface-level secrets and engaging with its expertly crafted platforming.</p>

<p>That's the beauty of Bigmode and Billy Basso's game, though; whether you're a dungeon-delving dilettante or a spelunker of secrets, you'll find something to love here.</p>

<h2>2.&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nine-sols-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=YyKairIw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nine-sols-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=yfzMWdu0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>married satisfying combat and exploration with a surprisingly heartstring-tugging story.</figcaption></figure><p>It may be true that&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>' Metroidvania world isn't quite as complex and multi-layered as some of its contemporaries, but that's more than made up for by one of the most affecting and well-realized stories I've seen in games for quite some time.</p>

<p>Unlike the general template for Metroidvania games,&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>' protagonist, Yi, isn't a blank slate. He comes with his own personality, his own memories, and, perhaps most importantly for&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>' narrative, his own baggage.</p>

<p>The story of how Yi slowly comes to terms with what his past contains and what it means for the world around him propels&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>into the pantheon of the greatest Metroidvania games of all time, but its combat is nothing to be sniffed at either.</p>

<p>You'll need your wits about you to master&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>' precise parry-based combat, which you'll use to take down an impressive variety of enemies and bosses.</p>

<h2>1.&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=uymB31V4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=Io98e6RI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>is a phenomenally generous, thrillingly layered expansion.</figcaption></figure><p>There was never really going to be anything else vying for my top spot in 2024.&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>is about as close to a masterpiece as a game's DLC expansion can get.</p>

<p>The Realm of Shadow is a beautifully complex and dense open-world environment to explore. Like many, I'm not really sure why director Hidetaka Miyazaki chose to claim that the DLC's explorable landmass would rival that of the base game's Limgrave when it's so much larger and more layered.</p>

<p>Some found&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>'s level of challenge too much to bear, but I welcomed it. Each of the DLC's bosses <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree" rel="nofollow">felt like a true test</a> of the skills I'd learned during my time with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, and to me, they all felt expertly designed and tuned.</p>

<p>Like the main game,&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>also comes complete with an incredible array of secrets to uncover. To share any of those secrets would be to spoil the surprise, so I'll just say that if you haven't played this one yet and you're an&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>fan, please try to set aside the time. It's worth it.</p>

            <p>Team Cherry's long-awaited metroidvania <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> will be re-revealed in April, if you believe a bunch of frantic reddit posts about cake. The standard practice when writing up such fan theorising is to walk you through it step by step, peeling back the layers like Inspector Clouseau. But I know that you are a busy person, so I will jam it all into a single sentence: <a href="https://x.com/everydruidwaswr">a Twitter account</a> purporting to be a Silksong developer has posted a tweet that seemingly predicts the Switch 2 announcement while using a profile picture of some cake taken from a recipe book that was published on 2nd April 2024 which is exactly a year before 2nd April 2025 which is the date of the Nintendo Direct teased in the Switch 2 announcement.</p> <!--more-->
<p>The conclusion being drawn on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1i393fl/can_someone_dig_deeper_into_the_username_i_did_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">the aforesaid reddits</a> is that we'll finally lay eyes on Silksong on 2nd April 2025 - because after all, if the cake tweeter was correct about the Switch 2 announcement, the implication is that Silksong is a Switch 2 game, and will form part of the console's introductory showcase. You can read a longer, more elegant version of all this on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-fans-believe-creators-switch-2-hint-points-to-april-announcement-and-its-all-thanks-to-a-slice-of-cake">Eurogamer</a>.</p>
<p>You might be struggling to recall what the hell Silksong is, other than the endlessly collapsing kernel of a storm of competing signifiers. It's the sequel to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>, remember? They announced it in 2019. Ah, such an innocent time.</p>
<p>The game stars Hornet, a character from Hollow Knight, and is about journeying upward through "coral forests, mossy grottos, gilded cities and misted moors" where Hollow Knight was about venturing ever downward. Back in 2019, Team Cherry promised new skills and tools, plus over "150 new enemies". It seems likely that much will have changed - five years in gamedev is a pretty long haul. Here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-everything-we-know">everything we know about Silksong</a> at the time of writing.</p>
<p>So, will we get some proper footage of Silksong at the big Switcheroo in April? Perhaps even a release date? I'm less convinced, not because I have insider knowledge but simply because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVInBsib04M">I have played Portal</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
