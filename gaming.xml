			<p>The 1930s was the golden age for detective fiction. This decade was the most prolific for esteemed crime novelist, Agatha Christie, who published around a third of her crime novels during this era, including many of her most iconic titles. It’s no wonder then that the 1930s is the prime setting for a detective murder mystery.</p>
<p><iframe title="Clue: Murder By Death - Gameplay Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Yeuc51KHiU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With Clue: Murder By Death, developer, Cocodrolo Games jumped onto the 30s detective steam train to great effect. Like all good 1930’s murder mysteries, Clue: Murder By Death is set in an isolated, upper-class country estate with an impregnable storm raging outside. The manor house is perfectly characterised with oak-panelled corridors, drawing rooms, libraries and the occasional secret passage to explore. Cut off from the outside world, the circle of characters is made up of the usual suspects; the murdered wealthy aristocrat, his questionably moral family members, the odd shady guest or two, and the gossiping servants.</p>


<p>In fact, Clue: Murder By Death isn’t just packed to the rafters with 30’s crime novel tropes, it also pulls in popular trends from other cultural corners of the era, such as Egyptology and the newly popularised Dracula movie. The setting for the game was clearly well researched and planned, making the gamer feel fully immersed in the storyline.</p>


<p>Visually, the game does a nice job of reflecting the popular board game it is based on. Your detective moves from place to place, one room at a time, investigating objects and chatting to suspects. The characters are designed to look like playing pieces, and while their lack of features can sometimes make it hard to tell who’s who – why are there so many indistinct servants?! – the overall look has a welcomingly cute, cartoony appeal.</p>
<p>But what of the gameplay itself? Clue: Murder By Death has a notable two-hour real-time playthrough feature. A thrilling idea on paper, but just a bit awkward in reality. Once you start the game, the timer begins to tick down. From here, the player must complete the game within two hours. Want to eat your tea? It’ll have to wait. Need to put your kid to bed? They know where their own toothbrush is. Come back after two hours is over and the game resets, eliminating all progress you’ve made. There’s no record of anything you’ve discovered or unlocked in that time – you’d better have a good memory – and you have to start all over again from the beginning. The first time this happens is pretty galling, but from then on, it’s just exhausting.</p>

<p>The great irony behind the two-hour real-time feature is the playthrough pacing that goes alongside it. As the timer starts to count down, you prepare to jump into the storyline in a race against time to find the killer, only to find that your detective moves at less than a snail’s pace. Suddenly, the room-by-room exploration becomes tedious as your character pitter-patters along a useless stretch of corridor just to move into the loading screen for another useless stretch of corridor. In fact, nearly every room you visit is preceded by a blank screen, breaking the flow and cause a feeling of disconnection.</p>
<p>As you begin to unlock each section of the map, the dawdling pace starts to grind. You finally find an object that will help to solve a clue on the other side of the manor, but the map is so huge and you’re so darn slow, there’s no way you’re getting back over to that side of the house anytime soon. Forcing you to undertake the journey, knowing full well you’ll have little time left to proceed much further, forcing you to do it all that boring walking again on your next playthrough. The developers clearly spotted this unfortunate setback and included the option to add two of the suspects to your detective team. Although this lets you spread your resources around the mansion, it doesn’t do enough to reduce the tedium of character walk-speed and room-to-room loads.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Clue: Murder By Death fully immerses the player in a thoroughly realised 1930’s era country estate murder mystery with the welcome addition of cute, cartoony visuals. Sadly, the game is somewhat let down by a frustrating two-hour real-time playthrough limit that collides with tedious character walking speeds and frequent clunky load screens.	</p></div>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-how-the-heck-will-mgs4-on-switch-handle-its-playstation-references</link>
            <guid>1435357</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="3ef78997ce374"><a title="MGS4 PS3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3ef78997ce374/mgs4-ps3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We all saw it coming, but Konami has now finally confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2</a> is heading to Switch 1 and 2, bundling <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots-master-collection-version">Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metal-gear-solid-peace-walker-master-collection-version">Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/metal_gear_solid">Metal Gear Solid: Ghost Babel</a> in one package.</p>
<p>I'm especially pleased to see MGS4 finally freed from its PS3 shackles. As the concluding chapter in the chronology (Snake's chapter, specifically – yes, I see you waving there, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/metal_gear_rising_revengeance">Raiden</a>), Guns of the Patriots is an indulgent mess of a game; one that attempts to tie up an overwhelming amount of loose threads. It's gotten a pretty bad rap as a result, largely thanks to its lengthy cutscenes and numerous scripted gameplay segments.</p>
<p>I absolutely love it, though, warts 'n all. It's pure fan service from start to finish, bringing back characters we hadn't seen since the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/metal_gear_solid">MGS</a> while chucking in a load of easter eggs right, left, and centre. Chances are most fans know how MGS4 plays out at this point, but if you've only just begun your journey with Snake on Switch with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/metal_gear_solid_master_collection_vol_1">Master Collection Vol. 1</a>, I urge you to go into the fourth entry as unspoiled as possible.</p>
<p>Which brings me nicely onto today's topic of conversation, so if you're worried about spoilers, now's the time to leave!...</p>
<figure data-uuid="baa27832cbbd0"><a title="MGS4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/baa27832cbbd0/mgs4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Konami</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>When MGS4 launched on the PS3 back in 2008, it really went out of its way to stress that it was a console exclusive – sorry, Xbox 360 owners! As such, it contains a few distinct references to PlayStation that I'm fairly confident won't be present in the upcoming release on Nintendo's consoles.</p>
<p>The most obvious reference occurs when (SPOILER!) Snake returns to Shadow Moses Island to stop Liquid Ocelot from stealing Metal Gear Rex's Rail Gun. As you head through the familiar environments, you eventually come to the point where, in the original PS1 MGS, the game would prompt you to swap discs. Otacon even calls Snake to inform him of this, only for the conversation to specifically reference the PS3, noting that the Blu-Ray technology utilised means that swapping discs is no longer required.</p>
<p>It's a fun little conversation that, for old-school PS1 owners, brings back some fond memories – something MGS4 strives to do at almost every turn.</p>
<p>So what the heck happens with this conversation on Switch? Is it just deleted entirely? My gut says that this is probably the case, but for the sake of authenticity, I really hope it remains in some capacity.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, Konami would get Christopher Randolph back in to record new Switch-specific lines. Honestly, I'd crease myself laughing if he said, "Oh wait! We're on a Game-Key Card now! All the data is downloaded!"</p>
<p>Come on, you know it's funny.</p>

<p>That's not the only thing. If you look around closely enough while in the game's Nomad sections, you can spot <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fmgs4-what-game-is-sunny-playing-on-the-psp-v0-xo7386wd37ge1.jpeg%3Fauto%3Dwebp%26s%3Dcb031a5c8e46f1d4cba6615ab6ff1dd368d99bcb">Sunny playing on the PSP</a>. There's also a reference to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/zone_of_the_enders_the_2nd_runner_mars">Zone of the Enders: 2nd Runner</a>, a title produced by MGS creator Hideo Kojima and, at the time of writing, one that has yet to grace Nintendo platforms. Finally, a <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/saturn/policenauts">Policenauts</a> poster is displayed in the environment at a couple of points in the game. With both titles, however, neither is locked to PlayStation, so I suspect both with remain.</p>
<p>Vol. 1 retained a lot of the quirks from the original releases, albeit with minor alterations. For example, MGS1 still prompts you to change the disc, even though this is merely done through a menu option. Similarly, PlayStation button prompts instructed via the Codec are still very much intact, though the game mutes any accompanying dialogue from the voice actors in this case.</p>
<p>It's a fascinating conundrum, and I'm curious to see how Konami handles it all. Funnily enough, there's also a real, branded iPod in the original release for MSG4, and you can use it to play all sorts of music while working your way through the game. Will this be replaced, too?</p>

<p>Nintendo itself probably won't be too keen on having explicit references to a rival company mentioned in the collection. The recent release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/console-archives-cool-boarders">Console Archives Cool Boarders</a>, for instance, very carefully notes that the game originally launched on "a 32-bit home console" in the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Console-Archives-Cool-Boarders-3016638.html?srsltid=AfmBOoqy-t7jNWwG5fC5pX7R93H9vhatwn9GJia0hv4yXdh3KoGMbpSz">official blurb</a>. Nintendo putting its foot down, or Hamster not wanting to take any risks?</p>
<p>There's also the curious case of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/hyperdimension-neptunia-and-death-end-switch-releases-scrapped-for-not-complying-with-nintendo-guidelines">Hyperdimension Neptunia being barred for the Switch in the West</a>. I'm merely speculating here, but the series' focus on parodying the real-life 'console wars' may have rubbed Nintendo the wrong way.</p>
<p>Granted, there are plenty of direct nods to all sorts of consoles in the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/worms_armageddon_anniversary_edition">Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/atari_50_the_anniversary_celebration">Atari 50</a>, but I'd argue that showcasing these in a museum-like context is a little different, and so they can probably get away with it.</p>
<p>Many questions linger, then, but I'm excited to finally play MGS4 on a not-PS3. It's been a long time coming, man.</p>

<p>Solve the case today</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're someone who loves a little bit of Agatha Christie, or maybe you're partial to the <strong>Knives Out</strong> movies, then Cocodrolo Games and Dolores Entertainment may have something just for you with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/clue_murder_by_death">Clue: Murder By Death</a>, and it's out on the Switch eShop... today! (No mysteries there.)</p>
<p>As you can probably tell by the title, the game is heavily inspired by British murder-mystery stories, particularly from around the 1930s, but it's the cute, almost board game-like presentation that has us intrigued. Each character looks like something you'd move around on a <strong>Monopoly</strong> board or, we don't know, a cuter version or <strong>Cluedo</strong>.</p>
<p>And, as you'd expect, murder is at the centre of the story. Lord Robert Anderson is dead, and you have twp hours to find his killer and solve the murder. But you won't just be playing as a detective, as you'll be swapping between the multiple different suspects.</p>
<p>Each character has their own perspective on basically everything — the way one person sees a vase is different to another, for example — adding layers to the overall mystery.</p>
<p>There's also a little bit of a bigger mystery to solve involving the mansion the murder takes place in — in every replay, you'll come to understand more of the complex home. There's 166 rooms to explore, and there's no way you can do that in a single two-hour session, right?</p>

<p>Out now on Switch (and other platforms), you can grab Clue: Murder by Death on the eShop for <strong>£18.00 / $19.90</strong> (or your regional equivalent. Plus, if you're in the UK, there's a 20% launch discount until 5th March.</p>

            <guid>1435348</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Best RPG winners <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> and <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> are together at last. Sega revealed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/66136/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33_x_Metaphor_ReFantazio/">a new Steam bundle</a> that gives you an extra 10 percent off both games if you buy them together. That’s over 175 collective hours of drama-filled, turn-based dungeon grinding if you go the completionist route. <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> director Katsura Hashino used the occasion to celebrate <em>Clair Obscur</em>‘s breakout success last year.</p> <p dir="ltr">“<em><span>Expedition</span>&nbsp;<span>33</span></em> is a work that conveys a deep understanding of and sincere dedication to the JRPG genre, crafted with great care down to the finest details. As someone who also creates RPGs, I found it to be truly inspiring,” Hashino, who’s been designing RPGs at Atlus since the 1990s, said in a press release. At a time when many franchises in the genre have moved toward more action-based combat, <em>Clair Obscur</em> showed turn-based mechanics could still keep evolving and appeal to a more general audience.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">“I am genuinely delighted to see Japanese-style RPGs being born and embraced, not only from Japanese-based studios like ours, but other places around the world through diverse creative approaches,” the <a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-5-phantom-x-english-release-date-announcement-1851780429"><em>Persona 5</em> director continued</a>. “While the two titles differ in their worlds and overall direction, players may find a shared spirit in how we each approach and express the RPG genre. I hope that this bundle encourages players to experience both titles and enjoy the breadth of what RPGs can offer.”</p> <p>Sandfall Interactive CEO And creative director Guillaume Broche had equally kind words for Metaphor: ReFantazio, a grittier fantasy RPG than Atlus’ usual games with shades of <em>Game of Thrones</em>. “The game has one of the most charismatic villains I’ve ever seen in an RPG,” Guillaume noted. He added that he’s been a big fan of Atlus’ work dating back to 2003’s <em>Shin Megami Tensei: Lucifer’s Call</em>, or as it was known in the West, <em>Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne</em>. That happened to be the first game in the series directed by Hashino himself.</p>

 <p>Last year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-director-says-jrpg-3-0-is-coming-to-re-shape-the-genre-at-a-fundamental-level-2000647233">Hashino predicted a new renaissance</a> in the genre would lead to the birth of “JRPG 3.0.” While he didn’t say exactly what that would entail, he suggested it would include an innovative rethinking of the core concepts fans have come to expect from those types of games. “There will be a greater dimension to these games and they’ll change the genre’s structure and presentation at a fundamental level,” he said. For now there are more than enough JRPG 2.0 releases to keep people busy.</p>

<p>If you live for wild shooters infused with skateboarding mechanics, then you need to be playing High on Life 2. The new sequel from Squanch Games is just as loud (if not louder) than the first game and also brings with it another big Trophy List.</p>



<p>Maybe there aren’t enough games about talking guns, and that’s what the whole galaxy should consist of? Then again, maybe not, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/high-on-life-2/" id="170939" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High on Life 2</a> has a certain, can’t-look-away, need-to-hear-everything charm that few other titles deliver. We were quite complimentary in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/reviews/high-on-life-2-review-a-faster-funnier-sequel/" id="176022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High on Life 2 review</a>, and if you do pick it up, you need to know the High on Life 2 Trophy List.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-high-on-life-2-trophies-amp-achievements">All High on Life 2 Trophies &amp; Achievements</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Squanch Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>As expected, the High on Life 2 list engages in tomfoolery with the names of the trophies and achievements. They play heavily into the game’s skateboard influence, and there’s even a nice touch on the classic 1991 ‘All your base are belong to us’ meme!</p>

<p>When you’re looking for a new game to play, how long it takes to beat is a valid aspect to consider. Starting a game can be a commitment, especially if you’re purchasing it, and it’s nice to know what you’re getting yourself into.</p>







<p>At the end of the day, everyone is different. Some of you might be looking for an expansive, hundred-hour RPG, whereas others might prefer a shorter, more condensed experience. If you’re wondering which category <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/high-on-life-2/" id="170939" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High On Life 2</a> falls into, then you’re in the right place.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-to-beat-high-on-life-2">How Many Hours To Beat High On Life 2?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>There’s a lot to do. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>If you play High On Life 2 casually, focusing on the main campaign whilst exploring some of the open areas, you should expect to complete the game in around 10 hours. </strong></p>



<p>High On Life 2 is a fairly structured game. There are open maps to explore and collectables to find, but there’s a linear narrative that you’ll be following. As you hunt down more of the Big Pharma targets, you’ll head to new areas, but you don’t need to spend any time there that you don’t want to.</p>



<p>Instead, you’re more than welcome to focus simply on the main missions, and if you do that, you can easily complete the game in under 10 hours. It’s great if you’re just there for the plot, but there’s more of the game to enjoy if you’re willing to put the time into it.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-a-high-on-life-2-completionist-run">How Long Is A High On Life 2 Completionist Run? </h2>



<p><strong>If you’re aiming to 100% High On Life 2, you’re looking at around 25-30 hours, assuming you embark on every side activity—and hunt down every Luglox.</strong></p>



<p>There’s a nice variety of activities to complete in High On Life 2, such as hunting down Skate letters or clearing Wanted Posters, but the real time sink will be finding every Luglox. </p>







<p>There are 199 to find across the three different maps, and they even include the tiny green ones that store some Pesos. Thankfully, they show up on your mini map when you’re near them, but more often than not, you’ll still need to search around.</p>



<p>Don’t worry if you missed any during missions, though, as thankfully, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/squanch-games/" id="2701" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Squanch Games</a> has added Luglox Exterminators. You can purchase a Luglox for 300 Pesos each, and it’s a great addition to ensure you won’t miss any and have to restart.</p>

If you participate in the server slam test and then grab the game, you'll also get a special emblem and player banner in the full release.</p>



<p>Bungie is also adding a few weapon charms inspired by other <strong>PlayStation</strong> <strong>Studios</strong> published and developed titles, which will be available to <strong>PS Plus</strong> players. The three charms are inspired by <strong>Helldivers 2, Ghost of Yotei,</strong> and <strong>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</strong>.</p>

<p>Marathon will arrive on PC and PS5 on March 5, 2026. With one of the best-selling games in the industry right now <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-radiers-14m-copies-sold-record-high-revenue-nexon/">being an extraction shooter</a>, it'll be interesting to see if Bungie can capitalize on a renewed interest in the genre. If it can't, then with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-art-director-joseph-cross-leaves-bungie-months-ahead-of-launch/">slew of issues the studio has had</a> in the last few years, its future will be seriously put into question.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Today, the qualification stage for the Call of Duty League’s Major II tournament starts. It’s the bedding-in phase for one of the most highly anticipated Majors in recent years, and for good reason. It’s also something of an opportunity for OpTic Texas’ Shotzzy to redeem himself, <strong>many years</strong> later.</p>



<p>The Major II LAN is taking place in the United Kingdom, and it’s the first time that the Call of Duty League has come to the region since <strong>2020</strong>. When Shotzzy last played on British soil, he gave a memorable interview that still sits with him today, but not for good reason.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-cod-league-finally-comes-back-to-england">The COD League Finally Comes Back to England</h2>



<p>The United Kingdom has been crying out for a Call of Duty esports event for the longest time, and while they’ve had Warzone, they’ve always longed for a CDL event. In March, that’s finally happening, as DreamHack Birmingham plays host to the CDL Major II tournament.</p>



<p>It’s a monumental thing, and the hungriest fans in the nation will be sure to blow the roof off the place, given that it’s almost <strong>six years </strong>since the CDL last came to the British Isles.</p>



<p>In 2020, during the inaugural Call of Duty League season, Shotzzy, who at the time represented Dallas Empire, had an awful interview in London. It was dubbed ‘the most awkward esports interview ever’, and for good reason.</p>



<p>When I caught up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shotzzy-haunted-interview-london-cod-league-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with Shotzzy in Madrid in 2025</a>, he told me that he had to ‘get his get back on that interview’. At the time, the Call of Duty League still had no plans to revisit the UK, but in recent months, things shifted, and the CDL is finally coming back to England.</p>



<p>Shotzzy went on to win the Call of Duty League Championship in 2020, securing himself as one of the GOATs of esports with a world championship title in two games in his pocket. He has since gone on to win another two rings in the Call of Duty space, becoming one of a few to win <strong>two years </strong>back-to-back, and he now flies the OpTic Texas banner.</p>



<p>Will Shotzzy have the opportunity to redeem himself on stage in front of a crowd of British Call of Duty esports fans? Let’s hope so.</p>

<p>Animated projects based on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/sega/" id="52202">Sega </a>classics such as Streets of Rage, Shinobi, and OutRun are in development.</p>



<p>This news comes from Sega Sammy Holdings Inc., Sega’s parent company. The company just released<a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20260213_q3_presentation_e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> its third-quarter earnings</a> for the fiscal year 2026. Not only did they cover gaming news and releases, but they also discussed their animated projects in the works.</p>



<p>For the upcoming plans and their animated section, several classic Sega games were listed as having upcoming animated releases. Streets of Rage, Shinobi, Eternal Champions, and OutRun are all listed with TBD titles in the animated section. It is not specified which of these releases will be adapted into a TV series and which will be made into films.</p>



<p>In 2024, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/golden-axe-animated-series-mike-mcmahan-comedy-central-matthew-rhys-danny-pudi-1235973820/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety </a>announced an animated series based on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/golden-axe/" id="1425">Golden Axe</a> was slated for Comedy Central.

<h2 id="h-golden-axe-and-streets-of-rage-also-have-games-in-the-works">Golden Axe and Streets of Rage Also Have Games in the Works</h2>



<p>In addition to news about forthcoming animated projects, Sega lists Golden Axe and Streets of Rage as properties with upcoming video game releases. There’s no word on when these games will launch. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/streets-of-rage-4/" id="469">Streets of Rage 4 </a>was released in 2020, developed by DotEmu. There hasn’t been a release in the Golden Axe franchise since Beast Rider in 2008.</p>



<p>Shinobi’s latest game release was in 2025, titled “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/shinobi-art-of-vengeance/" id="2877">Shinobi: Art of Vengeance</a>.” The game was well-received and released across all platforms.</p>

            <guid>1435279</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>T1 Esports has signed a new partnership with an unlikely party, the <strong>South Korean Navy</strong>. In a story that dropped earlier today, it was confirmed that a Memorandum of Understanding has been penned between the two organizations, with T1 specifically joining forces with the Navy’s ‘Power Analysis and Evaluation Team’.</p>



<p>The heart of this partnership is centered around bolstering the Navy’s cognitive and analysis capabilities, and to do this, it’s going to lean on technology featured in the esports space, in which T1 is a key and critical player.</p>







<h2 id="h-t1-esports-x-south-korean-navy-is-an-interesting-concept">T1 Esports x South Korean Navy is an Interesting Concept</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mbn.co.kr/news/sports/5175686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MBN</a>, a South Korean outlet, was the first to report on the MOU signed between T1 Esports and the South Korean Navy, which represents one of the strangest partnerships in recent years in the esports industry.</p>



<p>It was written (translated by Google):</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Through this agreement, the two organizations plan to strengthen exchanges and cooperation in various areas, including: activating the gaming function of the Navy’s M&amp;S model; researching ways to utilize the creative tactics of esports teams to advance naval tactics; jointly researching tactical analysis and development based on game data; and co-hosting academic conferences and seminars.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a statement, T1’s Chief Operating Officer, Ahn Woong-ki, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Through this agreement, we hope to see the soft power of esports merge with the hard power of the Navy to develop into a national smart power.</p>



<p>T1 will continue to expand its cooperation with the Navy and actively support its efforts to strengthen its digital and cyber capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And speaking from the Navy’s perspective, Kim Hyung-jun, Head of the Power Analysis Test and Evaluation Division, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We expect that through this business agreement with T1, cooperation between the two organizations in the fields of M&amp;S and data analysis will be further strengthened.</p>



<p>This will serve as an opportunity to further solidify the foundation for development of the Navy’s future power.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>T1 is one of the most recognizable brands in the modern esports space. The organization’s League of Legends roster is one of the winningest in history, and last year secured its <strong>sixth </strong>world championship in little more than a decade.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/all-the-biggest-game-franchises-are-going-backwards-2000668403</link>
            <guid>1435249</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>One of the biggest announcements made <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-state-of-play-sony-ps5-god-war-castlevania-kena-castlevania-2000668291">during Sony’s first PlayStation State of Play of the year</a> wasn’t for a brand new game or a new entry in a popular franchise. It was instead a small teaser for a remake of the original <em>God of War</em> trilogy. This is just the latest example of a big series going backwards, and more proof that big publishers are getting more and more risk-averse, even with some of the most popular franchises around.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/original-god-of-war-trilogy-getting-a-full-remake-2000668356"><em>God of War Trilogy Remake</em></a>, which is hopefully not the final name for the actual project, was announced on Thursday during the latest State of Play. TC Carson is back as the voice of Kratos, returning to the role he originated back during the original trilogy. That’s cool. And perhaps if this were the only big franchise returning to its past instead of moving forward, I’d be more jazzed about this announcement. The reality, however, is that this is becoming a depressing trend in the game industry.</p>

 <p>Last year, Xbox announced that Halo Studios (formerly 343 Industries) is <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911">remaking the original </a><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911">Halo: Combat Evolved</a>,</em> and it will launch in 2026 on Xbox Series X/S, PC, and PS5. Microsoft has promised more <em>Halo </em>games in the future, but it is very telling that after a few misfires, Xbox is running back to the safety of the first game for its next big project.</p> <p>Fans have been wanting a new <em>Splinter Cell</em> game for a very long time. But instead, Ubisoft is working on a remake of the original game. When will this remake launch? Unclear. And considering how many games Ubisoft has recently canceled, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-black-flag-remake-delay-2000661866">including a remake of the first<em> Prince of Persia</em> game released on PS2</a>, I’m not confident that the <a href="https://kotaku.com/original-splinter-cell-being-remade-by-far-cry-6-devs-1848221698"><em>Splinter Cell</em> remake</a> will even happen.</p>

 <p><em>Max Payne</em> is a series that hasn’t received a new game since Rockstar’s<em> Max Payne 3 </em>back in 2012. So it’s disappointing that the next <em>Max Payne</em> project officially in development isn’t <em>Max Payne 4</em> or an interesting spin-off, but instead a remake of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/remedy-remaking-max-payne-1-and-2-inside-control-engine-1848759888">first two games being developed by series creators Remedy Entertainment.</a></p>

 <p><em>Tomb Raider</em> is also getting a full remake of its first game later this year in the form of <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-tomb-raider-game-details-leak-and-it-looks-like-a-reboot-2000652612">Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</a>.</em> This one is especially annoying because there already exists a remake of the first game, <em>Anniversary</em>, which was released in 2007. Not to mention the OG game was remastered not long ago. At least in this case, we do know that there’s a totally new <em>Tomb Raider</em> game in the works as well, <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-our-first-look-at-tomb-raiders-new-lara-croft-2000652781?"><i>Tomb Raider Catalyst</i>, which is launching in 2027</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-e-day-trailer-marcus-dom-xbox-sgf-showcase-1851528894">I’d also toss the upcoming <em>Gears of War</em> game, <em>E-Day</em>,</a> on this pile. Sure, it isn’t a remake, but it is a prequel starring the original characters from the first game, Marcus and Dom, and it looks to be entirely focused on recapturing the nostalgic feelings of gamers who played the OG game 20 years ago on Xbox 360. Meanwhile, will we get a continuation of the characters and storyline established in <em>Gears of War 4</em> and <em>Gears 5</em>? <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-gears-of-war-e-day-gears-6-ending-storyline-2025-1851528933">Maybe. But it will likely be years from now, if ever</a>.</p>

 <p>And now we can add <em>God of War</em> to this growing pile of old franchises going backwards instead of doing something new or unique with their established characters and lore. Video games are taking longer and longer to make and cost more money than ever. One flop can sink a studio or destroy a publisher. And even Xbox, Sony, Rockstar, and Amazon are so risk-averse these days that some of these big franchises are being forced to cash in on nostalgia instead of moving forward and telling new stories. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/oblivion-remastered-is-already-the-third-best-selling-game-of-2025-in-the-us-industry-analyst-says/">Considering how successful last year’s <em>Oblivion</em> remaster/remake was</a>, I’m not surprised publishers are continuing on in this direction. Welcome to the future, folks. It looks very familiar, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>REANIMAL constantly has you on the edge of your seat, and while you fight for survival and ways to escape, there’s a wealth of collectables to hunt down, including all the Masks to earn the Beneath The Mask Achievement.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/tarsier-studios/" id="1858">Tarsier Studios</a>‘ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/reanimal/" id="170941">REANIMAL</a> is split into nine chapters, and Masks can be found in almost every chapter. Additionally, they’re easy to miss, as there is no way to return to a specific section. Instead, the game must be started from scratch if you fail to find everything the first time around.</p>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for the Beneath the Mask achievement in REANIMAL, Insider Gaming has the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-reanimal-mask-locations-listed">All REANIMAL Mask Locations, Listed</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to collect. Image via Tarsier Studios</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-chapter-1-mask-locations">Chapter 1 Mask Locations</h3>



<p><strong>Bird Head</strong></p>



<p>The first Mask to collect in REANIMAL is found in the Mill section of Chapter 1, after you have passed through the giant fan. The mask is available soon after your first encounter with The Sniffer.</p>



<p>When the Sniffer appears, run past the big door he closes and turn left, then interact with the wall to hoist your companion up to the platform. Continue to climb the platform, using the companion’s help, until you reach the top of the ladder.</p>



<p>Head left until you reach a door and follow the platform to a crack in the wall. Then collect the Bird Head inside.</p>



<p><strong>Worm Head</strong></p>



<p>The Worm Head mask is again found in the Mill, once you have stopped the boiler from spinning. Once that has been completed, go through the door to continue your progression.</p>



<p>Inside the room, open the locker on the right side to unlock a secret room, and head inside. The Worm Head is waiting inside.</p>



<p><strong>Conch Head</strong></p>



<p>The Conch Head is the final mask in Chapter 1, and is found near the train tracks. When standing alongside the draisine, head to the right-hand side, and enter the second door (the first one is a restroom).</p>



<p>Follow the platform up the stairs to reach a room with the Conch Head inside.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-2-mask-locations">Chapter 2 Mask Locations</h3>



<p><strong>Pig Head</strong></p>



<p>The Pig Head is the first mask in Chapter 1, available at the start of the village section.</p>



<p>Inside the Clothing Store, go to the left behind the counter. Here, crouch, and enter the hole in the wall found on the left-side. This leads to another secret room, where the Pig Head is found.</p>



<p><strong>Cone Head</strong></p>



<p>After surviving your close experience with the Sniffer, exit the cinema and go to the broken building on the right side of the main square. Keep an eye out for a citter that exits the broken building. It will enter a secret room on the right-hand side.</p>



<p>Using the crowbar, pull the planks off the door and enter. Hit the critter with the crowbar to kill it and collect the Cone Head.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-3-mask-locations">Chapter 3 Mask Locations</h3>



<p><strong>Deer Head</strong></p>



<p>The Deer Head is found soon after you kill the seagulls that are attacking you, using the crowbar. Once that’s done, climb to the top of both ladders to reach the flower field.</p>



<p>Go to the far left side of the flower field to find a scarecrow and hit it with the crowbar. Then, kill the critter that appears to collect the Deer Head from its dead body.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-4-mask-locations">Chapter 4 Mask Locations</h3>



<p><strong>Bucket Head</strong></p>



<p>In Chapter 4, the Bucket Head is found in the Orphanage section, and can be from the area with the petrified spider kids. While here, destroy them all to earn the Scared to Dust achievement. </p>



<p>In this room, head to the right-hand side of the room, crouch, and go through the bookshelf to reach a secret area. A critter will then run out of the room, into the area you were just in.</p>



<p>Exit the secret room back into the main room of the clock tower and kill the critter using the crowbar. Then, collect the Bucket Head from its body.</p>



<p><strong>Crown Head</strong></p>



<p>The Crown Head is found shortly after the Bucket Head, after the spider kids begin to attack you in the next area aftern the main room of the clock tower.</p>



<p>Inside the food hall, go into the middle of the room and kill all the spider kids that appear. When the spider kids climb down from the throne from the right side of the room, go behind the throne. One of the kids who appears is the spider king, identifiable by the crown on his head.</p>



<p>Using the crowbar, kill the spider king quickly, as he will leave the room if you don’t kill him quickly. Once he’s defeated, collect the Crown Head from the body.</p>



<p><strong>Plant Head</strong></p>



<p>The Plant Head is the final mask in Chapter 4 and is found just after you reach the point with the child wearing the bucket. Kill all of the spiders before advancing.</p>



<p>Once the spider kids are defeated, shimmy through the crack in the broken bed. Then, head through the door on the other side. Once through the door, walk back towards the camera and shimmy through a crack in the wall.</p>



<p>Pull out the Plant Head from the ground, then pick up the Plant Head.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-5-mask-locations">Chapter 5 Mask Locations</h3>



<p>There are no masks to find in Chapter 5 of REANIMAL.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-6-mask-locations">Chapter 6 Mask Locations</h3>



<p><strong>Fish Head</strong></p>



<p>Once you input the code on Cannon Island, the Fish Head is ready to claim. First, though, there’s a small cutscene to watch.</p>



<p>When it’s finished, go left and shimmy through the door of the bunker, and down the ladder to the bottom. From here, jump down to the beach below.</p>



<p>Head to the left-hand side of the beach to find a critter and kill it. Then, collect the Fish Head from the body.</p>



<p><strong>Package Head</strong></p>



<p>To get the Package Head, return to the boat after firing the cannon on Cannon Island, and enter the path that was previously protected by the Brook Horse until you reach a big opening.</p>



<p>Continue down the path, blowing up any mines by throwing the harpoon, and when you get to the end of the path, turn left and follow the cliffs until you reach the mines, which you need to blow up again using the harpoon.</p>



<p>Follow the path to reach a beach, drive the boat onto the beach, and collect the Package Head from the middle of the area.</p>



<p><strong>Diving Helmets</strong></p>



<p>There are two Diving Helmets to collect, both at the same point, which are found soon after the cutscene following the chase by Brook Horse.</p>



<p>Once the cutscene ends, wait for the characters to put down their costumes, and then pick up each of the Diving Helmets.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-7-mask-locations">Chapter 7 Mask Locations</h3>



<p><strong>Bush Head</strong></p>



<p>The Bush Head mask is obtainable right at the start of Chapter 7. After the cutscene ends, go forward into the next area, and head to the right-hand side to find a small metallic door.</p>



<p>Crouch to go under the door into the secret area, and pick up the Bush Head.</p>



<p><strong>Mine Head</strong></p>



<p>The Mine Head is obtained immediately after the Bush Head. Once you pick up the Bush Head, go down the ramp on the left and proceed forward past the two dead soldiers, then turn right and go past the shotrgun soldier.</p>



<p>At the beginning of the trench, turn right and shimmy through the broken wall, and collect the Mine Head in the area.</p>



<p><strong>Rabbit Head</strong></p>



<p>Once the Mine Head is collected, go further into the trench until you reach a soldier blocking the way. Approach the soldier to trigger an animation, run a safe distance away from the soldier, and then go past the exploding soldier to the opening.</p>



<p>Now, head left and shimmy through the broken wall to collect the Rabbit Head.</p>



<p><strong>Amphibian Head</strong></p>



<p>The Amphibian Head is the penultimate mask to collect in REANIMAL and can be collected once you reach the surgery room in the hospital in Chapter 8.</p>



<p>Find the desk on the right-hand side of the room, crouch, and go under the desk into the next room, then pick up the Amphibian Head.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-8-mask-locations">Chapter 8 Mask Locations</h3>



<p><strong>Gas Head</strong></p>



<p>The Gas Head is the final mask to find in REANIMAL, and is available to obtain once you have shot the hanging soldier, who drops a key.</p>



<p>Use this key to unlock the door on the right-hand side of the area and go through it, then look for the oven and interact with it to open the door with a crowbar. No, head back into the shooting range, and shoot the critter with a gun or rifle, and pick up the Gas Head.</p>



<h3 id="h-chapter-9-mask-locations">Chapter 9 Mask Locations</h3>



<p>There are no masks or any other collectables to find in Chapter 9.</p>

Endure nightmarish overworlds, slash through horrific dungeons, face brutal bosses, and wield an arsenal of powers in a relentless struggle against the Night itself.</p><p>It is the 9th Age of humanity. The cycle of day is ruled by humans, the night one by horrid creatures. Despite its efforts, humanity is annihilated with every arrival of the Night.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>A group of humans, calling themselves “The Stalkers,” discovered how to use the power of darkness to their advantage and fought the Night. However, it was not enough, and with every new dawn humanity rose again knowing that, with darkness, comes extinction.</p><p>Humanity found the “Seal of Night,” an artifact that allowed them to stop the cycle in an everlasting day. In exchange for a blood oath that The Stalkers were willing to pay, the sun ruled for hundreds of generations and, for the first time, hope was a beacon of light. Yet fate proved unstoppable, and they paid the ultimate price.</p><p>Now, as the Night starts devouring every single glint of light, Vesper, a Stalker by right and daughter of the traitor, will travel a dying land trying to save the last embers of humanity. She hunts in a race against destiny, as the shadows lengthen both in the world and in her mind.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Engage in Fast-Paced Dynamic Combat</strong> – Dash through enemies while you unleash your combos, use your weapons or destroy them with your dark powers.

Customize the upgrades of your arsenal and use the equipment that best suits your gameplay: Critical Damage, Life Steal, Poison, Close Combat, Firepower and more. Collect Sanguine vials, Crow Feathers, Moonstones and Noctilium to increase your stats and get ready to face the Night.</li><li><strong>Discover the Dark World of Medhram</strong> – Explore Medhram in a combination of <a title="Genres > Action [3,395 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>–<a title="Genres > Adventure [2,881 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> and dark fantasy lore.

<p>Nioh 3 has proved popular since its debut. On its first weekend in the wild, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nioh-3-reaches-almost-90000-concurrent-players-on-pc-after-launch-over-doubling-series-record">game welcomed just shy of 90,000 concurrent players on Steam</a>. As our Connor reported at the time, this was <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1325200/charts/">over double what Nioh 2 achieved on the same platform</a>, and <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/485510/charts/">eight times what the original Nioh managed</a>.</p><p>"It feels as though the series, after three iterations, has finally refined its formula to the point of excellence: like the shogun it so reveres, it has taken the roots of what has come before, paid homage to its legacy, and deigned to build something even more powerful - something even more enduring - on those foundations," our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nioh-3-review">Dom wrote in Eurogamer's Nioh 3 review</a>.</p>
<p>"Enjoy the brutality, revel in the power fantasy, and let yourself be hammered into the ground by the blunt-force trauma of a world dedicated to seeing everything in terms of absolutes."</p>

			<p><strong>Castlevania: Belmont's Curse</strong>, a brand new 2D game in <strong>KONAMI</strong>'s revered series, was announced yesterday <a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during the State of Play</a>. This year, the franchise celebrates its <strong>40th anniversary</strong>, and fans are thrilled not only because of the new game (the first since <strong>2014's Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2</strong>) but also because KONAMI <strong>has confirmed it's just the first in a series of new projects</strong>.</p>



<p>Castlevania: Belmont's Curse is set more than two decades after the events of <strong>Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse</strong> and the recent animated series on Netflix. It takes place in the streets of <strong>15th-century Paris</strong>, where a new chapter of the legendary House Belmont is about to be written in bloody red ink. Armed with the legendary holy whip "Vampire Killer", the protagonist, Trevor Belmont's successor, must descend into the French capital city <strong>under attack by monstrous creatures</strong>, making his way to a looming mystical castle to hunt down the beasts and save the Parisians from eternal darkness.</p>



<p>Long-time fans and newcomers to the franchise <strong>will have to master different weapons and spells</strong> if they hope to defeat these foes. Moreover, the developers (<strong>Evil Empire</strong> and <strong>Motion Twin</strong>) suggested that <strong>thoroughly exploring the castle will benefit daring players</strong>. New areas are rich with secrets and puzzles to uncover, as well as deadly traps that demand constant vigilance.</p>



<p>The iconic whip, a <strong>trademark of the Castlevania franchise</strong>, returns with renewed purpose and will now serve as a vital traversal tool, <strong>allowing players to swing across diverse areas to uncover hidden rooms</strong> and reach previously inaccessible areas. Mastery of the whip’s mechanics also unlocks alternative combat possibilities, enabling players to strike enemies from unconventional positions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When the <em>Mewgenics </em>team announced in 2024 that it had added autism to the list of disorders the game’s cats could inherit, developer Edmund McMillen — best known as the co-creator of <em>Super Meat Boy</em> — was unprepared for the reaction.</p><p>“It was like the most positive response I’ve ever had to anything I posted,” he says. On <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/evilautism/comments/1j3y70r/holy_shit_autism_creature_representation_in/">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@edmundmcmillen/video/7403411133987573034">TikTok</a>, fans expressed gratitude and excitement for the inclusion. “Everybody was like, ‘This is the perfect representation for autism. I feel seen,’ etc., etc.,” McMillen says. “That felt like somebody opened the door and said, ‘Go on. Go ahead, do your thing.’”</p><p><em>Mewgenics</em>, which launched for PC on February 10th, is the year’s first surprise indie hit. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/20/3530584/mew-genics-team-meat-announcement">Announced in 2013</a>, it was originally a Team Meat title from McMillen and Tommy Refenes; McMillen saved the project after it was put on hiatus. A darkly funny and deceptively complex combo of adorable characters, roguelike gameplay, and tactical roleplaying, <em>Mewgenics</em> is, as the pun in its name suggests, a game about breeding and bloodlines. It’s currently Steam’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fcharts%2F" rel="sponsored">top-selling game</a> this week. Co-creator Tyler Glaiel <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mewgenics-sells-over-150k-copies-in-first-6-hours-this-is-beating-expectations-by-quite-a-lot">told <em>IGN</em></a> it took less than three hours to recoup development costs, while McMillen tells <em>The Verge</em> the game is already expected to top 500,000 units sold. “It’s blown past anything I’ve ever done by a mile,” he says.</p><p>The game’s arrival in 2026, when <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/rfk-jr-vaccines-eugenics">misinformation about disorders</a> like autism is rampant and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/sundance-doc-ghost-in-the-machine-draws-a-damning-line-between-ai-and-eugenics-180613367.html">pro-eugenics</a> <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2026/02/epstein-emails-eugenics-chomsky-altruism-billionaires/">attitudes</a> abound, is eerily topical, albeit accidental. McMillen, to be clear, has not created an intentional commentary on the state of the world. “I hate politics,” he says. “It’s a game about cats fucking, you know what I mean?”</p><p>There is a deluge of mutations and disorders cats can inherit in the game — from bad gas or kidney stones to ADHD and depression — that impact their stats. ADHD gives players only seconds to make decisions or the cat will start acting on its own. Autism includes accelerated intelligence but lower charisma; the cat will be naturally very good at the abilities they’re born with, but other skills might be a little more difficult. “I’m very well versed in this,” McMillen says. “I have two children that are on the spectrum, and I have a wife who is as well. … It has been a big part of my life for the past 10 years.”</p><div><p>“I want people to play and read between the lines.”</p></div><p><em>Mewgenics</em> includes over 100 disorders — name one, McMillen says, and it’s probably in the game — but each has its own silver lining. The point isn’t to immediately dump cats with certain disorders, but to appreciate them. “I want people to play and read between the lines,” McMillen says. “I want you to have a cat with autism, and instead of throwing it away, realizing its strengths and embracing the challenge and potential that that cat would have.”</p><p><em>Mewgenics</em> is a personal project for McMillen, one that haunted him for years when it was unfinished. “I fell in love with the characters, and I fell in love with the world, and I fell in love with the things that I thought were interesting and fun about the genetic aspect of it,” McMillen says. The game’s road to release has been over a decade in the making; following their success with<em> Super Meat Boy</em>, he originally conceived the project with Refenes. While the original project was about cat breeding and the genetics involved, McMillen says, it wasn’t actually much of a game. “It was like a toy, a little idle game where you would breed your cats, and then you’d use your cats in minigames,” McMillen says.</p><p>After 18 months of development and a public showing at PAX, however, McMillen says that Refenes’ enthusiasm for the project had waned. “It was very apparent that I was the only person that wanted to continue working on the project,” McMillen says. “And I can’t force somebody to just continue to work on something.” The pair decided to put the project on pause to work on another <em>Super Meat Boy</em> project.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Edmund McMillen, Tyler Glaiel</cite></p></div><p>To McMillen’s surprise, he received an email from Steam expressing condolences about the game’s cancellation. After talking with Refenes, McMillen says, it became clear that <em>Mewgenics</em> would never happen while he worked at Team Meat. When McMillen left Team Meat in 2016, he took <em>Mewgenics</em> with him.</p><p>After teaming up with Glaiel, the two spent another six years reworking it into the massive game it exists as today; Glaiel did extensive amounts of research into breeding — and inbreeding — to work out the finer points of the game’s main mechanic. Felines can be any sexuality, and how their relationships progress is sometimes out of the player’s hands. “They can be very passive,” McMillen says. “They can have rivals. They can fall in love. They can be rejected.” Online, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1qzfwae/edmund_mcmillen_here_mewgenics_is_steam_deck/">he’s said</a> the game will take most players over 200 hours to finish.</p><p>Writing <em>Mewgenics</em> has made McMillen regard some of his previous work differently. He points specifically to <em>The Binding of Isaac</em> and its themes on nature versus nurture and “how nurture can really fuck a kid up.” Some struggles in life, however, are inherited.</p><p>“The game definitely became more about children — the experience of raising children,” McMillen says, reflecting on how fatherhood changed his view of the game from its inception to release. “The legacy that you leave, and the genetics that you pass to them and curse them with. I started to write more from that perspective.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NDE2MzM="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Megan Farokhmanesh</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/877906/mewgenics-steam-sales-edmund-mcmillen-interview]]></content:encoded>
